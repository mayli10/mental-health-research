I can't express enough how much I relate to this. Except, somehow, today I ate 300 calories and then stopped- although I was planning on not eating at all today, so small victory or small failure? üôÉ",False,False

I do OMAD and occasional 72 hour fasts and honestly when I'm fasting I don't find it that difficult, like if I see nice food I'll get a small pang but nothing particularly hard to ignore. But once I start eating my meal it's like no amount is satisfying and it's SO hard to stop - I basically just try to eat as late as possible so sleep stops me.... I hate that it feels out of control but I try to remind myself my daily calorie average is still well below normal and I'm hungry cause my body needs it to not die. It's a challenge though.",False,False

I can be strong and hold back, but the second i just think about eating something i just goes so fast that i cant even stop myself. And i just loose all of my mental strengh so i just keep eating, and eating. Cuz like ""if i get fat, then i just as well continue"" and i feel awful afterwords.  Uh fuck i hate craving food",False,False

I can fast and fast, but the second I let food touch my lips that's it, I suddenly feel RAVENOUS and just guzzle everything around me! It's like tripping a switch. I've started to dread finishing fasts because I'm so afraid of losing control, but I know I have to eat at some point.",False,False
