You may not feel hopeless but you know in your heart the negative behaviors your using to keep the feelings at bay are just detaching you from Howe much deeper your sinking into the real hopelessness. I hate saying it but "" you only hit rock bottom when you stop digging""  Climbing out of your ed is hard its painful. After all you didn't just get there overnight.  I know for me. The ed let's me not focus on the real emotional work I need to do. The accrual trauma and mental heath issues I must focus on and work through. They are complex and it sucks.  Counting calories and watching numbers is so much more ""neat"" ""easy"" ""compartmentalized"" but at the end of the day all those other issues still are with me. I wish you the best. I hope you're seeing a therapist and/or psychiatrist plus going to eda meetings. I enjoy mine greatly they keep my recovery on track. You can find meetings near you online meetings and buy or download book online.",False,False

I'm angry that I'll never fulfill my dreams and that I never took the opportunities I could have when I was younger. It would be easier to hardcore relapse because starving is easy and comfortable and interesting. Real life hurts and I have to work hard for little to no reward. Starving, triggering myself, and watching the scale go down is easy dopamine and a feeling of fulfillment, however hollow it may be. It doesn't feel so hopeless",False,True
