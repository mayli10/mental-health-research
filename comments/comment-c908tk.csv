If you have to question it, chances are you probably identify as a bulimic. I just recently witnessed the horrifying effects its having on my bank account ($100 takeout a day) as well as my TEETH (increased sensitivity) and awful fatigue. I would suggest not perceiving it as a “safety net” anymore because it truly will hurt you in the end. Bulimia is no ones friend... it seems you have a boyfriend who cares about you, maybe talk to him about it if that’s possible.",False,False
