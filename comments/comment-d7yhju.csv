I ate better yesterday and today and for the first time in months I ate 1400cal in a day and I ate a big fear food for me  which was half an avocado. I really don‚Äôt want to have a heart attack before I‚Äôm 30 and it‚Äôs so easy to just ignore all the other symptoms until something you can‚Äôt ignore happens. I‚Äôm trying and I appreciate the support. ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è,False,True

The following information I'll provide is a combination of things I've heard recovered people say and do, and obviously I'm not a doctor and not recovered yet so if any of this is not recommended/inaccurate I'll gladly concede to better opinions! You're also welcome to message me if you like!!   The main (physical) hurdle for recovering is going to be your digestive system. The other obvious hurdle will be yourself, because.... eating disorder. Self-love isn't easy!   Two routes here, in my opinion:   The ""No I'm going to RECOVER NOW DAMN IT"" route: Take it easy on your digestive system but eat as many calories as you possibly can per day. Your key to success will be about 6 small meals (or if it makes you feel better, ""large snacks"") a day rather than three larger meals, space them 2-3 hours apart, 300-400 calories each at minimum if you can stand it. Protein powder into bowls of cereal or oatmeal, peanut butter with toast, nuts, trail mix, ramen/soup, whatever you can stomach. Your digestive system will throw an entire fit about it in the beginning but you need to persevere. You will bloat. You will be physically uncomfortable. Sip water and take Gas-X and if you need to take breaks partway through a meal you certainly can! I also highly suggest reaching out to a therapist or a doctor to help with refeeding and not falling back into your disorder when the going gets tough. You also WILL at some point develop what's called ""extreme hunger""; where you're suddenly just hungry all the time because your body is like ""holy shit I can recover now and get healthy again, give me all the calories I can hold pls"" and you want to eat every two hours and you're miserable/triggered about it. I'm currently at this point. This is NOT binge eating disorder, and it will not last forever, and it will not give you binge eating disorder. I promise you that you really do need to eat when you're hungry. I have to keep telling myself that too.   The other route, also known as ""yeah I'd love Option A but actually all that's going to give me panic attack after panic attack"": Start small. What can you eat that doesn't give you panic attacks? See if you can manage sneaking more calories and nutrients into your small meals. Soups!! If you like soups, start sneaking things like pasta and tofu into them and slowly but surely bulking them out. If you like salads, same thing, start bulking them out slowly with fruits/veggies/nuts. Keep snacks that you feel okay eating multiple times a day on-hand, and reassure yourself that it's okay to eat food, it's okay to be hungry and address your hunger!! See if you can reach out to a doctor or therapist, or at least start journaling so you know what you want to say when you get the courage to reach out.",False,False
