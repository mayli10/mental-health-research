Probably doesn't mean anything by it. Unless you're morbidly obese, and its affecting your health, don't worry about your body image too much. Enjoy life. Thick girls are fun.. they can take a pounding. Thin girls are fun.. pick em up and light em up Some guys are into the two seater chicks. Not me personally but I know several guys who are.  Confidence is sexy.  Insecurity can lead you down some dark paths. ",False,False

Kind of a dumb thing to do, but I have had people say similarly dumb things to me where they'll be like 'oh my ex was \*quality they think is negative but I think is positive\*' and all I hear them say is 'ex was \*good thing\*' when they actually meant 'ex was \*bad thing\*' but they didn't state it clearly and my brain thought it was a compliment to them and a negative to me. Her being super skinny doesn't make you fat either, but I also chronically compare myself to other people negatively so I get it :(",False,False
