It actually started during a time when I felt like I had put my entire disordered eating past completely behind me. By that point, I considered myself 100% fully recovered: I actually enjoyed all foods in moderation, it was magical, FML...  The UC wasn't diagnosed until I was severely ill, to the point that I fainted in public and then ended up being cared for by my parents for two months. It cost me a budding relationship and I had to take a leave of absence from my job. My body literally stopped digesting food and I lost weight at an insane pace. The fucked-up thing is that I got used to the feeling of emptiness... and I enjoyed it. I can blame ulcerative colitis for directly catapulting me back into full-blown anorexia / orthorexia, except EVEN WORSE than before.  I actually got to my lowest weight ever while on massive doses of prednisone, because I overly restricted out of fear that the drug would make me gain. Then I started a biologic, and I've been struggling with the fact that I don't have chronic diarrhea anymore. Like, my body is starting to hold onto food and digest it properly, and that feels wrong. If I get a random bout of constipation now, my gastroenterologist is like ""that's great! you're healing!"" but I totally freak out, it does terrible things to my mood.  Sorry for the length, but yeah, it's a messed-up frame of mind. I hope for your sake that you don't get used to it!",False,False

I do think it is major fuel for my ED since it restricts eating habits so much, especially when it comes to restaurants and social gatherings.

OP, I've also dealt with major food restrictions following intestinal damage from antibiotics and then-undiagnosed celiac disease.
