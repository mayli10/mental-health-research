Thank you for the information :) But... what's the calories burned chewing vs calories burned for my stomach to chew for me... ;) I'm half kidding.,False,True

So everytime I eat I usually chill my tea or coffee in the fridge so that i can ""burn"" extra more calories throughout the day aside from my fidgeting and exercise üòÇ",False,False

I just got used to swallowing chunks of food. I kept thinking maybe it would make my digestive system work harder and burn a little extra lol  probably wishful thinking though,False,False
ehigoit,t3_avvsk7,t3_avvsk7,probwatchingcritrole,1,2019-02-28 17:12:15,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/avvsk7/chewing_less_should_technically_increase_your/ehigoit/,I literally just googled this two days ago üòÇ The very knowledgeable and totally qualified people on Quora seemed to think it wouldn't make a difference and would be quite dangerous. But like... if diet induced thermogenesis is a thing then why not this. And would you absorb less of the calories because the food is not sufficiently broken down for your body to finish breaking it down before it goes through your intestines? ,False,False

Chemical digestion happens via enzymes and fluids your body produces to aid in breaking nutrients down; one of the most well-known examples is stomach acid. Mechanical digestion is the actual physical grinding and squeezing that breaks the food down: this includes chewing and the action of muscles in the stomach and small intestine. If you chew less, your stomach will just have to keep and squeeze the food longer; if you chew more, it might take a teensy bit shorter for your stomach to send it on through to your small intestines. BUT chewing burns calories, too. Any time your body uses a muscle, it burns some amount of calories. So whether you're letting your teeth or your stomach do the work, the work is still being sone. So please just chew your food lol",False,False

I have to physically slow myself down when eating around others or else I look like I'm a competitive speed eater. ",False,False
