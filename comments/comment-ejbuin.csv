I'm hanging on to positive thoughts regrading this ☺... On the ed side my labs are turning out good... So That's(still a positive) I gained some weight... Not feeling to good about that part... Also feeling like shit my whole body aches and im incredibly tired and i run out of breath just going up the steps... I've felt like this for a week now... but my labs are fine... and I feel guilty for feeling being ""sick"" because the last time I felt like this I was underweight and despite my labs still being good at that time also.... I feel like it shouldn't be possible for me to feel ill because i'm at a normal weight... I really feel guilty for being sick...  I really make no sense.",False,False
