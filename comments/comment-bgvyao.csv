Even if someone has a slow metabolism for whatever reason, they should not be dismissing someone's hard work on their body and chalking it up to ""good genetics.""  OP very likely didn't ask anyone to justify their body so they shouldn't dismiss her's.",False,False

There are certain medication that massively mess up some specific chemicals in the body (eg antipsychotics) and make you gain weight while eating the same. Also, there are some genetic mutations that will make one even more predisposed to weight gain and poor processing of antipsychotic meds (specifically Olanzapine).",False,False
