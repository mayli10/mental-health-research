Iâ€™m a fully cis female, and I love my chest in certain contexts (sexually and in shirts or the odd dress designed to highlight them). I would never in a million years want top surgery.  But I wish I could take them on and off!! They make me look fat as shit if Iâ€™m not wearing something formfitting. The comfiest bras are still way worse than no bra. And they get in the way of exercise/holding things/being alive sometimes. I also prefer to refer to them as my chest if the context isnâ€™t sexual.
