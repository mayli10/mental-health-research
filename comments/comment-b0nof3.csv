But I personally don’t find it helpful since I like to see it more like some characteristic of myself that I have to learn how to deal with and overcome?,False,False

I get you on the five pounds thing, every time I make a new get its like never more than ten pounds since I'm always borderline underweight anyways, even three pounds makes a difference sometimes. we'll both get there eventually, I'm glad (or sorry I guess) that you relate so much ♥️",False,True

Not as long as you have but I can already relate. Especially to this statement:  &gt;Everytime ive had to talk to a doctor, therapist, or dietician, they try to separate me from the eating disorder, and at this point i feel fully confident that theyre wrong.  I *hate* it when people say ""that's not you; that's your eating disorder""! I find that this is *meaningless* because the notion of ""you"" is not well defined. I don't see a therapist right now but I wonder what would happen if I went like ""Yeah, you're right! It's not *me* to do this. It's also my eating disorder that causes me to see you. Since that's my eating disorder and not me, I'm going to go. Have fun missing out on the money you could be making."" -__-",False,False

Minus the boyfriend part. Ya girl single asf lol. But yeah, it’s my 6ish year anniversary of bouncing between the same 30 pounds (I’m only 5’3” so even 5 pounds is noticeable).
