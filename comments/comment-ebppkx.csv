I’m so sorry. -_- It already (seems) obvious to not shit on someone when they’re fucking eating- and to embarrass them, but also what bad timing on his part. I’m afraid to eat at work anymore, because that’s suddenly when everyone:  a) decides to barge in and ask a million questions and  b) they’re staring at me c) make comments d) something just fucking goes wrong  I will always politely decline food offers from bosses or customers forever now.

I tried to write a few posts about this a while back. I couldnt articulate it well. But like yeah my life gets messy, i lose things, i dont do my chores to a degree where it creates bad anxiety. Ur example for work is perfect.   I literally broke a fast once at work and my manager bitched at me for eating before my break. Its usually a pretty chill environment and if u really need to eat u can. I was sooooo fucking triggered it was like a real life manifestattion of my ed. “Dont eat bitch😡😡😡🤡🤡🤡”  i was extremely upset and sort of lashed out and defended myself. he admitted to handling it very poorly and i think he was stressed cuz his boss was there. But it was the worst thing he could say to me at that time. I hadnt eaten in three days and was eating my first piece of pizza. I ended up giving the rest of it to my mom.    His boss, also my boss saw the whole thing and yeah it was just terrible. Her and i had a very awkward talk about it a few days later. My restriction has gotten even worse since then",False,False

(For me that is fasting or VERY obsessive restricting)   Like I’m sure that’s only in my head because I make the connection of like “I’m out of control and now everything is” but it fuels me like nothing else.   Also I “b”/p twice today and twice last night so I’m right there with you.   Oof,False,False
