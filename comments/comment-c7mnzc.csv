I am 27, about to turn 28 with a very similar backstory.  Got my ED age 16, things seemed under control and I got my degree in 2013 despite severe anorexia but I have pretty much fallen apart since then when I developed bulimia. I've never had a job, a serious relationship and I am still 100% financially dependent on my parents . I've lost touch with all my friends and I am too embarrassed to get in contact again. I already had social anxiety and now it's at x100.  I am so embarrassed about the state of my life and approaching 30 feels like doomsday at this point.  On top of my ED, I have chronic fatigue so I feel completely defeated. I haven't given up getting better and getting my shit together to have some sort of a life but I really don't know how my ED is going to progress. I don't know how to disentangle myself from it. I'm just hoping for a semi-functional relationship with food even if it is a bit obsessive and weird to the average person.   Glad to see some older people on this forum. A lot of the time I feel like I should have outgrown this shit by now. I still have a teenage girl's illness and I should just get my shit together. xx",False,False

It's different for everyone, but I have a fairly normal life now - marriage, kids, friend/family relationships. I don't think I could ever go back to my lowest point, and sure, I have times when I struggle, but I have more days that are balanced and normal, whatever that is.  The unforeseen difficulty has been dealing with serious regret over my wasted potential and what I could have done with my elite education. I don't mourn the high pressure career or the lack of additional degrees (none of which I ever really wanted), but it would have been nice to make more money so I could give my kids a better life - something I never ever thought about before I had them.",False,False

I may have time to write mine up later, but the only thing “wrong” with me when I was younger was probably binge eating. I “got better” when I moved out of the house but things took a serious downward spiral a few years later, when I was definitely an adult.",False,False

I'm the ""person with her shit together"" you're describing. I'm 24, speak multiple languages, have an amazing job where my colleagues appreciate me, tons of money saved up, trips coming up, multiple hobbies I'm pretty good at, etc. The thing is, my disorder only got out of hand in the last year and a half. I was extremely hard-working since the age of 17 and I ""saved up"" achievements. Since my ED spiraled out of control, I've been simply surfing on all the work I did before. This past year and half has been empty. My main drive for recovery is that I don't want to become the girl who peaked in her early twenties.  TLDR; it's impossible to have ""your shit together"" when you have a severe ED, but circumstances can help you coast through it for a while.",False,False

I've been thinking about it alot recently. I'm 26, about to be 27 and have had eating issues from the age of 12. Started as bulimia/purging after meals, morphed into anorexia for 6 years, then I fucked off with recovery and did a complete 180 into binge eating disorder. I'm trying to kick it now but it is truly a bitch.   &amp;#x200B;  I wish I would've known more about how eating disorders can ""morph""/pendulum swing into something else. I legitimately gained 100 pounds from my hospitalized weight and was (may still be, I'm scared to weigh myself) obese. Coming from someone who was fearful of going above a 20 BMI, I am in disbelief of my size years later. Eating my calorie goal today is a struggle because now I just want to stuff my face with 6 times that amount, when years ago I had no problems with meeting it (and being under).   &amp;#x200B;  I feel similar to you in that I'm successful in some areas and completely lacking in others. I have difficulty holding down friendships, me having a relationship is pretty much out of the question, and my body image is so fucked I find it difficult to leave my room a lot of the time.   &amp;#x200B;  I'm tired and am probably not making a lot of sense, I'll revisit this tomorrow for sure. I wanted to reply and say you definitely aren't alone.",False,False

Sometimes I feel it can be especially hard for those of us who dont fit the ""teenager with family issues"" mold.  I hope you find the insights you are looking for.",False,False
