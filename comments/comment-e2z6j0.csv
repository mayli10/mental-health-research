The key issue is people who see it worked for them, and then recommending it to everyone and anyone as the cure all. It happens often with current fads such as Keto too.",False,False

There was a young teenager on r/loseit recently asking for advice on weight loss, and someone recommended intermittent fasting  and mentioned how they started with a 7 day water fast, although they realise this may be too much too soon for the OP.  Intermittent fasting should never be recommended to a teenager looking for help with weight loss and their health imo. It’s not sustainable, can be very dangerous, and does not teach healthy habits.  Now I know I’m a fucking hypocrite if you look at my post history lmao, but I’m not recommending my disordered behaviour to others, especially teenagers looking for advice. I think it’s that the fasting people get away with/get praised for recommending it whereas if we recommended the same, we’d be completely slaughtered in the comments (and rightfully so).  Anyway yeah, I feel you lmao",False,False
