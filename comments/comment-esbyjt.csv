I basically ate 100 to 200 calories a day for 1 month. I took sips from an Ensure chocolate drink to keep my vitamins and nutrients in check. One bottle lasted a week. 2. After one month, I moved on to 500-600 calories for 2 months. The best snacks that helped me maintain the calorie goal were pineapple and apples. By this time I was down 30 lbs. 3. By this time, I noticed I wasn't losing any weight by reducing my calories. I decided to move on to intermittent fasting. It worked for a while but I stopped losing weight again. Here, I decided to eat once a day, usually dinner, and throw up right after. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS. My mental health was getting worse by the day. I hated my body so much. I lost 10lbs but it was the darkest point of my life. 4. Once I decided to stop purging my food, I went back to intermittent fasting. Surprisingly, I started gaining weight. One day I decided to say ""Fuck it"" to my diet and went to McDonalds. I ate around 1000-1200 calories. The next day I lost 3lbs. I guess I restarted my metabolism. 5. My metabolism is the fastest its ever been. I usually eat around 1000-1200 calories every day and easily lose weight. I'm very cautious about what I eat and make sure I appreciate every single meal. My meals are usually like this:  * Breakfast: One fried egg with a piece of toast. No spread. One black coffee with no sugar or sweetener. * Snacks: Apple or air-popped popcorn * Lunch: I almost never eat lunch because I wake up pretty late and never have time. If I do eat lunch I have a side salad from Wendys. * Dinner: Boiled pumpkin with tuna or chicken breast. Sometimes I have white rice because for me it's comfort food. Dessert is where I go crazy. It's usually a huge piece of cake, chocolate or candy. * Snack: Grapes or pineapple.  Good luck and be safe &lt;3",False,False

I am diagnosed with EDNOS because my eating disorder presents as anorexia but I am still overweight so I don’t meet the diagnostic criteria for AN. I was in residential for a month and I went from eating MAX 800 calories a day to between 1200-1600 (not sure because we were on an exchange system) and very limited activity. I knew my weight before I went in and weighed myself about a week after I left and I’d only gained about 2 pounds! Looking at that over a span of 6 weeks with the lack of exercise (before I was compulsively exercising multiple times a day), plus the calorie surplus - you should totally be fine at your height maintaining at 1200! I know it feels really daunting, I find it’s easiest to pound a protein shake or two to get some extra nutrients in. Stuff like that always feel like it makes less of an impact",False,False

And I've mostly maintained for about 6 months. *Mostly.* Some DEXA scans have shown some fat loss and muscle gain, but I haven't done another scan since I've been consistently maintaining. I kind of want another DEXA scan to see if I'm truly maintaining or still doing fat/muscle shuffle but at the same time I'm kind of terrified that I'll find out I'm actually gaining fat...

If you constantly have a number to focus on it's so easy to decide that any increase is fat and that recovery was a dumb idea so back to starving it is, but thing is that our weights naturally goes up and down due to bloating, hormones and water retention. Seeing 5+ lbs on the scale might feel like a reason to panic and conclude that you gained weight but in fact those added lbs might be gone in a few days despite you not changing anything about your eating.      I weigh myself about 2-3 times a year (don't have a scale in the house as I know that will trigger a relapse) and my weight always stick around the same 5 lbs. To keep an eye on my weight I just check my waist measurement which I know waver due to bloating, and if it has increased I wait two more weeks and then check it again before doing anything about it since chances are it has gone back to normal by then.      I sometimes panic and suspect that a week of eating 2000+ calories every day has made me gain but my mom always tells me ""You been the same weight for years, nothing has happened"" but I'm convinced that THIS time will be different and I will have gained a massive amount of weight...but it never happens. Maybe I gained a little of two weeks of bad eating, but my weight will return to normal once my eating does. My body is happy around it's current weight so it will return to it and I don't need to micro manage my intake for it to happen.",False,False

A chubby child/pre-teen 2. Doing this for so long that it probably ruined my metabolism forever (started in my early teens and didn't start to recover until I was in my twenties) 3. Short, so all internet calculators had basically told me that I needed to starve forever.   I'm turning 27 now so well past that rumoured ""teenage"" metabolism but my weight is just chilling here and I have needed to adjust my eating to make sure I'm not accidentally losing weight.  I found that the extreme gaining and losing is **a lot** more intense when you are restricting as my weight might go up a little (like over Christmas and New Year's  when I was a binging mess) but it has already returned to the baseline.     Look into the set point/set weight theory, basically it's a theory that says that our bodies all have a ""set point"" where they are comfortable and that they will try to stay there unless we are overeating or under eating excessively.   So it's less about micro managing your calories (like our ED tells us we need to do) but rather just eating reasonably and letting your body figure things out. I had a really hard time believing it, but I have found that the less I obsess about my weight the easier it is to maintain. If I return to my normal eating my body will return to its normal weight  :)",False,False

I did a lot of exercise (5-8 hours a day) due to exercise bulimia so I was pretty active, but my weight hit a lowest point and didn't get any lower, instead keeping it there was a constant struggle and my body was like  ""fuck this shit"" and I decided upon recovery because feeling like you might die was scary.  At first I gained weight pretty quickly as I ate basically everything due to extreme hunger, but then I switched over to a more ""reasonable"" eating with occasional binges and my weight settled around 20-21 and stuck around there for years. Then I got better and my binges became more of a rarity (not  a 2 times a week thing but more 2 times a month) and I accidentally lost some weight (BMI around 19) and now I'm maintaining it by eating 1700-2000 calories a day and doing like 30-60 minutes of walking. Sometimes I eat more and I still binge sometimes, but my weight doesn't seem particularly bothered as it returns to the same range.      What I'm saying with this rambling is that once you increase your calories your body will adjust and maintaining on a higher number will become possible.
