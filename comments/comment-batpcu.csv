By the diagnostic criteria for anorexia per the DSM 5, it is not very ‚Äúseverely‚Äù underweight but *is* actually enough for a formal diagnosis of anorexia (albeit perhaps a ‚Äúmild‚Äù one).  And of course she shouldn‚Äôt have said that no matter because it‚Äôs just...*beyond* insanely insensitive and absurd... .... But yeah! Just so ya know. :)",False,False

I was surprised to find this because people can definitely have Anorexic behavior without being underweight, because that is how people get underweight in the first place!
