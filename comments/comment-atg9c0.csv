Because I have this one leather pencil skirt that I got from either DKNY or H&amp;M but it always acts as if it isn't going to zip if I try to zip it at my hips. But is totally fine when I bring it up to my waist and *then* zip. Maybe that could be part of the problem?  Either way, I totally get where you're coming from this one. Whenever something doesn't fit, despite the fact that it fit once or twice initially, is always such a self defeated and self esteem deflating feeling. And it's probably not much conciliation to say but, hey, at least it's probably just water weight. ",False,False

Went to zip it, it zipped but then BANG that zipper DIED  It’s actually the worst. I canceled my plans to sit on my floor and have a fat crisis.
