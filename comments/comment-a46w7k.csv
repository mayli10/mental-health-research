You are a living person with a body, which means you deserve to be healthy. I can relate to the feelings of doubt. But from the outside looking in, I can say with confidence: you deserve to recover no matter what. And recovery is there whenever you're able and willing to ask for it.",False,False

I feel like I’m not as bad off as others and I’m not deserving of the labels of my illnesses (whatever that means).  Please don’t let it get that far. It’s horrible in hospitals, but not getting there doesn’t mean you don’t have real problems that need addressing. Please don’t deny yourself help because it could be worse. At that point, where does it end? It could always be worse.  I wish you the best of luck. Everyone deserves to recover, no matter where they are.",False,False

You deserve recovery no matter what point you are at in your disorder!!! For the longest time I didn’t think I had a problem despite the fact I was having breakdowns over gaining weight or eating certain foods. I didn’t feel skinny enough. I was underweight and at the time all my vitals were fine. If there’s anything I’ve learned during my stint in treatment was that this disorder will never be satisfied.  This disorder wants us to be sick and stay sick. That’s how it continues to thrive and it is hellllllll.   I think if you are thinking about recovery, however, you are already self aware of how damaging this disorder is and some part of you wants it!! Go after it!! It’s hard and it’s sucks and it may never get easier. But behaviors will get more manageable.   Good luck!!! You got this. 💜💜💜",False,False
