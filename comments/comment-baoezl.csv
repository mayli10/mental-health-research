She was a regular at the store I work at and it brightened my day whenever she came in.  One day before my shift I had been fasting and I broke it on a ton of bread with butter. I went to work, and I just felt so gross and disgusting.   And then she came in, and after paying she stayed to chat for a bit and then she asked for my number. I don’t think I’ll ever forget that; I felt so disgusting but somehow she still wanted to get to know me. It didn’t work out, but it was the best relationship I’ve ever had.  You should go for it; you never know what you might have with her.",False,False
