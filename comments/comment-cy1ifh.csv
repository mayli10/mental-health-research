First of all, thank you so much for leaving a comment!   I did beg them to get help (but not force!!) and encourage any attempt at recovery. I didn't talk about my own ED that often, but it might've still been too much for them? I'm unsure, but I think not talking about it anymore is a good decision for sure.  Here's the tea:  I made the post a bit over a week before I had to return to school (they had to start a few weeks earlier than us). They didn't really take note of me the first few times they visited us, but eventually greeted me when we passed eachother one day. No texts still, no direct interaction.  During the week, between me writing this post and starting school again, they went to Starbucks and ate ice cream (they've implied being a regular at that ice cream place). I texted our mutual friend and she said C was trying to recover. Took her word for it and was proud.   // What I think MIGHT be happening is that C has realized they're trans (still using they because I'm unsure) which would explain their ED, aswell as a few posts on their tumblr. They also go by he/him on tumblr, wear a trans bracelet, recently got their hair cut really short and our friend has implied them not being &lt;name&gt; anymore before changing the topic almost immediately. I think I'm gonna get a ""It's a boy!"" card, just in case. //  They still talk more with anyone else, but at least they seem friendly towards me again. It hurts to lose a close friend, but at least they won't know I'm relapsing  h a r d. Overall I'm glad they're finally trying to find their happiness, even if it doesn't include me.",False,True

You can just let them go, even if you have mutual friends. But, if you value this friendship it probably wouldn't hurt to send them a message that explains that you really valued your time as friends and you are hurt by their sudden disinterest in you.  You could ask if there is a reason why they have cut you off and ask if it's possible to try to talk it out.  But also say that it's okay if they don't want to and just wish them luck and say you care about them and you will be available to talk in the future if they need help. Send them one message like that and then don't send any more. If they don't want to rekindle then just grieve the relationship and try to move on.    Is there any reason why you think they are doing this? Do they maybe feel like you are enabling their ED by engaging in the same behaviors? Are they upset because you haven't told them they need to get help? Those things are not any fault of yours (you are dealing with your own issues) but maybe that's why.",False,False
