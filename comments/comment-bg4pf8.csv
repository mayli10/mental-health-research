If we would just eat a normal amount throughout the day it wouldn't happen but we don't. I even keep a journal to keep track of the cycle in hopes of stopping it but despite reading / seeing how this keeps happening nothing stops me from eating.   Basically stopping all of the ED behaviors is the only way out so until we make the decision to stop, the cycle will continue.  Intuitive eating is the key to getting out of the cycle but it takes letting go of the food rules and excepting weight gain. Once your body and mind understand that they won't be starved / deprived of what they want any more the binges will stop.",False,False
