Thank you so much for saying this, it made me feel a lot better and was super kind of you. Yesterday was okay, but I haven’t been eating very well today. It’s just something I’m gonna have to work on and try to get help for. I hope so much for good things to head your way. :)",False,False

I first tried recovering 3 years ago and relapsed **hard**. At first I thought maybe I just can't do it but I started seeing small changes in the way I think.   Some days are really good and I can truly feel my mind working and reacting normally. It gives me hope that it's not only possible but probable. I am just waiting for the good days to start outnumbering the bad ❤   Just keep fighting for yourself and your health,False,True

When I was somewhat overweight a few years ago, and decided to lose weight in a healthy way, as long as a meal was under like 700-ish calories I was good. I lost the weight slowly but efficiently. I even snacked. I would eat 2000 calories a day sometimes, but as long as I was active, I didn’t feel bad about it. It worked fine, and I felt good about what I was doing at first.  Then my disorder slowly started to develop, and 700 become anything over 500. And then 400. Now, if I eat a meal and it’s over 300 calories, I legit feel like shit. I’m trying so hard to up my intake, not for myself, but because I have people who care about me and count on me, but it’s so hard. Everyday I wake up, wanting to at least partially recover, and I say “I’m going to eat 1200 today”. But by the time the day is over, I’ve burned 2000 and eaten 600, and I already feel like that makes me gross. Like that it’s not enough restriction. It’s just never enough.",False,False
