As someone who struggles myself, I feel it's important to educate myself on the risks and what to watch out for.   So far I've learned that one of the big risks is [electrolyte imbalance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolyte_imbalance). This imbalance is caused by purging sodium, fluids, and potassium all out of whack which can potentially lead to [arrythmia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_arrhythmia). Arrythmia, of course, can lead to serious heart issues such as cardiac arrest.   In some cases, bulimics who purge via vomiting risk  [bursting their oesophagus open](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/eating-disorders/bulimia-nervosa/qa/how-can-bulimia-damage-your-esophagus) or choking on their own vomit.   Bulimics who purge via laxative abuse could potentially die of dehydration. All the fluid lost while shitting yourself inside out dries the body and puts all your organs under considerable stress and *possibly* kill in rare cases.  I hope this is helpful!",False,False
