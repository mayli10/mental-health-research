I love bread too, but the other side of that is that bc I don't make my own, if I buy bread then I might only get one slice budgeted out of it and then the loaf goes stale... fortunately my partner usually eats it in time, but if neither of us feel like bread I feel bad watching it go stale. I need to set aside a Bread Day or something 👀",False,True

I love bread, I’m a total bread snob, I’ll talk about and compare different types of bread all day 😍 I just always seem to play myself: I “save” the bread for the end of the binge hit of course by then I’m too full and sick and I feel gross and tired and I don’t want to “waste” delicious magical bread on such a shitty situation. It’s all my own fault, I’ll get back around to not self-sabotaging my bread goals eventually 😂 I make a new kind of toast every morning for my SO; French toast, avo toast, grilled cheese, homemade jam, nut butters, etc, I’m mad jelly of him 😂  I have a client that orders for a social event they have every Tuesday afternoon: one mad indulgent thing and one “healthy” thing every week, at my discretion. So i spend Monday baking brownies, morning buns, layer cakes, cupcakes, etc, and then switching over to the sugar-free paleo keto gluten-free raw vegan energy balls or whatever is definitely like whiplash lol.",False,False

Like I love sandwiches and I think about having one as an easy meal every now and then but then I think about adding almost 200calories onto a meal JUST for the ""wrapper"" and I'm like... no thanks I'd rather have twice as much of the sandwich filling and eat it as a salad lol. It sucks that you don't get to eat the bread you make though!! Maybe something like french toast? Make the bread itself the main ingredient?  I bake a lot for my family/friends too. Sometimes I bake things for myself that are like... no added sugar, as little oil as possible, etc. (and they're actually still good) but do you ever look at the recipes compared to the ""normal"" recipes you make for other people and just get like... whiplash?? Going from making no-added-sugar banana bread to a cake that has two and a half cups of sugar in JUST the icing is such a mindfuck, lol.",False,True

Omg I can’t remember the last time I ate bread or pasta 😩 I always plan for bread but I never follow through. I’ve been baking lots of bread recently as well and I’ve never tasted any of it.",False,False

I love baking so much but I barely let myself eat what I make. If I planned a binge like this I think it would be all bread and real pasta because I haven't eaten either of those in a long time 😅,False,True

It's helping me a lot to know that it's there (a 30 min drive away) and I plan to eat it all on June 12th. I have a weird obsession with buying bargain foods (which is SO fun to deal with) and this helps me to fulfil that need while not binging on it because I know it's coming when I've earned it. You're not alone! It's not weird........,False,False
