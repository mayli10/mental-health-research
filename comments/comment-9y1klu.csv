It fucking snowed like half a foot the other day and it‚Äôs almost two months early. My boyfriend still has the AC unit in his window and with that draft we might as well keep the windows open.

A brisk 75 degrees and the little skin prickles that accompany it is nice but lately it's been getting into the 30s and 40s at night (making it like 60 inside) and I just can't handle it.

If I‚Äôm hot I freak out and take it as a sign that I‚Äôm fat. I can‚Äôt really explain it, but when I‚Äôm cold I feel sort of comforted by it.
