I live alone in an apartment style dorm and it's crazy how much food I throw away...I feel guilty as heck. Because I have a kitchen I basically went to the dining hall maybe 20 times this semester and have 50+ meal swipes that I've completely wasted....   I hate the dining hall too but next semester I'm going to try to force myself to go if only to eat a small salad or have tea just so I can feel less wasteful. I got in trouble once for bringing food out in my own to go container which sucks.    I've found the trick to having food in my room is to keep a very limited supply and I buy things as I need them instead of stockpiling... But I know that's not an option for everyone.,False,False

At my school there is one dining hall that stays open until 1 am, and I liked going to it bc there were less people there, and I knew that all the food was going to be thrown out in the next hour anyway. We werenâ€™t allowed to take food out of the hall, but I found that the workers kinda stopped caring when they were getting ready to close. I would stock up on bananas and yogurt.",False,False
