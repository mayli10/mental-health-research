If you don't take any medications for anxiety, perhaps talk to a doctor and tell them your stress and anxiety is making you uncomfortable and constipated, and you were looking to try a low dose anxiety med to see if that helps enough, so your anxiety is abated a bit and more regular? I would hate to recommend laxatives to anyone, let alone someone with an ED. Plus I'm not a doctor so this is just a tentative suggestion.  Also, stressing out will only make it worse. Try to find a (non restriction based) stress relief and try to find 30 minutes, say at the end of the day, to do your relaxing thing. Maybe while you're doing, rant out loud to yourself about all the things that stress you out, like you would to a friend, and see if any solutions come to your mind. It probably wont get you relaxed enough that you poo, but implementing something like that every night may help you",False,False

Honestly I think it's a combination of all of them, actually with the restricting as being the least of the causes! I've never been 'regular' largely because intense anxiety has screwed up my gut. It took being in a relationship with someone who goes like clockwork and me just going ???? because how does he do that? Plus I always get constipated on my period so that's fun.  I ate a couple of FibreOne bars yesterday and had some caffeine pills which usually really help but so far nothing. I'm reluctant to do much more because I'm busy for the next few days and last time I tried any kind of laxative it ended...badly.   And here I am posting to the internet to complete strangers about my bowel movements.",False,True

I've heard it is gentle and just softens stool to help you be more regular. Also, obviously, try to up calories, even by a bit, and maybe some blueberries??? For that good fiber but still a healthy fruit. Good luck!!! Praying for your bowels bb!!",False,False
