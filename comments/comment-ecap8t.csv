He bought me a bikini that was knowingly**way** too small and then asked me to try it on and take pictures of myself. Those pictures on my phone **make me want to die**. He knows that I’ve been having a really hard time lately, so why would he do that to me? Why would he buy me a bikini **in December** in the first place? What message was he trying to send to me? Did he even think about that? If so, why would he put something so superficial like the size of my body above my own physical and emotional health? He knew that this wouldn’t make me feel good, so how could he do that to me? **WHY** would he do that to me? And who the fuck needs a bikini in December‽‽‽   I love my boyfriend, but he intentionally did something hurtful for his own gain without any regard for my feelings or my health.
