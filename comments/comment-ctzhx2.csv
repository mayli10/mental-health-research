There's something about that starvation look/the look that you get when you've lost weight in an unhealthy manner. I think it's both the physical effects but also the... mental effects, if that makes sense? I feel like what I'm feeling on the inside (the emptiness, the meticulous calorie counting, obsession over every single calorie and every single bread crumb) sort of comes up and shows on the outside as well. When I gain weight, I no longer look sick because my body is actually getting nutrients, and most of the time, when I gain weight it's usually because I've been treating myself and having a good time lately, so it also shows on my face because I look more relaxed and happy I guess (even though the weight gain also stresses me out). So I think that this is why people say that you look better when you gain weight sometimes. But I totally feel you with the thing that your mom telling you that you look better now is triggering, I feel the exact same way whenever my mom says that.   It probably doesn't help much if I say this but: other people rarely care about the few kilograms/pounds that you've gained/lost. I know that I rarely give two fucks if my friends gain weight/lose weight. For me, my friends are beautiful and look good no matter how much they weigh. So if any of my friends would gain weigh I'd 1. Not notice it or care in the first place because I'm too busy thinking about myself and 2. If asked for my opinion, I'd tell them they look good because there's no way that gaining a few kilos could make someone ugly, especially if it's my friend/family member in the first place, honestly. When it comes to myself, obviously, if I gain even 1 kilo I've suddenly turned into an ogre and the ugliest person on earth, but that's just me. I'm sure you look just as good now as you looked before you gained weight. Also, remember that for your friends and family, who probably know you very well as a person, the ""outside"" starts to matter much less than the ""inside"". If they love you as a person, they will in most cases also love you on the outside and think that you're good looking/cute. I know that it's tough to gain weight and feel bloated and uncomfortable : ( Hope you feel better soon!",False,False
