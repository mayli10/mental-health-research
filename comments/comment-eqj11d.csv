Even though I'm chubby I love hugs, they make me feel safe and secure and loved. I pull away from hugs because I feel like I don't deserve them. I have a scooby doo pillow pet and when I put a tshirt on it and hug it, it almost feels like a real person. Stuffed animals also won't judge your body.  I don't know how much this helps, but when non-ED people hug each other, they usually don't care about the other person's body. It's more the feeling of warmth and security. Our EDs like to convince us otherwise.",False,False

My whole family has never been affectionate, never hugged my sisters or my parents unless I was a really little kid. My boyfriends family is the complete opposite. They'll hug for greetings and congratulations and it's so awkward ugh",False,False

I hated all hugs that I did not initiate and I only wanted to hug one person: my dad (sometimes). My father used to force me to allow my sister to hug me, and let me tell you... I hated it! I was, and still am to an extent, afraid of my body and other people touching my physical form only made me more aware of all of the inches and blobs. My fear of being touched by anything or anyone became entirely too heightened where I was afraid of people simply brushing my arm. Through allowing myself to be more emotionally vulnerable with others, the fear of being touched has subsided.    Being hugged can make you feel safer and more cared for, so, if you can, I would recommend attempting to work on this aversion. If you donâ€™t work on it it may become worse and begin to greatly hinder your life.",False,False
