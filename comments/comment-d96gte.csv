And I just wanna cry. Please find someone who will love you and is obsessed with suffocating cause he just can help but have you sit on his face.   You have friends? You have a sibling? Are you close to your mother. Imagine someone saying all that shit to them. Imaging someone making them how you feel EVERY SINGLE day. FUCK HIM.     nah.     Fuck him. But literally DONT. Leave him. You know why? You deserve better than that. Even people I do not associate with if I find out their partner ever did the sort of shit he is doing to you I would take a catheter and force a cup of capsaicin, glass and lemon juice up their mangy cock.    I fucking hate this because I can relate so much. He would say to me why cant you just wear makeup or do x or y or just not be me. Call me names. Then give me a taste of happiness. Just enough. Then it is gone and although I truly wasnt happy. I wanted to say I love him but here is the thing... you know when you haven't eaten for a while then you eat something reall and it is just full of overwhelming flavor? The memory sticks and clings. Love is like that. And I think you are getting so little.    I really dont want this for you. You are getting artic zero. Soon you will get that good humor strawberry shortcake CAKE though. And you will eat half but... not right away... later cause even though you COULD eat it all of it at this moment your WONDERFUL LOVING partner is coming home with a movie he knows you love. And it's fun not to eat alone.    You take care of you.",False,False

Sometimes the things we become addicted to aren‚Äôt pleasant, like how restriction, poor health, and exhaustion can be addictions for so many of us. No one can convince you that you deserve to be happy and healthy when you‚Äôre addicted to the sting, any more than any of us can be convinced. You are a whole person: interesting, intelligent, and unique, with needs and desires that are allowed and real. I know that it can be an aspirational thing to be a portrait of a person, and we can feel undeserving and afraid of wholeness, but the things you want at this moment might very well be two dimensional imitations of the things that you really need. Wavering, conditional affirmation isn‚Äôt the same as love, any more than pretty is the same as beautiful. Regardless of where you are in your journey with your body, I hope you take the first steps of healing and finding the things you really need.
