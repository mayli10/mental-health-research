I'm semi-pleased with the number in the scale (as long as it keeps going down I'm in a mini plateau right now) but if I eat dinner it'll go the other way and ugh I agonize over knowing that this weight is not real. I can't base my weight on a number that's temporary.,False,False

It’s from sodium/carbs and food just chilling in your digestive tract which makes me feel gross,False,False
