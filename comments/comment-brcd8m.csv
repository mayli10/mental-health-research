Depending on the nature of your colleague's work, they probably just care about you and want you to be okay. I would have rather had colleagues that cared about my health. In the past, my employer wouldn't let me take off work for eating disorder treatment. I had to wait until we had 50 employees so that I could qualify for FMLA and not get fired upon return.",False,False

They won't want to just look away. I know you're seeing a therapist, but in my experience its better to start at a higher level of care. I am very familiar with how undetectable or secretive an eating disorder can be in outpatient therapy.",False,False

It seems unethical to let a coworker actively engage in an eating disorder if you're in the field.,False,False

If I were you, I’d go to HR before this happened and make them aware of what your co-worker said and of your concern about being ambushed.   Your health is not any of their business. Would anyone ever fucking DREAM of ambushing a morbidly obese co-worker who eats donuts for lunch every day with an intervention?!? Fuck no.",False,False

But I also hate when my eating disorder makes me lie, and this backs me into a bit of a corner, doesn’t it?  It’s just a bummer and I’m going to have to wait it out I think. I don’t want to get them in trouble for deciding to put professionalism aside to risk helping someone they love, which in their minds, is what they think they’re doing.",False,True

Your coworkers setting up an intervention sounds inappropriate at best. They aren’t your doctors, and your health is NOT their business AT ALL.   If your health is starting to negatively impact your job performance, then your supervisor can talk to you PRIVATELY about it.",False,False
