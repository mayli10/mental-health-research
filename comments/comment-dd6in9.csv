What's been working for me lately is to buy in smaller amounts. You'll spend more money in the long run this way, but the less I have on hand the less likely I am to go out and buy more to smoke. This helps me space it out, like if I had bought 4 grams the last time and smoked it all in a couple weeks, I can take a break for a while. Also, make it harder for yourself to find the time and place to smoke. Keep yourself busy, with fun things or productive things, so that it can be a once a day treat.  I'm no master on limiting my use, so take my advice with a grain of salt. This is just what's been working for the past few days. The thing is, I don't have my own place. The lady I'm living with is someone I respect, and she knows I smoke but doesn't want me to smoke inside. She says as long as I smoke in the backyard or something, she has no problem with it. So, when it's dark or cold, its harder for me to smoke. This means I have a limited window during the day for it, and if I miss that window, I don't smoke that day. Maybe a way to do this for yourself, is to arrange your daily life in a way that gives you that little smoking window. Something to think about, hope I helped!",False,False

The story of a journey.   A long while back I went on a ‚Äúmission‚Äù to stock up on a 151-192proof grain alcohol of quality. Wanted it so badly because I was giving far too much money to EvanWilliams, JackDaniels, and CaptainMorganü•É ‚ÄúBuTiDIdnThAVeApROblEmOrNEthANg!‚Äù   I figured; ‚Äú*Hey, it comes in the same 750mL bottles that are around the same price. A 190/192 proof is 95-96% ABV that means to get [gram amount] of pure ethanol alcohol into this tolerant body I only need to drink like half the amount of fluid I‚Äôd need to drink for a 100 proof distilled spirit‚Äî so a bottle will last twice as long and I can get down my drinks in a smaller time window theoretically. And as a bonus the purealcohol-to-calorie efficiency is also better. SO THIS IS PERFECT FOR ME! I‚Äôll totes get shitfaced for cheap __if I take [medicine-name] and chug some jiggers mixed in a can of of Diet Coke on a totally empty stomach__ IT‚ÄôLL SOLVE ALL MY PROBLEMS!*‚Äù  Long story short: Despite Everclear/Spirytus not being illegal to transport/buy/trade/sell/own in every area of my stare (*in spite of what the web claims*) I couldn‚Äôt find a single place in my area or immediate surrounding areas that wanted to stock it or send it to me. Something to do with either the insurance or some tax they have to pay to stock it not being worth it because it was so niche and almost no one around who wasn‚Äôt a derelict alcoholic wanted it for more than novelty reasons. I didn‚Äôt really give up immediately because the allure of getting equally inebriated for half the price/effort was strong. I still failed and that failure probably saved me from alcohol poisoning tbh.   In conclusion: I decided to just start working 4 extra hours each week to pay for my alcohol painlessly and started skipping lunch again to save calories. Oof",False,False
