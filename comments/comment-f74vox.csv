Half is 8oz. Almond milk is 60cal/1 cup. 1cup is approximately 8oz. So if half of your cup was almond milk it would be 60 cal. The recipe calls for 1/3 of the cup almond milk while the other 2/3 is tea bags, sf vanilla, and water. However lots of baristas put half the cup as the milk so to be safe I‚Äôd log as 60cal, but it‚Äôs probably closer to 30-40 if we‚Äôre being honest :)",False,True
