She mentions that jump rope, running and ballet beautiful werenâ€™t effective for her  1. Walk with your heel hitting the group first and then your feet  2. She shows some exercises that she does in the morning (squats?). Tbh Iâ€™m not a gym coach or anything but i donâ€™t do the squats the way she does just because the posture doesnâ€™t look right to me. She does the squats while brushing her teeth. Afterwards she does downward dog for 30s. At night time she does these bicycle leg things 200 times.  (You can see it in the video at around the six minute mark) after she shows a series of stretches that she does for 30s each. At the nine minute mark she shows the massages. Iâ€™m not going to translate since thereâ€™s visuals but message me if you need clarification. She does the massage for 1hr.   All the best guys!",False,False
