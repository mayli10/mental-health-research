And somehow I got to squash down that feeling   Whatever it is it kinda sucks balls, if they just came out with a tablet I could eat once a day Already that would be fab   Lol @ different kinds of calories, oh Mum!   My mums sister is fat too! And I swear the things Mum says about her behind her back are so mean, my Aunt is absolutely amazing and fab, but mums just like one upping it on her with her clothes she brought in the kids section and a quarter of a sandwich lol   Ehhh what are ya gonna do?",False,False

I kinda have that too, my aunt and anorexia, my other aunt is on her way to be obese but she doesn’t see it and refuses to eat better or exercise, my mum is a misinformed orthorexic (so she is orthorexic but she believes things that are totally wrong like ""coconut water will make you fat"" and ""there are different kind of calories"")  No wonders I ended up with bulimia/ednos lol  But I think there’s a genetic thingy wimdy thing with eating disorders so it actually makes sense ?",False,True
