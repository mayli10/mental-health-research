Yeah it helped when I first started. But that didn't last. Then every time I tried to quit, I would end up gaining more than I lost in the first place. It took years to finally quit for good. It's a terrible cycle.",False,False

I smoked for about 1.5 years and it did jack shit to curb my appetite. Some people said vaping helped them but for me it made me hungrier to taste a sweet flavor in my mouth.  Anyways, smoking really isnt worth it, you'll smell nasty all the time and it only curbs appetite (for some) for a short time before the hunger comes back stronger, from what I've been told",False,False

I feel like when I was smoking I would binge more. If I couldn‚Äôt smoke 3 cigarettes in a row, i‚Äôd binge. Honestly I think it just causes more things to obsess over. It‚Äôs been like 2 weeks since I‚Äôve smoked, and no binges. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I don‚Äôt eat and don‚Äôt smoke now so i‚Äôm saving HELLA coin.",False,False
