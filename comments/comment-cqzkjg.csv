I did have some heart palpitations recently and went to the doctor to get it checked out because I thought it was from this shit. It ended up just being anxiety. But I didn’t ask anything specific about this. It seems like a fairly good effort (at least for me) so it doesn’t seem that high. I push mine to 160-180 for a pretty good length of time exercising.,False,False

I always have a high heart rate so I’m not too worried either, but I just was wondering basically if it is something to worry about I guess.",False,True

My resting heart rate normally sits around 46. When I purge my heart rate normally climbs into the 130’s-140’s.   I don’t know anything about heart rate variability. Mine has ranged anywhere between 12-64. 🤷🏻‍♀️,False,False
