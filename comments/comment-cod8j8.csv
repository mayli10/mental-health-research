Iâ€™ve done it twice (anemia). Neither time got much of a reaction other than an old lady trying to get me to eat hard candy. So it was more just humiliating. Both times I cracked my head and just had people staring.",False,False

I passed out on a bench once and woke up bleeding on the ground - sat up, dazed and confused and saw that the man I'd been sitting next to on the bench when I fainted was still sitting exactly where he was. As someone who'd also previously had fantasies of a dramatic House M.D.-style public fainting spell and being fawned over, I realised that in reality it was just humiliating.  My point is that nothing is going to make people care when they don't give a shit, because they're selfish by nature. You already deserve to eat and thrive and seek the help that you need for YOURSELF. We are here for you and if you can reach out to someone in your life for help, things will get better. Slowly and wonkily, but better.",False,False

Asking for help is really hard for people like us. The chances of others not taking you seriously or reacting badly are high. At least if your body betrays you, nobody can claim you're that making it up, or that you're just being dramatic, or that you're selfishly using up time and resources, etc. It makes sense.    You're right, there are better ways to ask. I want to encourage you to try and use them. But don't beat yourself up if you can't. In the end, you deserve compassion and affection.",False,False

Itâ€™s the beginning of your way out of this hell; you actually want to get better. Iâ€™m so happy for you in that regard. I just hope, hope, hope you are able to alert someone to the fact that you need that help or seek it out yourself. Then you can start dealing with the things that got you in to this mess in the first place.",False,False

I mean I'm glad I don't ever faint or else fasting as much as I do would be horrendous but I got close once and it was super scary. it's hard to know what we're doing to our bodies w/o dramatic things like this happening like we see in movies or the scariest stories. you're not alone.,False,False
