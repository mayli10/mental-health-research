When I realised what I had done I had a period of okay time where I was like bitch get your head together. Isolating myself made it easier aswell, I think some of the anxiety comes from the idea of people seeing you fuck up. It definitely can be overwhelming and I find myself sitting there counting down to when I'm gonna de-high a bit and gain some composure. ",False,False

I’ll even try to talk myself down and tell myself that the whole reason I got high was to check out for a couple hours but I can’t escape those thoughts. My brain is like, “Oh, you want to relax for awhile? Oh honey. We’re going to get deep. We’re going to examine why you are the way that you are. You’re just along for the ride.” ",False,True

I also used to be a regular smoker for years, but once my OCD and anxiety got too bad, I just had anxiety attacks every time I smoked and if I didn't have one it was never as fun as it used to be. I was always SO CAUGHT UP IN MY OWN FUCKING HEAD. I would also for some reason start ripping myself to shreds and start thinking about my life and my personality and evaluating it from a third person's POV and I just felt like the biggest loser. I couldn't just be in the moment. Last time I got really high was actually about a year ago because it was terrifying and I left my friend's house I think...",False,False

It is such a terrifying experience, even though logically you know it will end...somehow that doesn't help at all. I've OD'd on far more dangerous drugs but the overwhelming fear from a bad weed high is worse imo",False,True

I stopped smoking as much after suffering from panic attacks like this too regularly. The time that pushed me over the edge was when I was chilling with my sister and our partners really close to Christmas, so I was low restricting in preparation for the festivities. She wanted to try smoking so I was showing her how to inhale but she wasn't understanding it so I accidentally smoked almost the entire blunt alone trying to show her and I've never felt the same about smoking since that experience. I locked myself alone in a room and paced for what felt like hours to calm myself down.  I panic almost everytime I smoke nowadays and hate the shakes, so I rarely do it anymore. But that time I genuinely thought this is it.. my body is giving up on me.  Food is the only thing that kinda brings me back round too, just something to take the focus away from what feels like inevitable death lmao. ",False,False

I used to be a daily smoker but don't anymore bc I started experiencing a lil touch of psychosis (not from the weed, but getting high made it worse) and towards the end right before I quit for goods this is how I felt every time I smoked. So hard for me to explain it to people who've never had a panic attack on this level just from weed but this super duper resonated with me. I'm sorry it happened to you, fucking sucks.
