Yes anorexia is a symptom of many other medical conditions. However you're making the mistake of interpreting the Greek translation too literally. There is also something called ""anorexia mirabilis"" which literally translates into ""miraculous lack of appetite"" and was used to describe women, usually nuns, who used to starve themselves in the Middle Ages in the name of God.   &amp;#x200B;  However, I completely disagree that AN is a ""mind state"". In my opinion the act of willful starvation for whatever end *initially* (aesthetics, God, coping with emotional trauma) manifests *unconsciously* into a process that, according to a lot of research, very closely resembles addiction at a neuropsychological level. This is much much more than a ""mind state"", and much more complex than anyone can explain or make sense of right now. I wrote a thesis on this a few years ago and I personally find the addiction theory compelling on both an academic and personal level.   &amp;#x200B;  Also can I just say, most doctors aren't ""dumb"". Some are less competent than others, but most go into the profession with the best intentions and with the patient's interests at heart. I say this being a newly qualified doctor myself and I like to think if I ever got a patient with an eating disorder, they would not consider me ""dumb"" simply because the guidelines are not completely accurate. Please don't conflate the entire profession with the DSM (which definitely has its flaws).",False,False

I am SO annoyed when people say things like: ""You can't have an eating disorder, cause you're not skinny at all!"" and I think that's also what you mean. And it pisses me off so bad. That's just wrong. You don't have anorexia nervosa, but you do have an eating disorder.  When people say ""You don't have anorexia nervosa because you're not underweight."", then they're stupid for even saying things like that to disordered people (who the fuck do they think they are?), but actually they're right.  I never really understood why they make a difference between other eating disorders and underweights, because it kind of makes not-underweight people think they're not as valid as anorexic people. But since I study medicine and worked in psychiatries, ... now I do understand why the difference is important.  Therapy for severely underweight people contains different elements than for normal-weight or overweight people. Severely underweight people need to gain weight in the first place to not die, while normal-weight people with eating disorders should learn to maintain a healthy weight, the focus is more on their behaviour and body dysmorphia (sure, same focus for anorexics, but when someone is already almot dying, the physical part is more important in the first place.) In the end it's just a term. Not more. We shouldn't be too focused to achieve a specific disorder through losing more weight. Our disorders are all valid and bad enough.",False,False

Therefore it can affect someone of any weight.
