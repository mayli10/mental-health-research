I’m sorry you experience that, it must add a whole other layer of frustration to the situation. When I’m binging I find it distracts me from the panic or anxiety I might otherwise feel because I’m so focused on the food itself, which is a blessing and a curse haha.",False,False

I'm that friend that holds everybody up at the restaurant being painfully slow, the server is hovering, watching for the moment to swoop in and take my plate so she can offer my poor family the dessert they've been waiting for. In high school it was a race against time before the bell rang and I'd have to put half my sandwich away  &amp;#x200B;  Tbh half the time I'm completely dissociating, rolling the same bite around in my mouth. It's not cute.  &amp;#x200B;  On a binge is another story though, at that point I lose the concept of what I'm eating or even why, just that I wanna feel stuffed ASAP",False,False

When I was young I would just SCARF the food down (and I still tend to do this when I’m alone).
