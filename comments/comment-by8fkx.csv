I didn't even bother weighing myself this morning because I looked in the mirror and could see the water weight in my abdomen was still 100% there. This is like the thirteenth day in a row and I just fucking can't with this anymore. I just restricted really intensely for three days, and despite being miraculously unconstipated...I GAINED two pounds.

My bmi is still in the normal realm but I eat really low fat so I frequently miss periods. I hate the monthly anxiety of figuring out if my body is just dumb or I'm pregnant.
