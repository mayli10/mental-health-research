It's very confusing for other people without Ed so they will definitely ask questions. Being honest is the right option. I was also very honest with my mother the day I  wanted to recover. She suggested to make me food everyday so I don't have to count calories and I had to tell her why this is a very bad idea even if I want to recover. You have to be super honest and also tell them if their attempt to help you is not very helpful. Tell them exactly how you want them to help you. I for example just told my mum she shouldn't make comments about my body (even compliments), about my eating habits, to not force her food on me and not to get upset if I refuse to eat something she made. It was hard at first, because she still got upset, didn't understand why I refused to eat it and I had to repeat myself everytime, she make comments about my body, blabla. You have to be patient with them and be ready to repeat a lot of things over the next with months. I wish you the best ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False

When I told my parents, it really helped me to get prepared for whatever they might say. Disordered thinking doesn't make sense to people who dont experience it, so expect a little confusion and some questions. Explain where you're at in your sickness and what they can do to help you recover. Tell them you didn't want to keep secrets, just that it's hard to open up about. Hoping for the best! ‚ù§",False,False
