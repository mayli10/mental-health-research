Bowel movements are GLORIOUS when restricting. Having a good bm is a special kind of high for me.  Right? Like I already had chubby cheeks at my smallest. Smiling with too much facial fat is NOT a good look, ESPECIALLY if your facial features are softer.",False,True

This might be tmi (prob not bc we are all crazy here) but.... I have the best BEST bowel movements when I restrict.  Like, when I go to bed hungry, wake up, drink coffee and eat something eggy.  Boom!  My body empties itself out. I donâ€™t know why, and it hasnâ€™t been happening lately bc I havenâ€™t been going to bed hungry.  But I miss it for sure.",False,False
