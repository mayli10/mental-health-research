This happens with chocolate and vanilla and the poop colors are different for both and both are different from my usual poop color. I should probably see a GI anyways. This rarely happens with food because it takes me a long time to eat now but I remember tht it used to. I do have a lot of food sensitivities so that’s always a probability but usually the supplements are fine :-/ thanks!,False,True

As far as I know, dumping syndrome will happen with more than just liquids, you'd probably also experience symptoms (though maybe not diarrhea) with other things.  Other possibilities:  * There's an ingredient that you are allergic or intolerant to * There's ingredients that your body isn't used to processing, which can cause GI distress. This can happen pretty easily with say, milk proteins.  Personally, if there's an ingredient that my body struggles to process, I get very liquid diarrhea which looks sort of similar to like, the chocolate supplements (really gross I'm sorry), because things that cause diarrhea pull more water from your lower large intestine and combine with fecal matter to look Like That.  If it is actually dumping syndrome, you might be taking in fewer calories because fewer calories are being processed by the stomach.   If it's an option for you, maybe see a gastroenterologist, who'd be able to give you more information on what's going on with your body. There are gastric emptying studies that they can do to figure out what is really going on for you.",False,False

This can also make you dehydrated so be sure to hydrate if this happens again. Is it a cold drink? Some people have a hard time digesting cold drinks. Especially ones with high fiber. It happens to me if I drink green smoothies.,False,False
