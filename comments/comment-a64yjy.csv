What they dont see is how active I am. And Ido have a slightly higher than average RMR but that is due to a dedicated lifting regimen.   People also say this stuff about my best friend.

I would say that even with keeping track, there is very little you know about her and her habits. Maybe she climbs 5 flights of stairs every day. Maybe she doesn't eat breakfast or dinner. Maybe she has indeed a condition that doesn't show health problem only because she's young.   Many people are surprised when they see me eating 40 pieces of sushi at unlimited buffet. Well guess what, I don't eat breakfast and dinner, so those are the only 1300 kcal of my day. Yet, many people told me ""you're so lucky, you can eat anything and you stay thin"". Uh coming from someone who eats 2 pizza in one day, never exercise and drink alcohol every other day, I would not take it as anything else than ignorance... ",False,False

One of my roommates is like this and it drives me up the wall. He throws back 3 light and sweet Dunkin iced coffees every morning, goes to his restaurant job, will drink a martini after he‚Äôs cut (which he makes a point of snapchatting every time) and then he‚Äôll bring home bundles of food from work home with him, always in the realm of 3000kcals according to their online nutrition calculator, eat practically all of it, and chase it  all down with multiple cans of beer and a full bag of buttered popcorn every night. And not only will he not gain weight, he still looks muscular despite the fact that it‚Äôs been months since he‚Äôs gone to the gym. And he‚Äôs 23, so it‚Äôs even more of an oddity.  If it were anyone else, I‚Äôd write it off as ‚ÄúI have no way of knowing what he does behind closed doors‚Äù because my eating habits are definitely impacted by who I‚Äôm around and how much attention I think they are paying to me, but I see him eat like this all the time and know it‚Äôs a pattern. I think the fact that his build is more muscular to begin with plays a role in his metabolism, and the higher muscle weight translates to higher metabolic demand or something... but even that theory seems a little flimsy.  It‚Äôs pretty well established that the metabolism you have when you‚Äôre younger isn‚Äôt going to stay with you forever, but it‚Äôs incredibly frustrating when you‚Äôre not one of those people, and in close proximity to someone who eats like a dog that was let loose in a grocery store, without their body seeming to change at all.",False,False
