Life does not allow for such a rigid routine (believe me, I wish it did). This means you either sacrifice your strict adherence to the plan or you avoid participating in anything (which literally becomes anything) that interferes with it.  I already live a pretty isolated life. Social events or family gatherings is something I'm willing to make exceptions for because I know I'll be consistent otherwise. I don't have to worry about scheduling my days/intake around social events involving food as much as other posters do, and I don't let them stress me out, either, because they're uncommon for me. But yeah... social factors don't come in play much, which is part of what makes summer a good opportunity  I don't think I'll obsess about food because I already know I won't be eating any, and because nothing will pop up that'll throw me catch me off guard  You're right though, there are better ways. After I made this post I started considering intermittent fasting until i reach my goal weight (eat maintenance one day, fast the next day, repeat)",False,True

I do not advocate for it, but you can restrict in a much more moderate way and lose weight pretty quickly.

Even if it is not forever, I think this will only further your ED and I urge you to reconsider. Hope this is helpful.",False,False
