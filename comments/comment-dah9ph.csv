It’ll be much easier to gain weight if you don’t have to eat back exercise calories too!,False,False

It's marketed for kids, but could work for you too. My parents gave it to me as a kid bc I was VERY picky (read: undiagnosed autistic + grossed out by certain food textures).

Easy to keep down, plus they don't really make you feel full. Juices, protein shakes, soups etc. Always sipping something between meals. From what I've heard, rice and oatmeal are good for gaining weight fast in a healthier way. As for exercise, maybe try switching cardio for weight training.  Tbh, **5.4 kilograms** in a month does seem a tad overkill. I was gaining around **6.8 kilograms** a month in my full binge mode, where I was shoveling tons of food into my mouth every single day.

And just know that you can still do schoolwork even if you're in treatment during school hours! If you put the treatment team in contact with your school, they should be able to get your work sent to you so you won't get behind! It's called ""home bound"" :) and if you're in college, you should still be able to do that but it's not as dramatic but you HAVE to get your treatment team to contact your school/professors. I was in residential treatment spring semester of my senior year of high school for 4+ months (currently considering going back) and I was still able to do all of my work without any issues and I even finished my semester in April instead of June :)  Everything is going to be okay, I promise, and if you ever need someone to talk to, I'm here!",False,False

They're not overly filling (although I can't eat for a bit after boost) so they won't make you feel terrible and they won't mess up your eating schedule.   I'm currently drinking a boost in the early afternoon and every night (around 9pm) and having a cliff bar with my morning coffee and it's helping a lot! Also, I'm actually pooping like a normal person for once which is the best part :D",False,False
