We are discriminated and barred from accessing unbiased medical help.  There are los of stories of hrt, binders and surgical dilators being taken away from trans people in inpatient clinics. Stopping hrt cold turkey can be mentally catastrophic. Removing access to binders and such can push an already vulnerable patient deeper down. Without dilators, vaginoplasties (especially early on) may degrade/fail, leaving the patient with a sometimes permanent, non-consensual change on their genitals.  I cope by not disclosing my transness to anyone but my endo. I later cross check whatever drugs they prescribe for drug interactions with hrt on my own.  Sadly I don't know how this will be fixed. Maybe the next generation will get to experience proper medical assistance.",False,False
