Itâ€™s not fair to be constantly testing him, trying to make him slip up. He obviously cares about you a lot. I feel you on the insecurity thing, but you really shouldnâ€™t keep testing him because itâ€™s not nice.",False,False

Asking him about the other girls he's been with, showing him pictures of other girls, comparing yourself to other girls, they're all things you're doing that's making these feelings of insecurity even worse. It's a self destructive act imo, and even if it comes from a place of insecurity, it's just disrespectful to yourself if that makes any sense.   Ask him to compliment you more to help with your self esteem issues (asking doesn't mean it doesn't count!) And ask yourself if there's anything he's doing specifically that hurts your self esteem (not saying he is, just think about it). What I realized, and what you need to realize, is that the problem here is your feelings of insecurity, not the fact that there are other girls existing in the world that we compare ourselves to. So the solution to an internal problem is to work it out internally. He can support you, but it's something you have to work through yourself. Sorry for the wall of text and good luck ðŸ’•",False,False

I donâ€™t believe it.  Male perspective: This test has been done on me a lot. Its incredibly awkward to be tested like that. Regardless of who I am shown, I would say the same thing as your boyfriend. If he said the girl you were showing him looked better than you, you would be upset, no? Since he always says you are hotter, then he cares about you. He obviously found you attractive enough to become involved with at the start of the relationship, and that is when physical importance is the most important - at the start of the relationship. Looks remain a factor throughout a relationship to some degree, but the ability to be comfortable around you is likely far more important to him now. Trying to convince him that you are beneath him will make him uncomfortable, and eventually you might succeed. ",False,False
