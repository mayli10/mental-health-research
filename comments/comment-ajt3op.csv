It's so *everything* consuming for some reason until I get sick of it. I think I once unintentionally fasted for a whole day because I was so invested and I'm not even usually into games to begin with lol.   There's also Chess. Lichess is downloadable from the App Store and it's great because you have the option of playing against other people, playing against the machine or just training. It's splendid. There are so many variants, too. And those players won't go easy on you either, I know from experience. So it's definitely something you can play at for a while without getting tired. ",False,False
