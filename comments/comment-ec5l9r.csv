Coffee, botanical gardens, museums, night markets (avoid the food stands tho lol), skating, or even just small things like walking around your city (once went on the best date ever to the public library) are all super different and fun, and your date will appreciate you wanting to do something outside of the norm as well. Good luck !!",False,False
