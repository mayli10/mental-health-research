I’m so sorry your dip of a boss has done it to you. I’m sure you already know this, but he’s projecting his insecurities about his own weight onto you. And he’s a fuckass.   ETA I agree with others saying take it to HR. So fucking inappropriate and Wrong and he shouldn’t be allowed to get away with it.",False,False

I’m so sorry he’s treating you like this, I’m sure it’s born from jealousy that you have better self control than he does. (Side note: my boss has never oinked at me, but otherwise, this sounds almost exactly like my supervisor and me. “I can’t lose weight no matter what, it’s literally impossible” *devours every free food, snack, and sweet in the vicinity* “Idk what’s the problem, I work out an hour every day”)",False,False

His actions are NOT appropriate and he needs to be reported. I’m not on HR nor at your company so I have no idea how seriously they would take this (it’s maybe harassment so hopefully with a least a written warning and further training on how NOT to treat people (especially if you’re managing them omg!!).

Even if you dont want action taken they need to build up a history of his behavior. If he pushes it way too far in the future you (or another person) have prior evidence of his conduct.  It seems easy to just put up with smaller offenses but HR needs that record of complaints in most cases to do anything effective.,False,False

Like.........what the _hell?_ I'm honestly so baffled as to why he thinks that sort of thing is anywhere _close_ to _ANY_ semblance of a professional attitude. He's being completely unprofessional and it sounds like he's so frustrated with his own diet issues that he's literally trying so desperately, so _disgustingly pathetically_ to make everyone else fatter than him out of spite rather than accept the fact that the only person he has to blame for his weight is himself.  I'm disgusted at him on your behalf. I unfortunately don't really know if HR would make things better or worse, so I won't try to advise you, but just know that I'm mad about it with you.",False,False

I would have picked up that cake and smeared it in his face, then wrote my resignation in with the drippage.   OP, if you find him bothering you... take it to HR professionally.
