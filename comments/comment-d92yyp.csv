I'm not sure if I starved myself more or less during that period of time, but it was a lot harder to deal with everything; ED, depression, anxiety, the whole lot of health issues I have. It's such a weird situation to be in, and I'm sure a more common one than people realize. I mean, I'm talking to you right now, and I never thought I'd communicate with someone else in a similar situation, so I guess that's evidence enough (especially since we ran into each other on a relatively obscure subreddit). I think it would be easy for people who aren't involved in that type of situation to misjudge, it sure was easy for me to judge myself. I brought myself down about it, I remember feeling like a complete psycho. He wasn't my boyfriend, so why did I care so much? I thought, I should just get over him because it's over now, I had my chance and he chose someone else, so I should live with it. That didn't make it any easier. I loved him, and I love him now. Things worked out, I mean we have a few problems to work through but nothing related to this, so I definitely feel a lot more valid now than I did back then.  If you ever think these kinds of things about yourself, just know there's absolutely nothing wrong with having a crush on someone, even if they're dating someone else. Don't get involved with trying to break them up, or taking out your frustration about the situation on other people. Other people means you too, by the way, because you're a person. Don't beat yourself up just because you weren't there at the right time, or aren't the person he chose. You didn't do anything wrong, and that's hard to convince yourself of when the person you love isn't with you. I'm not sure how to help, because there's really not much to do in this type of situation but wait it out. It really made me feel like Toby stuck in the middle of Jim and Pam's relationship. Turns out I was Jim in a Pam and Roy relationship. Chin up, but if you can't that's okay too. It sucks.",False,False

I don‚Äôt suppose the guy I‚Äôm into even cares about thinness, but if I make it about that, it feels like I have a chance with him, or some control over his feelings. That‚Äôs just a part of eating disorders and false comparisons, I guess.   It‚Äôs definitely painful, but you sound like a strong person; how you managed to put your emotions aside, whilst being around them, is beyond me. Did the situation make your ED worse?   Thinspo, in my opinion, is most triggering when it has some relation (of sorts) to something emotionally taxing that I‚Äôm dealing with in the moment.   Don‚Äôt worry about wasting my time I have no life, haha. Thank you for sharing üíï",False,True

Apparently he was too, but the timing was never right and etc. etc. Anyways, for a while he was dating one of my friends. It really hurt to see that go down. They would always be touchy and cuddly, and it's a little fucked up to remember because his sister (who I'm close friends with) knew I had a crush on him before they started dating. Right afterwards, I decided to shove that down and tell her I was over it. I didn't want to get in between them, or make her feel like she was doing something wrong, or cause drama, or be the reason they broke up and then have to live with the fact I sabotaged my best friend's potentially great relationship. I had a million reasons to avoid those feelings, and I'm still glad I shoved them away for a while. It only got worse though, they moved in together and got engaged. She would text me all the time about their relationship problems, and I always took her side. I had to hear about everything, her planning her wedding in front of me. I was so lost.  Soon, their relationship fell apart. I don't know exactly why, I could go into detail from what she told me and what I know, but that would be a waste of your time. Point is, she called it off, and moved back home. Then came another horrible phase, being there while he tried to get over her. That was hard. I still think about this sometimes, because he didn't handle it very well. It makes me wonder if he ever got over her.  Point is, I love him and I know he loves me. I have my own past that I'm sure bothers him, just maybe not on the same level. We know its weird, but at this point its like the unspoken truth between us. No point in digging open old wounds just to hear him try to validate my pain.  So, I think I get it. Maybe. It really hurts seeing the person you love, love someone else. Especially when they're skinny and tiny.",False,False
