I told her I snack a lot (I do, I never really have full meals), and that was that. I have a follow up on January too and I’m fucked because I havent gotten my period in 4 months and idk if I’m going to lie or what ugh.  But I definitely feel you, her question fucked me up for a few days but I tried justifying it as something she is just trained to ask.  Good luck on your follow up though.",False,False

It's always nice when a doctor has some sensibility like that. Not many do and it can scare people away. I hope all goes well for OP, and that if needed, they find the best help for them.",False,False

If you're there for something else, they'll probably let it go.  That being said, it's comparable to someone coming in for something like severe depression or substance abuse and not wanting to talk about it - they're kinda obligated to try, since it's a potentially lethal condition if not managed. The OPs doctor sounds like she's had some ED training based on how she asked the questions, which is a good sign.",False,False

I'm in a similar situation, I have ED in my medical history and will be going to an appointment soon after losing notable weight, and I don't want to talk about it with her.",False,False
