There are also other protein bars. I think there is a company called Vita Health that sells a ""Pure Protein"" bar for like $8 per box of 6. On Amazon.ca they have Clif Builders bars in boxes of 12 for $20. They're eligible for free shipping too. I'm sure the US site has a cheaper price.",False,False

I’m in the US and pretty frequently see the original Clif bars on sale for $1 each at the grocery store. I can usually get the Zone and Balance brand bars for $1 too. (With protein bars I’ve often found better prices irl than on Amazon.),False,False
