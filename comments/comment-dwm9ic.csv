Sodium intake will correlate with fluctuations in water weight BUT in the long term it should mostly be oscillating around a baseline because the body has ways of excreting extra sodium. We’re not infinitely storing all the excess sodium along with accompanying extra water. Thank goodness! Much of the western world would have popped by now were that the case. It’s really cool how many systems the body has to keep things stable in the face of fluctuating inputs.    Dunno if that helps - I’m def not a bio major, just have read up on electrolytes a bit. Googling something like “what does the body do with extra sodium” should turn up a plethora of in-depth explanations.",False,False

But I'm eating way less calories than I should..so I'm wondering if it'll balance out in terms of weight? Or if the water weight will just keep piling on",False,True

The estimate I’ve read most often is that we need ballpark 500mg a day. Without enough sodium I feel like utter dizzy nauseous crap so I actually supplement sodium with some regularity depending on my activity level and how much I’m getting from food/beverages.   Of course, most people in the US are getting quite a bit more than 500mg of sodium each day. If you total up the sodium in what you plan to eat/drink and it’s under 2000 mg per day, I personally wouldn’t be too worried, but you’ll kinda just have to see how you feel. (Though an important caveat is that if someone has been significantly restricting for a long time, or underweight for a long time, electrolyte balance can be a very delicate and critical thing, and I’d be much more cautious.) Eating a high-sodium diet long-term can certainly have negative health effects. The water retention is really just a side effect of the body trying to keep sodium concentrations stable, and to keep an appropriate balance of sodium and potassium. I really don’t *think* that water retention would increase indefinitely, but it would very possibly be putting extra strain on your kidneys and circulatory system.",False,False
