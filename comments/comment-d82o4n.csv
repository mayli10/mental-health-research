I went to inpatient when I was 16 and that was the last time I really met any ED friends. Now I'm afraid to talk to them because I'm never sure where they are in the recovery and don't want triggers going either direction. This relapse has probably been the hardest for that reason.",False,True

But after almost 17 years, multiple failed recovery attempts, too many ups and downs and (let's be honest) general laziness, I've just accepted my constant  eating disorder➡️disordered eating➡️""matinence Ed behavior"" cycles.

I also don't have a lot of friends and so in recovery I got hobbies. I rock climb now and that's cool. Climbers are very chill and friendly people.
