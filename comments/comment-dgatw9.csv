I've gained 4 (needed) lbs because I've stopped having meal times and instead eat all at once. I'm temporarily forgiving myself for the 4 lbs because restricting isn't in my best interest since it's cross country season and considering my bmi and since I'm already struggling with energy levels. I've attempted to resume eating breakfast and lunch, but i haven't stopped stuffing myself. When i get home i just eat tomorrow's calories worth of breakfast and lunch and feel too bloated the next day to eat breakfast and lunch and still be mentally sound.  Emphasis on the mentally sound part-- with the mentality i have, i acknowledge I'm still technically restricting. I know restricting and then overeating is a self-fulfilling cycle. My efforts in eating breakfast and lunch has been to prevent this, but I've only stayed consistent for 2 days before pulling back. I know i need to stick to my guns for longer, but it's hard to actively continue to over eat-- purposely-- in having breakfast and lunch. It's different than saying ""fuck it"" and over eating, being in a good mood and momentarily forgiving of yourself, or when you're socially eating and don't want the eating disorder to prevent you from living your life and having a good time. Purposeful over eating means engaging in mindfulness, which prompts ED brain e.g. ""why actively eat when we could actively restrict"", ""we should use this opportunity to restrict instead"", ""take advantage of this mindfulness"", etc.   I know it's not a matter of what works vs. what doesn't, because in practice, any solution could work. I just need to make active and conscious good decisions.   On one hand i can acknowledge i need the extra food and energy, but on the other, I'm just uncomfortable with feeling uncomfortable (both mentally and physically), and at a 13000 calorie surplus, i feel like my safety net's been pulled out from underneath me.   There's my self-reflection, does anyone have advice? On just how to lead a life in which i feel i have control. Obviously i know what it is i need to do, but, i dunno. It's hard to feel good about life when you're going through it alone, and when you're going through life alone, it's hard to find the motivation to always make the right choices, and when you don't always make the right choices, it's hard to feel happy with yourself, and it's hard to continue to make the right choices **when you already dont feel happy with yourself.**  I don't feel like my eating disorder is severe enough to warrant treatment, because it's not my eating disorder that needs to be treated. I need therapy and socialization and support. Admitting you need support in navigating yourself so that you can navigate the world is uncomfortable, though. Because yea, you're taking a good look at yourself and acknowledging you're kind of defective and need literal support in interacting with others and literal support in being normal. At least, this is how I feel about myself. I need a 24/7 extroverted best friend who includes me in their life who's the opposite of me in every way but still for some reason finds value in interacting with me and having me in their life and makes me better just for being in my life (alright im describing my best friend from several years ago who moved away but you get the point, fuck i took him for granted).  I know i should probably seek help, and that that's the best answer for addressing and treating my bullshit the quickest so i can move on with my life, whatever moving on with my life means. I've always been hopeful of what life could be.  But yeah. Treatment, probably. I keep considering the idea off and on depending on my momentary mental state. Treatment is probably the best option for the sake of increasing the quality of my life. Do i know what treatment entails? Nooope",False,False
