I need to remind myself of this constantly.  I struggled with depression and self harm for years and always thought people with EDs were ""better at hating themselves"" than me... So I tried out a lot of the behaviours but they never stuck because luckily I sought out therapy and got better. Then therapy ended (reached max of sessions covered by insurance) and I have been spiraling down all last year, culminating in anorexia. Because of all the therapy I was 100% aware of how bad what I was doing was but I still couldn't stop myself. Starting inpatient next week luckily. Still constantly feel like I did this to myself because I stopped using all the tools therapy gave me.",False,False
