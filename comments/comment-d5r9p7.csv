Then depending on the intensity of the craving/how hard I think it will be to avoid:  Low: 1 babybell light sliced as thin as possible, and sprinkle a little oregano over the top or before the cheese  Medium: mozzarella  Hardcore: mozzarella &amp; actual toppings. Usually either ham and pineapple or Italian sausage  Even the last one isn‚Äôt too bad for calories. And even if I made 2 of them, would still beat giving in and ordering Pizza Hut by a LONG shot lol",False,False
