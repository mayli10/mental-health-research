No fuckhead, I have depression and it’s not 👏about👏you👏  I’m sorry you’re dealing with this, it’s in no way helpful but really difficult to address.",False,False

This is exactly what my mom does with me. No offense to your husband, but he needs to keep his thoughts in and support you as much as possible. He’s just giving you one more thing to worry about",False,False

I go through the same thing with my boyfriend. I usually end up shutting up about my issues until he forgets about it/moves on to something else because I hate making him feel bad :/ I’m not sure that’s the right thing to do though",False,False
