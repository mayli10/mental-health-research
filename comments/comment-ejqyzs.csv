Most models probably would only look pretty or okay if they were normal bmi. I got much more positive treatment from both men and women when i was hitting that underweight bmi mark (not at that “EW ur 2 skinny, gross” mark normies associate with *gAsP* anorexia but that weight where people think you are just naturally skinny but in reality you are starving yourself). That “kind of underweight” look is so popularized in media that people think it is the sexiest weight now, and guys fetishize that look, even though if you google victoria secret model bmis, their bmis are not considered to be in the “normal” bmi range. A lot of men say that they don’t like girls who are too skinny but in reality a lot of figures they gravitate towards constitute a lot of effort on the girl’s part, whether it’s an obsessive diet regimen, exercise, smoking, etc etc. Not only that, some guys complain even if you are skinny but now you lack the perky boobs and butt that naturally can only come with a healthy bmi",False,False
