I’m on a recovery ~journey~ and I really understand where you’re at. Something really helpful a therapist told me in treatment is that recovery can seem really scary because it might feel like losing control. However, it’s not- it’s taking control from the ED, and that’s new and hard and scary but you are absolutely capable of it. Sending you love and support 💓",False,False
