I do most of my shopping at 9:30 or later after getting off work to avoid too many people being around and I bring my own bags that I use instead of a basket to avoid people seeing what I have.  There are even certain items I will not buy at the same time as other items because I think it makes it too obvious.  Logical me knows nobody cares but I’m still really neurotic as well.,False,False

I like being secretive about my shit, I guess? When I was living with my then-girlfriend, she was able to drive me to walmart and we'd go super late at night so I could be disordered in peace. But the closest grocery store to my currently apartment is a lot smaller, and also I can't drive. Even though I consciously know that people probably don't give a damn, I still feel really off about people even knowing. It's infuriating. Thank you for the reminder, though. It helps.",False,True

If it makes you feel any better I don’t think anyone listens to what other people are buying.  Most people don’t care and are wrapped up in their own thoughts.  And if you got an entire haul of ED food most people would be too dumb to realized, unless your in the disorder or you work closely with people who are most people have no idea what we look for in food.  At most people might think your dieting but unless you have an ED it’s not like everyone can just pick you out by your grocery cart.",False,False
