For what it’s worth, I hope the best case scenario happens (where you can sit him down and really get through to him about why he was wrong to treat you this way).   Stay strong OP! I’m rooting for your recovery, and always remember that it’s okay for things to progress/get better at a pace that you are most comfortable with.",False,False

I understand that people are skeptical of Reddit relationship advice (and its tendency to skew towards breaking up); however, it is also true that there are toxic behaviors that are not acceptable in any good, respectful, and caring relationship. Making ultimatums about mental health and eating disorders, interpreting your personal struggles as a sign of “disrespect” to him, and using emotional leverage to blackmail you into changing a behavior. . . is super toxic.   You deserve to be with someone who cares about your mental health for YOUR sake, wants to help you be better without emotionally pressuring/threatening you, and is someone who you feel like you can talk to. The way he treats you does not sound kind or considerate, and ignorance about mental health is no excuse for emotional toxicity and self-centeredness.   Please be careful OP. I have been in your shoes before. Send me a DM if you need to talk.",False,False

He’s usually a very kind and considerate person and I just think he’s really ignorant about mental illnesses.",False,True

The thing is, he takes it as me being disrespectful if I relapse after promising I wouldn’t. He takes it as an insult, a personal attack.  I don’t know how to make him understand that without therapy it’s hard for me to recover...",False,True

I know that saying 'dump his ass' is oversimplifying everything, but it sounds like your boyfriend is seriously lacking an understanding of your situation and how to be any kind of support system. If he's getting pissed at you for just trying to talk to him about the thought of relapsing, then I don't know if it would be worth it for you to try to explain how that kind of shit isn't helpful, or how any of this actually works.  Obviously I've got no clue what your bf is like normally, nor if threatening to break up with you was legit or just a heat-of-the-moment outburst from a worried partner. But based on your post alone: he ain't it at all. That's an astronomically shitty way to treat someone",False,False
