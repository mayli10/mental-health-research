I always say I’m going to do IF and then never commit so this is exactly the motivation I needed. And to know it’ll take two weeks to adjust - it’s so good to have a light at the end of the tunnel.   I need to go back to not being afraid of hunger. I used to be able to wide the waves and now I’m a baby. Thanks for taking the time to write this. ,False,False

At the beginning of the week, I bulk buy ingredients for two big meals to prepare everyday for that week. I prep the ingredients when I buy them (ie. cut them up, weigh them...). For example, I bought tortillas and a bunch of chicken...etc and have been making the same meals this week since they are sitting in a container already weighed out! I cycle through recipes every week. It's like meal prep.    I became really strict with myself and wouldn't allow myself to eat outside my windows or outside my planned meals. It was really hard. I was starving most of the time, but after two weeks my body is completely adapted and I get full with 600-800 calories shoveled into five hours (I get really nice portions for my lunch and dinner! It makes restricting not seem like restricting!)   Good luck to you, my love! Don't be afraid to be hungry. You will eventually always get hungry no matter how much you eat, so don't convince yourself that you NEED food in that moment. We can biologically survive a very long time without it. :-)  ",False,False
