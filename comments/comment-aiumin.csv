Ugh, I always do this where I make it all my fault and the other person isn't to blame. But everyone here is saying he was the one in the wrong and not me... like I KNOW that's the truth but it's hard to wrap my head around. But you're right about pretty much everything. So thanks.",False,True

The saying ""when the tiger shows you stripes"" fits here. Describing it as stupid and impulsive, humiliating is nice of you, as is not feeling as if he is at fault of anything....but honestly it sounds like a friend/acquaintance did a kinda weird shitty thing and you are not wrong to feel angry confused and hurt.   and I don't know exactly how this went down... and the way his went down is kind of important for context so I may have this totally wrong, but if he just casually requested naked photos (knowing you are just friends with no acknowledged chemistry, knowing that you have mental health/health struggles and are vulnerable etc.... he may not be a friend worth having. Like you say... you might not want to maintain this friendship. What positives are you getting out of it? It's hard for me to not feel angry about how this may have made you feel so objectified and pushed (in ways you did not want to be objectified and affected).  &amp;#x200B;  I totally know what it's like to have so many triggers around trust and boundaries.   &amp;#x200B;  I guess if it was just a one off thing he texted I can see why you would be tempted to frame it as an innocent understanding but... well... as I mentioned... I tend to have trouble trusting people once I get a gut instinct. Sometimes paying attention to these feelings is the safest thing for #1: you",False,False

Asking for nudes from someone you’re not in an actual sexual relationship is creepy and wrong. You’re not responsible for that inappropriate behavior and your reaction is normal. This one is completely on him. ,False,False

I'd completely understand if you wanted to break the friendship, nudes are pretty awkward anyway.  Hugs xx",False,False
