I feel like my drivers are closer to ""if I cant be pretty I can be skinny to make up for it"" and ""feeding myself is a chore and I can barely get out of bed or shower"", plus I didn't develop mine til 21 so most ED media and general knowledge doesn't apply to me. It's fucking dumb to me that the medical classifications are ""this strict set of symptoms, this other specific set, or get into the ednos basket! I mean osfed.

Woooooo- that sent me down a scary road. Still haven't found the way back.   I find I do my best when I don't think of foods as off limits, and remind myself the brain doesn't remember the quantity, just the taste.   But OF COURSE if I want a nutritionally empty/ calorically high food, I can't justify keeping it in my body, so I just eat a large quantity, then purge.   Then if I'm calorie restricting if I go over even just a little I failed and I might as well fail big.",False,False

First off, I can‚Äôt ‚Äúeat naturally‚Äù it‚Äôs a surefire binge to happen. When I set calorie limits, I better follow them to the fucking T because if there is like any uncertainty about my count, my brain start screaming WE BLEW IT, BINGE TIME!  Although, I had something miraculous happen last night. I had massive gas (tmi sorry) and horrible stomach cramps and could barely eat and didn‚Äôt log my calories, I could feel that binge urge between cramps, but instead I just went to bed.  So solution is to eat maltitol and get more painful gas.",False,False

I've never really associated myself the ""numbers became my obsession"" subgenre of restrictives... Too much pressure bro. I weigh myself rarely cause I tend to spiral when I do, and the moment I start calorie counting and I don't log a little thing or I can't find the right brand so there are some differences... Idk it just all goes out the window and I eat forever.... Just not paying attention to specifics and public excuse of intermittent fasting, I can fast over 18 hours a day and go to sleep satisfied on a big bowl of lettuce with 4tbsp of low cal dressing... And that feels so decadent!   I feel like someone needs to do some clinical research and invent new more specific ED names/types (especially because I think all the AN ___ Subtype"" classifications are stupid, poorly understood by non-ed physicians, and reinforce the ""you either starve yourself or binge and puke"" stereotype that is fucking buuuillshit.   I feel like the ""it's all numbers"" and ""I don't eat because I truly feel I don't deserve food"" and the ""if I was skinny it would make up for x flaw"" subtypes are different drivers for a similar behavior which is where the confusion start, obviously with some overlap between drivers and people can have multiple converging drivers...",False,False
