I'm in a very dark place at the moment, with school coming back for me, with my issues with having a job, with my eating disorder relapsing, with my mental illnesses that lay untreated... it's a lot. I apologize if anyone felt like this was for attention, when I intended to use this as a 'offmychest' type post. &lt;3 I definitely think that we have a shared sense of community with our shared suffering, but I worry that we aren't able to find a way to soothe this. I struggled with this in this post; Not knowing what to do with myself and feeling like nothing else will help unless I die. It's hard and I think I should try therapy again, but I'm very incredibly busy and need to dedicate a large portion of my day to studying and practicing for my degree. Plus I need to make money somehow to save up to move out of my parents house again but I don't know if I can because I don't want to eat and all on my mind is food. Ugh I'm sorry for the essay. I do, genuinely, appreciate the reach out; however, I cannot in good faith allow myself get close to people at this current time in any regard :( I'm sorry.",False,True

I know that we're complete strangers but I'm here to talk if you need to, and as crazy as it sounds I love you solely because the fact that you're here means you know the same struggle and pain that I have, and that connects all of us even when we feel completely alone &lt;3. You say that the guilty feelings you have won't leave you, but nothing in life is permanent, you didn't always feel this way and that means that there is 100% the possibility of a way to leave this behind someday too.",False,False
