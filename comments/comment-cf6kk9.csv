I'd also bet money that no doc has recommended anything she's doing.  BMR tends to drop in old age due to a more sedate lifestyle and no longer exercising, not inherently. An older person who's gaining weight needs to move more, not eat 800 kCal/day.  Idk this just comes off as normalizing something that's more likely to be unhealthy.",False,False

Also called hyponatremia.,False,False

If she's short, then it's also not toooo unreasonable to be eating 800 a day. As a 5'1"" 21 year old, if I ate about 800 a day I'd only be losing a pound or two a week, which is considered 'safe'.  Either way, sorry that you're being triggered by something you aren't in control of. Hope you find a safe space somewhere.",False,False

Imagine being at her age - at least I guess sheâ€™s old if sheâ€™s a grandma? Correct me if Iâ€™m wrong - and still feel the need to restrict when meeting old friends. Old habits and disordered eating die hard. But you know better than her, so as triggering as the enviroment is try not to let that get into your head and take care of yourself",False,False
