When I was 13 my dad left home and I suddenly could go out late and I got into lots of trouble with a new crowd of friends. I was in bad sexual scenarios and I have always connected sex with love since. I used to take that out on my husband a lot for a while and think that if we weren‚Äôt having sex he would leave me and not love me, because as soon as those guys in my past weren‚Äôt getting what they wanted they physically left.
