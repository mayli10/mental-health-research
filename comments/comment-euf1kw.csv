There are other antidepressants that may not cause a change in appetite. Luckily, Prozac is easy to get off of and switch. You should not have withdrawal symptoms.",False,False

Like I didnâ€™t get as anxious, sure, but I also didnâ€™t really feel happy either. I missed the bad days and the good days and I wasnâ€™t happy just having mediocre days. I went off after a month and now itâ€™s been a year, but even with the low points in the end Iâ€™m glad I went off even for my own mental health, which has improved some since then anyway",False,False

What I surmise is that a path out of the anorexia/bulimia (the antidepressant gave you bulimia) would be more valuable for your depression than any psychoactive drug.,False,False

They have me on a low dose (30 mg) rn but want to bump it up to 60 because apparently thatâ€™s gonna make my depression better and the appetite increase go away? Like what kinda crackhead logic??,False,False

Thereâ€™s an urgent care center nearby me that takes my insurance with a $30 copay (thank god). I think Iâ€™m gonna go there first. See what they say. I really appreciate your concern ðŸ’œ,False,False

Can you try going to urgent care instead of the ER? Itâ€™ll be cheaper. Or if your doctor/insurance co has a hotline you can call for advice?",False,False

They might turn you away after a short and very expensive array of tests. Going to urgent care or your primary care physician first is a better and far less expensive move imo...,False,False
