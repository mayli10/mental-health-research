Get your pulse, blood pressure etc. checked.   I can't talk for you but for me I found I had a raised heart rate from a number of things.  1. When I started restricting the hypertension in my body would give me a raised heart rate at night and in the morning.   2. A lot of cardio and HIIT training over the years has left my heart rate high at resting after exercise.   3. When I went past the 9 stone 5 pounds level my body fat was 4%-5%. As a result I became more sensitive to my heart rate because my body had become so lean  4. My B/P involved consuming a lot of caffeine to help with the purge process. Naturally being so lean the caffeine and the violence of the purging caused my heart to race at rest. Usually while trying to sleep at night and the next morning.   How this helps.",False,False

Eventually I went to the emergency room and had tests done. It was anxiety and panic attacks. I had been having that for so long. I wish I had gone to the doctor sooner. But I know that's not always possible for a variety of reasons. But if you are able to it's always worth going to the doctor, even if just for peace of mind.",False,False

Sounds like low blood sugar to me, hypoglycemia. Could also be electrolytes. Adding lite salt to your drinks can help with electrolytes, and eating low carb for a few days can help you ease into a fast.",False,False

Abnormal? for a person with an eating disorder? but when you feel your heart beating like that, that's heart palpitations. It can be caused by anxiety but it's probably something that you should get checked out.",False,False
