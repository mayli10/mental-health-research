Bottled water tastes better than tap to me too, but that’s likely a placebo affect.  I used to drop some of those flavoured electrolyte tablets into the bottles so it’s a bit easier to drink, and also tops up your electrolytes which is pretty important!",False,False

I think a part of it is that I don’t get thirsty, probably because this has been happening for such a long time. I’ve tried all of those water tracker apps but lost interest.   Idk why I struggle so much trying to look after myself",False,True

Try to force yourself to drink 3 cups of water in the morning, in the afternoon and in the evening.  Sometimes I even set an alarm clock at a certain time cause I simply forget to drink water (I rarely get thirsty)",False,False
