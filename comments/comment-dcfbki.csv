I first ""decided"" to have an eating disorder when E! Online covered that Lindsay Lohan had bulimia. Ran to the bathroom to see if I could make myself vomit. A few Google searches and I was on the proana LiveJournal. That's where it really kicked off cause it was a community and everyone felt like a fat piece of shit, so I had people to talk to. I feel like I didn't totally just decide to have an eating disorder, I think I jumped at the chance to discover how to be skinny at the age of 12 and didn't know any better. I was a child, and now at 27...it is not a choice anymore. I would love to be able to eat without it being a stress-induced nightmare and it not turn into a binge like I will never feed myself again. To not be a calorie rain man. I think that's what makes recovery feel impossible to me, I do the math without even thinking about it.",False,False

No-one forced me down this path. I decided to restrict and delve into ED holes like this place. I‚Äôm the one who let outside things influence me; sure people like my mom had a *huge* impact on how I decided to cope with shit- but it‚Äôs not at all her or anyone else‚Äôs fault.  Especially relapses. I chose this. I knew what things would trigger me, and I still committed to doing them.
