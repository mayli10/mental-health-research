You moved your body, got your muscles and blood moving, activated endorphins, all that good stuff. Donâ€™t focus on what you didnâ€™t do, focus on what you achieved. Even just going to the gym after taking a break from it is a win! Think of the motivation you needed to just do that. You have to start somewhere. Instead of getting through the full list of things you wanted to do today, maybe you go back tomorrow or in a few days or a week and do the next thing. And then you go back again and do the third thing. All movement and exercise is beneficial, obvious exceptions excluded. Donâ€™t let it get you down!",False,False

I'm sure this didn't help at all sorry",False,False

Iâ€™d recommend going in the morning, when itâ€™s not so full. I always feel like everyone will judge me, but that never happened. Ultimately everyone is focusing on their own workout and nobody really cares about what everyone else is doing (except for that one creepy dude, that you can find in literally every gym!).",False,False
