She was also his exact type.  Man, if I lost a pound for every time jealous thoughts creeped in to my head maybe I would be happy. Because I would disintegrate in to nothing and cease to exist.",False,False

I knew my boyfriend's ex before I met him, she worked with my best friends. My friends and I admired how sexy she was. When I found out he had dated her, I was like ""Damn, well done. She's smokin' hot.""   BUT THEN, after a few months of us dating, I saw that she was one of the top most visited IG profiles on his account. She posts a lot of selfies and dog pics, not much else. It instantly ignited my jealousy and I questioned him about it, and he claimed he only checked her IG to see if she had moved out of our city yet. BS.   Now I creep her profile every few months to see what she looks like because she started body-building. She had a soft petite figure before and now she's super jacked. My feelings are like a weird mixture of jealousy and glee.",False,False
