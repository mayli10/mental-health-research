There have been so many times I wanted to try out recipes with capers but no matter what grocery store I went to, I couldn’t find them anywhere. Then a few weeks ago I was at an organic market with my SO and out of nowhere he goes, “hey, weren’t you looking for capers a while back?” and when I looked over he had a jar of honest to god capers in his hand. So I bought them and they’ve been in my fridge unopened ever since. I’m gonna have to try this magical caper cherry tomato grape mashup salad thing ASAP.",False,False

Tomatoes.   18 kcal/100g, juicy, tasty, requires a decent amount of chewing. If you can get the multicoloured ones they have different textures and flavours also. Highly recommend binging on these if you’ve got a couple days without sugar, that’s when your tastebuds will be most sensitive to their sweetness!",False,False

I think something in your brain just snaps and tells you to find food, constantly. The worst part about it is that the more you try to restrict to fix the binging, the worse it’ll make you binge.  My best advice is to try not to restrict to a low amount of calories, eat 3 meals a day at a normal amount of calories (1500-1800 which is generally NOT enough to gain any weight), eat fruit for snacks. If you really can’t control the binging, find something that you can eat a fair amount of for a lowing amount of calories. Things like watermelon, grapes, apples, I’ve found that just being able to eat for a long time helps, and the lower calorie the better if your brain is telling you to eat a massive portion.",False,False

For reference, I’ve gained ~10lbs from my LW and the bulk of it happened throughout the month of June.   First thing I would recommend is sitting back and trying to think of anything changed to trigger this binge. For example, within the same week at the beginning of June my brother escaped a toxic living situation and moved into the sunroom on a blow up mattress in my tiny one-bedroom apartment, and I was guilted into going on the world’s most boring road trip with people I mostly don’t particularly get along with, that lasted for two weeks. I have OCD, and the feeling of being so massively out of control and having no safe spaces left was the number one contributor to my binge eating.   The second thing that helped me a lot was realising that it was less impulse control issues, and more the desire to stop the obsessive thought patterns that was leading me to binge. For example, I would remember that I had one of my favourite protein bars in the pantry and I would. not. be. able. to. stop thinking about the stupid thing. This would lead to me telling myself, “fine, just go and eat the fucking thing, get it over with, once it’s gone you’ll stop thinking about it and you’ll be able to move on”. What it took me a while to notice was that the thoughts never stopped just because that one food item was gone - they just switched over to obsessing about a different food item. Telling myself in the moment, “it WON’T be over, it will keep going, eating this thing isn’t going to help or make it stop” was really useful in cutting a binge off before it started.   The third thing was wrangling some control back over my life. I was able to start planning and prepping and weighing my meals again, and while it still took some time to not let those meals spiral into a binge, slowly starting to feel more in control helped a lot.   Another trick I used was paying for and earning binges. For example, one day I binged on 2000 kcal worth of protein bars, which was 1200 kcal MORE than what I had planned to eat that day. The following day I made myself burn those extra calories, which is three times more than I was burning on average per day at the time. It was miserable and exhausting and afterwards I switched to EARNING my food instead of paying for it after: if I want that extra protein bar, I have to go to the gym FIRST and burn however many calories will be in it. Eventually, I stopped wanting any extra food outside of what I’d planned and budgeted for.   I’m about two weeks binge-free at this point and I feel a thousand times more in control and generally better. I hope some of this can help you too.",False,False
