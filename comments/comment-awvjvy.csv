For me, it always felt that there was something missing that I couldn't quite place, and after getting diagnosed, it just felt right. Despite that, it does suck to have yet another diagnosis making you feel fucked up.  That being said, I'm still early on in my treatment of BPD, so I don't have a lot of experience from that standpoint. I just wanted to let you know that you're definitely not alone and you can get through this.",False,False

Really interesting - I didn't realise that there were different forms of PTSD, though it seems so obvious to me now. It makes a lot of sense and I'm kind of curious if my symptoms are more accurately just complex PTSD. Thanks for the info!",False,False

It might be worth looking into that if you have a PTSD diagnosis in the past?  I have BPD, and my own diagnosis chain has been MDD/GAD -&gt; OCD -&gt; bipolar -&gt; PTSD. Most people I know were never diagnosed with BPD off the bat and according to my psychiatrist it's normal to go through a lot of different diagnoses before landing on that one.  My experience is that being diagnosed with BPD, while kind of scary at first, was actually a godsend because it allowed me to actually figure out what sort of treatment I needed and to access that treatment; I'd never have started DBT if not for that diagnosis. I still struggle daily but I think just... knowing exactly what's wrong with me, knowing that most people with this disorder feel and act the way I do, is validating and makes it a little easier to deal with. I might be crazy but I'm not crazy-with-no-reasonable-explanation like I used to be.  Good luck and I hope things get easier for you x ",False,False

I wouldn't really contest it myself. I'm kind of textbook- the lifelong history of self harm, catastrophic emotions, abandonment issues, undue risk taking, and perpetually cycling between aloof and overattached, hating myself than loving myself then hating the world and loving everyone, and so often just feeling  e m p t y . It was kind of a relief, honestly? Like wow, there's a *reason* I'm like this ??   It helped me understand my eating disorder better too. By making myself small and sick I'm able to hold onto people (or at least their attention) and it provides me with a sense of security. It also helps fill those  e m p t y  times with something engaging. Colors in the blank spaces in my self image too.",False,False

Finally being able to identify the cause of my pain was life changing.  Remember that getting a diagnosis doesn't change you; it only gives the symptoms you've always had a name. It helps you get the right treatment. You're still you and you can recover from BPD!  Speaking of treatment, have you tried DBT (dialectical behaviour therapy)? It has helped me so much... its a long process to learn it, but its worth the hard work.  ",False,False

I showed a lot of symptoms of it when I was younger and was afraid I have it too (maybe I do?) but I’ve found that being honest with myself, admitting my irrational thoughts and fears to myself, accepting that they are there, and trying to give myself positive self talk (telling myself the opposite thing: I am not worthless/unloveable/going to be abandoned/worthy of being abandoned etc) has been helpful.   Trying to pretend that I don’t have these thoughts never did anything for me. I know there’s a lot of shame/stigma attached to BPD, but try to be as open and honest as you possibly can with your therapist and they can help you work through your thoughts. Try to find ways to delay yourself from anger and reaction.   For me, when I have irrational thoughts or fears or I feel angry, I wait. I wait before I speak. I look at the other side and focus on the other persons point of view and what they may be going through. I remind myself that everything is not about me and most things are not personal, and that what I see myself as is not what other people see, other people love me and love many things about me and think that I am a person who is worthy of their love/energy etc.  I try not to push my irrational thoughts away and instead accept them; they are part of me and my mental illness ~but~ they don’t define me and they can be worked through. Having (if I do have it lol) BPD does not make me an evil person, it just means that I will have to work a little harder at my personal relations and my relationship with my self/self esteem etc.   From what I’ve read therapy is the most helpful for BPD and that requires that you are comfortable being in a place of absolute honesty with your therapist.  Like I said, my mom has it, and she lies to her therapist, herself, and everyone around her. She will not accept herself as she is. And she still suffers. It kills me to watch her suffer from this awful mental health condition and have her life ripped apart by bulimia. She is a precious human being and does not deserve to suffer so terribly. I really really feel for her.    I don’t know if this is going to be helpful at all because like I said, I was never professionally diagnosed with it. Try to be accepting as you can of yourself as a person with BPD and let your therapist into your head so they can help reframe your thoughts. BPD does not make you an evil or broken, unfixable person!",False,False

Not sure if I’m allowed to post links here, but I have a [podcast](http://www.picklesandvodkapodcast.com)  in which I have conversations with people about their mental health, and my latest episode was with a fellow Redditor who has BPD as well as an ED.

So my diagnosis.  12 years old: after years of self harm (i was 8 when i started, been good for about a year!) and failed suicide attempts they diagnosed me as bipolar. The medication , lithium, made me a walking zombie and my hair fall out.  14: officially diagnosed with Body Dysmorphia and EDNOS. I b/p'd through out high school.  16: i checked myself into the hospital to get out of living with my father. I lied about being suicidal to get it. There they changed the diagnosis from bipolar to bpd. They switched my medication which actually helped (until i discovered drugs)  BPD is a never ending fight against yourself. I ask myself multiple times a day ""why cant i just be normal? Whats that even like?""  Now im 24 and at least can tell when mania is about to hit .",False,False
