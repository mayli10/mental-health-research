Weight gain side effects tend to be caused by either a sudden appetite increase that people're not equipped to handle if they're used to eating intuitively, or an increase in appetite in depressed/anxious people because the meds are working.  Occasionally they can make things go haywire beyond that, but it's not *nearly* as common as the above makes it seem.  Different medication has wildly different effects on different people, too. I've taken a couple of antidepressants that all had ""possible weight gain"" side effects. Nada.",False,False
