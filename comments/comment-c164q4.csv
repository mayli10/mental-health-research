I had a therapist in treatment tell me that working on recovery can feel like a loss of control, but itâ€™s really the ED losing control and your healthy self gaining it, which can be new and hard and scary but is so worth it. Definitely sounds like your healthy self wants to recover and has your best interest in mind. Sending you love and support ðŸ’“",False,False
