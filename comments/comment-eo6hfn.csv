It helps you understand and gives you scripts to help open up lines of communication and gives you a whole list of unhelpful behaviors that a lot of caretakers fall into.,False,False

I didn't go into specifics about treatment options because I'm not from the UK, but hopefully someone else can answer that part.",False,False
