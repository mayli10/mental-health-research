The other commenter pointed out their high BMI's as a reason to let it slide, but tbh, people usually don't get to extreme obesity (not saying everyone there is obese) like that without having some kind of unhealthy relationship with food. I suppose it's possible if you're really just eating an extra 100 Calories a day for life or whatever, but that isn't the story for quite a few of those people. And then, sometimes, they gain everything back from overeating/past overeating behaviors.  Of course, I wouldn't claim that I'm talking about the majority of people there, but the type of people I just described here are definitely prevalent over there..and no one talks about it.",False,False

So, come 7 o'clock, which is the usual time for my &lt;400 Calorie OMAD, and I finally convince myself that I today I was allowed to have that one bowl of soup, after debating about it and having it linger in my mind for a couple hours. It was hard, but I was oh so looking forward to the veggies in that soup. I felt pleased at showing myself some self-care for once.  So I go to the kitchen, get my bowl, look in the pot, and it wasn't fucking done. There was only chicken and water/broth. There were no vegetables. In shock and disappointment, I vaguely recalled my mom mentioning something about the ""vegetables"" and ""not having enough time during her lunch break because she had to help my sister after she fell for an online scam"". Though, it's 7 hours later, and I guess she never came home from work (which is disgusting because the pot of chicken has been sitting in room temp for all that time, and my family is supposed to eat from that for days).  I shut the lid to the pot, put my empty bowl back in the cabinet, walked back to my room, and couldn't help but cry.   Don't get me wrong. I'm not some spoiled bitch crying about her mommy not making her food; for 3.5 years, my ED did not allow me to eat food made by anyone but myself. No, I cried because it took me hours to allow myself *that* specific food. I didn't work for allowing myself a chicken leg and some other raw veggies I whip up really fast. I worked for chicken and veggie soup. I wanted the grey squash in there. I love grey squash.  Hell, if she told me, I could have finished making the soup myself! Of course, she doesn't have an obligation to..it's just..ugh..my fucking ED. Nothing is safe anymore, and unless I convince myself that something else can be safe within the next hour, it looks like I'm going to be fasting again today.  Also, my lower esophagus really burns today for some reason. I don't usually manifest acid reflex that way, but I have no other explanation for it.  God..I wish I knew I was going to fast from the beginning..because preparing myself mentally for dinner and then not having it literally last second made me hungry :( I'm usually never hungry, so wtf",False,False
