Then I catch the lie b/c many heavier or unattractive people have X.  Then I realize my personality also holding me back, but I‚Äôve find that far more impossible to change despite therapy, so I go back to denial &amp; focusing on appearance... good times.",False,False

I‚Äôd be happier if I wasn‚Äôt fat.   I‚Äôd work longer hours (instead of going home early because I don‚Äôt want people to see me) and make more money if I wasn‚Äôt fat.   I‚Äôd be more motivated to do *anything* if I wasn‚Äôt fat. ,False,False

Grades are bad? Well if I had more discipline I wouldn't be fat, which means I'd have also the discipline to study.   Crush rejected me for a reason completed unrelated to my appearance? I'm fat and unpleasant to the eyes.  I'm stressed? If I wasn't fat I wouldn't be stressed. At the very least it means I probably have my crap together in other aspects of my life. ",False,False

Like, I deserved to get bullied for being fat.  Why did I get bullied?  Certainly not because tweens like picking on new kids who don't fit their norm.  I had the bullying coming, by not having a flat stomach.  ",False,False
