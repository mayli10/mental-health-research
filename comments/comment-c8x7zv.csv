Now that I'm thinking about it: it's brought up regularly. Sexually speaking, a lot of people with ED are frustrated. But I never thought about the view from someone on the opposite end--in this case, straight guys--reading these stories (mostly because I don't relate to them at all since I don't h4v3 s3x).  What's worse is that sometimes I will see ""healthy"" online boards, but even on them it can be toxic since the masculine lean and muscly figure is revered (and I don't look like that at all); it's even common to see some comments jeering at their former skinny bodies, poking fun at masculinity and reducing males to muscles. The female perspective isn't any better, but it's related to curves with proportion.  A tip for shows or other content that may trigger you: focus on some thing in the product which you can *analyse* restlessly, like quality of dialogue, direction, outfits, camera. Sometimes I have to take breaks when watching TV shows because it becomes unbearable, too unreal, even fake when the product is subpar. That takes my mind off what might trigger me (but shows aren't my trigger, so I don't know how it could happen to you).",False,True

Somewhat hesitant to share mine here but for the other guys lurking here I will.  Posts that casually mention sexual  things like “deepthroating my bf triggers my gag reflex and reminds me of purging” fuck me up *bad*.  The envy and self-hatred I feel when reading posts about recent sexual experiences with guys by female users on here, around my age especially (early 20s), is unbearable. I immediately think, “sigh, he must be so hot” while I’m just a fat and ugly loser who’ll never be attractive enough to get that level of affection from a girl. I also can’t help but notice how so many female users here are either in relationships or are having hookups despite their body image issues/ED. As an single guy it just makes me feel like even more of a minority and even more alone here.  Also, the recent posts about Natalia Dyer aka Nancy from Stranger Things...it’s funny, because that show is just as big a trigger for me too. Steve...needs no explanation. Obviously cute as fuck, awesome hair...every girl I know irl adores him. Billy? His hair, his body...seeing the women at the pool drooling over him in the trailer...ouch. That’ll never be me... And Charlie Heaton (Jonathan Byers)? His slender frame, his cheekbones...plus he’s *literally* dating Natalia Dyer irl. God, to be him for a day...sigh.",False,False

On the validity of having an ED: one of the worst things because it would prompt me to be even more disordered so I could ""fit"" the descriptions.
