I swear it was 1 pound for 1 bowl. You can remove it from your diet or switch to a more protein heavy, healthier cereal like Magic Spoon cereal.

When I used to stress eat I always went for cereal after getting back from work around midnight and it was the main thing that contributed to my unhealthy weight gain. I recommend tossing out the cereal and have oats or something similar in the morning and like the other poster said eat earlier.,False,False

If I want something like cereal for breakfasts, the closest I can have is weetabix, so I just don't buy anything else. The second I pick up any other cereal off the shelf it's over.",False,False
