What helped was actually going to this fancy café that does bean flights (multiple different beans brewed the same way) and brew flights (the same beans brewed different ways). It helped me both appreciate coffee and figure out what I like in coffee and what I don't, but I wouldn't recommend doing this until you at least like coffee with 1 milk 1 sugar when you want to finally switch to black. For example beans will usually have ""notes"" described at places like this and I find I like a ""chocolate/cinnamon/malty"" kind of flavour profile more than a ""fruity/berry"" one.",False,False

Had a friend who did, she was the one who got me to really like it, though, with a bit of honey in a French roast. This eventually got me to trying espresso and espresso drinks. If you want something stronger, try an Americana. It's espresso with water. However, I would start with cold brew coffee because it's less acidic and naturally kind of chocolaty.",False,False

In my teens I was adamant that I would never be a coffee drinker because I hated it. Even with sugar or milk/cream it still tasted like coffee and I hated it. Eventually when the ED stuff got a bit more intense in my late teens and I started uni I just started drinking it black - since I hated it with sugar anyway, why bother adding extra calories and crap? I started seeing my husband around that time and he drank black coffee too and we went out for coffee a lot to talk or read and over time I really just learned to love it.",False,False

I switched to a little bit of almond milk and then transitioned to black - I think it took around a month and a half before I felt like I enjoyed it lol",False,False

No promises about how long it will take though. Get good quality coffee and you will learn to at least appreciate the different notes and flavors. The one that finally got me was casa cielo from Starbucks. It’s a dessert coffee, so it tastes a little like chocolate.",False,False
