My asshole brother was talking about how I look like a guy who just got out of rehab, saying how I don't like to eat most foods. Everyone laugh and I never felt so awful in my life, am I a clown to his friends or something? How can people be so mean.

Speaking as a 19 year old student with roommates, we had the same situation. My roommates had stuff about one roommate that upset her. She actually came into my room sobbing and I felt awful. I told her nobody hated her and had us all talk it out. If you dont think you can talk to them about this as in saying, ‚ÄúI heard you guys the other night and it really upset me. I want you guys to know I feel like you‚Äôre some of my close friends and thats why I dont understand where your words came from. I‚Äôd like to address these feelings so we can continue to grow in our friendships and remain civil in the house‚Äù kinda thing ~~ then they probably arent people you should live with. remember they dont know you, they dont walk in your shoes. it honestly sounds a lil jealously based if theyre attacking your diet and clothes",False,False

Roommates can be so clique-y and catty especially if they're young. I was the odd one out in all my dorm situations so I know firsthand how much it hurts to know people are gossiping about you behind your back. Especially because my eating habits were super sketchy too. Are you living on campus? Maybe you can contact your RA and tell them you're uncomfortable. You might get to switch to a new dorm. I had to do that twice. Don't let it get worse if you can help it. Because of my roommates I dropped out.,False,False
