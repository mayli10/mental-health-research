I have to take food science classes where we taste things, and my plan is to lie and say I have IBS or something to get out of taste testing segments.",False,False

I would always enourage anyone to follow their passions and their heart, but also do what's best for you mentally, even if that means staying away from unknown calories for a while. I know that talking to the ED part of your brain is hard, but if you feel like you have a love and passion for something, you should at least try it out? Either way, if you do or do not, we're all here to support you ",False,True

Just like you, I love cooking food for others and have been considering going to culinary school for the past year (lmao even opened a food blog because ofc I did). But I'm so conflicted - on one hand, I'm growing more and more convinced that cooking isn't an actual passion of mine but something that my ed has made me obsessed with and I would hate to drop my major (which I loved pre-ed) for something that may actually mean nothing to me. Also there's the small detail that you're supposed to taste whatever you make at cooking school which means unknown calories. Plus meals (lunch specifically) is apparently included as part of your tuition in most culinary schools and hahahah just no",False,False
