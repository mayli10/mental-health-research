I think that some people become vegan because they are particularly sensitive to the suffering of others.  A person can't just stop those feelings, so it's important to honour that.    There are cases where eating a vegan diet is not a pragmatic option, like if you are facing issues of malnutrition, or have certain GI tract conditions, for example.  In those cases it's still possible to eat a diet that is ethical, environmentally responsible, and does not cause undue suffering, with some forethought and leg work.    It has been my own experience that there are few resources for people in this position; they tend to face derision from both vegan and omnivorous sources.  This can make it very difficult and intimidating to live a life that is harmonious with your values without being detrimental to your health.

It's not evil to be an animal that eats other animals; it's morally neutral.  Then, I would suggest doing some research on how to source ethically responsible animal products.  Eggs would be a good place to start: there are lots of humanely-run, visitable (if desired) small farms that have chickens living in good living conditions.  Another place you might choose to start is shellfish, particularly mussels and oysters.  Bivalves do not have hardware or response consistent with the ability to feel pain. Because they have no brain, or central processing unit for stimuli, there is no 'there', there, and they are not capable of suffering.  Additionally, even farmed shellfish are environmentally sustainable: farming bivalves involves little more than installing wooden posts in their natural habitat and then harvesting them from the posts.  I hope that this helps.
