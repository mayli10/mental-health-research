Low/imbalanced electrolytes are one of the big killers of ppl with EDs. I actually ended up in the hospital from it and what‚Äôs scary is I didn‚Äôt have ANY symptoms or like warning signs beforehand and my levels were super low. and I would never had known either if I hadn‚Äôt been getting my blood drawn for an unrelated reason and it had come up in my blood work so that‚Äôs scary. üò¨,False,False

Calcium is also an electrolyte I think. They play a role in an array of functions in the body - fluid regulation, cardiac function, nerve function, etc. The sodium-potassium pump is part of how cells get energy iirc, but that‚Äôs as far as my HS bio takes me.   The takeaway is that electrolytes (in their proper amounts) are *absolutely essential* for the body to function properly. Get much of an imbalance going and you‚Äôre going to feel super crappy - feeling dizzy and nauseous is common, potentially muscle cramps and even heart palpitations. Imbalance can become severe enough to require hospitalization.   For most people in the modern world, electrolytes aren‚Äôt something they need to worry about overmuch. But when restricting and/or purging and/or significant exercise are in play, it‚Äôs much easier for an imbalance to occur.",False,False

I drink a couple liters a day and consume about 3x the WHO‚Äôs Standards of sodium. I feel better than when I restricted salt and Emmy electrolytes,False,False

I get enough potassium and magnesium from food so I‚Äôm okay on those,False,False
