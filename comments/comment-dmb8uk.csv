Because I’m to the point now where I know something is wrong I just don’t know who to go to or what to do. This is my first time talking about this ever so it’s hard for me to find the right words to describe what I feel and what’s going on btw. And this has been going on for probably over a year,False,False

I can’t eat very much I usually eat till it hurts or eat even less so it doesn’t hurt. I honestly thought that I wrote this post somehow because it’s exactly what I feel. I haven’t been to the doctors or anything or talked to my parents or friends or anyone seriously about having an eating disorder even though people closest to me suspect it. I’m scared to talk to anyone about it so this is my first day on this community. It’s hard to find anyone going through the same things I am,False,False
