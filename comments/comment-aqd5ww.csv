Honestly I would rather eat one bite of good ice cream. Too bad they done sell single spoonfuls of ben and Jerry's. ,False,False

Wtf. I dunno who to believe either. Yah. Halo top is too sweet in my opinion. I will buy it only if I basically wanna binge eat a whole thing of ice cream. It's never worth it. And I usually don't even eat the whole thing and end up throwing it away. ,False,False
