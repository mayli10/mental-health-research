I can only keep it up for a short time before my thin facade reveals what a terribly awkward and boring person I am.

When I was growing up people always remarked and complimented me on being ‚Äúmature for my age‚Äù and I definitely had to be the adult in my house because my parents sure as hell weren‚Äôt.

I constantly ask my boss for permission for things I should just be doing, or look to her for how to react/behave in certain situations. And when shit happens, my immediate reaction is that I need to find a real grown-up (I‚Äôm 31...).
