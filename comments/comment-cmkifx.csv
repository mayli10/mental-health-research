Only now reading the other posts I don't know should I post anything.   I am male 35 from Ireland. In my previous posts I have written about my issues with my weight. Basically I have dealt with EDs since I was 14. In my late twenties my EDs affected my day to day life. My weight became too low and I was unable to explain my appearance away or normalize it. It had become noticeable I was becoming dangerously thin.   The way I am coming at this is from the social context of the culture I exist in and was raised in, in my home town of Ireland Dublin.   Validation for me personally was sought from both women and men. In Ireland theirs a strong obligation to belong or identify and conform to your peers. Living on a small island with a small population you find groups can largely vary with a lot of different group participants (sexual orientation, age, social standing etc.) Though one group dynamic always exist. A judgmental, critical &amp; negative response to each other. I can say with hindsight it is probably what accelerated and contributed to my anorexia and the subsequent things I lost in the fire.    Naturally as a child I was extroverted and I always projected a class clown personality. In reality I was scared confused child and later teenager. I hated eating around people because of the comments they would make around my food choices. I have always had a lot of food hang ups. To this day I still prefer to eat alone.  At 17 I became incredibly conscious of how people perceived me. I was 18 stone and I was an average student with no plans of attending college but as I mentioned in a previous post this all changed at this point of my life. I started to exercise more. I pushed myself on the treadmill and in the pool. I was diagnosed with dyslexia which resulted in the opportunity to study engineering at college.   For the first time in my life my friends, family and peers started to provide and shower me with positive reinforcement. Instead of just the usual fake platitudes. Naturally as I continued to lose weight. I would receive more attention and compliments. I was happy. I had met someone, graduated with a degree &amp; was working in a prestigious company. I was finding all the validation I had sought through education, employment and most importantly my weight.   As I mentioned above my weight and behavior reached the point where I couldn‚Äôt explain it away ‚Äúas a long hard week in the office or the gym.‚Äù Colleagues, friends and family were starting to discuss my behavior and my weight .My eating habits and exercise regime brought our relationship to an end and to this day I still think I lost the only person I only ever loved.  I left my prestigious job for another company. One where the comments on my weight weren‚Äôt as frequent. I had become isolated and withdrawn. I didn‚Äôt progress my education. I lost most of my muscle mass and damaged my left knee from crazy exercise regimes. At my lowest I was 8 stone 10 pounds.   The desire for social Validation got me to this point but a fear of breaking with my routines held me there. If you asked me was I happy? I would have said no but I was ticking all the boxes and people were either envious or jealous in one form or another. I never smiled during that period of my life and I was horrible to be around and always so cold so constantly cold. Looking back I know it was toxic and damaging behavior but I still from time to time engage in it for that precious social acceptance.   Sorry about the length of the post hope it helps.",False,False
