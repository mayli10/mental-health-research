Without the people here posting about how awful purging is, I truly believe I wouldâ€™ve started, or at least tried, a long time ago. I already have some concerns about my heart and my teeth, and an addictive personality, so these posts really resonate with me. Every time I consider trying I remember people here begging me not to, and I donâ€™t.   So if youâ€™ve posted about it before, thank you. Youâ€™ve stopped at least one person. ðŸ’–",False,False

Continued multiple times a day for a decade with a week or two breaks here and there. This summer I stopped for 6 weeks and was so proud!! Slipped and have been struggling ever since. Itâ€™s so hard, Iâ€™m promising myself to start over tomorrow and get this under control. Donâ€™t ever start purging, it is something that will haunt you for life.",False,False

Purging landed me on a cardiac ward with an NG tube and total bed rest when I weighed over 100kg... everyone always talks about my anorexia nearly killing me time and time again over the past decade, but I know itâ€™s not the restriction or even the low weights/rapid losses that nearly ended me.
