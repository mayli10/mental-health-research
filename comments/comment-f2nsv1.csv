You've done amazing to make it this far. You could take this as a way to see what went wrong and how to avoid it in the future? Do not downplay your hard work and dedication by saying the years are wasted. Like I can do 6 months without lax and then I'll have a blip but as long as I get back to avoiding them asap it's not a waste. The time between the blips will get longer.,False,False
