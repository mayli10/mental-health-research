I know it‚Äôs normal for kids to go through picky eating phases, but there‚Äôs only a couple of foods she‚Äôll eat. She went three nights in a row without eating dinner. I try to make the effort to eat around her, since I usually save my OMAD for dinner. I‚Äôm just hoping it‚Äôs a phase and it doesn‚Äôt continue, because she‚Äôs already small for her age.

I always waited until the kids when to bed to exercise in front of the TV, but one time when I went upstairs to check on the kids I found her doing sit ups. When I asked what she was doing she said that she wanted to be strong like me and saw me exercising so she did it too. I don't think she realized my motivation for exercise wasn't to be strong so that's a good thing, but it scared the crap out of me and really made me realize that kids are literally sponges. After that I was always sure to eat in front of them and waited until I saw that they were actually asleep to exercise",False,False

But hers went on to BN and she was trapped in it for many years. She seems to be in her first recovery after 15-20 years. I have my own kids, teens and preteens. I don‚Äôt have to disguise my habits much because I do eat normally (conditioned myself to be satisfied at high restrict maybe, idk) but I‚Äôm not sure they‚Äôve picked up on how small my portions are compared to theirs. Once I started weight restoring last year I made a point of clearing my plate sometimes (my default would always be leave at least a third of it). They make comments all the time though, they‚Äôve told me I ‚Äúlook anorexic‚Äù and ‚Äúlike a skeleton‚Äù (even after weight restoring üòû) this concerns me but it also gives me the perspective against my BDD so that I know I need to keep gaining. I want to be a good role model, and aside from occasional really bad days this is enough motivation for me to keep restoring",False,False

When I refuse to eat something like dessert, a lot of people in my family or my friends will decline it too. I feel really bad every time that happens though.",False,False
