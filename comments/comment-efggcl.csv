For myself, I can't know for sure because I have a bad ""grass is always greener"" mentality but I've always thought so. Everyone in my family somehow has weight distribution where we store almost all weight in our stomach but still have extremely small boobs, which I feel looks awful and unfeminine. I feel envious when I see people complain about being pears or even apples who at least get big boobs along with the belly. If I had a more normal fat distribution, I think maybe I wouldn't be like this, but with how it is I feel like I have to be significantly underweight to look decent.",False,False
