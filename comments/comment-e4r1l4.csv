Like somehow, she felt like your progress was a reflection on her own child, and out of a weird defensiveness/protectiveness, she felt the need to put you down in an attempt to make her child look (and feel?) better.  From your roommate's response it seems like maybe this was unusual of her mother to do so maybe it's just... irrationality. Bc like everyone else here is saying there is NO WAY she sincerely thought you looked bigger than before :| time for me to eat her",False,False

Maybe her crash dieting doesn't work or she keeps fucking up her diets by scarfing down packaged desserts at 2 am while watching her shit TV shows or scrolling on FB talking shit about other women she went to school with. Or maybe you remind her of what she used to be and it hurts her. Orrrrr maybe she wants her kid to lose weight and is upset that you did so she wants to bring you down.   Next time you see her you should say, ""oh my gosh your hair. Did you dye it? I didn't think so theres so much more grey."" Or bring up her wrinkles.",False,False

The other was short and a bit curvy.  The short one's weight did not change at all.  But my taller sister lost weight.  I have this aunt who's REALLY overweight, and has been struggling losing weight and is known to lie about her weight a lot, she says shes 150 lbs, but shes so clearly like 250 lbs.  She said the taller one gained weight and the shorter one lost weight only because she felt jealous of my older sister since everyone was complimenting her weight loss.  Nobody says that unless they know it's ok, it so clearly stems from her own insecurities.",False,False
