If you canâ€™t handle the realities of this disorder, which OBVIOUSLY includes a fear of fatness, then what are you even doing here.",False,False

And yes I agree, this sub shouldnâ€™t just be browsed willy nilly, just because itâ€™s an ED sub so itâ€™s definitely going to contain triggers.   Also I love the phrase willy nilly I havenâ€™t used it in forever thank you for reminding me of it!! ðŸ’•",False,True

My brain is foggy, oof.   I definitely agree, if someone is that vulnerable to triggering speech (even speech directed inward with intrusive thoughts) this is not a wise place to  browse willy nilly.

You do not have to feel guilty for feeling fat, I hope you donâ€™t still feel guilty for that. Itâ€™s like, you already feel fat, which sucks, and then now you feel bad for feeling that way too. When does it end!!!  Yes! This is your space, and itâ€™s our space. TWs are there for a reason, and if someone doesnâ€™t like something that is still within the rules, they can say so politely, or they can keep scrolling imo. I just donâ€™t know any other community as positive as this one, and Iâ€™d much rather be here with all your supportive people than somewhere more toxic, like ED Twitter, you know? Obviously if someone said something like youâ€™d find on fatlogic or FPH thatâ€™s a huge no but tbh I havenâ€™t seen anything like that on here.  Yes yes yes to your last point. Not all of us have the same EDs, and we wonâ€™t always be able to relate to each other. But I think weâ€™ve done a good job at co-existing and supporting each other, just like you said. Thank you so much for your thoughtful response ðŸ’•",False,True

Iâ€™m 100% okay with the rules, I totally get why theyâ€™re in place and why we need to abide by them. Maybe I wasnâ€™t super clear, this post was in response to a couple of posts Iâ€™ve seen recently, especially the one from yesterday where someone was really upset and basically said people were fat shaming etc when other posters shared their intrusive thoughts. My point is that the rules are in place and we abide by them, and posts that are offensive get taken down by the mods. Since we are following the rules, and this is an ED sub, coming into this space requires some personal responsibility to know what triggers you, and not to come for someone who was already following the rules.  Hope that was more clear!",False,True

I think most mods would understand why you want to post those things. However we unfortunately have to keep content here limited to what will not get us booted again due to reddit admins finding it distasteful,False,False

I've had body image and eating issues since around the age of 10 years old. I've always been on the smaller end of the healthy BMI spectrum aside from the times I've been underweight. I so very vividly remember my mother chastising me as a pre-teen when I said that I ""felt fat"", because that might make people who actually are fat feel bad. Since then, I've felt so guilty for feeling fat. But, fuck it - that's honestly how I feel most of the time!     I simply can't imagine existing in a larger body and being able to have any sort of happiness, but I don't view anyone else that way and I know that being overweight doesn't have to lead to unhappiness... for other people. I only have one friend IRL in the world I can express these sorts of things to, but he constantly tells me I need therapy and I'm tired of hearing it, so this is my space. It's our space.     It's tough because EDs are all so very different and all of our bodies are so very different. Sometimes those with AN can't relate to those with BN and sometimes those with BED can't relate to those with AN or BN etc. But I like that we usually find a way to coexist and support each other here.",False,False
