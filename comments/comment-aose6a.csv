I hope I don‚Äôt ever get to that point, that sounds awful. And the smell of sweets doesn‚Äôt do much for me to suppress that either, UNLESS it‚Äôs something intense, like milk chocolate. If someone is eating a chocolate bar near me and I smell that, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm stuck in a bubble of chocolate and I feel stuffed as hell for a while. Like it just smells...thick? You know? Idk. I smell the milk chocolate, so I imagine it as thick and creamy and filling, thus I feel full without eating it. Just like with the banana lol. But so far it‚Äôs just with select foods, and just foods I‚Äôm more than able to turn down or resist. Bread is one I don‚Äôt think I could ever refuse lmao",False,True

I have noticed that bread ALWAYS smells better than it tastes though. But I haven't been able to get that satisfaction from other food (especially sweets), it just makes me hungry and shaky.",False,False

I never really noticed it, like releasing tension from watching my little food stuff on YouTube or reading recipes but you‚Äôre 100% correct",False,True

I love bananas too, but I can resist those. Bread, I‚Äôm not sure about lol. I‚Äôll try it soon üòÇ Just smell a loaf of bread without having it omg. It‚Äôll be the hardest thing I‚Äôll ever do if I succeed  And same for me, if I watch anything like that I need to either have eaten or eat at the same time, but what‚Äôs working best for me rn to feel the most full with little food is to eat while I‚Äôm watching something not at all related to food, and something that‚Äôs kinda long and drawn out, like something on Netflix or a long YouTube video or something, so I can stretch my food to last the whole hour or whatever. It‚Äôs a lot more filling that way for me instead of just scarfing it down because I‚Äôm so hungry lol",False,True

I somehow really like smelling bread ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  And yeah stuff like mukbangs and food porn just make it worse, unless i can be eating WHILE watching. Some people use mukbangs as a way to satisfy cravings and i dont get it. I do enjoy watching that stuff but i have to be eating something at least semi fulfilling. ",False,False
