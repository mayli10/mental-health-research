It was scary because I lied and told them I weighed more than I actually did, so I was worried they might end up giving me too much anaesthetic. I was too scared to tell them my real weight because of my parents.  2. I don’t think so.  3. No.  4. Not very long. I followed their instructions exactly as far as what to avoid and how long before having solid foods again, etc. I had no complications and no pain. I did take painkillers but not as much as I could have and didn’t have any problems. I think it was about a week before I was allowed to have solids but I eased myself into it because I was paranoid (pasta, salad, beans, etc, I avoided anything super hard or crunchy for another week or so to be safe.)",False,False

I wasn't put under for the one I got pulled and I do not intend to be put under for the ones I am having cut out in a few months. My dentist told me it was entirely unnecessary and they only do it for the comfort of the patient.     2 and 3 are both a big no from me.     4. Maybe like a week? I only did liquid foods for like two or three days.      It's not nearly as bad as people say, at least just getting them pulled. I'm sure getting them cut out will be worse.",False,False

Once the IV part was over, anesthesia was actually kind of nice. I kind of suddenly woke up and snapped out of the “high” very quick it was weird.  2. Possibly a bit- pain meds and antibiotics made me nauseated but I also didn’t exercise much while I was healing.  3. No change in my face (I mean it was only one of the teeth)  4. Full recovery took about a week or so. again, only one tooth.   The oral surgeons do tons of these operations and thousands of people have them out all of the time. You’re gonna be fine!",False,False

The needle went in my arm, then in a minute I felt drowsy, and then I closed my eyes and went to sleep. I woke up after it immediately and fully functional. For me, it was like a power nap. 2. I didn't lose weight. I gained because I could binge on ice cream and cheesecake lmao. I was supposed to fast but I guess my appetite is the strongest thing about me. fml 3. Face is the same. 4. Recovery was pretty short for me. Like 1-2 weeks before stitches fell out and I could start binging again.   good luck and try not to worry too much!",False,False

I was scared of the needle but after that I don’t remember anything, just waking up in a really comfortable armchair. I was a little out of it for maybe 5-10 minutes, all I did was try to make a joke about getting my arm waxed where I had a bandaid over where the needle was, then I walked out to the car fine. I was kinda tired the rest of the day though. I’ll note I didn’t take any of the opiates they gave me, just the ibuprofens since the pain wasn’t that bad.   2. I have no idea, I didn’t measure - probably, because I only ate soup and halo top for a day but after that my body was crying for a vegetable so I went back to my usual diet lol.   3. No, I got all 4 of mine out and my face didn’t change.  4. Probably about 4-7 days before the pain really went away, longer for everything to fully heal. I think they ended up telling me 3-4 days with no exercise because they knew I wasn’t going to listen if they told me longer (I ride horses and was on reading week... I wasn’t going to throw my whole week away lol!)",False,False

Going under anesthesia wasn't scary, I had been under before, it was the coming out of it that was scary for me. I forgot where i was and what was going on and remember crying to my mom about it. But got over it pretty quick and wasn't too loopy after that. 2. Not that I remember 3. No not really 4. I had dry sockets after the removal, which hurt and slowed down recovery quite a bit...  Idk how common it is though, none of my friends had the same problem as me.   Good luck ❤❤❤",False,False

I lost weight but that was intentional; I imagine you’d lose a bit just by not eating solid foods but I restricted heavy after my surgery because I knew I could get away with it. My recovery time was quick, too, I only had to wait like one day before I could eat solid foods again, and two days before eating stuff like chips. Just be sure to clean your gum holes regularly, avoid straws, etc and you’ll be fine. (Idk about the face thing... I didn’t see a difference in mine and I had five teeth removed. I guess it could be different for everyone.)",False,False

After hearing others wisdom teeth removal experience with local anesthesia I'm definitely glad that I chose general and went to sleep. I had a trusted family member pick me up after, who also picked up my prescription and I hardly remember being loopy or even coming home.   2. I wasnt really hungry during my recovery so yes I lost weight. The medication I was taking also would knock me out for hours at a time. When I did eat it I remember it was mostly applesauce, sugarfree pudding, oatmeal, some risotto my mom made and I also went out and had a milkshake (ate with a spoon) to have something cool.   3. My face didnt get skinnier. The only dental work that changed my face and profile was having my teeth straightened from braces.   4. Recovery took 4-5 days, I stopped using the post surgery medication after 3 days. I had all 4 removed, all of them were impacted and under the gum. Stopped having to use cotton swabs on the wound after 2 days. I had my last checkup a week after the surgery and the wound was mostly healed by then. Doctor told me that my stitches would fully dissolve in a few weeks. I started eating normal, chewable foods a week after the checkup.   Remember not to drink through a straw, stick to soft foods and follow the post surgery care plan. Get lots of rest. You do not want to develop Dry Socket, it'll make everything so much worse.",False,False

I think so, but it was mostly because the antibiotic made me sick  3.) I don't think so  4.) The pain only lasted a few days. Couldn't really chew for 1.5 weeks though and eating only soft foods gets boring after awhile. I found the gauze they put in your mouth after the surgery (to soak up the blood) super uncomfortable. What actually helped the bleeding (and this might sound weird) was slightly damp tea bags (black tea). They're softer than the gauze so less pressure on the sockets, and the tannins in the black tea help close the capillaries and slow/stop the bleeding.  Good luck!",False,False
