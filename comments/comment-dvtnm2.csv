I am literally going into conservation biology (crosses fingers that things will work out) and it drives me crazy when people are like, ‚ÄúSo you like straws huh, so you fucking hate the environment then?‚Äù Excuse me but did you drive here today? Are you wearing sneakers made of plastic? Was your shower warm this morning? Just, some people are really quick (in my school anyway) to think it‚Äôs so evil to like straws, to enjoy the thermostat above 68, etc. I was nervous to post this thing because I don‚Äôt want people thinking I‚Äôm just a huge paper waster advocate or something.   The state of our environment is drastic yes, but I think when people get really on your back about how you‚Äôre not perfectly reducing your footprint it just makes people resent conservation. I think the goal should be to find comfortable alternatives to our sloppier human ways of life and to hold larger corporations accountable first. This is most sustainable. Biodegradable straws are an excellent strategy I think, or not putting straws on the table but letting customers ask instead so they don‚Äôt just mindlessly consume it.     I once saw our Uni janitor throw the recycling in with the garbage anyway. :/ I‚Äôm all for the environment I just think we need to balance the lifestyle people are used to with that transition because I mean, if I am slightly annoyed by some change I know there are people out there who don‚Äôt care about the environment at all and do tenfold more. I hope this doesn‚Äôt sound entitled, I know that the school can do whatever they want but it does feel ironic that we don‚Äôt get the straws but get the lids like you said, or worse they are always idling the campus busses and stuff.   But your school should totally look into those biodegradable straws they don‚Äôt effect the taste at all!   Also I love Zero products so much more than just the diet ones too!",False,True

I‚Äôm all for reducing waste for the environment but not to be that impractical.  Okay, this is a tangent but my Uni has also gotten rid of plastic straws. GREAT, I actually 100% support this, but can you provide a fucking alternative please???? Besides $4 straws? Cuz it‚Äôs hard to walk up 8 flights of stairs with no lid on my Coke Zero.
