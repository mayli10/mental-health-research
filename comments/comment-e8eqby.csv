The whole thing is kinda sketch and I hear it's run by a girl and her creepy ED-fetishizing boyfriend but I don't know for sure. Overall I was in a very deeply disordered place when I applied and I hope I never do it again bc even to my fucked-up ana brain it seemed kinda creepy,False,False

Kinda invalidating but I'm a little glad now bc I know I would have used its toxicity to trigger myself to hell and now I can't visit it bc it just reminds me that I wasn't skinny enough for them,False,False
