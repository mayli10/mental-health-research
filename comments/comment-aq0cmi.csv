These aren’t magical metabolic outliers but these are people who are ‘naturally thin’ for any combination of the following reasons: - Small appetite - Natural preference for lower calorie food - Dietary restrictions/allergies - Active job/hobbies - Hyperactivity - Picky eating - Lack of interest in food ",False,False

I was tired of people saying shit like ""You're so lucky you're a guy and can eat whatever you want."" Like no. I torture myself constantly because looking at the mirror is like looking into a horrifying, undulating mound of boneless flesh.  It helps that I have kind of a dark sense of humor and no shame. I had a friend comment on my binge food haul while we were out together (she said something along the lines of 'I wish I could eat like that and stay thin'), and I straight up told her ""then throw up your food like I do."" Obviously I don't want her to actually try purging, but it was a good way to get my point across.",False,False

Of course I'm skinny because of obsessive calorie counting and compulsive exercise, but whenever I allow myself to ""overeat"" when I'm out to lunch/dinner (after having fasted for at least 24 hours before and planning to fast another 24 hours afterwards), it makes me feel good that my appearance seems ""effortless"" to others.
