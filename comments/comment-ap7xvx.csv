Just pie today or is someone on their way?”  *oof*  When  I go alone, I order pie.

I’ve never thought to put on a background video but I DO sometimes pretend I’m asking someone for clarification about their order. Eg:  Me: hi I’d like a chicken wrap, boom boom rice balls, and a small California pizza with a 2liter Diet Dr Pepper.   Restaurant: we only have Diet Coke is that ok?  Me: *panic mode* uuhhh... HEY HONEY, THEY ONLY HAVE DIET COKE .... yep. Thanks he says that’s fine. ",False,True

Me? i aaaalways do the same routine. put music on really loud, and then a Youtube Video on with people talking so it sounds like i have guests. It's pathetic. The height though is when sometimes as i get the food and place it on the table away from the guy's sight, i say ""hey put this on the table"" or something similar, as if I'm handing it to someone 😂 yup. Just me and my cat as well. ",False,False

Dude i stopped ordering from a particular restaurant because the delivery man was always the same and he started making comments on how often i ordered. Then one time mpre recently, during a BAD binge, i ordered from 2 different restaurants and... Well... The delivery guys arrived at the same time. I live alone in a small studio apartment but when i order it's enough for 10 people and this was 2 orders.... They asked if i was having a party i said yeah :))))) ",False,False
