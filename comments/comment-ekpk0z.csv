You have 2 common options that are available to Americans. 1) if you have a credit card that provides travellers insurance. You can travel to another country and get the health check-up and treatment you need. 2) try to get health check up from local community services. Sure it won't be specialized treatment you need. But it will be something  Really do hope you get better soon,False,False

There are Community Health Centers everywhere and they're hospitals that don't need insurance. You could also mention to them any financial trouble you may have. You do not want to fuck around with heart issues, it is one of the worst issues you could have. Your heart issues could be completely unrelated to purging. Please take care of yourself!",False,False

I went to a cardiologist last year and he said my heart was fine and I was definitely purging a lot. Idk wtf to do. I feel like I'll never get better. I also went to a ed treatment place outpatient and they were just like dont throw up because throat cancer and it will destroy your looks more than help. And eat only 1500 calories a day. They didnt help at all. How the hell does a person that's slightly close to overweight and also bulimic recover? I dont think it can happen for me.,False,True

I know itâ€™s scary to talk about this stuff with a medical professional but with heart problems, you donâ€™t wanna fuck around. Please please see someone about your heart concerns, itâ€™s better to be safe than sorry because these can kill you. I really hope youâ€™re okay and donâ€™t actually have heart issues. I have a minor phobia of heart problems, so Iâ€™ve spent waaay too much time looking up stuff about how EDs affect the heart ðŸ˜¬",False,False
