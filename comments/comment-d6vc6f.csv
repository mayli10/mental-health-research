I need more deep breaths in my life. I really wobble back and forth from eating normally (really no disordered eating) to pretty extreme disordered eating. It‚Äôs funny because like I would totally be okay with ordering a slice of pizza and eating it and not freaking out; but in my mind sometimes it‚Äôs like, I ...forget that. It seems so silly. I think your calm vibes worked, I really appreciate you.",False,False

Take away what may be helpful and leave the rest.)  Deep breath. You‚Äôre ok. There‚Äôs nothing wrong or shameful about wanting some pizza. It‚Äôs universally liked. If you think leaning into the craving is the right move, see if you can get a personal size or single slice. If you get more than you‚Äôd like to eat, have a bit and put the rest away. You may feel a compulsion to get more right away. I like to think of that as a knee-jerk response. You don‚Äôt have to say ‚Äúno‚Äù, just ‚Äúlater‚Äù. Give yourself 20-45 minutes to let that ‚Äòza settle and let that urgent feeling fade. If you want more after a while, then have some. Rinse and repeat.

I was at 780 something when I had my bloodwork done last, healthy male T tops out at something like 700 i believe. My dose was lowered but I'm really struggling to meet the calorie requirements to gain now, seems like last time on IM injections my appetite was much worse and I gained much easier.   My appetite has been increasing the past few days though, and I'm getting that same hangriness, so maybe it's coming for me again and I'll be talking in here about how I ballooned up again in 6 months, but right now I'm eating junk and fast food and still am unable to gain any significant amount of weight. I have a weight goal to hit and a self imposed soft deadline, but it's taken me 3 weeks already to gain 8 pounds and I've been stuck at the same weight all week while stuffing my face. What happened to the days of gaining 15 pounds in just a few weeks while trying to lose???   Also, my body reacts so much more to exercise now. I walk 10 miles a day and do heavy lifting for work twice a week and just that is bulking me up on muscle. Even when I was restricting bad, all my weight was in muscle and I was still getting more tone.",False,False
