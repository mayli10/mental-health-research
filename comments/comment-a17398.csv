Then you get thirsty and drink more liquids but you don't pee out that other water until your big intestine reabsorbs &amp; it gets rerouted to the bladder. This take up to 72 hours depending on your body!!! So don't sweat. Just ride it out and drink water to keep your system functioning at full capacity üòé (PS water is HEAVY and fat is super light, so keep that in mind with the weight gain to calorie intake ratio)",False,False

In order to have ACTUALLY gained that wait you'd have to have eaten 24,500 calories above maintenance. That's 44 Big Macs ON TOP OF maintenance. Somehow, I just don't believe you managed to eat that many Big Macs. üòâ  Breathe. You are doing fine. It's water. Drink some more, dilute your sodium, pee it out, and try again in the morning. You don't need to panic-binge. No punishment-restriction necessary. ",False,False

But I did gain three lbs overnight after trying to be a normal person. And eating close to 1300 cals  I definitely think it's water weight but that STILL PISSES ME OFF.
