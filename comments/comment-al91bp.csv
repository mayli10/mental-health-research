The running just somehow stimulates my digestive system or something? TMI?  Luckily the first time it was sub-zero so I was actually wearing pairs of leggings and it um, didn't manage to penetrate all the layers.  I now use these washable/re-usable environmentally friendly fabric pads that are designed for periods. But they also are wonderful for containing 'accidents'.  &amp;#x200B;  What a life I lead....   ....still I do enjoy the running.",False,False

I would always volunteer for the earliest shift (started at 5am) because I’m an unsociable hermit and the early morning swimmers don’t care if I’m friendly so long as I unlock the gates on time.   One morning, I woke up feeling incredibly constipated. I restricted but I wasn’t really aware that was an eating disorder yet. I took a bunch of generic Walmart laxatives and promptly forgot all about it.   Cut to 5:45am, I’m on the tower. It’s dark except for the flood lights and the only people in the pool are triathletes. The laxatives finally work. And they *work*.   I shit my bathing suit on the lifeguard tower. The problem here is that I’m not allowed to leave my tower without another lifeguard taking over. I had to whistle for them (the lifeguard office is too far away to yell, we could only communicate via whistle blows) to come out and relieve me. But first I had to ask them to bring me some bleach wipes because...reasons.   I basically pretended to be super particular about the cleanliness of the tower so they would bring me bleach wipes. Then I waited another 5 minutes, sitting in my own shit puddle, stomach cramping in rage, to summon them again to switch so I could “use the bathroom real fast”.   My suit was ruined. I finished out my shift nude under my uniform sweatshirt and sweatpants, hoping that it wouldn’t be the day a triathlete had a stroke in the pool. Luckily not, but I did have to act like I was super ditzy and “lost my suit” to get another one from my boss.   So yeah. Not quite the same, I know. But you are not alone in the “shit my pants even though I’m way too old for that to be a thing” club. Solidarity! ",False,False

But honestly? Hardcore relate. I know the absolute *shame* that won't release you, but you still push to do whatever you need just to feel a little bit more in control.  I hope the rest of the day was slightly better for you. Please take care and stay safe. Hugs!",False,False

I shit myself on the elliptical while I was a junior in high school. The YMCA was right across from the school so naturally at 4 pm on a Wednesday it was packed with my peers.   I was wearing short running shorts and had been going hard on the elliptical since I’d ran there after school. About two hours. I hadn’t had a real bowel movement in what seemed like my entire life. So it was basically a watery ass explosion that blasted the inside of my shorts and streamed down my legs.   So many people saw me have this accident.   I was in residential last spring with a girl who I went to high school with and hadn’t seen since graduation. She even remembered the time that ChaosSauces aggressively shat her pants at the gym.   I’m so sorry that this happened to you. I know the pain / shame / embarrassment that goes along with something like this.   Is it wrong of me that I wish your pants had been totally ruined so you actually had to stop working out? Because I think the saddest part is that you went back and kept working out despite ruining your parties. That’s the ED voice being manipulative AF. ,False,False
