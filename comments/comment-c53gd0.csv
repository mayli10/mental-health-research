I‚Äôve always had a problem with food and my body. I‚Äôve mentioned it on here before, but whenever people would comment on my weight as a child (5-6 years old), I‚Äôd start crying, even if the comment was positive.   I was sexually abused by a babysitter when I was around 4 for a period of time. My parents never found out.  I had a very unstable childhood overall. My parents had a messy divorce when I was six. My mom had primary custody, but we were extremely poor. Got evicted every month or two, all the apartments we lived in had huge rat/roach problems, etc. Oftentimes, my mom couldn‚Äôt afford to buy food.   My dad had a long string of different girlfriends and most of them were abusive. His first girlfriend after divorcing my mom used to enter the bathroom while I was bathing and touch me inappropriately. My dad married his current wife when I was 11, and she‚Äôs always been abusive toward me. She used to keep me locked up in rooms and stuff.   My weight was always a huge focus growing up. I kind of felt like that was all there was to me. People would constantly comment how I was ‚Äútoo skinny‚Äù and how I ‚Äúneeded to gain weight‚Äù. I was always known as the skinny girl.   I guess my eating disorder was a way to focus on something other than the problems in my life, and it was also kind of a cry for help. I wanted to look on the outside like how I felt on the inside, and it kind of seemed like my weight was the only thing people ever cared about (even then, not really. I got down to a BMI of 11-12 and my parents never said shit and never took me to a doctor). And, eating just felt wrong growing up when my mom could barely afford food.",False,False

My mom has always had a poor relationship with her body and used to be kind of jealous/admiring of how thin I was. people would always tell me I could be a model. I felt special. I started swapping packets of Italian dressings for a real lunch around this time.   Then when puberty hit all the attention shifted. I got wide hips and big breasts and suddenly rather than ""cute"" and ""thin"" I was ""curvy"" and ""voluminous"". Around this time my dad started switching his comments to ""moment on the lips, lifetime on the hips"" as I would eat junk food. For the first time I knew what tight clothes felt like. I could t just grab the smallest thing in the store and still have an overly roomy fit. This is when I started getting much, much worse.

Everyone knew she was sad and broken inside, but nobody knew exactly what it was. There was this mystery about her, she had these perfect proportions and people carrying her home when she fainted and she was so dainty. 40kg at 5'3 but had a D cup. I had to listen to boys tell me how ugly I was, but to tell her that they'd like to fuck her if she was up to it. I'm glad I got rid of her though, I tried to help her for years and only got shit for it.  - Parents would walk in on me while showering, I'd ask them to leave because I was mf-ing naked ""Haha, not like there's anything to see anyway!""  - When I didn't know what to eat, my family would say I'd develop an ED. Like, we didn't have my favourite cheese, so I lathered my bread in butter, salt &amp; pepper. That shit. Who didn't do that? Generally I wasn't allowed to go to doctors, etc. to take care of myself. I became accustomed to chronic pain and discomfort, so starving myself when I moved out didn't feel bad at all.  - Fights with my parents would always ensue at the dinner table. So I took eating upstairs. I binged everyday without purging, I spooned Nutella out of the jar, instant Ramen a bag of chips, a bar of chocolate, a bottle of Coke EVERY DAY. Eating became associated with escaping my dad.  - Having my body constantly compared to the other women in my family who were much heavier or had been through pregnancy. They think that if they compare my 24 inch waist to their 40 and call me fat, that makes them thinner. Or something. Well, it destroyed me.

I'm an outlier in being underweight other than my cousin who I think also probably has an ED. I love them all and they've given me a lot of support but I remember this fixation really soaking into me as a child. They can be cruel, even though none of them are particularly thin and many are overweight. Projection, I guess.  - Dad was a volatile alcoholic (who was also disparaging about others' weight). I remember his presence as menacing. I always felt like I had to brace myself emotionally for his outbursts. I've been diagnosed with bipolar I and I'm estranged from him now, don't know if he was ever diagnosed, but in retrospect it would make a lot of sense if he had it, too.  - A bunch of other diagnoses including OCD and panic disorder. OCD was a sledgehammer through my reality, I think I'd be dead if I hadn't been promptly diagnosed and treated (mine first emerged as invasive thoughts - knowing why they were happening was absolutely  key to me),:but I've read that it's a ""containment disorder"" much like AN - a way for a person to distance themselves from reality/emotion, to hem off anxiety, give it some kind of explicable form/constriction, which makes so much sense. I was diagnosed with depersonalisation/derealisation disorder when I was 14, and was engaging in SH from 11. I think my ED is another way for me to physically manifest a form of control and change, to concretise myself, because I so often feel unanchored in the world and within my own identity.
