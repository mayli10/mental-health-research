Then I get better and recover from it and realise that I never had one in the first place. So I tear down the support net I built for an ED that didn‚Äôt exist and convince everyone I‚Äôm fine, and then eventually when I realise that I‚Äôm still doing dangerous diets to escape my depression I make a new account since I made too many mistakes with the previous one, and then the cycle loops",False,False
