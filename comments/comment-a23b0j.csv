I understand it's easy to hype milestones like birthdays up in our heads, but realistically, they're not that much different from any other day. So it doesn't matter when or what day you get to where you want to be, just as long as you get there in the end. Hope you feel better ðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œ Love from a girl who is also going to be fatter than she wanted to be on her birthday next week",False,False

My birthday is soon and all I wanted was to lose the weight I gained from my binge streak to be cute for my 21st birthday pics:(. But I've told myself: what's the rush? There's always next year and it's not summer yet so the winter bod can live on ðŸ’• ,False,False

I wouldn't say you're a failure by any means but ik it can feel discouraging. But I hope you can find a tiny piece of cake or a nice candy bar or something for dinner, happy birthday ðŸ’›",False,False
