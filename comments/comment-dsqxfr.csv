Even at my LW I could only wear wide calf boots and it was the worst.   I've been researching possible plastic surgery options, which is so embarrassing to admit because I have having that level of insecurity that I would actually spend/go through so much.  But there's a couple ways to fix it. If your calves are just really muscular, some people have had success using botox injections to force the muscle to atrophy. This is pretty expensive since your calf muscles are so much bigger and need way more botox than your typical facial muscles. A DEXA scan could give you an idea of whether your calves bulkiness is from muscle or fat, if it's uncertain.  If your calves are mostly fatty (e.g. in my case) then liposuction is a pretty common route. I had originally imagined lipo to be way more surgically involved - I think since I heard Kanye's mom died from it that it must have been a lot of cutting and what not involved - but at least for your calves it's pretty low-key. Most people only need local anesthesia so the risk is smaller there too.   Procedures like cool sculpting did not seem like a good option, especially for calves, as that's an off-label treatment area and cool sculpting has very mixed success rates, despite being in the same price range as lipo.  Ideally I want to combine lipo for calves and use that to do a fat transfer &amp; breast lift (since I ended up with loose skin on my breasts of all places cry cry).  I spend way too much time on RealSelf.",False,False
