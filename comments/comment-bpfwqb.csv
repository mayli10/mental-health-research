Keeping things like this to yourself just compounds the stress. Being honest with the people around you makes everything a lot easier. I know how terrifying it can be when you're in a situation where it finally makes sense to mention what's been going on, but with practice it gets easier. I mean, my heart still races a little when I'm about to speak of things I would have kept private in the past, but I can say them so casually these days and it really does help me feel like I'm not alone in it. That even if people don't really understand they'll at least be aware so that if they ever notice anything unusual I don't have to worry about them figuring me out because I already told them exactly what's going on.",False,False

I can relate in that I had all of the tendencies and the mentality but I was doing okay from Jr. High up until a year and a half ago, at the age of 30. (I was diagnosed with atypical AN in my mid-20s).     Then I started a job in weight loss and they gave me a fancy scale of my very own. I KNEW better than to weigh myself, but I started doing it anyway. I lost 25lbs in a few months and ended up quite underweight. I had a wake-up call and stopped weighing myself... but I'm still not okay. My relationship with food has NEVER been this fucked before - I was fine for so many years!!!    And I'll tell you a secret. This is literally the first time I've shared this, even on this sub. I fucking goddamn started weighing myself again a month ago. I keep telling myself I'm okay with being at the lower end of normal BMI... but it's a slippery goddamn slope.     Sorry for replying to your ramble with a ramble of my own. I hope that you can find some mental peace and do some nice things to take care of your body. I know that's way easier said than done. &lt;3",False,False
