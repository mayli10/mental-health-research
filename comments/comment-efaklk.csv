Except I’m still in college for the high paying career you already have. And amongst all the things you listed above, being the first in my family to go t9 college, school feels like another vulnerable thing I could lose along with being thin/beautiful, and it feels like they’re waiting for the ball to drop. It’s a heavy burden to carry, but I don’t think it’s real. I do think I’ve almost entirely made it up, they may be a bit jealous/insecure, but I don’t think it’s nearly as intentional/spiteful as my head has made it up to be. I think it’s just me trying to justify my own disordered thoughts about remaining thin.",False,False
