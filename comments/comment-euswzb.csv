So you're likely in the clear for that if that's what you see.  I can't really help with the rest except  really encourage you to go see a doctor soon because that sounds absolutely terrible and possibly urgent. If you can I would also suggest having something small, easy to digest like a banana or chicken soup a few times a day rather than 1 or 2 ""big"" meals (compared to a single banana lmao) if that's what you're doing. But I'm no doctor so yknow, grain of salt.",False,False
