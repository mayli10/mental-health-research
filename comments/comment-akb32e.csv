Maybe there's a support group at a nearby hospital? Can you get books from a nearby library? (Decoding Anorexia ; Brain Over Binge --- both helped me a lot).   I am 31; I still have a mild ED. You're not too old - you're actually in the age group they most commonly happen.  I hope you don't try to kill yourself :-(   you deserve to live. ,False,False

Ok I dont think it was this account although it might have been, the thing with family and some ther personal matters I don't feel qualified/talking about in this public forum. I f you need anything at all PM ME, idk where this reddit format came into play, but much love and we're all still here",False,False

But I'm gonna be harsh with you for a minute because I think you need to hear it. It's not easy to grow up, and it's even harder to grow out of an eating disorder then fold, I'd lie to you out of ease but that isnt any use to you or me. You dont need to grow out of your disorder (although if you're given the ability I think you should try and work on it). But even if you dont grow out of it, I honestly think that offing yourself is the pussy way to deal with things, (you might not schedule that, but I think it's a good thing to hear anyways). Its awful, but atm you're living for other people. Your mom, your dad, your brother or sister, a pet, it doesnt matter. You may, or may not be, suicidal atm or the nearish future, but hey if you do have any rash thoughts please oh god dont act on them at least until you're out of hs. And before you do act, reach out to me or some of these nice other people here on reddit or somewhere else you feel safe. I promise the ship and rash thoughts arent worth it. Additionally: I'm here for a convo if you need it, day or night. ",False,False

I honestly spend my time just starving and purging and hating myself and I can't get help because my parents will guilt trip me. Thank you so much, but I can't get better. My eating disorder is the only thing I'm good at and it's like a friend to me. And I am 16 (17 in April) and I feel too old to have an ED or be suicidal. WHenever I tell anyone it's like ""Grow up, you're not twelve years old"". I'm glad you're in a better place.",False,True

If you knew me in real life you'd agree I was a selfish prick. I can't get help because my parents will guilt trip/shame me and that will make me actually kill myself. Also I'll get taken off my Ritalin. ,False,True

EDs are hard at any age but especially with younger people I think that they're infinitely worst. I stumbled into mine when I was 14 and I can guarantee you it was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I was in exactly your spot down to the details. I'm 20 now, I still struggle a good amount and I'm still depressed, but I am far more happy and better now even though it isnt always easy. The only thing you can do is try and get better really and not let it control you, even though I know how that sounds. I promise you're not a waste of space. You have as much of a right to be here as anyone else does. You. Are. Valid. I'm not sure what your life is like, but I can guarantee you that you have a thousand internet comrades rooting for you. I hope it gets better love",False,False
