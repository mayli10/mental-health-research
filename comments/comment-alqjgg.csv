Im still just upset and I think it’s that time of the month again so I know I’m being defensive as well. I think I’ll do that once I feel like I can talk to them again. It just sucks because it’s like this is the whole reason I didn’t want to tell them about it in the first place but I was pushed to by my ex therapist. I’ll figure it out. I just really wanted to vent.,False,True

I'm sorry if it was off-target.  If you aren't even talking about it at this point, maybe you could try forbidding them from commenting on your weight, body, and food at all, full stop? Like ""I know you're trying to help, but it isn't helping me right now, so please stop"".  If they still don't listen...I get that they're worried, but they still need to respect your boundaries once they're down. :/  Some friends are just...disappointing. I'm sorry.",False,False

Maybe I shouldn’t have said disordered thoughts because literally all I said is wow this girl is so thin. That’s literally all I said and somehow it turned into this conversation about things I don’t even talk about with them anymore. I don’t share all my disordered thoughts with them. Definitely not the concerning ones. I don’t make judgmental comments on weight.    I’ve tried to get my friends to understand the disorder. I really have but they really just don’t care enough to really listen. That’s the crux of my problem. I understand they won’t ever really get it but they aren’t trying to do the bare minimum. I feel if they were concerned they would challenge me in more helpful ways than just telling me that skinny people are ugly and that I should just eat. :////,False,True

I worry that eating disorder support spaces normalize this stuff too much. If they didn't worry, they wouldn't be very good friends imo.",False,False

But it’s something I hardly talk about with them. Like literally I talk about how I wish I was smaller once in a blue moon. But to them, they act like that’s all I talk about. And idk it feels it just feels like they get mad at me for having this disorder and they think I can just turn it off. If I try to explain myself, I’m just making excuses to them. Idk. I just wish they cared enough not to fight with me on every little thing I say because they don’t know the whole story. ",False,True

I made them feel bad by celebrating smallness (when I was the closest to that degree of small out of all of us) sometimes people become defensive because they are hurt. they probably don't feel good listening to how much better skinny women are, maybe that's why they're reacting like that.",False,False

They always also somehow turn it back around on me to make it seem like I’m the one criticizing them for not being thin ?¿ I also don’t understand why they bashed the skinny woman I posted and called her ugly. My eating disorder has never been about being smaller but they just assume that. It feels like to me if they really cared, they’d try to be a least a little more empathetic and understanding. It just feels like all they want to do is yell at me. :////",False,True

It sounds like they are trying hard to keep you from going off the deep end, and they're good at spotting disordered thinking. There is no such thing as an innocent disordered thought.",False,False
