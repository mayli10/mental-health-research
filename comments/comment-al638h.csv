My problem more has to do with the fact that it did not tread any new ground.      Every ED film ever is about a middle/upper middle class white woman who also tends to have an unconventional/quirky parent or family member. There is never an issue of money or lack of treatment options. Everything is simply ""handled"" which is so divorced from the experience of the majority of people dealing with ED's. ",False,False

It‚Äôs great she realized she had made mistakes with her daughter, but infantilizing an adult is just creepy to me. I think it would be more helpful for both of them if she decided to take up the job again and be a mother to her daughter as she currently needs. I‚Äôve had similar issues with my mom and I would just be mortified if she did anything like that.",False,False

I respect your opinion if that's how you felt about the mom scene, but I thought it was the only thing that redeemed that movie. probably because my ED stems partially from my mom too.
