Don't beat yourself up about this exam it is only one possibly shitty math result in high schooI. This might not make sense or apply to you as I'm from Australia so our system would be different but I only made it to the end of year 10 and then failed year 11 twice. I honestly thought I was done for and would sit on my parents couch for the rest of my life. Now I'm at Tafe doing a course that that will lead onto a course that will lead onto Uni and so far  I'm actually managing to get through it. There are alternate pathways to Uni and sure it's going to take me a bit longer to get into uni than my friends (mainly because of doing year 11 twice) but then what is two years extra. If what you want is to study medicine you can do it! ❤️,False,False

I have had similar experiences that led to some really unhealthy periods of my life.   Don’t let this one exam become a bigger obstacle than it needs to be. You deserve to achieve the things you want. You deserve to be healthy and feel good about yourself.   You *will* if you keep trying.   Stay safe ❤️,False,False
