A couple of months before the day my fianc√© and our roommate sat me down and told me things couldn‚Äôt go on like this, I was weak and tired and sad and cried all the time and was just miserable. Every time I went for a wedding dress fitting, she needed to take it in even more.   They were both big fans of the Keto diet and convinced me to try it ‚Äúinstead‚Äù of recovering because we all knew I wasn‚Äôt just going to be able to start eating again.   When we got home I sat down at the kitchen table and my fianc√© cut up some slices of cheese for me and sat with me and distracted me with conversation while I ate them. Getting over the hump of starting (with CHEESE!!!!) was all I needed, it was easy after that.   I really recommend it as a tool for recovery, if you‚Äôre interested in trying it. It‚Äôs good because you don‚Äôt have to sacrifice any of your rituals; you still get to work out the nutritional info of your meals, you‚Äôre just focusing on macros instead of calories; there are still ‚Äúfear‚Äù foods and ‚Äúsafe‚Äù foods, but they‚Äôre based on science instead arbitrary gut instinct; and you still feel like you‚Äôre in rigid control on your intake because the rules are so strict. It‚Äôs a great stepping stone imo.",False,False

I feel you, i'm quasi-recovering (clich√© but I don't think I'm ""sick enough"" for recovery if that makes sense) and i read a piece recently that said something along the lines of ""if I was taking care of a body that was not my own, I would be ashamed"" and that absolutely rocked my world, so I'm upping my cals back up from the triple digits and TRYING not to obsess (but still lose a little weight, healthily this time) and even eating still at a deficit my mind is freaking out that I'm going to gain weight!!! But it's impossible!!!! But OBVIOUSLY eating 2 small meals is gonna make me balloon up!!! And this screaming match happens in my brain every time I open the fridge üò∞",False,False
