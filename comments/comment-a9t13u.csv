I was ok with my body but always wanted to lose a little. Now I’m just hollow. I feel you when you say it’s just all wrong now, like we have messed up our ability to be that normal again ... I’m rooting for you! I hope we both can find peace :-) ",False,False

When you're thin and you eat anything it makes your belly stick out and it sucks. I also liked my body before my ED started and I was convinced I was fat. I wasn't even fat. I was just softer because I hadn't been working out the way I used to.,False,False
