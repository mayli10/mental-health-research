I don't take solids or meat/protein at all..;;,False,True

I find that preparing food for my SO helps me get my mind off of my own eating. I’ll prepare us similar meals like stir frys and overnight oats but cook his with more protein, oil, whole milk etc. It helps me when we eat similar meals, and I think it helps him not worry about my eating if we’re eating similar things. I hope y’all find something that works for you! x",False,False

We shop, prepare, and eat food separately, partly just because our schedules differ, but I like this arrangement. He doesn’t comment on what I eat, and I leave him alone too.  Your UGW sounds like flirting with serious health issues or death. I hope you’ll find a way to stay safe.",False,False
