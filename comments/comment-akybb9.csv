I never understand how people get excited for fall and winter, and complain about the heat. It gets really hot here in the summer but I still prefer it over goosebumps and bundling up and freezing hands and feet and my muscles getting sore because I'm so tense and shivery.  ",False,False

I think it has to do with our bodies making certain kinds of fat when it’s cold that’s easier to break down because we will need the ability to burn it for energy or something like that. I mostly made that up. But hey, it sounds right. Haha. I’m the same in that I’m alway cold. I live on hot tea and almost daily epsom salt baths. First I run turn on the space heater, then I run the shower until it’s all steamed up in the bathroom and I can’t see my reflection, then I soak while drinking tea until I sweat. My husband calls me “mother of dragons” because my baths are so hot. Once we lived in a apartment where every time I got out of the bath, the fire alarm went off. Haha. I had to start taking the batteries out first. ",False,False

I’m Australian and hate the heat. All the sweating and burning, not being able to cover up. And exercise outside just makes me feel so uncomfortable. Not even real exercise, walking to the station in the morning makes my makeup run and my skin start to feel sticky. I mean it’s nice when you’re on holidays and can laze by the ocean. But for living everyday it just makes me so miserable.  When I was living in Europe I felt it motivated me to do more in winter because being up and about helped keep me warm. But in summer here I just feel like lying about in an air conditioned room after work. ",False,False
