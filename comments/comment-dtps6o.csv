Six days is a lot in my book. Iâ€™m proud of you. You can still keep going on with your 6 days. It can just be a blip.  The most days Iâ€™ve made it without drinking is 7 and that was damn hard and felt like an eternity. I know how easily feeling good and proud can turn into something...not good and proud. Please donâ€™t let that lady turn your accomplishment into a failure. You did good, my friend. Keep going.",False,False

You made it 6 days without purging like fuck yeah? Who cares what some random nurse thinks. You accomplished something, please donâ€™t give up! You got this. Itâ€™s a victory going any amount of days without purging ðŸ¥°ðŸ’•",False,False
