Yesterday night I wanted to eat again but being a university student none of myself or my roommates had time to get groceries recently so I ate a single pear and all of a sudden was out of food. Quite a blessing in disguise.  Today was okay. I ate a normal amount of food (an excessive meal but an OMAD nonetheless); heavy on the dessert though, because there was a potluck/Christmas party and later it was someone‚Äôs birthday. The secret, I‚Äôve found, is coming home to an empty fridge.  How are you doing?",False,False

I've been b/p-ing pretty much all through last week, whereas I normally would only do it in moderation (say, 1-2 times a month TOPS). It is so extremely difficult to break out of such a cycle; you start craving things as badly as a heroin-addict craves a fix after 3 days cold turkey and you just know the tricks to get rid of it, so why the hell not?!  Man, those cravings are baaaaaad. Really, I mean it. Wherever you are right now, know that here's a person who sympathises with you and Is. Extremely. Proud. Of. You.  Sending you much love and strength. üòò",False,False
