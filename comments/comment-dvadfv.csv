That's a slippery slope. Maybe focus less on food and more on exercise? If there's a fitness activity you like, such as dancing/yoga/Zumba/wii fit/etc., you could lose some weight while having fun, instead of focusing on restriction or obsessing over healthy foods?",False,False

I know it’s easier to say this than do it, but I am overweight (just crossed the line to obese this year), and every time I try to lose weight I just end up with ED feelings/behaviors. My BMR is now lower than it should be because of all the phases of high restriction I have done",False,False
