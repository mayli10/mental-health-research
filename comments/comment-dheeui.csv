However, I’m sure that would probably not happen and I would eventually just eat like a normal person  This is my fear too. Realistically, i know I wont have issues with gaining weight if i go the rest of my life without counting calories, but its become such a safety net for me. There's a reassurance in it/i can control all of my other anxieties in a way",False,False

I hope we get better and start normalizing the amount of food we eat and feel satisfied mentally.

It's about 20,000.  I don't feel as cold and I'm constantly aware of how i feel in my skin. I still have a thigh gap, but they touch when i, like, bend backwards or something, and it's pretty triggering when I've gone months not being aware of them because they never interacted. I can feel the water retention in my face and my skin is breaking out. I never feel good about any of my food choices now because i just feel guilty, and i can't stop making the decision to eat because I compulsively worry about ~depriving myself~ (while also simultaneously feeling the need to make up a 20,000 calorie surplus). Food and my weight is all ive been thinking about, constantly-- even though im not even hungry and haven't been because of how much and how often I've been eating. I really need to give my body a break. I want to wake up with the ""morning skinny"" i would no longer register because it was the norm.   I'm currently accutely aware of how my body physically feels because it's not how it normally is. I realize i took for granted feeling normal every day while eating maintenance, because right now i feel lousy every day. And whenever i do eat, i can't just eat a slice of toast and an egg, i have to eat a lot in one sitting before i can move the fuck on with my life and it sucks. And what sucks more is i haven't lasted a day of either eating maintenance or fasting. Right now I've eaten eaten 100 calories under mainteance. I still have my 10 mile weekend run to do so I'll be at an even greater deficit, and i honestly don't think I'll eat any more today, but I'm still big depresso.  I just dont know what to do. My entire life feels triggering. I'm wondering if i should temporarily delete my food-related apps (cronometer, YouAte) because honestly confronting the surplus as today's burden every day is a lot of pressure that i feel like has contributed to my failure to resume normalcy",False,False
