I've never told him, but I think he's figured it out just from the stupid shit I say. He gently tells me protein shakes arent meal replacements and offers to make me toast when we're at his place, but he never pushes.  We were at a bakery and I was worriedly thinking out loud about having bread, like ""oh no, can I have one of these?"" He said ""of course you can have one."" The authority of his voice cut through my head and I felt like I did indeed have Permission to eat the damn chorizo bread for once.  Bless him, I hope everyone meets someone like him at least once",False,False
