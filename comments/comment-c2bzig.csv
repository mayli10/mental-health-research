Now that i'm not restricting i haven't really noticed much of a drop but that was when it really improved.,False,False

Plus, hunger helps me concentrate bc my ADHD lessens if my brain has a constant stimulus to focus on, like music, gum, or...hunger pangs.   However, I become physically clumsy, struggle to type, and drive badly to the point that I have to stay off the road.",False,False

I know that I am probably not focusing better. There is conflicting data about whether or not restricting affects cognitive tasks. A lot of people report feeling like their cognition and concentration are diminished, but there have been a few studies, including the infamous Minnesota Starvation experiment, where performance on tests weren't actually inhibited even if study participants felt they as though they were impaired.  However, even if my mental capacities are diminished while restricting, it's the only time that I actually have the motivation to study. In fact, I can study for hours. As opposed to binging me who sits on his ass all day, depressed and drinking. So if I can only remember half of the stuff I study when I'm restricting, it's still more learning than what I do when I'm not restricting.",False,False
