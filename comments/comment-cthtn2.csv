Parents can be just really clueless and uninformed about eating disorders. When I was ridiculously underweight and one day got two frozen yogurts because I just had a traumatic thing happen and was like fuck it I deserve a treat after 2 years of zero desserts, my dad literally was like ""Are you *sure* you want to eat all that?"" in this judgey tone and I was like, bitch wtf, you've been concerned and harassing me to gain weight for like a year and I was just hospitalized a few months ago and now you're telling me I need to watch my sweets intake? It's really really difficult to stay sane and smart about being healthy/recovering/reaching your goals when everyone around you is so clueless and insensitive. People say things without thinking and honestly most of the time they don't mean anything by it. My last boyfriend made some comments surrounding weight/food that always made me sad and uncomfortable, and at one point I literally just said ""Hey, you know I've really struggled with my body and eating in the past and I'd just appreciate it if you were a little more sensitive when you talk about these things because they can still really upset me"". It might feel uncomfortable at first to express it but the other person will then know not to make thoughtless comments.",False,False

You would look so beautiful in this if you were still your anorexic weight!” I’m the healthiest and happiest I’ve ever been. Don’t let their limited perspectives bring you down.
