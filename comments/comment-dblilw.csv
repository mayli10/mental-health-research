It didnâ€™t cause any long term issues for me, so once I realized that was what made them so bad and stopped using it, they almost immediately went back to normal. It might be good to track them though, because if it does make them worse, youâ€™ll definitely want to get off. Everything else was great though, and I would still be using it otherwise! Good luck love ðŸ’•",False,False

Basically, I just donâ€™t think it would cause you to gain at all. It did make my chronic migraines significantly worse though, so thereâ€™s that haha.",False,False
