They openly demonstrated it without regard for my feelings. She was prettier and was a social butterfly. When she hit puberty, she gained weight. One day, I overheard her crying about it in the bedroom and my dad consoling her, saying, ""Don't worry. You're small-boned like your mom. Your sister is big-boned like Aunt Susan. She might be skinny now, but she'll be a fat grownup, while you'll be skinny and perfect."" I vowed to always be skinnier than she'll ever be for the rest of my life. I'm 30. So far, so good. Fuck you, Dad.",False,False

I started a """"diet"""" and lost 15 lbs in around a month by eating maybe a single granola bar and then eating a small portion of dinner every day. When I got to my goal at the end of the month, I had my first binge. The quantity wasn't as much as later binges but it was the first time I felt truly out of control. After that I never regained my healthy relationship with food; it's been 6 years now",False,False

It was a small school and the bullying and harassment was relentless and cruel. I was ostracized and gaslit. I became terrified of crowds because of lunches there, and to escape the rejection I started skipping lunch. Then I'd come home and skip dinner because I was too busy locking myself in my room.   It wasn't like how I am now. I don't fully understand my aversion to eating back then. Maybe because everything tasted the same. Maybe because I associated it with the bullying. However it happened, my relationship with food was awful until a few years later when I got into a position woth a positive support network.   I ended up gaining so much weight and I didn't even notice. I had anorexia when I was young but only after being cheated on and dumped did I develope body dysmorphia. I saw a disgusting, worthless person in the mirror unworthy of love. I saw a replaceable, ugly human being. It wasn't long after that I fell back into anorexia, but this time I obsessively check the scale, count calories, and check my body when before I did none of that, I just starved.",False,False

Which was going to be very soon. I thought I was being sneaky and opened the bag under the table in the next room because I HAD TO HAVE THEM with such an intense craving, and obviously was caught and then yelled at &amp; chips confiscated. Earliest ED memory is harder because there's so many tiny things. Body dysmorphia was very young. I remember looking at my thighs while sitting in elementary school and being appalled at the way they spread out. And I always felt like my stomach was too big. I don't remember restricting until 9th or 10th grade, but I was a binge eater since childhood; the weight kist didn't start catching up to me until I was a teenager.",False,False

My dad was a single dad for a few years and a horrible cook. Lived in frozen meals for a few years. And they've always tasted comforting. Even 23 years later I'd prefer one of those to a homemade lasagna ðŸ™ˆðŸ˜‚. Earliest memory of the ED is a bit harder. My issues first started super young from a need to ""control"" some aspect of my life and evolved into more sinister things later. One of the first conscious decisions I remember making though was realizing that if I chewed slow enough and took small enough bites, I'd barely be halfway done by the time the family was done eating. Which is when I'd rave about how good it was, despair in how ""full"" I was and offer to clean the table.",False,False

I think the earliest ed memory I have is during September 2017, just before homecoming. I was going dress shopping and Iâ€™d never had an issue with my body before even though Iâ€™d always been kind of chubbyish, but all of a sudden I just realized how far my stomach went out, the armpit fat, the tiny bit of extra fat around my neck. the next day I started exercising. ended up not really restricting until November.",False,False

I  recognise it as one of my earliest memories of dysmorphia too. The only time I liked my stomach was when I woke up before breakfast when it was still flat. I started skipping breakfast because I'd get really self conscious about how I looked in my school uniform.   And yet, no matter how flat my stomach ever was, I'd still detest how my legs looked in those damn school socks.
