She eats challenging food, but doesn't really talk about how she's battling the thoughts or changes to her body in recovery, or at least not as much as megsy recovery.  I've also noticed she doesn't seem to do the 6 meals a day thing in recovery, which is probably why she does more challenging meals?",False,False

She has said multiple times “I tried filming this yesterday but gave up halfway..” and then after you figure out she was by herself. Her act is a bit theatrical which makes sense since she’s into theater. Her whole eating whatever she wants without significant weight gain, no bloating, no extreme hunger. She also claimed she stopped exercising for recovery but she still has abs and definition like she works out 6 times a week. Her “recovery” is really just over played and dishonest in my opinion.",False,False

Especially at one point it seemed like she was eating burgers and ice cream/cookies in every video, which I'm not judging cos each to their own but it's just no way that I could remain with that figure if I ate like that.   I don't think her recovery portrays realistic recovery, unlike MegsyRecovery, who talks about dealing with weight gain etc.",False,False
