Do you have a safe place to go if your mom does kick you out? And whatever happened or is happening with college, just keep in mind that college doesn’t have to mean 4 year college. Plenty of people start at community college and then transfer. Or come back to school later on when their lives are a little more stable. There is always hope, although I know right now things just feel shitty...feel free to ignore this comment if you just wanted to get your feelings out, not think about next steps.   But in terms of next steps, the first and most basic thing is to keep your body safe and functioning, and the second is to address your housing situation (is your mom serious? Do you have anywhere else to go? Do you know what public or charitable aid numbers to call if you need emergency shelter?).   Much love to you!",False,False

I hope things start to get better real soon, keep your chin up and take each day as it comes. Feel free to DM me if you need to talk x",False,False
