It almost feels as if I made this comment. Every. Damn. Word. in this comment could've been typed by me. I'm sorry that you feel this way too, but I'm relieved that I'm not the only one.   &gt;The internal pain can be so bad sometimes that I want to kill myself and sometimes it can be bearable.  This so much. I just want to run away from the bad feelings. When it gets bad, it feels as if it will never get better. But then you wake up next morning and the bad feeling has passed. Only to come again later.  Funny thing is that my parents have accused me of using them as an ATM all my life. But now after shit went downhill this year, I lost all respect for my parents, and now they are literally only ATMs for me lol",False,True

I think sometimes how the fuck could my dad do that to me when I was a child, which human does that to another human, let alone their own fucking child ??? Isn‚Äôt a parent meant to protect their child ?? The internal pain can be so bad sometimes that I want to kill my self and sometimes it can be bearable. But my dad is rich and I need his money so I‚Äôm playing the game. Whatever. No wonder why I‚Äôm fucked up. Lol",False,False
