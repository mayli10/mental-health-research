My gf keeps some kinda Breyers Chocolate Minicups in the freezer; 100Cals per 50g cup… I've never had one, and I do get an odd satisfaction at this gap in my diet. These days my main food is instant coffee, black but sweetened with pancake syrup (zero hfcs, half-sugar &amp; half-sucralose, prawly slowly killin' me)… I no longer sweat calories, macros, and certainly not prepackaging.",False,False

Where as things I prepare I will literally lie awake at night trying to make sure I didn’t miss tracking any ingredient and that all the amounts were 100% correct.
