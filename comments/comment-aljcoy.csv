It hurts me a bit how squeaky-clean it is in this sub compared to proED (but maybe that's an unhealthy part of me talking haha)  So many terms/definitions could really up for debate: ""pro-ED comment"" and ""advice"" ""encourage"" and ""tips"" ""thinspo"" ""harm-reduction""  recovery promoting etc.  And honestly........................ I mostly feel like most of this conversation is  just not really worth it, especially right here, right now.  This community does need to try to follow the guidelines if we want to stay on Reddit. These guidelines seem both bizarrely specific and impossible to define to me, but anyway...  I don't know. I know my opinion is influenced by my particular struggles but it just makes me annoyed that theres always this weird policing issue around ED conversations  It's totally possible I'm just weirdly hung-up about all this  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;",False,False

Well, not really, I'm fat as fuck (21) but I have no boobs and I WANT no boobs. I'd be happy completely flat.
