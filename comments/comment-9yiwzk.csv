I think they're really good. I heard they were gross but I would get them on sale a lot from Safeway and found them to be really tasty. ,False,False

I can't stand sugary things now and I had an incredibly sweet tooth.  Creamy yogurts would make me heave now.  When I was a kid (ahhh Memory Lane) it was the thing that everyone only drank full fat milk. If I tried full fat now, one swig and I'd want to puke.  Low cal products are good for normal eaters anyway.  They can eat more if they wanted to, so win/win.  Sugar free sorbet's better than usual sorbet.  See, if more people were willing to give it a try we could solve the morbid obesity crisis in a month.",False,False

I definitely notice that the richest/highest calorie brands of ice cream I like a lot less than cheaper, frozen yogurt type ones, so I feel like I’d love all those new substitutes coming out...

My hierarchy of ice cream preferences is soft serve&gt;low cal ice cream&gt;regular ice cream cause for me it’s all about texture.
