If he pushes you to recover/eat, then tell him it’s got to be baby steps. This shit gets ingrained in you and creates a fear that can be pretty obnoxious. No-one wants to have a panic attack in front of a crowd.",False,False

Could make all your crepes for other people, or make it artistic and make them look like something/someone either than making them “for eating”.   Could do the usual feigning of a stomach ache so you can’t eat any of them, skip out on the meeting if it’s too much temptation, etc. remember that “I don’t want to” is a valid reason to not do something all on its own. People don’t need more detailed reasonings than that.   Or have a good time and enjoy a crepe. One day doesn’t destroy progress. One arrow does not take down a castle.",False,False
