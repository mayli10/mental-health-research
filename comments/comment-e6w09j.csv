For me I love it toasted with several lattes on the side because it feels like your easting pastries with you coffee but instead it's just healthy low fat bread and I can eat the whole loaf! Whereas pastires will leave you unsatisfied..  If you really can't have it plain try it with a no added sugar jam (pure fruit jams). Or sometimes I eat it with a platter of fresh and dried fruits, grapes and dried figs go well. And tea!!!",False,True

I can never have one slice which is why I came up with the bread binge cycle.  Restrict every 2-3 days then binge on a whole loaf of GOOD and NUTRITIOUS bread. I just love bread so much so I can't cut it out completely lol,False,True

I spent a whole hungover day at work daydreaming about different combos of bread and fats. I haven't eaten bread in 6 months. The fantasizing has reached near erotic levels.,False,False

I would eat bread more often because it's not even really a fear food for me; it's everything I want to pair with bread that makes it a fear food, so I don't allow myself to eat bread.  I don't usually want to eat it plain, I usually want to pair it with a dip, hummus,  oil, or PB...and those all make bread too decadent for me, unless I have a little bit out at a restaurant on a very special occasion once every few months, if that.  But it also seems like a waste of calories to pair bread with some low-calorie sad soup or something lol. So...plain it is?",False,False
