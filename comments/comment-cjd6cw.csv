I thought she was being completely dishonest about the whole thing in Shane's video. She's just getting started, she's not recovered. Even after you're weight restored you aren't recovered. That shit takes years. If she's even totally weight restored I'd be absolutely shocked. She tries to say she's honest to her viewers, but she isn't even honest to herself.   I think the idea that her mom is ultra abusive is somewhat farfetched and is a symptom of the pervasive idea that EDs are the fault of the parents. In all likelihood I think her mom is probably trying to help, but she doesn't know what the hell she's doing. A lot of parents of adults with AN treat their daughters and sons a bit like kids because they're so damn worried. Her mom probably controls her whereabouts and has a driver for her because she wants to make sure when she goes out, someone will be there were there to be a medical emergency. Her mom isnt bright. To me her mom comes across as a stupid mom who's trying to be her kids' ""best friend"", but is also worried about her daughter. I interptet her actions as trying to make sure Eugenia is as happy as possible and not dead on a moment to moment basis; there's no consideration of the long term repercussions of her moment to moment happiness. It's toxic, but it's not the mom giving her kid an eating disorder or hoping that her kid doesn't recover.",False,False

I really hope she sees them for who they really are and moves on from them and has a healthy and good recovery. I respect Jaclyn for what she did and I feel bad for her and her friends that they had to do that, but they helped at least save her and make her face reality a bit. I still don't think she's convinced she has an eating disorder. The way she talks about it in circles is a bit worrying. Of course it is very difficult to talk about especially to thousands of strangers, but also it feels like she is going to relapse if she stays in the same state of mind and enviroment she got sick in.",False,False
