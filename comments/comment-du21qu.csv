Im have this weird obsession with appearing very “carefree” about food I think because I am secretly SO NOT carefree about food. And I want people to feel comfortable enough around me to eat comfortably, I dont want to not eat much and make them feel like theyre eating too much.",False,False

I try to always compliment people on things unrelated to size/looks and if I hear anyone doubt their food choices I reassure them instantly with the Useless Nutrition Knowledge TM that ED has forced me to build up over the years. Some stuff feels too hypocritical so I can't do everything (like I can't bring myself to tell my mum she doesn't need to care about calories when it's all I think about all day long lol) but I really try to do as much as possible.,False,True
