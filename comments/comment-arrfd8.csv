It is a horrible thing to have happen for both you and the kids. Most physiologists will tell you it can take over year to get through all the different issues, itâ€™s like morning a loss in the family and the feeling and issues you will go through while making a stable life for your kids. Over time you will be richly rewarded for your efforts if you work hard at making a life for your kids. Talk about your feelings with a good listener, donâ€™t isolate. Your exâ€™s life isnâ€™t all that you imagine and his day is coming and will be full of regret. If he still has contact with your kids the new gf is going to catch hell, so you donâ€™t need to worry about her as a comparison. I would be surprised if she hangs around. A sure sign of the unwinding will be when your ex starts getting super flaky with regards to helping with the kids. Heâ€™s going to try and make things like a honeymoon for the ex who will start complaining to him. Stay strong, communicate with someone, things will get better if you work at it.",False,False

I am so sorry to hear about him being a total douche, but even more sorry to see you trying to cope this way. This scum bag doesnâ€™t deserve to hold this form of power over you, but... hey, Iâ€™ve been there.   Are you seeing a therapist by chance? Life events this devastating can be overcome, but having some assistance would make it much easier.  Please feel free to pm me if you ever need to talk. Sending my love your way. ðŸ’— ",False,False
