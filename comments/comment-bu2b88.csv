The community when I was there was excellent, but I didn't feel like I received great care. I literally told them ""If I leave right now I think I'll end up in the ER within a few weeks"" and they discharged me anyway, and I'm back to my old shit. At Alcott, I also like, pretty consistently had to witness another patient getting put into a dangerous situation (Literally being grabbed and dragged down the hallway because they weren't equipped to deal with non-compliance in any other way). That was very disturbing to me, and they didn't have any area where you could go to cool down by yourself outside of your room, and they didn't have enough places for people to meet with their treatment team, so you were often locked out of your room (Which is why I ended up being forced to see people getting brutalized! They'd tell everyone to go to their rooms but my roommate was having a meeting and I had nowhere to go). They're like, one of the only places in my area that accepts men for residential/inpatient so it was my only choice.  That being said, there are a lot of people who benefited from the same program that I was in. There's someone in my partial program who went to Walden's other inpatient program in Connecticut and the same residential program and has much nicer things to say about them.",False,False

They told me I had no holds and could leave any time I wanted, which is why I consented to care. They then trapped me there for a week. I went up and asked if I could leave because I was sick of being ignored and lied to, and the nurse said if I asked again they'd put a hold on me for another week.  The whole time I felt dehumanized and spoken down to. I dreamed of escape every moment. I will NEVER again trust a doctor, ever. Or any social worker for that matter. All the ones I met were manipulative liars that avoided telling me the truth.  I'd rather rot and die than ever be in the care of a hospital again.",False,False

Residential, PHP, IOP, outpatient, the works. Definitely wish I started in residential. Instead my pattern was like this: OP, IOP (for forever), PHP, residential, PHP, quit cold turkey. I had to go back to work and school and didn't prioritize my health. Relapsed after 3 weeks and now 3 years has passed. Start high if you can, do the hard work in PHP, IOP, and OP. Cessation of behaviors isn't an excuse to stop going.",False,False

I was grouped with all sorts of girls my age, all with various disordered eating habits and mental/emotional issues. We had a nutritionist there to plan our weekly meals/snacks based based off of our personalized treatment plans. We had to eat supervised to be sure we finished our full meal. Followed by a pat down, and checking under tables to ensure we weren't stashing food. If we went to the bathroom, we had to sing or talk to the the employees so they could be sure we weren't purging. We couldn't exercise unless it was allowed by the therapists. We had daily therapy groups, weekly Anonymous meetings if you wanted to attend (AA, NA, etc.) We had all sorts of recreational activities like art class, hikes/walks, group outings (nail salon, going out to eat, etc.) Family/friend visitations once a week. It was nice I suppose. They only downside was the cliques and the unspoken competition between us girls as to who was the most sick or whatever. We were roomed in groups of three so you had no alone time whatsoever unless you were showering. You could keep your shoelaces, jewelry, and whatnot as long as you behaved yourself. It was a lot more relaxed than other hospitals I've been at.",False,False
