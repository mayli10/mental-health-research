But I still feel so... intimated by the presence of other pretty Asian/non-Asian skinny girls, to the point I would never befriend one.  Almost feel like I‚Äôm a fake and they‚Äôre the real deal.  Or for this matter, I also feel intimated by other intelligent women who don‚Äôt give a damn to appearances, calories, foods or whatever.

Sorry.",False,False
