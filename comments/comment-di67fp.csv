Using things like urge/feeling surfing where you pay attention to the rise peak and fall of an emotion or urge can help also may help with binging. You could distract yourself or self soothe by well doing something nice for yourself. Also to deal with the disordered cognition if you interject conscious healthy thoughts that may hell. Try countering the thoughts with things like its o.k. to eat a healthy meal. If you are at a normal BMI you can remind yourself you are at a healthy weight and that is a good thing being healthy. Stuff like that.,False,False
