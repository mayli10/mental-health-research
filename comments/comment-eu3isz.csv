Ive lost 15 lbs in 2 months and it feels amazing to my sick little brain. I feel confident and accomplished seeing my body change, and although I may not do it in the *most* healthy way, at least I don't hate myself right?   In general I'm super obsessed with food and that kinda sucks but I don't really know how to not be lol. I'll probably get a therapist who specializes in ED at some point, but I'm not ready yet",False,False

She said she used to weigh &gt;!38 kg / 84 lbs at a BMI of 14-15!&lt;. I could always tell that there was *something* off about her even though she's weight restored now. I highly suspect she's still struggeling with body dysmorphia, self-hate etc.     Unfortunately I also suspect that she thinks she's all alone with this shit and that she can never confide in anyone because her struggle is invalid. She immediately made me promise to forget what she said about her former weight.      And the genius solution my fucking retard brain came up with? ~~Telling her how I can relate and that she can in fact talk to me if she wants~~ Starving down to dangerous levels to show her she's not alone.
