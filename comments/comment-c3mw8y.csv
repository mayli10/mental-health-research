Like, I went vegan and I ate like, 200kl-600kl a day, it made me want to restrict more. On the other hand, there's a lot of people in recovery who are happier and healthier on a vegan diet. So it really is dependent on what you feel is in your best interest and what diet (vegan, vegetarian, omnivore) works best for your body/health.",False,False

Its one of the reasons why treatment centers do not allow someone to maintain a vegan diet. I've been vegetarian for 8.5 years, and I refuse to progress to veganism because I know it'll fuck up my orthorexia.",False,False

Wish you all the best with your recovery either way ðŸ’“,False,False

When I first went vegan I ate in abundance and felt amazing, but slipped into restriction that led to full blown bulimia. I find myself scared of many more foods now, even bread. Donâ€™t know if I need to drop all rules for recovery to get level-headed or not",False,True

There are plenty of vegan options for at home eating/eating out.   If you live in an area where vegan eating isnâ€™t widely accepted and this drastically limits your options and causes you to eat less I would *not* recommend it.   Iâ€™m saying this because I have lots of vegan/veg friends and they have tons and tons of options that donâ€™t include animal products.   I really believe that if you stop eating vegan to recover and you feel hyper gross youâ€™re not going to want to continue recovery. But if you feel good and youâ€™re getting in lots of nutrients and fun food youâ€™re more likely to continue eating this way.,False,False

At least for a little. Instead of macros and calories it was like, what food is going to give me the nutrients I need to survive.  I'm back to counting calories again but I dont think veganism vs nonveganism changes things for me.",False,False
