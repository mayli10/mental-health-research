I remember being healthy with restriction and getting good results and feeling really good about the food I was eating, the energy I had. But a lot of people become disordered when the reality hits that it isn't sustainable. A deficit becomes a *way of life.* A period of restriction, especially an aggressive one, means that your body's hormones start to work against you. Hunger becomes a battle. Giving in becomes shameful. Extreme restriction to deal with 'failing'.  &amp;#x200B;  I don't think weight loss is always a disordered endeavor. But it very often is the path and gateway to a lifetime of disordered eating and a bad relationship with food.",False,False

And I 100% agree with your post tbh.   I think there probably are people on there that have signs of disordered eating but plenty on there that are simply just dieting. Like once someone is over a certain height and activity level 1200kcal isn't healthy (like I struggle to fit in my micros nutrients into a slightly larger kcal limit).,False,False

I was really happy to read this post actually. I mean we have actual eating disorders and while there might be some people on there who do have eating disorders as well, as a whole they have good, intuitive eating habits. Maybe we were projecting? Or maybe we find it hard to associate restricting calories with anything healthy? I for one know that if a friend doesn't eat lunch I assume the worse and then have to remind myself that they're probably busy and not hungry and that's okay for them. ",False,False

I feel weird because I'm part of r/ fasting  and I sincerely think it's the most helpful/ recovery oriented subs for me (because I'm BED, not restrictive). The people there know when to stop, and usually maintain once they hit their goal, or do far less frequent fasts. ",False,False

Is fasting for 14 days an amazing feat of self control, and are the people worshipping as a goal just not as good at fasting? Or is it disordered eating hidden behind the guise of ""wow I just totally rate my relationship with food ahaha."" I think 1200 calories is fine in the same way that I think fasting is fine - it's a cool thing to do. It's a functioning idea. I just think that people hide problems behind it. If 1200 is ""plenty"" then 700 is fine. ",False,False
