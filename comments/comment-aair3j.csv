I always thought of it as a punishment and something to avoid when I was younger but Iâ€™m trying to see it as something good now. Glad to hear that from others as well! ,False,True

If you don't vibe with your first therapist, ask them for recommendations for new ones. If you aren't comfortable, you won't make any progress.   I've never been to one for my ed specifically, so I don't know specifics, but my therapist has really helped me to feel like I have a safe space to vent about everything, even when I don't feel like they're helping with my other issues at the present time.",False,False
