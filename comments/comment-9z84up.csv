At first I thought it was just severe depression.I tried celexa, Zoloft, prozac, latuda, seroquel... I pretty much just refused to continue taking the antipsychotics because I didn't want to risk weight gain. But my psych new I didn't have depression when I wasn't responding well to any of the SSRI's or other antidepressants. It wasn't until I got on lamictal that I started to feel a little more stable. They've titrated me up to 300mg a day.  &amp;#x200B;  I think people often paint mania/hypomania out to be this great, euphoric experience where you're full of energy and creativity. But there is also a dysphoric side to it, and thats why I didn't recognize myself as bipolar. My hypomanic episodes have always been short, maybe 2-2.5 weeks. At first I'm just more talkative, I want to clean and organize, I'm interested in things I normally wouldn't care about (which is like, nothing, because my eating disorder has sucked the humanity out of me), I'm wide awake. But the blissful side of it only lasts a few days, then that energy channels itself into uncontrollable racing thoughts, paranoia and rage. Have you ever had a bipolar rage? Shit lol. Not fun. I once put a dent in the wall from banging my head over it repeatedly because no one would take me to the grocery store. So I guess thats when I really knew the lamictal was working--when I didn't feel so enraged and irritated. It would happen when I was depressed as well but theres a different nature to it. When I'm depressed all the anger stays bottled in, so I just come off as passive agressive or hostile. When I'm hypomanic I'm very uninhibited about how pissed I am. I've never really had those issues after the lamictal. My psych has tried to get me to sample a few other meds but he knows how reluctant I am due to the side effects. I also smoke pot and that actually helps me although most doctors would not recommend it for type 1 (it triggers mania).",False,False

Recently had to go up on my dosage a little bit because my anxiety was out of this world. I’ve never taken the others you listed, but I’m taking lamictal for a mood stabilizer and trazodone for my insomnia.   I’ve realized that my ED stuff starts up when I’m hypo. I’ve been dealing with ED for 8 years and recently started back up. I used to just do it a little and give up, but this time is different and I’ve dropped 20 lbs in about 2 and a half weeks. I take meds twice a day and it makes me restrict because if I eat after taking the meds then I have a chance of throwing up my expensive medication. Idk. Kinda fucked up I guess. ",False,False

I felt like neither of them actual made me feel better. The prozac didnt seem to do anything, but you can't be sure with that sort of thing. Maybe I would have been more depressed if I wasn't on it, who knows. The rispiridal had a much shorter half life so if I skipped a dose because I needed to drive somewhere etc you could really tell the difference. It made me sluggish, foggy, lethargic and also academically incapable - Im very good at maths but on rispiridal I couldn't recall my times tables. They didnt help my depression and anxiety, it just meant that I didnt express my frustrations and worries in such a distressing-to-watch way. I'm autistic and when my mental health was poor I used to have trouble suppressing the ""meltdowns"" that usually only autistic children have. Instead i just stayed in bed, stared at the wall, and gained 30 pounds. Also the rispiridal made me drool and lactate.",False,False

It totally stabilised my mood swings to a manageable level.  I take Duloxetine on top of that and I take diazepam and temazepam for anxiety/sleep.    I know some people don't get on with lithium but it's honestly saved my life.  The symptoms of the illness never go away completely, but definitely makes life easier.  Lows less low, highs less high, a lot less frequent.  I think it does generally make me feel more ""meh"" about everything.  I wouldn't call it ""numbness"", more like I feel more distant from what's going on around me.  I wouldn't need  Vyvanse  because Lithium's made me pretty much demotivated to do things and lack of concentration's more connected with me drifting off into a meh world.  Not that I think of that as a negative because it helps really.  Getting the right combo can take some time.  I've been through loads of anti depressants , but I like Duloxetine (but then I was just really relieved that I wasn't suicidal all the frigging time after taking Paxil for years and realising it what that med that was causing it).  I know how frustrating it is being a guinea pig for a while, but it'll be worth it when you get the right combo   x  &amp;#x200B;",False,False

I’ve been on Prozac and risperdal but never vyvanse.   I was on a much higher dose of risperdal (around 4 mg) and it made me feel like I was dead and I gained a shit ton of weight on it. This was before the ed really took off and honestly why the ed really took off, at least partly.   Having both bipolar and an ed sucks and I feel like the moods themselves and the meds and the loss of control over my life i felt the illness had give me all contributed to me going from “somewhat unhealthy relationship with food” to “full blown ed” but, you know, we all harve our vices.",False,False

Lexapro worked really well for me but I had side effects and once I got my partner i changed to brintillex which also worked really well but is expensive.

I'm currently on Lamictal (anti-seizure, works as a mood stabilizer) and Viibryd (anti-depressant). I was previously on a few different cocktails that used anti-psychotics as a mood stabilizer, which is what your risperdal is for, but none worked for me or the side effects were intolerable.
