I can't even describe how great it has been for me, it helped save my life.  A small sidenote; Some things *might* (I am not a doctor, just to be clear) be a bit worse at first. I did experience a lot of irritation and a bit of increase in suicidal thoughts. But it went away fast! Don't want to scare you, just letting you know that if it happens, it's not uncommon!  Good luck! I hope it works wonders for you.",False,False
