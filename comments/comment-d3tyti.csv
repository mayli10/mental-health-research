Fruit or smoothies is perfect before a short session. For a long session add some complex carbs so put that banana on some oatmeal.,False,False

One day at a lower deficit or even at maintenance doesn't hurt once in a while,False,False

I'm pretty sure it'll go smoothly, I'm going with my partner and our time slot is estimated to be about 8pm, so I'll have already had dinner beforehand. He's going to be home so there's no getting away with not eating dinner!",False,False

Skipped lunch because the whole appointment took from 11am-4ish. I would force yourself to eat something for sure within an hour of starting but not sure how much for 1-2 hrs. But I ate about 600 calories before mine because it was going to be so long and I would recommend a “normal” meal for it because it is really hard on the body to be wounded like that.,False,False

Hope yours goes ok! But if you end up feeling weak since it's your first time restricting during a tattoo then try having something small with sugar cause tattoos lower your blood sugar and restriction already results in low blood sugar which makes it worse.,False,True

I figure most of the nausea/dizziness would be psychological- do needles or pain make you feel ill? I'm not bothered by needles or pain (I do weekly intramuscular injections) so I figure I'll be fine, but if you're worried I'd say eat at least 500 calories an hour or two before your appointment. Bringing a drink with you will also help, even if it's just water. And if you watched them tattoo you last time, don't do that this time!! You might not think it's the idea of needles but it very well might be that. I'll be looking at my phone this evening while they tattoo my ankle, but that's more social anxiety than anything else.",False,False
