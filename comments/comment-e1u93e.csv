Sodium and fiber are an issue. Though water is usually passed when the fiber soaks up the water and is pasted as waste.   To manage my water weight, I leave two days a week to sauna. This is usually 1 hour to 1 Â½ hours in the box. I usually bring with me my old MP3 player wrapped in a towel listen to a podcast or a playlist.   Or not as good go for a walk. Your body will process the waste products and usually afterwards you will pass the waste.   Hope this helped",False,False
