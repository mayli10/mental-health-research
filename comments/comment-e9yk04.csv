IF works for a lot of people and I think it’s great in that aspect. It’s not like it’s cutting out entire food or counting macros or calories groups like ‘fad’ diets do. I think fasting is beneficial for overweight and healthy weight people.   Eating disorders will always exist. Just like depression and anxiety and ADHD will always exist.   1000 people start IF, 1 gets an ED, 999 don’t (yes not real statistics you can’t know this but I’m making a point shush). That one person was predisposed and probably would’ve come across something in their lifetimes to trigger the onset of an eating disorder. Maybe it happened to be IF, maybe it was a traumatic event, maybe IF lead to binge-restrict cycle or a more restrictive diet like keto or 80/10/10 etc etc.  It feels unfair because normal healthy people are taking what makes us disordered people think we are special and extra disciplined and in control and in a twisted way ‘better’ than normal people (fasting/skipping meals) and doing it in a more controlled way with a healthier mindset and without the complications of our disorders because THEY DO NOT HAVE DISORDERS. They’re just changing their eating patterns.",False,False

You can do it healthily to help overcome nightly binges, and make good choices to be nourished and satisfied daily..  OR you can use it as a tool to skip meals/OMAD/binge and be unhealthy. I dont know if this is true, but I honestly feel like some people are more prone to take IF to crazy ED levels versus others who use it as a tool for success (success being dieting in a healthy way).   I wouldnt ask me though, Im on this sub after all lol.",False,False
