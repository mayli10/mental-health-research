No sugar is 100% more filling and makes restricting a lot easier.  Did restricting vegan-keto for a while, but I don’t recommend if you like volume eating at lower cals.  My go-to was macadamia nuts, avocado, tofu, leafy greens, shiritaki noodles, miso soup, veg soup, and jicama. ",False,False

If you can find them and they're not too expensive, they might be a nice alternative!  You can also do tofu, seitan, tempeh, and other meat alternatives if you're into that!",False,False

Do you have any allergies? For protein snacks i like nut butters that come in packets (a whole jar is binge-able tbh) - Justin’s vanilla almond butter is 180cal, 4 packets for $5 and they usually last me over a week bc i don’t eat them every day. I also like quinoa puffs, 120cal per serving for the truffle sea salt flavored ones, and a decent amount of puffs (1oz is around 25 or so)  Chickpeas, lentils, chia seeds, nutritional yeast, and really any other other beans/legumes are awesome for protein entrees/toppings! Tofu, tempeh, and seitan are really good too.  Hope this helps!!",False,False

The only added sugar I have now is alcohol but even then I keep it under a certain amount of grams. I'm vegan so I've not had dairy. ,False,False
