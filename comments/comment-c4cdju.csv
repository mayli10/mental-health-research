It was never eaten in a way that was non-disordered (i.e. always binged with shame and/or tears because we just wanted real ice cream). Food thats main selling point is that it is low-calorie never works out well for me. It becomes the only allowed option.,False,False

We all had to go to a grocery store together and at one point there were six young adults crowded around the freezer with all the Halo-Top reminiscing about the disordered ways we used it. Hilarious and terrible at the same time. I now hate it and hate that I still desire it for that reason.",False,False
