I’m actually a big nutritional and anatomy/physiology nerd, so if you ever want recommendations or to know more about how it works or my experience, lmk.  Low carb foods &amp; cal: - Chicken  - Pepperoni (if you can fit it into your daily cals) - Bacon  - Tuna  - Egg - Half &amp; half creamer (if you use it) - Feta cheese - Cheese in general  - Mayo  - Spinach  - Lite creamy cesear dressing  - strawberries - raspberries  - blackberries  - blueberries  - cauliflower  - broccoli  - hummus - flavored almonds (or plain)  - banana peppers  - pepperoncini peppers - pickles - stuffed olives (I usually get canned garlic stuffed) - carrots  - avocado   I eat one meal a day, usually at night, because if i eat earlier I have trouble making it through the day. Keto also reduces my appetite so I’m able to last the day without cravings. Here is an example of what I typically eat.   - 3oz cooked chicken breast: 120kcal  - 28g feta cheese: 70 kcal  - 1oz roasted red pepper hummus: 70kcal - 40g of carrots: 16kcal - 28g salt &amp; vinegar almonds: 170kcal  - 2 garlic stuffed olives: 20kcal  - 50g avocado: 80kcal   Total Calories &amp; Carbs: 546kcal | 20g   You can mess around with combinations depending on what you’re in the mood for. Sometimes I want more avocado, so I reduce the almonds. Or maybe I don’t want any chicken, so I substitute it for 30g of uncured pepperoni (150kcal). As long as you stay below 30g of carbs, you’ll maintain ketosis and have reduced appetite and be losing weight without the crappy symptoms. It may seem like you’re eating less bc/ you can’t eat like 4 rice cakes, but your hunger is greatly reduced so it doesn’t really matter.  Edit: highly suggest you use my fitness pal &amp; a food scale to track what you’re eating with accuracy.

Ketosis usually happens after eating 0-25g of carbs a day for about 3-5 days, or simply fasting for 2, if you’re a woman. To put it into perspective, you’re eating around 30g (banana) and around 80g (2 poptarts), so 110g of carbs just this morning. That increases hunger and cravings.  When your body is in ketosis, your appetite lessens and you don’t get the same intense cravings or hunger pains that you do when on a diet with sufficient carbs. The only way I can really stay focused and remain energetic and not hungry is by limiting my carbs. Otherwise I just focus on how hungry I am, feel foggy brained, dizzy, etc. not fun.",False,False

I know this sounds mean, posting this kind of comment on here, but I try not to give advice on how to help people starve themselves.
