Minnie Maud is not the same as Maudsley (what you are explaining here). Minnie Maud is a recovery guideline that says you need to eat a certain amount of calories every day, no exercise, in order to regain weight you have lost, to help your body heal and trust you again and to  help you stop restricting, counting calories and obsessing about food. I think it actually sounds quite wonderful, if you take aside all the obvious mental stress you have to get through. But you’ll not recover if you don’t deal with that anyway.",False,False

To be fair I'm only trying to recover from my b/p problem and still trying to hide the restricting. I want to train for a marathon but I know to do that I need to significantly up my intake... it's not easy and I need to find a therapist in my.college campus area.  But thank you &lt;3,False,False

[Here's a link](https://goutiest-zorse-5012.dataplicity.io/ProED_Trees/t3_4uwaii.html)   I've only read a few. Wintergirls is a classic, highly recommend just bc it's so iconic in this community.  Letting Ana Go was short- pretty decent, a little juvenile, but still enjoyable.  Second Star to the Right is about an anorexic in treatment back when people were only just starting to figure out what the illness was. I found it fascinating. Highly recommend.  Brave Girl seating is by far the worst I've read. It's a memoir of a mother who did MinnieMaud with her anorexic daughter. I was horrified by the way she decided to treat this illness. MinnieMaud itself is horrifying to me. Worst summer of my life.  Anyways. Happy reading, op :)",False,False
