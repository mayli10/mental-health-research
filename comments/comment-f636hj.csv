I have a diagnosis of that as well so just know that you are not alone in what you are going through :) I hope one day your shame with eating lessens because I'm sure you and others on here are beautiful and strong despite any of the struggles you face. Please stay strong too! &lt;3,False,False

You’re so right, it is related to my anxiety. I was diagnosed with GAD and my disordered eating aggravates it 1000%. You put it perfectly, I do feel shameful eating food even though it’s necessary to live. Stay strong &lt;3",False,True

I have the same problem and the thought of being associated with food while people are around and could see me is a terrifying concept in regard to my own life. Eating out is tough because as you mentioned some situations have that unknown factor with food. I think your embarrassment in grocery stores and eating in public could possibly be the result of social anxiety and general anxiety brought about from your eating disorder (not making an assumption about you by the way, just brought it up because I know that is partially why I go through this). Eating alone has become a habit for you and although difficult, I think it is best to face things that make us uncomfortable or else we just feel stuck in our problem even more. We shouldn't feel shame or embarrassment because everyone needs to eat and food is an essential to life. We know this somewhere deep inside but it's hard to be rational and apply that form of logic to ourselves and our lives.",False,False
