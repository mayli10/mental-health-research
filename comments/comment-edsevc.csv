Have you tried prunes/coffe? If you smoke cigarettes and juul get my shits moving. Also high fiber snacks can be a big assist,False,False

Its been scientifically proven that the usage of laxatives has no effect on weightloss beacause the calories have already been absorbed. It just makes you shit. You know how this disorder works. The usage of lax one time opens the gate to lax abuse. Laxative abuse has the potential to ruin your digestive system fully. You see the posts on here where people talk about shitting themselves? They're deadass not joking. And every single one of those people have been where you are NOW, in the position of just acquiring laxivives for the very first time. Additionally,  extreme laxative abuse can result in constant bloating so that cancels any chance of having that sickening flat tummy we all after. You do not want to be in a position where you shit yourself. Eating disorders make a lot of things weird and awkward but when you bring feces into the mix shit gets real (lmfao). Think about if you could Handel the possibility of pooping on yourself man. Im so serious. Like really close your eyes and think about how you would feel to loose control of your bowel movements like that. You might think that this is just going to be a one time thing but this disease is so persuasive once you start using laxatives it could be very difficult to stop.",False,False

In my experience they don’t really help with sodium induced water weight either. They do make you poop but it’s not ideal because the more often you take them the more you need because you end up with what my therapist called a ‘lazy bowel’,False,False

Just take them before bed but do it when you won’t be going anywhere the next day cause it can come on suddenly.,False,False
