No shit, I’ve been avoiding the scale to resist my OCD and then today I was like “it’s been a while let’s see where I’m at since I haven’t been tracking at all” and I lost 8 lbs; I was relieved I wasn’t heavier but a wave of sadness came over me because the entire time I had thought I’d gained weight from not weighing myself constantly and therefore looked massive: the weight loss didn’t change the way I  see myself. I’ve lost over 50lbs but still see the overweight me in the mirror. I feel crazy.",False,False

That’s what so shitty about these disorders. It’s about how you see yourself, what value you assign yourself, and how you deal with difficult emotions. If it was truly just about weight, we’d all be cured once we hit our UGW.",False,False
