Even pre-ED I would always eat more when I was tired or had a cold or something mild (obviously if I was really sick, then I couldn't eat anything, because I couldn't keep anything down, but I would certainly make up for it later on). But other people I know, non-ED, also noticed this in their own lives. Tbf, maybe if you were not paying attention to your intake, you might not actually notice that you are doing it?",False,False

Whenever I’m over tired I eat SO much more than if I wasn’t. Same with being sick, it’s almost like I “allow” myself to eat more so I could “get better” quicker. I’m *in* recovery I guess but not really making any progress at all lol so idk I would say I’m pretty consumed within my ED still and do these things regularly.",False,False
