I limit myself to 1/4 of my TDEE calories daily, but Iâ€™m also sure that it would take very little for me to start eating 3000+ calories a day again. I think Iâ€™m just a stupid dieter.",False,False

If I stay under 10k calories per week, I can still lose 1-2lbs per week, &amp; somehow that seems so much more doable than the strict 1200 I used to give myself per day. This week I planned two fasting days to make up for VDay chocolate; going into VDay knowing I'd only had 3k of my 10k helped me relax &amp; enjoy good wine &amp; beer &amp; treats, and the scale STILL nudged down a tiny bit for me this morning. I mess up often, but it gives me motivation to ""save"" calories for social &amp; family things, which has really helped my mental health. Might be worth a try? ðŸ’œ",False,False
