I am going to get one of those smart scales with the hope that itâ€™ll recognise water weight from being on my period (etc)... does anyone have one?,False,False

Almost 15lbs difference in a day. And it takes about 2 weeks after my period ends to go away.... just in time for it to come back! I hate it.,False,False

It's not fat or anything though, it's just water retention and period bloat. It sucks though. My weight fluctuates by like five lbs within a week during my period and it's stressful.",False,False
