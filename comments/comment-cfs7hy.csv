Schizophrenia is such a ""doomsday diagnosis"" - more heavily stigmatized than anything else and with a heaping side of ""you're like this for life!""   I don't doubt there's a point where the negative feeling of the diagnosis does outweigh the ""am I alone with these problems? It's just *me?""* type of distress. Interesting.",False,False

It's like you cant even get help until it's too late and you're too thin.  This is the reason i keep trying to get to a worrisome LW because then someone would actually think i have a problem and i could get help and finally, maybe, get my life back and be healthy and not have this hell of an eating disorder.",False,False

I had to ask her about BPD before she admitted that she noticed ""borderline traits"" in me and sent me to a DBT program. I've heard a lot of similar stories like that. Sometimes I just want to read all of my clinicians' notes to see what else they're withholding...",False,True

My therapists and psychiatrists spent months explicitly referring to my ""hypomanic"" and even ""manic"" episodes, without ever making a formal diagnosis of bipolar (or at least not telling me about it). It took me an overdose and my second IP stay to finally get a diagnosis of BPNOS. One of my therapists also liked to say that I had ""borderline traits"" which is why she sent me to a DBT program.  There are some benefits to de-emphasizing certain diagnoses (I was reading about ""diagnostic neutrality"" in schizophrenic patients leading to positive outcomes in treatment), but at a certain point it feels like they're just saying my problems aren't bad enough to be given a diagnosis :(",False,True

When I talk about others (who haven't explicitly said they have an eating disorder) I say they have disordered eating. I do this to be sensitive. I'm not gonna diagnose or assign a label to someone even if I see the writing on the walls.  I'm also not a health professional, who respectfully should be giving out diagnoses because that's a crucial step to treatment.  Diseases/illneses/disorders are named so they can be referenced to and treated. It is incredibly dismissive and invalidating to not be diagnosed by your healthcare provider. I'm sorry you aren't getting a diagnosis.",False,False

Doctors will suggest outright lying to us because we'll react badly to the diagnosis or some similar bs.  Borderline shows remission in 80% of patients over 10 years **of consistent DBT.** Nothing else shows results like that - no meds, no other kinds of therapy.   Now, DBT still totally isn't the thing for every Borderline. But the fact that millions of BPD patients around the globe are wasting *years* of their lives, living with an extremely high degree of psychological pain, *not trying the statistically most successful treatment* because they are never told it's Borderline is an absolute injustice.",False,False

""Your eating disorder isn't a part of you, if you personize it it gets stronger.""   I get what she was saying, but it hurt more than it helped. It feels incredibly invalidating. I'm sorry you're going through this. Sending you hugs, if you want them.",False,False

When I went in the hospital a few years ago, my mom called my therapist, who said to her “mention to the inpatient guy history of her showing borderline.” And I’m like well this is the first I’m really hearing about this thanks?? So frustrating.  Or the fact everyone tip toed around saying it like both my therapist and the inpatient guy were like well you have the symptoms but we don’t jump to diagnose.  It just sucks cuz to my mom that means I don’t have it and am perfectly normal",False,False

Honestly the combination of behaviors you listed should be enough in and of themselves to warrant a diagnosis. Disordered eating patterns are a symptom of an eating disorder, among other symptoms such as anxiety, obsession, body image disturbances, etc. While not everyone who experiences disordered eating habits will have a full blown eating disorder, those habits are a huge red flag. I believe the persistence of those habits coming back up over and over indicates a full on disorder.   Maybe you could seek a second opinion! It’s infuriating to take the huge step of seeking help only to be invalidated like that. I hope you find the support you deserve OP!",False,False

Of like, almost anything ""more serious"" than depression/anxiety.  It is literally the stupidest shit and it makes me absolutely rage.  Not ""saddling yourself with the label"" when the fucking symptoms are already happening doesn't help.  It just makes us feel like nobody is taking our suffering seriously.  God I want to scream. Borderline, Bipolar, and other serious (non-eating) disorders have this problem too. People find out their doctors have had secret ""we think it's this"" notes in their file for *years* while they have been flailing in treatment, wasting money on meds that aren't right, and struggling with a sense of ""there's no diagnosis to explain this, I'm just intrinsically broken as a human."" It's so fucked!  What is ***wrong*** with mental health professionals? Ugh. I cannot understand the huge gap in empathy that seems to be so so common, when these feelings in treatment seem to be so universal for patients. Even if you don't just naturally get how *hearing that it's not ""just you"" but is a condition we recognize and others suffer from* would make you feel not alone / fundamentally broken, how have you not read about this feeling by now?   Sorry for the full blown rant, I just find this shit so irritating.   I have been in various mental health treatment for 13 years now. I hear the same things from other patients everywhere I go. The same frustrations, concerns, traumatic moments. But virtually no change in the attitudes, language choice, and methods of the providers.  I am so tired of this system that fears ""labels,"" hides information, retraumatizes patients, ignores nuance in patient language and behavior, etc.   I am so tired of having a shit system. We all deserve so much better than one that discourages you as you go along.",False,False
