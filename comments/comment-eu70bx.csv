My favorite game series possibly of all time might be the Assassins Creed games, so I definitely recommend those. You don‚Äôt have to play them in any particular order but there is kind of an overarching story to at least the first few. Though most people recommend skipping the first game and playing it later even if you go in order, since it‚Äôs mechanics are a bit different than the rest. Personally #2 is my favorite anywayüëÄ  I also just played Dishonored for the first time and it was _really_ good‚Äîit was actually something I couldn‚Äôt just finish in a weekend like I do most games. It was super interesting and there‚Äôs a lot of different stuff you can do and a couple different endings you can get!  And I know someone else recommended it already, but... Stardew Valley is pretty much the ultimate escapism game. I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd like it that much because it comes off as just a farm simulator at first but it‚Äôs sooooo much fun to play and so easy to entertain yourself with. I‚Äôve lost several hours to it lmao",False,False

I used to really like Lollipop Chainsaw, it'ssuper fun.  Also Devil May Cry. And Bayonetta. Those are hack n slash games  Also Alice: Madness Returns was suuuuuper pretty looking. Like honestly, so pretty. Story was kind of fucked up, which I like but some people might not  Also you can't go wrong with most Final Fantasies and they're always pretty  Shadow of the Colossus, I had it borrowed and didn't have the chance to finish it but it was good as far as I played   If you're ok with horror (I'm not! I'm a huge pussy!) I'd say the Silent Hill earlier games, I watched my sister and dad play it and it's really good, you'll need nerves of steel but it's awesome   I don't really play many PC games but I did play Hotline Miami 1 and 2, it's fast and fun  Oh and while technically I met it as Nintendo DS games the Ace Attorney series is really good and I think at least the Phoenix Wright part of the series is having a sale on steam right now",False,False
