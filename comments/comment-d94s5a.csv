That, according to my brain, is sick. Not where I am right now. &gt;  I've been sober for 13 years and can relate to this. I often get really odd when I'm not feeling well. Everything from having a cold or the flu to situations like what you described. The first few years after I got sober my body couldn't tell the difference between the flu and withdrawal. I had really strong cravings and nightmares when I was ""muggle sick.""   I find that now whenever I'm ill I either push through in complete denial or I fall into a depression because I somehow feel my illness is my own fault. I hold onto a lot of shame surrounding my past addiction and it often manifests as self sabotage.   When I'm stressed I restrict pretty fiercely until I crash. When I'm ill from restricting it's even worse I think because it IS my doing, or at least my illness's doing so it did it with my own hands. But I try to remember that it's not really me, ya know? It's a reflexive and crappy coping mechanism that often doesnt work for me. I'm trying to seperate my ED from my sense of self.  I wish I had something of more use to share with you. I guess all I can say is that I understand how shitty and judgmental the world can be when you have something like substance dependence in your life history. I dont believe we are bad people. I believe we  have amazing integrity and deserve better than what our culture has become.",False,False
