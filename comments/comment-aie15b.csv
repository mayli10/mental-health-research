I wait as long as I can (usually 10-4 somewhere around that time frame) then want to eat every hour on the hour! I feel like if I really had a disorder I would just be too terrified of food to think of eating. Yesterday I went up to 1175 Cal's and only burned off 150. Today I failed another fast. It sucks! I don't relate to anyone who says they're too scared to eat or keeps up their rituals or obsessively count weigh and ritualize their meals. I feel like a complete fraud compared to them or that no matter how thin I get I'll just always be a bulimic and never will be as good as they are! It sucks so much but you're not the only one!! &lt;3",False,False
