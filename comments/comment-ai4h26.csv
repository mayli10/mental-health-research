It's nice to have stomach that works. I don't think i never ever take it for granted anymore. It was a shitshow/constipation for years and it's amazing when it starts to work like how it is supposed to... or something like that :D  I was so happy when i have been pooping daily since summer. Except for now it has turned into serious constipation because i quitted smoking two weeks ago.  Nice to hear you being in recovery. Keep on going.",False,False
