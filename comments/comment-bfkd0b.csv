These industries wouldn't be as huge as they are if people didn't consistently underestimate their own beauty.",False,False

I know, for example, that people prefer reversed images of themselves because they're so used to how their reflection in the mirror looks that seeing it ""backwards"" looks wrong/offputting. That's why so many people hate themselves in photos, when other people don't necessarily see what's wrong with the photo.  Anyways, if possible I'd try not to read too much into that statistic. Other people will probably never criticize you the way you criticize yourself!",False,False

However, I will note that when I was really overweight my face in the mirror looked to me like my face looks like in photos now, after losing a lot of weight, which is odd because geniuniely I don't recognize myself in mirrors anymore. My mind is completely disconnected from my appearance I don't even know what I look like anymore- so we are not our best judges of attractiveness, for better or for worse I think, which is a bit comforting, to me, weirdly enough. Truth is, we don't really know what we look like at all- our mind can completely distort our reflections to be completely different.",False,False
