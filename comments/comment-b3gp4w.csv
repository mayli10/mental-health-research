The only advice I can offer you is to try to make the positive, affirming voices even louder than the damaging one. This could mean practicing positive affirmations, being with close friends (or family if you're able to make the drive) or doing things that you know you're good at to distract yourself. My heart goes out to you and I really hope all the best for you. ",False,False

I know that doesn't make your paranoia go away but even if that were the reason, you're better off without him.   Not to mention how he literally ended a *marriage* over Kik.   Please take things slowly and treat yourself well as you heal. This community will support you 100% so please don't give up recovery because of him. ",False,False
