Also very difficult to get to like any type of recovery but I think if people can recover from drug and alcohol addictions then I can recover from this. I don't know if I believe that because I actually think it's true or because I don't want to completely lose faith in having a normal life one day.,False,False

I think you can recover from the behavior (even if its temporary) but the thoughts and triggers will always pester you. It's up to you to fight them and want to stay in recovery. I went for a year without binging and purging but the thoughts were always there. I've recently relapsed HARD and I just dont love myself enough to try and stop again. I would like to add this may not be true for everyone but it definitely is for me.,False,False

They discuss the road to recovery and the final stages of recovery, respectively. A worthy read or listen. U can do a free trial on audible for one of these books then cancel subscription so u sont pay. Not trying to sell the book etc it's just what I did. Hope it helps. :)",False,False
