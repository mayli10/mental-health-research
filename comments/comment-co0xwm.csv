If you are medically unstable they'd certainly try to hospitalize you. However, when I first developed my ED, IP was never mentioned... they set me up with a therapist and dietician and I was supposed to (and did) gain weight on my own. I had 'only' lost about 12 lbs. If an MD did recommend IP, then you'd go through an eval at that facility, and possibly be put on a waiting list for awhile. I think it's actually more likely they'd try to treat you as an outpatient. I think if you saw a doctor they'd refer you to a dietician and a therapist.",False,False

Surely there are things you can do on your own to help yourself recover. What are you struggling with most right now? How can we help?,False,False
