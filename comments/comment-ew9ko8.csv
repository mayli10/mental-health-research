I don’t see a problem in criticizing the culture in general, but outing specific individuals solely based on speculation is a bit insensitive, especially if that’s something we would all be horrified to experience. Of course, if they admit to their problems that’s a different conversation, but assuming someone has an ED based on their figure and then vocalizing that assumption is just propagating some of the same ideas we despise.",False,True
