I can't manage my thoughts when I crave what's bad for me.   The root cause of my suffering is the desire to not suffer.

While recovery is certainly going to take a lot of conscious mental effort, part of it is training yourself to think about things other than food, even if you're thinking about it in the context of recovery. I had a wakeup call not long before I finally committed to recovering fully when I went to see Mamma Mia 2 with my sister. In the days before I had been asking myself that exact same question; what did I think about and enjoy before AN? After going to see the movie (which had been preceded by 24 hours of fasting and a two-mile run so that I had wouldn't feel guilty about having dinner out), I realized that these were the kind of things that brought me joy before -- singing, dancing, spending time with friends and family. Not being curled up in my bed at 7:30 PM (having a restrictive eating disorder is freaking exhausting), trying to figure out exactly how many calories were in a medium-sized Granny Smith apple.  &amp;#x200B;  One of the best things you can do for yourself in recovery is rediscover those things that bring you joy.
