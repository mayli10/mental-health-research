I add a little sweetener and a load of lemon juice usually just for the yums.  Everyone recommends Gatorade and shit but if you're not into flat soft drinks aka fat juice (which is basically what that sugar water is) make your own to rehydrate. ",False,False

Supplement electrolytes especially right after; if you can, get a 0 cal powder like Ultima or LyteShow because theyâ€™ll give you a lot more than sports drinks or Pedialyte will. Just speaking from experience here. Please do consider seeing an actual doctor if it persists because stuff like this can definitely have serious repercussions, and you deserve to be okay. ðŸ’›",False,False

Please make sure you are getting enough potassium/sodium/magnesium. Something like power ade/pedialyte/Gatorade type drinks can be helpful.  Purging can also cause seizures from messed up electrolytes.  Purging can also effect your blood pressure due to electrolytes like above and from the force of purging itself.   I'm saying all of this with harm reduction in mind. Please only take medical advice from a physician.,False,False
