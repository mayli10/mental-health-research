I know recovery is tough, but it's worth it in the end, I promise. I've seen people suffer through recovery and the difference between them at the end of recovery and in their ED period is astounding. You don't understand the extent of your suffering until you're on the other side IMO. I don't want to get preachy - it is ultimately your choice. I just don't want you to be discouraged by your boyfriend.  If you have to re-explain yourself and your bf doesn't understand it, there may be a problem with communication. It doesn't sound healthy if he's ignoring you and treating you like crap. I'd urge you to rethink your relationship in this case. I'm not one to say ""dump him"" all the time, but I think here it may be worth considering if this relationship is in your best interests.",False,False

If he's typically a good partner and takes your needs and feelings seriously, it might be a good idea to have a conversation with him about what you find triggering or upsetting. It's easier to handle food situations if everyone is on the same page and has the same expectations. If he's a loving partner, he should have no problem with you drawing some boundaries for your own health. It can be as simple as letting him know he needs to ask if he can have some of your food in the future. Good luck. I hope today was better!",False,False

Some of the stuff our eating disorders make us feel can't be felt or near to understood by the average person, which is why I don't think he is harming you on purpose, why would he? He gets not advantage from it. You have to look from his view of not understanding, you might just have to communicate this in great detail to him so he understands next time, he might find it silly but he has to respect it, the average person wouldn't want their food taken out of greed and maybe he was toying with that a bit.
