A big win for me. Whenever I eat something I consider ""bad"", doesn't matter how much of the thing it was, I really feel the compulsive need to purge. But I didn't and while I feel gross, I know it's good for me to push back against the urges to do that.  â€¢I brought yogurt and an apple to work even though I'd rather not eat at all until dinner. I don't know if I'll be able to have them, but I'm trying to not punish myself more for what I feel like was a ""bad thing""",False,True
