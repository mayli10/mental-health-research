I'm okay-ish where I am weight-wise, but that desire to lose just a pound or two will not let up! I have thoughts of wanting to lose weight nearly constantly, all day long. Then I drink too much and smoke too much in the evening, end up eating enough to maintain, convince myself that I'm happy about it, and then feel bummed out but not surprised that I didn't lose weight the next morning.    I'll be at a healthy BMI or only barely underweight as long as I stay within this 5lb range that I'm kinda happy with... but I really want to aim for the 5lb range below that one because it would mean I'm ""mildly"" underweight and that just feels better.",False,False

I remember it vividly and I die a little every time the reality hits me,False,True

Dainty to me is feminine and small and in need of protection/safekeeping.   I wish I was dainty too, but I don't think I will ever be. I'm too tall and broad.",False,False

Nothing has changed emotionally, I'm just fat.  To be fair though I definitely liked my body more than I do now, but I was still crazy self conscious.",False,False

That's the problem. I loved being small. I felt sexy af.  I recovered because I got scared about my health. And now I'm binging and purging and gaining weight.  ^(This has been the worst trade deal in the history of trade deals, maybe ever)",False,True

I feel like I hate myself just as much as I did when I was at my LW.  I feel so crazy self conscious about how big I am. I'm verging on obese and I hate it.,False,False
