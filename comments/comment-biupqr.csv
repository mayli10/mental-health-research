I feel like eating disorders and at least some mild form of body dysmorphia come hand in hand.   I was looking around online for a very specific band shirt and ended up only finding one in a kids’ large size. It was super cheap and exactly what I wanted, so I ordered it on a whim, totally expecting it to not fit—like at all, because I’m a Massive Trash Raccoon in person-disguise, and I just got it today and it fits, almost with room to spare.   I get moments like these often, like tangible proof that what I see in the mirror isn’t how I look in reality, but my brain just totally skips over them like they never happen.   It’s like you’ll never be small/big/muscular/sick enough for your ED. The fight never ends. I know this and it sounds so exhausting, envisioning the downhill spiral without end ahead, but I don’t know how to stop",False,False

I stg people apparently my height and 30+ lbs more than me look thinner than me.  Makes it really hard to believe the scale, so I’ll weigh myself on every scale I see trying to get some variety in. But they’re all pretty similar. So that’s something I guess. Yay.",False,False
