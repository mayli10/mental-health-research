You can't be too skinny at one weight and too fast at less than 10 lbs more. I seen on here a lot that it's kind of normal for Korean girls to be treated this way by their families, but that doesn't make it right.  I'm kind of similar to you in that I stopped growing taller very early and have always been pretty thin, but I'm about 5'6"". I'm not sure how much I weighed in high school, but in college I got up to 130 because I wasn't exercising anymore and I the available food options in residence were not healthy. Nobody ever commented my weight until I lost a lot. Even when they did it was mostly compliments. I got way down to 105 over one summer. I kind of got better for a while and managed to barely get to back to a healthy weight, but then I lost 3 lbs again recently and my mom said out of nowhere that my clothes were hanging off of me. The jeans I was wearing were men's jeans which typically don't go below a 27"" waist so they were definitely really big on me, but I wear those all the time and the shirt I had on actually felt kind of tight. I'm sure my mom made that comment out of concern though because she knows about my anorexia. Respectful/reasonable people typically don't comment on others' weight unless they have a good reason to or they're trying to be nice. You shouldn't have to put up with people addressing you with every thought they have about you appearance. Even if they do I guess you could always just tell yourself that it's a reflection of their own insecurities. Don't let other people's negativity get you down.",False,False
