I would advise strongly against it. I struggled with it for years. It’s better than purging imo as it doesn’t fuck with your electrolytes but I would still warn anyone away from it. I still have nightmares about relapsing back into it.",False,False

I don't c/s a horrible amount, but the worst that's ever happened to me is just guilt over wasted food and temporary jaw pain (since I already have TMJ) when I really go overboard.  I wouldnt say it's horrible if the alternatives are worse physically or emotionally, but you do start to mildly crave doing it in my experience. The only real thing that keeps me in check is living with others.     ",False,False
