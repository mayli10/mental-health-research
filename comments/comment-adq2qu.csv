It had been over 4 days since the last time. I've tried to keep up on water and I already eat a lot of veggies for fiber. So I had my husband go get milk of magnesia last night (supposed to be gentle)ðŸ™ŠIt worked and cleared everything out I guess but TMI had a lot of diarrhea so idk maybe it wasn't a problem needing fixed?? ,False,False

I also have been thinking that maybe my high protein intake has been causing the digestive problems since I don't exercise nearly enough for all of that protein to be going towards muscle development.

Before trying lax tea I would recommend Miralax. Its very safe &amp; gentle compared to senna/bisacodyl. Good luck! x",False,False

Itâ€™s pretty normal when youâ€™re restricting though, your digestive muscles are like the rest of your muscles and tend to atrophy a bit when not in use. Less food and less requirements = less use and eventually less ability to do their job. I have senna tea when it gets really bad because I prefer that over harsher lax and stool softeners take too long when I am feeling uncomfortable. It usually eventually fixes itself when you start to eat more though. I have a friend who had to be put on some lax while IP because she had been restricting for so long her body still wasnâ€™t passing anything even with normal intake. I think it took her about a month to become regular again ",False,False
