The name makes me giggle every damn time I eat the shredded pork carnitas flavor. The other ones are more, but imo not as tasty anyway   Trader Joe’s chicken potstickers are low. Can’t remember exactly how many, but love those things  Lean cuisine meatloaf and mashed potatoes 240 if memory serves?   Lean cuisine spaghetti and meatballs is 260   FWIW Blakes Has fantastic shepherds pie, it is a solid 330 calories so a little higher but so good!",False,False
