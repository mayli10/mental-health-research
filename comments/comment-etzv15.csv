I‚Äôm still losing at a faster rate than ‚Äúnormal‚Äù due to being obese so it‚Äôs quicker to fall off, but not as rapidly as I was and I get all wound up about it. I think I need to learn patience lmao",False,True

Someone tiny will lose weight very slowly, because they are already on ""battery saver mode"" metabolically speaking and don't require as much energy.",False,False

I accidentally solved this exact problem in my own body by restricting a specific macronutrient in the context of an ad libitum diet. I'm still amazed I only have mild orthorexia (TW fear foods &gt;!my only fear foods are my undiagnosed allergies (chia and hazelnut), vegetables (I don't really fear them... I have just heard too much about oxalates, and so don't eat enough vegetables to make it financially viable to eat any vegetables. NEVER listen to people who talk about oxalates if you are prone to disordered eating) and peanut (because apparently the lectin can give you heart disease) - the other foods i don't eat, I just don't eat. I keep them in the house (for guests) and I don't feel a need to eat them.!&lt;).",False,False

I‚Äôm not underweight though, I‚Äôm obese. I‚Äôve lost 110+ lbs since July (mainly from August), but I‚Äôve still got a lot to lose. From August-October it fell off rapidly, but it‚Äôs slower a lot since mid October despite restricting more.",False,True

""I haven't eaten allll dayyyy"" (no you literally just ate a biscuit wdym). maybe she lost a bit more than 1kg and just counted it as 2kg. it can also be down to loads of other random factors like water/food/poop/etc weight -- my weight, for instance, can fluctuate up to 2kg in a single day lol",False,False
