You also will not really be able to put on muscle if you are well below your TDEE... Doing some walking and light stretching should be good to get you in the habit though.   The most important thing is to start slow and fun. If you make your workout a drag you will stick with it less, it will tax your self-control even more. If you start slow and do things you actually enjoy, then it can become a fun thing you do to reduce stress. Do not try to find the ""optimal"" or ""perfect"" workout as this will just feed your ED.
