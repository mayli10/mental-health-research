If that resonates with you at all, just know it is your disordered brain trying to convince you it is actually good for you.  If you do seek recovery, bring that up with whoever you start seeing. They will probably tell you to find some hobbies- it may seem stupid, like ""it's not that easy"" but if you really spend time doing some research and exploring new things you can find a more beautiful side to life. Like, a garden doesnt care how skinny you are. And online community for paintings of litter cats wearing hats wont ask for your BMI. You will find many things in life that you can then point to and say- if I become underweight again, stop nourishing myself again, I wont have energy for that. I want to stay healthy so I can enjoy and live my life.  If only i could follow my own advice.  Good luck, even to consider recovery is a big first step!",False,False

Oddly enough, the only thing that has made me less scared of weight gain is actually gaining the weight and finding out that it's not as bad as I expected. It was super uncomfortable at first but then I'd actually have days where I'd feel okay about my body as my mind started to catch up with the physical changes. Unfortunately now I'm back on my bullshit, but know when I start to gain again I'm actually gonna be okay.",False,False
