At the beginning of the year my weight loss was a journey to get back in touch with myself and the needs of my body and 65lbs later I’m like hahahahaha I know all the tricks it’s all coming back to me now.   I think the worst part is that I get to much kudos irl for my miraculous body transformation and I’m just like oh yeah there isn’t a single person in my life currently outside of my family that knew me back when I was sick this magic trick is brand new to these guys and not the old coat I pulled out of the closet.,False,False

I've known for awhile that my teeth are trash, but like you, I am unable to quit purging. I hope that you are doing well and I hope that one day, we both won't be burdened by this disease.",False,True

I would hate for another oesophageal exam because mine will probably be fucked now forever and I’ve returned to purging. I always forget how bad it fucks me over until an example hits like a couple minutes ago when I asked my sister for a cigarette and sounded like I’d already smoked a hundred today.   Instead I’ll be quietly pleased when someone says “damn your voice is so deep/husky/sexy” tomorrow because I am a pile of trash,False,False

The most in touch I have been with how the ED has control of my life is when I realized I was terrified of losing my teeth,  yet I was still unable to stop purging.  The worst part is that in the end there was no great turn around after I was catapulted out of denial. I hit “rock bottom”  a few years ago and have been hanging out here ever since.",False,False

My therapist actually told me that I should see a doctor to have them look at my oesophagus because of my long history with bulimia. I hate this shit but I'm a creature of habit.,False,True

I tore my oesophagus when I was like 21/22 and at the time I was still hella overweight and was all aboard the good ship “I’m not skinny so it’s not a problem it’s a plan”,False,False
