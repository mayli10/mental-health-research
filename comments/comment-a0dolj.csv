Everyone has the right to be in a bad mood and to want some alone time.   Be careful though, isolation is a symptom of common mental disorders and brings more room for your ED to develop.

If you feel that badly about being mean to your friend, you can always recognize/acknowledge that hurt you've caused and explain to her where your own insecurities and feelings were coming from and apologize.  Even then you shouldn't have to feel obligated to spend time with/support her to make up for it. Some people like to take care of others when they're feeling down and many others need to find solace within themselves especially when feeling overwhelmed. Ultimately, it's important to take care of yourself before you take care of others. Don't beat yourself up too much over this, you deserve love on your own terms as well xxxxxxxx❤️❤️❤️❤️",False,False

You have the right not to hang with someone, WHENEVER. especially very soon after the worst day of your life.  It is weird that you were salty and mean but you are likely suffering a bit of anxiety and it's causing difficulty processing some feelings.... causing you to lash out?  Just a guess",False,False
