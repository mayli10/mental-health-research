Every time someone meets Lisbeth Salander they describe her as ‚Äúanorexic‚Äù, though the author goes out of the way to describe her eating multiple sandwiches in one sitting and what not, very manic pixie dream girl if you ask me. Anyway, the thing that annoys me the most is that they explicitly say that she‚Äôs 4‚Äô11‚Äù and 90 pounds, which is skinny but definitely not anorexic. ",False,False

I give major credit to all people who join in January and wish them nothing but success, but I just don't feel like trying to find a machine that's open. I used to go to the gym at midnight or later, but have changed it to midday since my car died.   It's pretty empty at 2pm thankfully, but right now the swimming pool is full of people standing doin nothing and never leaving room for those of us wanting to swim laps.   Until then, I'm using January to focus on getting the eating part right. When I put too much on myself at once, I will crash and burn. January is to ease back into things and I'm doing great! I'm working on yoga and stretching and getting things moving again so that I won't die at the gym. I'm also making sure I eat 'real' food every day so that I have the energy to work out.   I've always been a sugar junkie and I've gone 6 days without anything sweet or artificial! I feel so much better already. ",False,False

I had a doctors visit 2 months ago and then another 2 days ago: lost a pound between them. Doesn't matter, I ""KNOW"" I have blimped up. Like, my goal pants feel more tight and you can NOT deny the validity of goal pant fitting....  Right?  I don't even know anymore lol I do know this shit sucks though, hang in there friend.  I think it's the ""settling in"" phase where you drop weight, feel like a slender amorphous glorious butterfly released from its fat cocoon only to fall back into the ""oh wait no I'm still gross"" way of thinking. Don't let it get the best of you, hold on to those tangible measurements when you start to feel yourself slipping down the rabbit hole. Some days/weeks are just bad feeling but you have concrete evidence that you haven't become the Stay Puft guy.  Good luck and of course stay safe and as healthy as possible.
