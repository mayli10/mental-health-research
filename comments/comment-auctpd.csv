Physics is physics. If you’re confident that your math re: CICO is correct, then there’s no way, short of having a very rare metabolic disorder, that you’re not burning body fat. So if the scale isn’t moving there has to be another reason: water retention, hormones (I know you’re a dude but dudes have hormones right?), food weight, waste weight (ahem), the position of mercury in relation to Jupiter’s third moon, whatever. Reevaluate your math and if it’s coming out the same, you’re good. ",False,False
