They nonjudgmentally acknowledged it (like, ""Okay, thanks.""), and respected when I told them I didn't want them to explain too much about what they were going to do to my teeth, and they proceeded to apply the protective white coating stuff (I don't know what it's called).  They never comment on how much my teeth have deteriorated or try to make me talk about my behaviours.  They just recommend products that can help manage the symptoms.  My mouth feels a lot better these days.  OP, telling your dentist is a good idea.  They, among all nonspecialist practitioners, are doctors who can tangibly and immediately make your ED symptoms more manageable.",False,False

First of all, they likely know something is up if they don’t already suspect bulimia in the first place. Second of all, they’ve seen it all. It’s like the first few times you go to the gyno, you’re all “omg but they’re going to see my vagina!” And the reality is, they’ve seen a lot of vaginas and I mean a LOT and it doesn’t even phase them. What is it that you think the worst that can happen will be? I totally get it’s nerve wracking and embarrassing etc. but I feel like, worst case, you just switch dentists and never call them again if the experience ends up being bad. But I’m betting they will still be nice and just want to help you. Sorry, that wasn’t my best pep talk. But I really hope you’re able to ask them for the help you need.",False,False
