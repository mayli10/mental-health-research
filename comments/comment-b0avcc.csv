YOu could always go in person or email instead if you want, but im sure giving a call and telling them ""hey, i keep getting the runaround and never get a call back. can you please escalate this to someone who will call me so i can set up the appointment i need?""  i promise they will take you seriously even if you dont go in at a new lw. I went in at a normal weight and they still took me seriously and my vitals were still even kinda shitty anyways. do what you feel is best for you,its hard but you have to be your own advocate",False,False
