One of the things I really think about now is I do NOT want a hunched over spine when I am older. I look good right now and I want to look good my whole life :-),False,False

Even after the news I'm still unmotivated to restore weight, I thought at least it would give me a kick up the bum.",False,True

Does that make sense? So, I haven't engaged in behaviors to a level where it has hurt my physical health much. If I were in and out of being underweight I doubt I'd have made the same gains in bone density.",False,False

I haven't had a period for years, got close to weight restored and got it three times in one month, then lost it again upon losing weight.",False,True

It's great to know that bone density can improve over time. After weight restoring were you still engaging in ed behaviours? I'm worried that even if I weight restore I'll still engage in behaviours and it'll stuff up my bones further anyway.,False,True

I'm 32 now and in February had another dexa scan. I've been at a healthy weight from age 17 to now, bone density is up 10 percent. Check my post history from February of this year for more info, happy to answer questions too. I'm sorry to hear about your diagnosis. FWIW I didn't make any super immediate changes when I got my diagnosis either.",False,False

I've also stopped my periods many times and have barely had them consistently ever and I'm 21, so that's another big red flag.  Yeah, they told me to do PT and get in a walking cast but I refused and continue to do 5-12 miles a day on it. I did rest it for about 5 weeks back in May-June but got impatient",False,False

I honestly was telling myself that I wasn't that sick so it wouldn't happen to me.  Could the stress fracture also not be healing because you aren't resting it enough?

I knew it was a possible consequence and almost expected the outcome not to be great.   I don't eat dairy, but my calcium levels have always been fine on blood tests, so my GP has said it's most likely related to hormones and low body weight.",False,True

I hope it doesn't turn into osteoporosis. How did you start suspecting you have osteopenia? I'm freaking out a little, because my ankles have been hurting for a week, and I have this fear that they're fractured, because my bones have become weak, because I cut out almost all dairy. I'm going to call a doctor on Monday.",False,False
