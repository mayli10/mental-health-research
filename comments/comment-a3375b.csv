Two eggs and cereal sounds like a perfectly healthy meal and is also way too little for a growing teenager if that's all you've eaten all day, so I don't know what the fuck your mom's on.",False,False

That's a super long time, I've never fasted that long! Please take care of yourself, and dont feel bad over such a small amount of calories!

Gonna be the building blocks of muscle. The cereal might help keep you full. Maybe you can try downing a big glass of water, and some green tea later. Would it help if you focused your energy on planning your next high-volume and nutritious meal? Iâ€™m sorry you are feeling poorly. Itâ€™s ok to break your fast with food your body and brain needs.
