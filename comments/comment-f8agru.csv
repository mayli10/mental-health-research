I've learned that the people who do EKG's are always extremely kind. More often than not, they try to make conversation with me and are very easygoing. They have you pull up your shirt and pull up your jeans slightly. Make sure not to wear skinny jeans, because they have to put wires on your ankles and if the jeans are too tight, they can mess with blood circulation when pulled up. They always let me keep on a bra when doing it. Just make sure it's not wired because they have to put stickers and wires underneath. EKG's only take about five minutes. It's very quick and easy and you really don't know when they are monitoring your heart rate or not. They stick on the wires, stand at the computer for a bit and talk to you, and you're done. I had several holter monitors in my lifetime. They do help pick up on palpitations that happen only rarely, but you should only get one if your cardiologist recommends it. They're more for people who have a heart conditions, or for people they're concerned may have one, to get a better idea of what's going on and how they can help. If there is something actually wrong, the EKG would pick it up. If you're really concerned and feel like it didn't do anything for you, then for sure request a holter monitor. They'll definitely pick up anything that the EKG did not.",False,False

If there's anything going on in your heart *all the time* to cause these episodic issues the ECG should show it, otherwise your Dr might have you do the holter. The holter monitor is kind of annoying bc you can feel it's there but also not anything more unpleasant than that. IME if you have a non-under wire bralette/sports bra on they should be ok with you keeping it on, especially if you ask, as well as any other clothes you like. It takes no time at all for the ECG to get done and the only uncomfy thing is the cold uhh ""probes"" if your clinic has metal ones üòÖ it's super chill and nothing to be worried about ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False
