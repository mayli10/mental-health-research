Here's my ghetto dollar store self-care spa day, everything is only a buck each so I can go all out:  * Bath Bomb * Face Mask (rn my Dollar Tree has some Yes to Tomatoes ones and some Bolero ones) * Bolero Foot Mask * Pumice Stone * Some kind of decent smelling conditioner * Shower Cap * A couple scented candles   1. Make a nice cup of tea. 2. Use as much conditioner as necessary to completely saturate your hair, then tuck it all up under the shower cap to marinate. 3. Run the bath, light the candles. 4. Apply face mask. 5. Add bath bomb. 6. Enjoy your bath. I like to watch a garbage movie (The Princess Switch on Netflix was godawful, I loved it), or read a book, enjoy my tea, pumice my feet, thoroughly shave, etc. 7. After the bath shampoo and condition your hair as usual, and apply the foot mask. 8. Trim and shape fingernails, and after the foot mask do the same for your toesies.  Sometimes I'll even do like a steam soak for my face with a hot towel, or follow up with a dermaroller.  I always whiten my teeth and do an extra thorough cleaning of them too.  If you can't get to the store for any of this you can totally diy it. I make bubble bath with a gentle liquid body soap, egg white, and honey. You can do a face mask with ground oats, Greek yogurt, and honey, and a sugar scrub with almond oil, coconut oil, and honey.   ❤️  ",False,False
