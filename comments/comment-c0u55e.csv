Privacy is going out the window - big websites don't care about it, and the new generation coming onto the internet doesn't think about it enough to care.  Even though it's disproportionate, I find this aspect of it the most concerning. The minority who care are sometimes dismissed on claims of being crazy, suspect, or unwilling to evolve with and adjust to emerging changes in society.    I wish there was a way to get more people my age and younger to realize (or care about) just how easy it is to learn a lot of personal information about them just with a Google search. Yellow Pages' (or whatever the name was) successors are so easy to access, and looking for myself and my family in them has made me realize just how easy it is endanger them. All you would ever need is their name. I hate it so much. But maybe I've forgotten how much information was shared in phone books.",False,False
