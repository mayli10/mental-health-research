That’s why some people go on a diet and then develop an eating disorder. It’s definitely a delicate tango between weight loss and anorexia but for some it starts with weight loss.,False,False

A lot of issues with people not understanding ED's is it is hard to understand something if the people who have the issue never talk about it or discuss it. And the rare chance they do it is usually in a defensive or aggressive or hurt tone. So speaking up in a rationale detailed and knowledgeable way without emotion is the only way society at large can start to understand ED's. Being rationale and speaking without emotion is critical to getting people to listen and hear you.,False,False

I also work in a restaurant (kitchen staff, which is probably ironic somehow). I've been in VERY similar situations... recently a manager was making comments about how she could never be anorexic because she ""loves food too much"", among other things.   I just smile and nod. You are NOT a coward. Its not our job to educate the world, especially when we're still struggling. You don't have to feel bad for keeping your privacy. You don't owe it to anyone to try to correct their very wrong ideas. They probably wouldn't listen anyway, and there's no point in making your life hard when there's literally no benefit for anyone.",False,False
