I empathize, my mom has disordered eating and my dad even moreso. I normalized a lot of disordered things as a kid bc they were my main models for eating behavior. Also growing up without consistent food in the house made me want to binge at restaurants, friend's houses, etc.  I think a lot of diet culture stuff is so normalized that your dad, and others, see his behaviors as ""healthy"" versus disordered and potentially triggering.",False,False

When I told my parents about my bulimia my dad was just like «doesn’t everybody throw up when they eat to much, though? Its not a disorder, I do it all the time», and my mom is pretty much anorexic. Makes recovery almost impossible.",False,False
