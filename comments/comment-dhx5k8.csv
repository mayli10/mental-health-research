Someone posted a link where you can compare your age/sex/BMI to different countries and I was definitely in the higher percentile.,False,False

Idk that’s really confusing to me since I’ve never seen it defined like that.   In recent years, I’ve been mainly exposed to the way USA government organizations (NHANES, CDC) uses weight and BMI percentiles  Ex. https://ibb.co/RzyTHZ7 https://ibb.co/s3HN0sB  Source:  https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_03/sr03_039.pdf   Similarly these are the 3rd, 5th, &amp; 10th BMI percentiles  for children &amp; adult’s 9-20years.  https://ibb.co/3T9sFKK  Source:  it was included on the EAT-26 scoring/interpretation  http://www.nyeatingdisorders.org/pdf/EAT-26IntpretScoring-Test-3-20-10.pdf     This also matches the way I was first exposed to weight-BMI percentiles medically. Back when I was a kid I was considered to have childhood obesity because my weight at my height/age/sex put me above the 95th weight percentile. I’ve never seen it defined the opposite way.",False,False

I don’t know if I’m phrasing it right.   Sometimes I feel like I freaking transcended EDs sometimes and my entire personality is just abnormal eating habits and major persistent depression.  Middle Childhood (7-9) — Overweight, Compulsively over ate, emotionally over ate, &amp; legitimate eating addiction that wasn’t b.e.d idc that’s not in the DSM.  *Diagnosed with mental illness at this point but not EDs... well except for Pica kinda embarrassing ngl*  Mid-Childhood (PreTeen) — all of the above, +binge eating +childhood obesity  13-15 — Normal weights when at this age but ...awkward eating habits, idk how to describe it. Had conquered my eating addiction &amp; binge eating while still having some issues with emotional eating. In between periods of eating healthy I’d have periods of always being ‘on a diet’ or ‘cutting down’ on something or crash dieting. *BTW my Pica was gone before this...it just kinda went away, idk what happened*  Rest of teenage years — subclinical restrictive eating, EDNOS-P. Those two eventually joined forces with my other mental illnesses to become Anorexia Nervosa which would become a problem for years to come. At age 19 I also had a Compulsive exercising problem along with AN.  20 to present — certain behaviors involving restriction, purging, compulsive exercising became a problem again at some point for at least some brief period. Also problems with binge eating, emotional over eating and, alcoholism contributed to me becoming obese again.   I relapsed into my Anorexia N ‘a couple’ times, including the most recent relapse when i quit drinking and had no other ways of coping with life my family life being tragic and life in general being shit.   Right now I’m just trying to eat healthy, not gain a single damn pound but not cross into Underweight territory again either.",False,False

I'm like you, I will eat anywhere from idk 1000? on IF days to 1800 on regular days and like I don't hate my body the way it looks that much? I just hate how it operates and doesn't lose weight. I'm obsessed with the scale and measurements and numbers but like idk I go out to eat way more often than I think a normal calorie-fearing person would. I hate the term EDNOS though. I just consider myself a disordered eater with a hint of body dysmorphia.  edit: I was actually trying to fit myself back into the anorexia DSM diagnosis but the only thing I seem to qualify for is intense fear of gaining weight. My weight is low for someone my age but not severely. I'm just in like the 90th percentile or something. I do qualify for ""mild anorexia in partial remission"" though lol.

I can relate, I don't know what my disorder is, my binges are not the bulimics' typical binges, and I throw up whenever I feel guilty, but I fast too, and when I do restrict, i don't go below 700, sometimes I eat super clean, other times just junk...
