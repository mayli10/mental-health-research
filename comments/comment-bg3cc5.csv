I go to a gym that's packed with lots of BIG guys in the free weights section, so I usually just grab some of the smaller weights and scurry upstairs to work where less people can see me. I'm PMing you the app that I use for exercise ideas because I don't know if I can post it, it's free and one of the best ones I've tried!",False,False

I've used some of the machines a few times but I'm honestly not quite sure how to actually do it the correct way, like how many I should do and how much I should wait between reps, and what exactly is a rep. At home I never have the motivation to actually do anything.",False,True

If it's too hard, start with very small weights (like a few lbs) and look up some simple exercises. Add in some body weight exercises like calf raises, wall push-ups, ect. and work your way up by adjusting the exercises and adding weight slowly. The best part about beginning strength training is that just about everything you do can be done at home with minimal special equipment!",False,False
