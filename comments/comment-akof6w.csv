It wouldnt be right be me to give you qualified advice but i can share things which have helped me?       Finding another method of self-care/taking care of your health or appearance can help diffuse that sense of control into something aside from food. I started doing my nails and found a physical activity which i really love. Overexcersizing is a danger so if you think that is something you are at risk of then obvs dont do that. However if you think that doing a bit of bodyweight excersize or a sport would help you then go for it.       For me, developing a bit of muscle tone and progressively learning new things and challenging my body was both a distraction and an alternative way to ""push"" myself, where the result was positive. I still go through bad patches but finding other outlets has only been helpful. It feels really good to finally learn something you couldnt do before, like a handstand or a pull-up. And it makes you appreciate your bodys capability more so you may treat it with more care.        I also like to draw. Mostly repetitive and detailed patterns but it helps me relax a bit.  I dont know you irl so i dont know what kind of things you enjoy but im sure youll find something to help you get the ball rolling with making lil changes. :)       Do you have support or anyone you can vent to or give you guidance, health wise?",False,False

Whenever I get anxious I always associate it with something that i've eaten and its controlling my life, I don't know what to do. I know its because I feel so powerless over my anxiety im desperate to externalise it and pin it down to food being the cause and therefore it's something I can control.   &amp;#x200B;  Yeah defnitely, if you have any tips I would be so grateful because im really freaked out at the moment, i'm scared ive got some underlying health issue despite having so many tests that prove otherwise, I just want my life back.

Its been something ive been looking into myself, its been difficult to get an actual appointment but i have been doing a lot of research on the subject, audiobooks, podcasts, lectures and the like. I hope my comment wasnt misconstrued as like.. ""if you think hard enough it can go away!"", which judging by the downvotes it may have been.         Disorders are an illness of the mind, but we *do* have some control over how we handle them. This doesnt make them any less real and it doesnt make it our fault it just means that you *do* get to assert control over who you are instead of letting your mind control you. Psychiatric illnesses are often our body's correct response but to the wrong context.",False,False

The thoughts you have influence your habits and behaviour and learning to control them is like a muscle...it may be hard at first because its new, and sometimes its easier to stick with what you know even if it makes you feel bad, than attempt something new and feel overwhelmed or scared of failure, but just like a muscle it will get stronger the more you work it out.       The same things happen with negative thoughts, if you have them all the time your brain just autopilots and automatically thinks them and the neural pathways get stronger.. so the sooner you can re-wire your brain to be kinder to you the better, but it is never too late. Even if its just taking a small step.",False,False

It sounds like you might have a little of that, but it actually sounds like you may be developing a restrictive, food avoidant disorder. You should definitely talk to a doctor or a free clinic if theres one you can go to. My heart goes out to you, anxiety is such a beast.",False,False
