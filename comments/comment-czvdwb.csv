There will be super hard days but you really have to push through or else your life will be short and miserable.   I can’t help a lot since I’m not going great but I hope you really try! :)  This is my recovery insta account btw: @recovery.diary.eats",False,True

Any doctor I’ve been to has been concerned but in the nicest way “I don’t know if you’ve always been this petite” is probably the only comment I got regarding looks. Nurses and doctors should know to not comment on appearance at all - their focus is supposed to be on internal health anyway?!  For sure!! I hope you’re okay,False,True

I’ve always been healthy weight/slightly under so I was never ever complimented by family members on my weight loss it was always concerns but to my ED it felt like compliments - it was people my age and peers who praised me,False,True

I'm not underweight... in fact, I've been overweight for a while now... so even though I've been dropping weight faster than is probably healthy, people are *so enthusiastic* about my ""progress"".   Not gonna lie... its kinda nice having the support, even though they don't know what they're supporting. It's nice not to have to battle between the ED voices, and those of my friends and family.

The range of sizes perceived as “fit looking” is expanded downward when most idols/celebs/VSmodels maintain BMIs in the &gt;!17 something to 19 something!&lt; range. I noticed this range is often considered to be “aspirational fit”. Back in my teenage years I didn’t realize just how many celebs had underweight and on the border of  underweight BMIs. It also made me irritated a lot back when holier-than-though “fitspo” bloggers were popular because they criticized anyone who used the term “Thinspo” because so many of them failed to realize half of the fitspo they posted was of women with underweight BMIs",False,False

People should just not base health on sometimes outside appearance. Like why do people think I look “healthier” now that I’m actually unhealthy compared to my lovely healthy body pre Ed? It’s messed up. I feel like everyone just wants to be deadly skinny or lean muscle these days. (Including me :/ ),False,True
