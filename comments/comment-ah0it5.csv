I learned things in treatment and rehab I never would have dreamt up on my own, but it was another day in the life for the doctors there. I’ve heard from a bunch of professionals in the fields of addiction and behavioural research that people with eating disorders are some of the most deceptive individuals out there, sometimes without even realizing it. They would catch me in things that I had no idea were totally, undeniably symptomatic (several of which I have seen in Dray’s videos....). Because eating disorders don’t require a ‘substance’ in the sense that most addictions do, individuals suffering from them will get so ‘smart’ about the disorder; they’re often very intelligent, highly organized, disciplined people with a tendency towards perfectionism. It’s the perfect combination for learning every deflection method in the book, I can’t imagine what it would be like to be someone who knows exactly what kind of questions or tests are going to need deflecting from other doctors in the first place.",False,False

I really didn't mean to come off as defending her. I have my personal opinion on whether she has an ED, and she definitely blocks certain words in her comments.  Side note shes mentioned in videos that in college she was a big drinker of diet coke and crystal light, if that isn't laughably obviously I don't know what is.",False,False

She’s also pretty childish, but she uses big words to hide it.  It’s not surprising we never see or hear about her friends. When I watch her videos I do not see a mature, confident and responsible woman; I see someone who lives for validation and approval from others, especially her mom. Eugenia and Dray aren’t so different, only we weren’t necessarily as complicit in the start of her disordered behaviour, but we are damn well advocating for Dray to keep going. She is literally covered in lanugo, and everyone just thinks it’s okay.",False,False

I 100% agree with your sentiment (if I'm understanding it correctly) that non- ED people's judgments are largely based on their ignorance and sometimes their stereotypes around EDs. But I think youtube tends to jump down the throats of young, attractive, ""influencers"" who cater to younger audiences or very obviously base their platform on their appearance (in an obvious or non- obvious way). For example its very popular in the vegan community to attack influencers for ""promoting anorexia"", etc.  The most glaring issue with Eugenia is that she is an adult who lives with her family, adopts childish mannerisms/behaves in an intentionally immature way, bases lots of content around modelling clothes...  Dr Dray is a professional who vlogs her everyday life and gives evidence of herself being a ""functional"" person, including videos cooking and eating. Of course this is where I think theres a lot of ignorance around orthorexia and ""if a person is eating they clearly can't be anorexia"".  I'm sorry this ended up so long. I'm not trying to defend her behavior I'm just trying to speculate on people without ED's views.",False,False

Doctors and psychologists would be telling them that every little rationality they could muster in their brain was the ED talking. “It’s the disorder, you’re not yourself, you can’t think clearly.”  But because she is a doctor, we all come to her defense and say “she knows better!”  The Golden State Killer was a police officer. It’s the pros who know how to do it best.   I’ve been in treatment with medical professionals. They get eating disorders too. Everybody pretending like it doesn’t happen isn’t helping her, it’s just weird. Cool, she’s smart and has an education. So does that mean that everyone else who has an eating disorder must be stupid? Intelligent people can’t possibly fall victim to eating disorders? Well, the data doesn’t back that up. It makes me really angry that two hundred and something thousand people will defend her because they like what she has to say about skincare, like it isn’t possible to be good at your job and have mental health struggles at the same time.  “Sorry Eugenia, hope you don’t kill yourself, but Dr. dray, you’re cool as long as you can tell me how to get rid of this wrinkle between my eyebrows.” is YouTube’s attitude toward this subject in general.  (“She’s a gymnast/dancer/ice skater” isn’t a defense... especially at competitive levels, encouraging disordered behaviour is pretty notorious in these sports. It’s a reason to get even more help. If you have tendencies toward disordered behaviour and have a history of these activities, you may need some extra support to learn healthy lifestyle choices.)",False,False
