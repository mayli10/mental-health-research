Think of your doctor as someone who is discovering with you what strategy works and which weapons are best to fight your ed to take control over your mind and body back.    This takes time and no one is cured in a single session.   It's difficult, but it is possible and it's very much worth it.",False,False

Alas, no.   Good doctors and therapists truly can help. They can make observations and suggestions based on their greater knowledge/experience/perspective. But the actions have to be mine. The willingness to sit through the discomfort of change has to be mine. But the new life will also be...*mine*.",False,False
