I do it because I find if I have a higher protein intake, I tend to have lower calorie days while staying relatively full, have more energy, and less likely to binge.",False,False

More recently, after trying keto and then (off keto) training for a half marathon I pay some attention to carbs and fats. Calories and protein still dominate my thinking and choices though, especially when restricting significantly.   I used to avoid fat whenever possible because the caloric density scared me - I wanted more volume for my calorie allowance than things with fat could offer me. Having experienced how some fats can really provide great satiety I’m much less afraid now. I buy higher fat %  cottage cheese than I used to for example.",False,False

Don’t be scared of fat if you can, remember that fats are crucial for our hormones. I pay attention to protein now, and let everything else kinda fall wherever. I try not to be too strict about carbs and fats anymore but I’m still conscious about them.",False,False
