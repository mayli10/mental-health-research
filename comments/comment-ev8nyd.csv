Not a fan of supporting her due to her... scummy behavior.    Thanks for the update- Iâ€™ve been away from her situation for a few months and was wondering what was up with her.,False,False

But she posted a video a couple days ago, she's allegedly down like 50 lbs, but idk how reliable her account of her weight is. Our gorl is a known liar/manipulator but I've still got hope for her. I'm hoping it's not another infamous 89lb situation but ultimately her fate is in her own hands so we'll see.  I should probably also mention that I have only watched her actual videos a handful of times, I don't want to support her or feed into (lol) her lifestyle, so I watch mirrors and a loooot of commentary videos. I super recommend y'all do the same if you're interested in her, Freelee, or any other extreme diet YouTubers!",False,False

Like when I was obese I thought I was eating so little, but really it was that I didn't know shit about nutrition and I was eating super calorie dense foods. But I've also met underweight people that swear they eat a ton, but really they usually focus on healthier/lower calorie foods or don't eat as much as they think. I find those sorts of mindsets in different body types super fascinating, I just love to hear people's assessments of their own diets and relationships with food.    Idk I just love to hear people talk about their diets in general though. I watch a wide variety of YouTube channels focused on diets, mostly at the extremes. Freelee and ALR are my go-tos because their lifestyles are so opposite one another and both are honestly so alien to me. But my middle of the road, reasonable and sustainable queen is Unnatural Vegan. Her give-a-shit-but-kinda-actually-not is goals for me.",False,False

From my underweight best friend (without an ED, just a small appetite and prefers healthy stuff), to my slender coworker (eats like trash, but smallish portions and few meals), to my super healthy but obese friend (no greasy food, just huge portions).   Itâ€™s weird how much variety there is in peopleâ€™s diet types and weight.",False,False
