In this case of me gaining 5ibs, I usually lose 2-3 after a few days but hang on to the rest until I restrict really hard and wont see it come off until a week later. I havent been able to lose weight because of it, so i am slowly gaining somehow.",False,True

With that, I realize it's probably water weight, I mean I get a little bloated but not very. but the weight gained never entirely goes away. So... for example, gaining the 5 ibs in three days, 3 ibs will come off within 3 days, but I retain 2 of those pounds. Like.. it takes a week after that of me heavily restricting to get back to where i started. So that keeps me stuck in the same place it's so frustrating. ",False,True

It's like trying to run a 4½ liter V6 with a fuel pump off a 2 liter I4. It's going to work, barely. Things might break down (in a human body, you might waste muscle. In a truck, you might lean out and detonate a cylinder when you put your foot down).  This is why to keep losing on high-carb semi-starvation you have to drop calorie further than on euinsulinemic semi-starvation (which for some people with a high genetic carbohydrate tolerance may be extremely high carbohydrate).  Your body isn't going to give up fat when the insulin level is too high.  When the fuel is available (calorie restriction with liberated fat stores in a fat person, or a fully-fed state that is not trying to store) you can run at the full RPM and you're not falling over.  I've found I'll naturally calorie restrict (and it doesn't feel like starvation, because it's not) if I'm just eating protein and fat and if I have weight to lose. I just don't feel hangry. Presently I don't restrict much because I'm at minimum weight.",False,False

When you’re in a prolonged deficit your body will also try to save energy, but not in the old “starvation mode” myth people think where you just stop burning calories lmao. You’ll basically just have less energy, maybe become less fidgety than you naturally are and your NEAT (non- exercise activity thermogenesis) will decrease. So you’ll subconsciously not pave around / fidget as much or whatever. It doesn’t make a huge difference, but w these factors combined, yeah you’ll burn less calories. Your metabolism doesn’t just stop though, and that’s p much the whole truth to “starvation mode”",False,False

I’m going through something similar, too. do you get any other symptoms? 5 lbs over a few days is definitely not all fat but if you’ve been eating under your calculated maintenance for a long period and then being to eat around that number, your body will retain as much water as possible and digest slowly. other folks can get away with eating slightly above maintenance without seeing major fluctuations but for many folks w ED, our baseline is nutrient-deprived and our body responds accordingly. I’m currently struggling w having this response stop (the weight keeps climbing), and it’s making me very confused/worried/depressed, so I sympathize and at the very least hope you feel less  alone. but I can assure you that the 5 lb spike over several days is temporary and not fat, but there’s a lot of factors dictating how quickly it comes off (sodium, stress, menstruated cycles, carbs, hydration, inflammation, etc.). I completely get why it’s confusing/might cause anxiety though. hugs &lt;3",False,False
