So it‚Äôs very easy to get dressed since everything matches.   My thighs don‚Äôt touch when I walk. Every time they did I‚Äôd be like step, fuck me, step, fuck, step, fuck me  My quick mirror checks in public spaces are now ‚Äúwoah, I look okay!‚Äù Vs ‚Äúoh shit this shirt makes me look even worse outside the house‚Äù  I think the deep reason is how I lost the weight. I got hired in a place where I walk 7-10 miles a day. And I continue to work there. So now I can eat a little more than when I was purely a restricting couch potato. The exercise improves my mood. I love my coworkers and I laugh out loud every day.   I‚Äôm getting paid to work out and qualify for benefits in a few months. Life is good.   I have more energy. That means instead of sleeping and working, like I used to during the very beginning when I was out of shape, I can send friends my work schedule and go out with them for a couple hours after. After all. I‚Äôm already dressed and hyped from walking.   I have hip bones sticking out a little now. And guys are obsessed with grabbing them. I have more stamina for sex and other fun activities, like hikes. I don‚Äôt get out of breath easily anymore.   I FEEL in my 20s now. How people tell us to enjoy this decade because it‚Äôs awesome and you‚Äôll never be back to it past 30-40. I don‚Äôt feel old before my time, which my weight back when I was 150+ definitely made me feel. I don‚Äôt have a fear of missing out now because I‚Äôm IN.   My outside is finally matching how I‚Äôve always felt on the inside.   I like how I look and the number on the scale isn‚Äôt an enemy anymore. It‚Äôs a friend.     ",False,True
