As I said there's no wrong or right, it's either your cup of tea or not. As this guy was forced to speak his mind then was accused of it. If someone is being delusional then let them be, unless they obviously need help to get out of a toxic relationship. It's their right to choose what makes them happy. And what makes one happy might seem like hell to you and vice versa. You're not the one to judge what's wrong or what's right (unless it's if it comes to you), nor am I. Yes, you know some kind of people, I know the other type. My point is, do not accuse someone to be ""wrong"" just because they don't meet your idea of a lover.     Fair enough, good to know you found the person for you. Still, not my goal in a relationship.   Yes, this is the life I want to have. I only mentioned it because I guess it might be ""wrong"" for someone who has a different goal/view. Only showing you both sides of the coin.",False,False

A lot of people don't know what they need. A lot of people live their whole life in delusion about what they need and who they should be with. If my partner found another girl attractive I'd be okay with it too, but I know that I'm his most attractive person.  I don't know why the fuck you keep asking me that, I answered it. My current partner is. People I've liked or dated before were attractive, but none of them was ever ""the prettiest person"" I knew. My current partner is. Does that answer your question?",False,False

What if she asked him ""would you like me better if I was thinner"" (which I believe it was something along the lines, I'm not accusing her though, just a theory.) Maybe he had enough of the drama and has you know, his own shit to deal with? I'm sorry but sometimes it's a hell to date a person with an ED, I can see what shit I put my bf through sometimes and it is too much sometimes.

One is gorgeous for one and average for another. Different types and etc. For example I never understood the hype for Jason Momoa, but hey that's just me, you know.

It comes in all shapes. Only important thing is to find the right person for you that meets your needs. There's nothing wrong with just wanting to be with someone for the time being without huge future plans. I've seen many people like that and they're happy with that. And that's what only matters. To be happy and in love. Not to please others.   I'm not the prettiest, the cutest and the best of them all, I have many visual and mental issues, so I would get even mad if my bf ever mentions I was lol. I'm sure he finds other girls attractive and all and that would be fine by me.      Another example: I don't want to get married or to have kids. Does that mean I love my bf less than the next couple?    Also my question remains, if you've had more than one partner, then who's the prettiest of them?",False,False

Dudes typically know better than to discuss the weight question with women. Disordered or not.   Forcing him to say those things definitely gives him 0 room to take her feelings and sensibilities into consideration.  *I have been like OP.* I know how the whole conversation goes. Cornering someone into saying something they don't want to, not out of fear or trying to be secretive, but because they love you regardless of whether or not they also find someone else attractive. :/ while I do feel for her, it isn't fair and it's super shitty.",False,False

A lot of the time, what they 'found' is A person, not THE person. They just want to have someone, not THAT one. That's why I'm so critical of people whose person isn't their top all.
