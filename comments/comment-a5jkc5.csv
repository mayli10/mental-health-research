I’ve had one for a couple of years and it’s seriously the best decision I ever made ,False,False

I have a fucked up cycle due to years of restriction, but whenever I get a ""normal"" period, I feel like a fat failure.   Can't wait to unpack that in therapy.. ",False,False

I didn't have a period for 7 months but have had 2 since then (after trying to be more lax about my eating). It triggered me to no end since I try to damage myself as much as possible and can't stand the feeling of having a normal functioning body.,False,False

Are you me?? I stopped getting my period in December of last year. Then two months ago out of nowhere had some spotting....little more last month...now this month it’s normal. Yesterday I finally had to give in and go buy Tampons for the first time in a year because the bleeding wasn’t just super light anymore. I’m maintaining between 95-100lbs (when I was losing, I went from 170 to 95, lost my period around the 120lb mark) - but I still feel so guilty and gross like my body thinks I’m ok or I’m gaining weight and the scale is just wrong....ugh it sucks so much ",False,False

I didn't get mine for years and as soon as I got my first one I was so triggered that I immediately went on birth control that skips it because I don't want to know if I'm ""healthy"" enough to be getting it.

I was 13 pounds underweight and I still got mine.  I will say though, that the feeling might pass when you've been done with it for a while. I always feel insanely fat when I'm on mine, probably from bloating but also just from being full of blood. Again, not rational since I'm always full of blood.",False,False
