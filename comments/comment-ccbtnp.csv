If it’s during my restrictive not eating phase, I was constantly surrounding myself with food related things - extensive meal prepping with calorie counting, calculating deficits, searching up random foods to see how many calories they contain. On the other spectrum, I was bookmarking all restaurants I need to eat at, watching 10k calorie challenges, planning my own fantasy “cheat day”  It’s one of those things where trying to not think about something just makes it worse. We obsess over not thinking about it then get frustrated when we can’t.   A couple of tips from my therapist that has helped:  1) Explore the other important aspects of your life. What else makes you happy? What makes you confident? Ask yourself what kind of person you can to become. It’s okay to have a goal weight and want to look a certain way (provided yours isn’t one that is under the recommended range). But equally important are things like skills, knowledge, your work ethic, how you treat people, how you view the world, how you view yourself. As cliche as it sounds, food/ weight/ body image does not define us.   I saw food/ weight as the only thing that was important about me. It’s how others viewed me and how what I used to base my self worth. Other hobbies I had are just distractions, things to prevent me from binging. But that’s not true. Yes food is important but other things are equally so and they can make you equally happy/satisfied  2) The above is hard to do cause it’s something that comes from within. A more practical tip can be to change your environment. Go for replacing instead of eliminating. Eg unfollow some food related Instagram accounts and replace them with other non-food related things.  Another thing my therapist that has stuck with me - “being at my goal weight, eating perfectly are very important to me right now. But you might find that in 5, 10 years time, when these things don’t play such a large role, you may find yourself having neglected large aspects of your life.  I hope this helps. The theory is all there and despite understanding, agreeing with it, I’m still constantly relapsing in and out of those thoughts, some days worse than others.  TLDR: instead of stopping food obsession, replace and fill your mind up with things equally as important",False,False
