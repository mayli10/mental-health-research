Talking about your body like that is not okay. I legit have breakdowns alone sometimes over stupid stuff my bf has said without meaning it - I can’t imagine staying with someone who meant to nitpick like that. I’m sure your butt is fabulous and assure you don’t need that negativity in your life.",False,False

Even most women seem to think that cellulite is something that they're not ""supposed"" to have.   What did he say after you explained that you don't have any control over it? Or was the comment about his exes the last thing he said? He should at least read up on it and apologize for his comment.",False,False

LOL on my ASS? Nah those scars are on my wrists bro!

Hydration can help a lot with it but it’s nothing to be ashamed of - it’s like trying to exercise your nose to be a different shape. Tell your fiancé that what he said was hurtful and rude, unless he’d like some unsolicited comments about his body. ",False,False

I'm glad I have that kind of trust and honesty with my boyfriend.  I feel like I can trust whatever comes out of his mouth especially when I ask him to tell it to me straight with no filter.",False,False

Stuff like this is not okay to say, what does it even accomplish except hurt the person it’s said to? I mean he can feel this way, it’s okay to have an opinion to himself, but then he should either accept this is how OPs body looks and love her, or leave if it bothers him this much. It’s not fair to make someone feel like shit over something trivial they cannot change.

Aside from health issues like a huge increase in weight gain or loss or some other out of the ordinary thing, I would never discuss my partner’s body in a negative way and even then it would be loving and concern in tone if it was an actual issue worth mentioning like that. I cannot imagine ever saying anything mean to someone I love about how they look, because I love them for them, body included. Especially things they cannot change. That is cruel and awful and why even be with someone if their body bothers you?   I’m sorry but what your fiancé is saying is really horrible and mean, and I think that’s really wrong. There is nothing wrong with cellulite, I have and had it when I was at the low end of a normal bmi. Stuff like cellulite and stretch marks are completely okay to have and I would guess most people have them! And it does not remove how attractive someone is, it is attractive to be a human with normal skin! Please look after yourself and make sure you listen to your gut feeling on your partner because it’s not healthy to feel dragged down by the person you are loving, they should always make you feel beautiful and build you up!
