So hard to remind yourself of when you’re deep in eating disordered thinking, though.",False,False

You can be skinny and eat out but it’s hard. Restaurants use a lot of oil. Seriously why is the world so obsessed with going out. It’s financially draining and homemade meals taste better. Capitalism. People who are always going out to eat I find are slightly wasteful/bad at saving.,False,False

People can go out, drink, take pictures of food and look happy but still have struggles with eating.   There are definitely people who exist who can eat and drink without care, but I honestly think for a lot of people there is a layer of toxic thinking that surrounds food/body image/weight. iTs hard to compare because you never know. I myself definitely post pics anytime I eat out",False,False

While I’ve recovered, I recently had a panic attack over a vegan donut which led to a failed purge. Definitely not the carefree, cooking-obsessed foodie many would assume me to be.   All that is to say, more people struggle than we think. Comparison never helps us, especially in a world full of social media lies.",False,False

It's so weird. I see girls in public that are clearly anorexic and emaciated, and while I'm jealous of their weight, I also don't actually think they look good. Definitely not better than someone who is more of a normal weight. I'm not disgusted at all by normal sized and chubby people, I truly think they look better, but I don't think ***I*** look better when I'm a normal weight, if that makes any sense at all?!?!? Like I'm actually somewhat disgusted by very emaciated girls but jealous/envious at the same time. Like damn, I wish I was that frail and sickly. It's royally fucked up.",False,False
