I really appreciate that you took the time to listen. And you're right, distraction is a great coping skill. I definitely have issues with being hard on myself, especially about not doing things ""perfectly"" so I know I gotta chill on the judgement lol easier said than done tho ‾\\\_(ツ)\_/‾  I will for sure continue to make music and I hope sharing my experience here encourages others to try some creative outlets that could be effective coping tools. Thanks again!",False,True

Diving into a hobby when you feel poorly is actually what you should be doing.   I really liked the track you made. I can’t give helpful critique as I am not good with music, I just like what I like. It sounds like a track that would play in a video game when you’re going through a dungeon. I hope you keep making music and it keeps bringing you solace.",False,False
