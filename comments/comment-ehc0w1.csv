I don't know how much this'll help, but I found that when I was in school, a lot of catty girls bragged about doing stuff that they in fact didn't do. Eg one of my friends bragged about how she only ate 50 calories a day and exercised for 6 hours a day. I was friends with her sister so I knew that wasn't true. For me what worked was putting things into context and not assuming everyone is telling the truth.  Stay strong, dude. HS is brutal.",False,False
