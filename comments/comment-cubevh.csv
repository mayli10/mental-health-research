For me, everything I ate used to be... my favourite stuff? But the pizza tasted so bland, the chocolate had such an artificial taste to it, like it was eating powder milk ( i actually checked the expiration date thinking that the chocolate was expired) the bread was...tasteless, the cheese sandwich felt like a salt sandwich with too much pepper (bear in mind that I used to eat 2 of them everyday)  and I can't even describe the honey: it was simply off.  It just boggles my mind how I was able to eat this. I'm just happy to return from now to my healthy eating habits.",False,True

I will plan to end a certain duration of asceticism with a “binge” or cheat weekend of all my favourites, but I find that they taste “off” or different, like the person made it wrong or it’s been sitting around too long waiting for me to eat it haha. I think you just break your addiction to those foods by avoiding them for so long and the dopamine hit you get from eating them is different so it changes the satisfaction level. I tend to just go through phases of having different favourite foods (for a while it was nachos and pizza and bread, lately it’s been smoothie bowls and protein bars and nut butters) and that’s good, it’s good to get enjoyment from food, it’s just a pain when you feel like you wasted your cheat calories on foods you no longer love.",False,False

I have actually fallen asleep immediately after writing this post and now the abdominal pain is gone. I still feel full and bloated, and I'll unfortunately have to wait a couple of days for this feeling to pass. Unfortunately I have already weighed myself as soon as I woke up and the number wasn't as big as I expected (in a good way). I'm somewhat glad I went through this experience because it made me realize how binging is just... not worth it. I'm eating pretty clean and today I wanted to eat food I don't usually eat (bread, chocolate, honey, pizza) and I went wild. They don't taste the same anymore. I was eating and eating expecting to like the food but it turned out to be a huge disappointment. My favourite chocolate, pizza, cheese sandwich, honey with bread tasted like shit.  I can't fathom how I used to eat them??!?? I would've been better off with a delicious salad. I'm writing this because maybe other people who may struggle with binging will see this comment and read the message: IT'S NOT WORTH IT.",False,True

Just make sure to drink two glasses of water with it to prevent dehydration. Also don't do this very often, because it CAN lead to bad habits and abuse. This is what I always do when I binge and have pain from too much going through my bowels.",False,False

Here is what I do afterwards:  1) Sleep it off. You will still be bloated as fuck in the morning and you’ll probably have a headache, nausea, and heartburn, but the abdominal pain will be gone and you’ll be able to get up and move around just fine.   2) Digestive enzymes for gas and bloating.   3) I know you’re already full, but try to drink as much water as you can before going to sleep. You’re going to be dehydrated, which is uncomfortable, but drinking water will also help decrease the bloat more quickly.   4) Don’t weigh yourself for a few days. Just don’t. I will never understand the girls on this sub who weigh the day after a binge. What does it achieve? All it tells you is how much the food and bloat weighs. Wait at least three to five days.   5) Other helpful supplements: fibre to get things moving, a diuretic to flush out the water weight, bromelain to speed up digestion, a probiotic to help regulate your stomach bacteria.",False,False
