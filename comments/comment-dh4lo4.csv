I guarantee a good chunk of that is water weight.,False,False

It's more likely that you're carrying at least 10lbs of water weight as well as 5-10lbs of digesting food waste in your system. Good hydration, adequate fiber, and light body movement (walking, stretches, yoga, etc.) should help bring the scale down to a more realistic number.",False,False

Depending on your TDEE you’ll have gained weight but you easily be holding onto 20-30lbs of water weight. When I would have lengthy binges I had so much edema that my legs felt sloshy and heavy. You can flush it out relatively quick!,False,False
