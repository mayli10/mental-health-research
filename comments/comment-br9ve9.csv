Definitely could've been nicer to myself about 3 minutes ago. So I guess I could start in the mirror. Thank you so much.,False,False

Whenever you notice that you're being unkind to yourself try to challenge those thoughts and come up with an alternative that is more objective and less emotionally charged. People with EDs are generally pretty hard on themselves so it's very likely that your thoughts are too harsh and are sort of perpetuating or at least exacerbating some of your symptoms, and that they are not based in truth. Try to combat the intense negativity with something rooted in fact.  Rough example of how this works with me:  Scenario: Hungry Me 1: Wow, you absolute fatass. How could you be so weak and actually want to eat? As if you really deserve it, piggy.   Me 2: Well, actually it's 1 pm and I haven't had lunch yet. I'm _'_"" and a 20 year-old guy so my BMR is _____. Even if I was comatose I would still need to eat that much and I haven't even come close to that yet.   Me 1: â€¦",False,False

I used to have (and to some extent still do) have a horribly toxic relationship with myself. I would never talk to someone else with such disdain and vitriol like I routinely used with myself. I noticed when  I made an effort to be gentler to myself I felt better about everything that was happening. I don't mean to suggest that PMA will make weightgain fun or enjoyable but in terms of at least coping and maybe even fully accepting it I think that is the simplest and yet most effective thing you can do.,False,False
