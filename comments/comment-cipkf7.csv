Even if it was intended as a joke. Stuff like that has happened to me a lot before  Like at my last job (restaurant), instead of taking a name or a number to call out when the food was ready, we had a question of the month. The answer to the question was how we called out the orders.  My coworkers bosses and I were all talking about the next months question and what our answers would be.  The question - “What breakfast cereal best describes your personality?”  So like, this suuuper gay (and cute) guy we worked with chose fruit loops, stuff like that. I couldn’t ever figure out or think of one for myself.  So my boss eventually says that I’m Kicks, because I’m super sweet.  Without even a goddamn nanosecond of time passing, one of my coworkers, in front of everyone, blurts out “and round!”  I managed to laugh it off as best I could. Some of my coworkers were shocked and said openly that like that’s not okay, some of them were laughing with the girl who said it.  I didn’t eat for almost three days",False,True
