Then no matter what I tried to eat at most half of everything. Half of the burger, half of the fries, half of other sides.... so if it's a 1200kcal greasy gross meal, I know I ate at most 600kcal. Then I just say I am stuffed and refuse to eat more. It's more socially acceptable than getting the Small Garden Salad with dressing on the side ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚",False,False

Of course you can add egg whites which is 17 cals per egg but I'm not sure exactly how many calories it would be there since they use butter or oil to cook it. There are many options on their menu that are less than 750 cals like their sausage, egg &amp; cheese grits bowl for 360 calories. I'm not sure what kind of food you like so it's hard to give suggestions.",False,False
