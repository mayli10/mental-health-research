OUCH, I couldn't have put it better... I feel like plenty of nice people have expressed interest in me, and I never let them into my life... yeesh. Well- thank you for making me feel less alone.

Although most of the women I’ve slept with have been kind and loving to me, the men have been kinda gross and I know I’ve only slept with them for the sake of believing validation from men was somehow more meaningful because it was often more superficial. But my ex would sometimes get super disrespectful and cruel with her words and it only ever made me fall more in love with her cause the meaner she was the more I thought she knew the real me. Like she was only mean cause she saw me for who I really was and I loved it. Whenever she’d call me beautiful or anything of the like I would get angry and cry so that only led to her not being nice to me anymore which was what I really needed and wanted. Words of affirmation and all. Beyond that I’ve also noticed I sleep with a lot of very thin women which can be vverrryy triggering. Essentially: I feel u.",False,False

I like to self sabotage like that too. I often find myself trying to make myself ‘unattractive’ to men, as a form of self defense. And when they do find me attractive anyway, I seem to pick the worst ones, because it’s what I ‘deserve’—heavy quotations. The ED has me gravitate towards less than desirable people, who do or say things that send me back to the ED to cope, and so it goes. It’s a cycle of sorts.   You’re absolutely not alone. I don’t want to bring up anything super sensitive, but I’ve had really similar experiences. Imo, some of my past relationships were just an elaborate form of self harm.   You’ve got this—the realization is the first step. Let me know if you ever want to talk about anything at all—not even this, just if you need a friend.",False,False

It’s self defense, I think. You’re shutting others out in the hopes that you won’t have to go through the same pain like you did before. At least, that’s what it is for me. It really fucks me over, and learning how to trust is a big issue for me.",False,False
