That is no longer true, and today obesity is instead a strong predictor of health problems; the person of normal weight is, on average, healthier than his or her overweight counterpart. All animals, including humans, choose partners partly (if subconsciously) on reproductive fitness: will this person be healthy enough to carry on my genes?  Because women are most fertile when young (still in thier mid-late adolescent years), and get bigger/fatter with age, youth was a driving factor when men were choosing girls to mate with.  Legal teen porn is still the most veiwed category on internet porn sites like pornhub.  Note that this bias also works against very thin people. Men are less attracted to unhealthily thin women (bmi under 17.5) for the same reason. Studies done by researcher Devendra Singh show that when men are asked to rate the attractiveness of silhouettes of womens' bodies, they overwhelmingly pick the silhouette corresponding with the healthiest weight for women, around a a BMI of 20.0 ‚Äî not too thin, not too fat.",False,False

They started as stays which are very much up and down and then developed further. Corsets were needed to maintain the fashion of the time as their dresses could weight multiple kgs.",False,False
