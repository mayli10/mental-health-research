I was never given the care I needed despite his financial success (which I was never able to use for anything I needed. He fucked off to go live his own life when I was ten. He's pooped up here and there as he pleased or when absolutely necessary, like he visited me once during a hospital stay which he only helped pay for because it was mandated by the state lmao) and as my issues worsened, I ended dropped out of school and falling into a pattern of descriptive behaviors that prevent me from standing on my own two feet. Without professional help I'm never going to be able to hold a job or get out of either of my parent's hair.

But because he refused to get me the help I very desperately needed when I was younger, my mental state has gotten progressively worse over the years and as a result I‚Äôm unable to support myself (not because I‚Äôm lazy or spoiled as people often assume, but because I literally cannot function like a normal human being). He didn‚Äôt get me treatment (which he could have absolutely afforded) in a very short sighted attempt to save money.

Anyway, if we‚Äôre going to discuss unsupportive parents who fuel EDs, I‚Äôd like to share a few gems from mine over the years:   -my ED developed at age 17. Shortly before I turned 18 I had to get a physical (I think to get forms filled out for university) and my doctor was alarmed by my weight loss and told my mother she suspected an ED and referred me to a psych and dietician. My mother cancelled those appointments, made me eat some cheesecake, and ignored all advice given to her by the doctor.   -my dad once came to my house, screamed at me that I‚Äôd end up in the hospital and he‚Äôd be stuck paying for it and THAT‚ÄôS NOT FAIR TO HIM!!!!! then stormed out and didn‚Äôt speak to me for a week or two.  -when I was in uni my mother would weigh me in public (at the fucking grocery store!) or else borrow a scale from a neighbour and force me to weigh myself in front of her. Then she‚Äôd shake her head and yell at me for ‚Äúwhat I was doing to her‚Äù but not once did she offer me actual help or support.  -she called and screamed at me threatened me and cursed me out on multiple occasions with comments such as accusing me of ‚Äútrying to look sexy for boys‚Äù and asking if I think the starving children in Africa look good  -she cut out an article from the paper about a model dying from anorexia and put it up on my fridge  -she made a comment about how she had felt badly for Terri Schiavo but then she heard her condition was caused by bulimia so it was her own fault and she has no sympathy for her  -conversely, she would ‚Äújoke‚Äù about wishing she could purge so she could lose weight  -my dad never acknowledged I had an actual disorder and instead referred to my weight loss as my ‚Äúvegetarian thing‚Äù and blamed my school/teachers  -they tried to ‚Äúcure‚Äù me by forcing me to drink Ensure Plus for a few weeks. Jokes on them, I dumped those fuckers out when they weren‚Äôt watching and restricted my food to make up for whatever I did drink  -my father, who has an advanced health related degree and therefore should not be quite so fucking stupid about these things, would read bullshit pseudo science type articles and spout them off as fact. Lecture me/order me to eat certain things, told me I needed to weigh a minimum of x (which would actually be close to overweight for my height), pretty much everything he said to me about food/weight nutrition was incorrect but he refused to consider the fact that he was fucking wrong. He even claimed that my weight loss was due to me not eating bough vegetables! Like wtf?!? Even my treatment team (who he didn‚Äôt know about, because I sought treatment without their knowledge or help) would roll their eyes when I told them the things he said.   It was (and still is) so bad that even at my very sickest, my therapist was constantly threatening to call the police and have me taken to hospital involuntarily due to my extremely low weight and purging‚Äî I was a danger to myself and absolutely could have been involuntarily committed. However, I knew she‚Äôd never go through with it (and she knew I knew it was an empty threat) because we both knew how my parents would have reacted. Hospitalising me may have stabilised me in the short term but it would have completely fucked me over in the long term.     ",False,False
