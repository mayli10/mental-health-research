My legs are short compared to my torso and I heard once that women's femurs stop growing when they enter puberty and I got mine early so FML. I have to get into serious underweight zone for my legs to look ok but then my face is hallow like I'm cracked out.,False,False

My thighs are huge, my shoulders are wide, my hips are narrow, but my arms are thin and I lose from the top first.   Small boobs, and a butt I HATE.   Seriously, fuck my body shape. Its only appealing if I'm skinny enough to have skinny thighs and a waist so small my stomach concaves and makes my hips look wider in comparison.",False,False

They look so thin and dainty when I have long nails (too bad theyâ€™re brittle and peeling as hell but nail polish covers that right up ! ðŸ¤ )   Every time I go out, I check my reflection from the back using 2 mirrors to see how ugly or decent my ass looks and sometimes I end up with a pile of clothes around me while I cry because Iâ€™m gross !!

I'm transgender and I feel blessed that my body has always been so messed up because it made me smaller than I would have been otherwise. Thankfully I stopped growing at 13. I don't think I could handle it if I ended up growing the way my brothers did. My twin brother is four inches taller than me and my older brother is nine inches taller. If I grew taller I would probably also be wider. As is my shoulder width is in the upper range of what's average for a girl of my size. Any more and absolutely nothing would fit right. Certain clothes are already tight in the shoulders. Like, in most in my measurements XS is still a little big at some stores, but then for certain kinds of clothing the shoulder width is important and I'll see like 14"" or smaller shoulder width measures on their size charts. It really sucks. I just want to be small the way I probably would be if I wasn't trans. If I never had that last growth spurt after grade 8 I probably would be that small still.",False,False

It can be really bumpy and dimpled and I am pretty sure I won't like my body after the surgery either.      But the phlebotomist told me I shouldn't gain any weight because it will worsen my condition and it can destroy my knee joints when it gets too bad.      So I am constantly frustrated, because I want to lose weight to look perfect, but will never achieve it, so I am eating because of frustration, but then again I shouldn't gain weight because it will make everything worse and I just can't maintain a normal weight &gt;.&lt; I am either gaining or losing and both is bad and my mind tells me different things everyday.
