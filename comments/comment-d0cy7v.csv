(something else i do is i mark every time i don’t go out to eat at night. then when i wake up i add the tally marks together and each tally equals 10 extra calories in my daily total. this just kinda helps me not go out at night because i get a “prize” if i dont.)",False,False

Is it because something about the evening makes you more anxious and you eat to cope with it? Is it because of food insecurity, e.g. thinking that this is your ""last chance"" to eat before the end of the day? Are you distracting yourself or procrastinating from something else that you don't want to do and using food as that excuse?  I'm in the same boat as you and I literally JUST avoided a binge, so here's what I did.  First, I recognised why I wanted to binge - in my particular case today, it was a combination of being anxious about some work I have to do, so I wanted to eat to alleviate that anxiety; I wanted to eat as a way of also postponing the work; And I'd noticed a food that had the potential to start a binge (a snack food I don't often keep in the house), and once I'd seen it, it was hard for me to forget about it. Those three things are together what gave me the impulse to binge. Different things will trigger me at different times, so it pays to meditate on it each time.  Once I analysed that, I redirected my compulsive binge-energy into something food-adjacent that would distract me and take up my attention/time/hands until the initial compulsion calmed down. In my case, I started making myself a cup of tea with soy milk, because however many calories are in the soy milk would be much better than the food I wanted to binge on. At other times, I redirect myself to low-cal snacks like pickles, kimchi, or Halo Top, based on whatever food it is I'm craving or compelled to binge. I find that if I can redirect or satisfy that initial burst of compulsion to binge, I can avoid the binge completely.  While the kettle was boiling, I isolated the food that was triggering the binge-compulsion (very easy in this case, because it was one specific product; not so easy in other cases) and made it harder for myself to access. It put it in our pantry, which is a pain in the ass to get to ATM because we have to lock it to keep our pets out. So basically, put as many barriers between yourself and the binge-triggering foods as you possibly can, either physically or mentally. Put the food away in a tin, inside another tin, inside a cupboard you don't use. Put it in a bag in your car boot and go back inside. If you live with other people, put it in a common area where people will see you if you go back to get it. This is only useful if you know the desire to binge on that food will eventually subside; if you know a certain food will always trigger a binge, see below.  If you DO start to binge, DON'T fall into the in-for-a-penny-in-for-a-pound mindset. You CAN stop a binge at ANY time and it WILL be better than if you let the binge go on. So you eat an entire block of chocolate - you might be tempted to think that you've ruined your day so badly, there's no point in trying any more. BUT eating a whole block of chocolate is better than eating a whole block of chocolate AND a bag of crisps AND a pint of icecream, etc. It is always better to pump the brakes, no matter how far you've gone. I was binging earlier and I recognised halfway through that I wasn't really enjoying the food, I didn't need the calories, and I was full, so I forcibly stopped myself and threw the rest of the packet away.  Which leads me to my next point - I hate wasting food, but over-eating past my calorific needs until I get uncomfortable, lethargic, guilty, etc. is, IMO, still just as much of a waste. If I have to get rid of food I don't want in order to stop eating it, then I've learned that's just what I have to do. I'm fairly friendly with my neighbours so I can sometimes pawn half-eaten or uneaten food items onto them or my parents, but if worse comes to worst I'm not above throwing food in the trash if I'm in the middle of a REALLY bad binge and it's doing me more harm than good to eat it. The important thing is that you do this when it's BENEFICIAL to you, not as a form of punishment to yourself. Sometimes the healthiest thing to do is just let a binge let its course.  I remind myself (positively, because negative self-talk rarely helps in the long term) about the reasons why I don't want to binge, the progress that I don't want to lose, the promises I've made to myself and others, etc. I try not to make them about my appearance. Mostly I focus on how proud of myself I'll be in an hour when I can look back on the binge I DIDN'T have, and how much better and more in-control I will feel.  If I do binge, or start to binge, then I keep myself accountable. I try and keep a level head, recognise that I am binging, and make a more conscious choice to eat food, even if it's still a binge, because if I don't and I allow my eating to become mindless, the binge is always worse. I personally track my calories even through a binge because it helps me stay self-aware and regain control over my compulsions faster. BUT everyone is different and some people find that calorie-tracking will make things even worse. Know what's best for you and don't harm yourself by tracking; but if possible, find another way to stay mindful about your intake to avoid falling into a deeper binge.  Lastly, if I do binge, and I binge hard, I DON'T try and compensate the next day. E.g. after a really massive binge, I'm tempted to think ""Well, if I just fast all day today, then the calories will even out and it'll be like nothing happened!"" ... Yyyeaahhh, the thing is, after a binge, my eating compulsions are ALL kinds of messed up. My binges are related to food insecurity, so trying to force myself to fast or super-low restrict immediately after a binge just triggers my eating compulsion to go CRAZY and I am far, far more likely to just binge again... then try and fast again... then binge again... etc etc.   Instead, what I do now - with a much higher success rate - is just try and get back to ""normal"". Whatever the highest level of restriction you're comfortable with, or your ""normal"" eating, not your ""compensation"" eating. Even if that means eating at maintenance for a day or two. If I take things slowly and talk myself through my eating choices, then I am much, much more likely to regain control over my eating habits and my binge compulsions. THEN, afterwards, if I so choose to, I can lower-restrict or do IF for a short period of time, once I have pulled myself out of a binge cycle. This can often just lead to another binge cycle, though, so I honestly just advocate for trying to return to ""normal"" eating after a binge without ever attempting to compensate for it, because preventing future binges is going to be much better for you in the longterm than whatever short-term benefit you think you'll gain from fasting, purging, etc. One outstanding binge is better than three successive binges with unsuccessful fasts in-between.  Phew, this is such a long reply! I hope there's something in there that can be useful to you. I've been literally wrestling with a binge cycle myself for the past couple of weeks and am only just now pulling myself out of it because I use these techniques. The best thing you can do is try and slow yourself down and recognise WHY you binge because everyone's compulsions are different and everyone responds to different things, too.  Oh - and I also find that coming and talking to people here helps a ton! xo",False,False
