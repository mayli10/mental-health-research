I drink 3-5 cups as well and to cover the grossness that is workplace coffee I have to be pretty liberal with whatever Iâ€™m using so I always bring unsweetened almond milk. 30cal for a cup from most brands so I just log a full cup a day to cover the 1-2 oz I pour per cup. You could also measure out one cup to take with you each day if you want to be accurate but itâ€™s now my staple,False,False
