One of the reasons I often find body acceptance stuff grating, is bc it tends to assume that loving or being cool with your body is the ideal way to be. It especially bugs me when people frame loving/accepting your body as the “true” human condition, and blame “modern society” for negative body feelings (although obviously, modern media HAS made the problem more acute). In reality, I’m pretty sure people have been feeling all kinds of weird ways about their bodies since the dawn of consciousness, and that that’s just part of the human condition. Accepting my body uncritically would not be an authentic experience for me, even if I weren’t anorexic, and I think it’s okay to be critical of/disappointed in your body, just as long as it isn’t all-consuming, or manifesting as sheer self-hatred. The body is a perpetual negotiation for many people, and has been, IMO, since time immemorial.  idk if this makes any sense. It’s been a long day. But yeah, I think about these issues sometimes.",False,True

I hope the author learns a healthy relationship with food. So many of us see it as the enemy. I've never been overweight, but one of my fears is that recovering would make me so. It's so hard to find balance. Like, the author feels like she MUST be okay with being overweight to beat her bulimia. I don't mean we shouldn't all strive for body acceptance at all, but I think it's such an example of how many of us (myself included) have disordered thinking.  It makes me reflect on my own black and white thinking. This all or nothing behavior. Emaciated or overweight, no such thing as normal.",False,False
