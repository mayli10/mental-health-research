It's SO important to talk about these experiences. I was quiet for a long time and it made it so easy to become vulnerable to people who recognized me as a groomed child.    Reaching out for help can be scary, but the peace of mind it can bring can be worth it so much! My ed for a large part stems from what happend and finding more peace with my body has always helped me so much.    Hope you have a good day /night. Take care! ‚ô•Ô∏è",False,True

Hope you reflect some of you proudness back to yourself! Strength is mostly just about not giving up (I think) all the fight and trying is part of that journey. And you and me both are still here fighting the fight, right? Have a nice day!!",False,True

And seriously it's so special to find someone with the same sense of humor. I hope you have lots of good times to come!",False,False

Speaking up and reporting your assault. I'm so sorry that happened to you. But you've shown how strong you are- you got this.,False,False

Have experience with childhood sexual abuse, and sexual abuse in my teens.  Also quite recently I experienced another sexual traumatic situation and actually spoke about this about an hour before it happened and was quite emotionally and reading something I had written about it on my phone when the whole thing went down.     So the thing that happened last week was actually not a very bad thing in comparison to other things I have been through, but due to my background, plus my recent downfall back into the 24/7 obsession with my body made the aftermath terrible. I knew there was a centre for sexual violence and I was advice d to call them before but hadn't. Have so many bad experiences with mental health profs I didn't know what to expect. But when I called they where so nice.    They where caring without using that tone you use when talking to a baby. Which is something a lot of psychs do when explaining things about sexual violence and the impact. Like I don't know the impact. Like my intelligence is damaged cause my psyche is.     The people from the centre will keep in contact with me the coming weeks, monitor my ptsd, answer questions etc.     If you want help you probably still can find it. In Europe all countries have centres for sexual violence and i know the USA has RAINN.           &amp;nbsp;     It's never to late for help and you deserve it.     And yes I am also happy I could spend a day not worrying about myself but being in good company. I just met this woman but think we could be friends, she has the same humor as me, lol that's like already being 80% on the road to friendship.",False,True

I was a victim of assault last year and it really shook me/made ED symptoms 10x worse. I'm so impressed by your strength and I'm glad you were able to enjoy that moment with your friend. I'm also really glad you were able to talk to someone and get support. I didn't seek help when it happened to me and I wish I had.,False,False
