I usually eat between 4-5:30pm for last meal of the day. It has helped me sleep earlier as well because I’m no longer full of excess food energy (not sure how it works scientifically but when I’d be eating ice cream at 9pm I wouldn’t be sleeping at 10pm).,False,False

The more time I give my body to de-bloat and digest, the better. Like if I start the day feeling full (or even just *not empty*) it sets the whole day up to be ruined, which is ridiculous.

The hunger pains are a signal from your body. You could try to eat more healthy nutrient dense stuff to prevent those late night cravings. But stop the junkfood first!
