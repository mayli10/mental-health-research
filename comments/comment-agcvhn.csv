I went for a workout right after I wrote this actually. Felt a lot better. Not 100% by a long shot but at least I was able to zone out for a while and expend some of my nervous/anxious energy.

I can say with absolute confidence that exercising helps with that about 90% of the time. Plus, it has the added benefit of turning my excess fat into muscle, which allows you to look slimmer even at higher BMI.  I hope you can start to learn to live within the darkness as you put it.

I think you need to focus on your depression first, you seem to be at a low point. I was there very recently myself and although it's different for everyone, I can empathize with your Rollercoaster emotions and crying. I also know that when I was that low there wasn't anything anyone could say that would make me feel better at all.   So I just want you to know that you do have love and support and there are lots of people in this great community that I'm sure will understand your struggles in ways that other people can not. I urge you to redirect your focuses to other things that aren't imaged based, maybe reading or writing? Something creative you can loose yourself in that is positive and uplifting. Good luck üíú",False,False
