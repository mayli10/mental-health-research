Mine is a saint and handles all my whining and disordered behaviors, but even I get tired of myself. So I know that one day he will too. I try and hide the most destructive pieces and avoid telling him that I fasted all day or that I couldnt handle the idea of food in my system and purged but still I know the glimpses he does get past my ""healthy and well adjusted"" facade worry him and that guilt sucks.   I try and be honest as much as I can with myself and with him. I want him more than this disorder and I refuse to let this disorder take anything else from me.  I would show him you appreciate his patience and remind him as often as you can that what he does is meaningful. ",False,False
