Sometimes it’s my Disordered eating mind that’s controlling my eating so I restrict, usually don’t eat breakfast, binge on fast food, c&amp;s, practice other disordered eating things. But sometimes it’s like I don’t even have disordered eating thoughts - I eat a normal maintenance amount, don’t really log my calories, I allow myself breakfast, I don’t binge, I don’t feel like an existential crisis when faced with food I like.   So yesterday morning I had a breakfast flatbread with friend without a second though later in the day I was beating myself up ....simply for eating breakfast. When really it was just a regular ol’ breakfast flatbread. Nothing crazy.",False,False
