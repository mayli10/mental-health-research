I really like my actual body, I just really hate what I've done with it. But I'm the body type that I want to be, I just need to be 60-70lbs lighter and then maybe add on 15lbs of toned muscle.

Also are you me because I'm also 5'11, hourglass shaped and even have almond shaped eyes! Wow!  I totally understand the tall girl heavier weight issue its unfair because even though you are almost 6 inches taller, we internalize the fact that we don't weigh 110 pounds and if we did its almost unrealistic to maintain or achieve. Totally understand that struggle. Also,the you're so tall you should model comments I got my whole life.  If I actually lost the weight my face would look fine and maybe I could again, but for now I just accept it and work with what I have! ",False,False

A friend‚Äôs boyfriend once stole my number from her phone and texted me saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôre way too hot to be her friend.‚Äù I don‚Äôt wanna sound cocky, but there was ample evidence to suggest that I was hot af.
