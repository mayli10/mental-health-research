I like seeing y'all but I dont really want selfie posts to take over the posts with content (if that makes sense),False,False

Maybe it is better to just leave them out because I want this place to be welcoming to everyone. ,False,True

I guess a lot of the weekly posts were bad. I really liked to be able to occasionally do the Way to go Wednesdays or weekly selfies... especially in recovery it is hard because i feel even fatter than most times. Anyway, I can see why they might have been a problem (especially Thinspo, which wasn't my thing). ",False,False

I don't know I would totally love a healthy wins post but I also know not EVERYONE is in any form of recovery whether it be full recovery or quasi recovery. And I don't want this to be a ""recovery only zone"" because that's stigmatizing.  But I also don't want this to be a ""well I ate only 300 calories today so I'm winning because that makes people feel like failures as well. So perhaps avoiding that in general is the best we can do while still being supportive.   It's tricky. ",False,False

I'm guessing the only way we can stay alive is no food posts thinspo or weekly weigh ins.   Frankly I think it's a good thing. I don't think we need more competitiveness in our competitive brains. ,False,False
