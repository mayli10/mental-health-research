I mean, I was already working on getting over him, or trying to- no use pining over someone who's taken. But that made me think about, if they broke up? I still wouldn't try to get with him. Like the most that would happen is cuddling while drunk or some shit.  Anyways, thanks for the reply! I tend to crush on any guy or girl who is even a little bit nice to me. After a while I get over it, lol",False,True

I dont have male friends that I would casually sleep on them.  It's strange he spent so much time with you without her there. Like it makes sense you weren't okay and he wanted to help, but why wasnt she with him at the time too??  He sounds sweet to you but would you want to date a guy who does things like this with other girls while you date him? Cause hes doing it to current girl.",False,False
