A little teary reading this and in a good way. Thank you so much for putting so much time and thought into a response, and I'm so sorry to hear that you've struggled so much and continue to do so - I really hope someday you find some peace and some happiness. I don't know the words to reply well to this or to tell you just how grateful I am for it, but thank you so much. And thank you for the suggestion of weight training! And for the explanation of how it helps, that makes a lot of sense - rather than using it to punish I should see the positive side of it in the strength I could gain...   Thank you again, really ❤️",False,True

It sounds like your ED is causing you a lot of stress and grief. This is a good place to vent but remember it's also OK to reach out to people IRL for support. Just because you're not underweight doesn't mean you don't deserve help or someone to talk to about these feelings.  Wanting someone to notice you're okay is fine and normal but unfortunately it doesn't always work. I wanted someone to notice I wasn't okay for almost 6 years, and by the time someone did I didn't want help and got into a really dark place complete with SH and suicidal ideation. It's been a year, a psychiatrist, two therapists, and three medications since someone noticed and I'm still in that dark place. Reach out if you want to. It's okay   As someone who doesn't have a real eating disorder but has experienced disordered thoughts/obsessing over food/purging/bingeing/wanting to be underweight, I know that it sucks. Perhaps you could use these moments of clarity to help yourself if you see that the path you're going down is harming you. I know some people have found comfort in weight training because it takes the focus off their body's appearance and shifts it to its abilities instead.  You sound like a lovely person. You're valid and you deserve to be happy. I truly hope that things work out for you.    Sorry if this sounded too pushy or preachy, I'm not the best at advice but I see you're hurting and I want you to know that people care.",False,False
