Cause: Bad feeling. Bad, bad, bad feeling. Like, looked-at-a-post that hurt me feeling.    Cure: Slow water sips.  I'm the farthest from someone calm, but for years this worked. I outgrew it because I didn't appreciate it. I had a teacher at my conservatory who focused on Grotowski and collective mindfulness. A hard class, but not scene-study related. She told someone else in the class who couldn't shake unworkable mood to stop and have a sip of water everytime they were distracted. I didn't think about this weird note again until I discovered that boiling hot rage could be cured with the safest thing I knew: slow, slow sips of cold water. Zero cal, good for me, and necessary. I couldn't find anything wrong with it. For once I relaxed. I was defeated. There was nothing but goodness when it came to a slow, deliberate water-break.  &amp;#x200B;  For now, fuck that. For now. For now.",False,True
