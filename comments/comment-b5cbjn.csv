I feel like such a wimp because it’s only a week into this relapse, but it’s never been so intense. I’ve always been fighting with myself to not eat. Last night I was feeling so dizzy and messed up. Nothing even sounded good. I ate three saltines, cried, and felt sick. I’ve had more today, and I kinda want to have a snack, but I’m so afraid of ending this restriction period before I’ve even gotten anywhere. Eating isn’t even helping the brain fog. ",False,False
