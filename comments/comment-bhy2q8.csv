My fiance ""knows about"" my eating disorder... We've always been (were both kinda really weird people, probably had something to do with us both probably having Asperger's idk) unconventionally open about our respective issues.   He just thinks I stopped purging....I may have had a part to play on that mistaken assumption, but, regardless.....  He's six feet tall and 120 lbs *on a good day*. He has no conscious disordered behaviors, he doesn't have ED, I'm 99% sure of that. I think it's mostly an aspie thing, because he has a real problem with most food textures, and so he just doesn't like to eat very many things, over time I think her learned to ignore his body telling him it's hungry if there's nothing around that he wants to eat. Basically, it's an eating disorder, but not the kind any of us have. Not caused by body/social issues, but by Asperger's issues.  AAaanyway- I totally get most of your post. It's hard to try to balance wanting to lean on someone you love for support, but not being able to because you can't be fully honest with them.  My solution has been to just try my best to deal and build up the emotional and mental strength to fully bring him into the circle of my craziness. One day. When I'm not terrified it will destroy us.",False,False
