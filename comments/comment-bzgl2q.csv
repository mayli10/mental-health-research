I don't know the science behind it, but it makes sense if we correlate that with OCD, which has similar causes: doing the action (restricting/ocding) eases us.

Personally, restricting is one of my only defenses against the anxiety I've battled all my life (literally, my first verifiable memory is of feeling sick with anxiety). When I'm restricting, I'm chill, I'm less emotionally reactive, and my body is relatively at ease.  I believe this relief is due to both the psychological reward of feeling in control, and an actual chemical phenomenon (possibly involving serotonin? google Walter Kaye if you're interested for more on that). I suspect there's just something very biologically wrong with my brain chemistry - and its interactions with my sympathetic nervous system - that science/medicine can't yet address. But restricting does help. It helps more than any clinically approved drug or treatment I've ever tried.",False,False

I get super happy and outgoing when Iâ€™m restricting. I think itâ€™s because I usually would end up restricting in small periods back when I was doing better in recovery as a coping mechanism for when I felt like I did the wrong thing. But when Iâ€™m constantly restricting anyway Iâ€™m always repenting for it, so I just do what I want and it goes well, and I just feed into this happy outgoing cycle.  Kinda sad, because it means the only time I can feel like myself and act like myself is when Iâ€™m slowly dying from lack of food (and hiding my ED from my loved ones) but thatâ€™s just how it be.",False,False
