I am actually a freshman at university, I'm done with the high school part. Wasn't fun.  There's this pressure when you're given the opportunity for a fresh start. On one hand, I'm feeling an incredible sense of liberation. I am an adult (legally at least), I have the power in my hands to completely turn my life around. Here, almost nobody will know me and I can present myself in a way that I want to. I'm scared of my weight screwing that up for me. I mean, this seems like an opportunity of a lifetime. To stop being depressed, to actually feel happiness. For a long time I didn't see I was depressed, my mood was just...neutral. Then, for a short time I felt genuine happiness, I was around people, having fun, and that's when I realized that there is something wrong, because I haven't felt this way since basically 5th grade. Others would feel like this nearly every day when they were around their friends, I was missing out on so much. I never hated my life, I firmly believed that I was worth something, no matter what others thought of me, due to my family and religion. But I was just so numb, for so long. I can't say I felt *nothing* all the time, I'm a very emotional person, but only when it hits me. I would feel empty for the entire week, and then I would cry myself to sleep for ""no reason"" on Saturday.  I felt emotionally drained when I graduated high school. Oddly, I think this is a good thing in my situation. It's like my mind cleared out during the summer break and I'm beginning to feel new, more refined feelings, probably a part of growing up. One night I started writing poetry out of the blue, the words just came out and I wasn't even aware I had that inside of me.   The only part of my being that hasn't grown in these few months is my self-image. It's holding back the beauty that I feel. Losing weight was the only thing that made me feel sort of better about my body, but never *good enough*.",False,False
