You very well could have lost weight but because it is gradual, you don’t really notice a difference in how your clothes fit. I usually don’t notice weight loss in myself until ~10lb and seeing a photo of me taken by someone else. And also! Perhaps you *are* losing but you’re losing equally around your body, so even if it is difficult to see changes in a specific area, your body overall could be changing.",False,False

But I do want to let you know that I've been there and I feel your pain. The best overall advice I can give is to avoid purging as much as possible.  If I could go back in time and change one thing about my early ED years it would be to stop purging. It never was an effective way to lose weight and the side effects have followed me for years even after stopping.  Hang in there -it's gonna be okay",False,False
