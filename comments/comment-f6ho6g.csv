Thank you so much for taking the time to comment and help me. I truly appreciate you and your kindness. I am currently seeking therapy hopefully with someone who specializes in eds. I'm on a path right now to discover what will get me through and how I can begin others areas of my life. The non-zero days thing makes complete sense to me. I think that would be effective for the majority struggling with mental health. It's tough to do a lot with your days sometimes and even doing one thing can make a difference. Thanks again and please try to stay strong and try to take care of yourself! :),False,True

Everything you are feeling is normal and valid.  Like you said, you should try not to compare to other people but it's nearly impossible not to. I'm 27 and all my friends are getting married and I turn around like ""when did this happen, why am I so behind?"" But when I take a step back I realize that I'm going at my own pace and that's okay. We all are dealing with different things and the only person you are competing with is yourself.   You are still SOOOOO young. You have so much ahead of you. Maybe you are ""behind,"" but there's so much time to course correct. You should take this time to decide how you want to move forward. Are you at a place where treatment is right for you now to help you get on track?  If not, that's okay. I was reading something on reddit (someone pls remind me where this came from, because I don't remember) about 'non-zero days'. The premise is to every day do one productive thing. Just one. No matter how small. That helped me immensely because sometimes it is too much energy to do the big things, but I can usually do one little thing whether it's cleaning or exercising or making one phone call that I've been putting off. Sometimes it snowballs into me doing more things than I planned.   Not sure if this was helpful but know that you're not alone.",False,False
