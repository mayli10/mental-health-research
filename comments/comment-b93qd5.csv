I've been going around here probably contrariwise to the rules saying that the golden rule is to eat for nutrient density. Counting macros MAY be useful, but if it causes you to become anxious, don't bother counting. This sort of rule is naturally going to steer you towards things like eggs, meat, fish, cheese, liver, and nonstarchy vegetables. The calories per gram is high but you don't need to eat much to feel full because it's all protein and fat, not carbohydrate (which for some people has an orexigenic (makes you eat more) effect).  If you wind up bingeing, it'd be more of the same, with a bias towards truly indulgent things like clouted cream (place whipping cream (has to be 33%+) in a ramekin, and bake at 195F for more than 3 hours - more than 12 if the ramekin is large. It's a pudding on its own once you're stabilised on a real-food animal based diet, even if not mixed before cooking with sweetener and maple extract as I once did)  _CONSIDER CAREFULLY_ (weigh the benefits of accelerating the clearance of visceral fat against the likelihood of developing worse DEB) a two to three day water-and-salt (really, coffee, tea, hot chocolate sweetened with a noncaloric sweetener, anything that isn't sugary is okay) fast after eating a bit of liver and greens, to let the system cycle through a bit. Since you say you're having a hell of a time trying to sleep, your priority should be sleep, hydration, and electrolytes. If you're O.W. you shouldn't have a big issue physically with a couple day fast, but before commencing the fast promise yourself you will break it with something nutritious in a small portion (to prevent refeed syndrome) and then the next day eat something nutritious in a normal portion. __Given the history of ED you have, I would not recommend a fast.__ If you think you have it in you to do it without a relapse, it can be a powerful tool for blowing out the cobwebs. However, most of the benefits can be derived simply by ensuring that what you eat is all high in nutrients and unprocessed.  The weight, if you are worried about it, is secondary. Right now you should want to focus on proper nutrition, so eat to satiety. On this kind of diet, if you are insulin resistant, that will rapidly clear and appetite will probably drive you to negative energy balance.",False,False

You don't need permission to want to get better, but if it helps you, here: you absolutely have permission from all of us reading to seek help, feel better, and do whatever you need to do to get well. Asking for help is a scary thing, but you can do this. Instead of feeling like it doesn't fit into your plans, try considering that it *is* the plan. You are not a failure if you do not hit some goal, some date, or some activity. You are a human being trying to make the best out of the situation you are in; that you recognize your feelings and have the desire to recover is a victory in itself.  Undoing years of disorder thoughts and behaviors is disruptive and scary, but isn't the thought of continuing down the road you're currently on even scarier? That was my thought when I finally opened up to my doctor this week. You can do this. ",False,False
