I kinda get this mindset of one slip up and I have to start all over, like count for days in recovery resets. I really like the view you've got. I'm hoping the habits I've built up will take over for the next couple of days. ",False,True

How many days are in 6 months? Almost 170. If you were purging everyday, that's 170/170 times you could've hurt your body. 100% of the time. However, it was one day. One time. 1/170. Just a bit over half a percent. 0.58%. That is such a huge improvement. The more days you go, the lower that percent goes. You havent halted any progress. Keep pushing through. Remind yourself, you had 170 opportunities and only took 1. That takes immense strength, and I'm proud of you. Keep working hard. I believe in you",False,False
