You have mentioned in the past that you have been light headed recently - giving blood will only make this worse. Are you healthy enough for your blood to benefit the recipient? In my country they test donated blood for certain health markers and dispose of the blood of it isn’t upto scratch.  Is there a chance you have low iron?   Hope you are doing ok love.,False,False

The waiting period is purely for your own health so I highly recommend waiting out the 8 weeks as to not severely injure yourself. Stay safe love,False,False
