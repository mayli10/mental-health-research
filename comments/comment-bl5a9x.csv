So I was just wondering if anyone else thought that he might have had an ED or anything",False,False

Oh yeah he said those exact words, I felt really bad for him too. Dan’s one of my favorite humans, it makes me so sad whenever he talks bout his struggle with depression.

Honestly I think they’d make a cute couple, but I think they’re both straight and just good friends with each other.
