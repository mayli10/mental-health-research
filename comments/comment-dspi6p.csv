I don't abuse laxatives... But I have to do an enema at least once a day to stay comfortable. Its really addicting and I spend at least 2 hours a day ""taking a bath"". I tried quitting once about 4 months ago but I didn't have a bm in 8 days so I started right back up again. If I don't flush myself until the water runs clear ai cant sleep or do anything. I get a clear euphoric feeling... Almost like a high. Its a terrible thing and I have a lot of trouble in my life because of it. I cant travel, sex is almost non existent unless its right after, and I never go out of my house after 8pm. Please please dont do this to yourself. Its the worst thing I've ever done to myself.",False,False
