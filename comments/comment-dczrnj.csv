The key for me to avoiding bloat is to get your body used to semi regular consumption of liquids and foods. When I used to fast and go so long without putting shit in my body i would bloat hella, I think it was cause my body wasnt usedto havin stuff in it. This really finna suck but I'd recommend suffering thru the bloating as you acostum your body to regularly consuming things. I drink at least a litre of fluid a day. Im in deficit most days but I consume a lot of volume foods and foods rich in fiber. Also I drink tea, I heard it helps with bloat. The combination of high fiber foods (I love oatmeal and broccoli) and ample liquids also helps reduce constipation for me. Your bloating affecting you this much could also be a perception issue. We all know that we feel more like a ~skinny legend~ when restricting so when you eat you'll trick yourself into thinking you look noticeably heavier when you dont. I have an ed so I get what ur saying by feeling fat but 113 for 5""6 is technically underweight. So it really is mostly a mental thing. I hope you feel better. Be kind to yourself.",False,False
