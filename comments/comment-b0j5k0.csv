Oh my lord I feel your pain. I don't know if there's anything worse than a silent room and a roaring belly. Sometimes I actually just think my stomach does it purposely to embarrass me... like it doesn't make a noise until everything is absolutely silent and then it goes mad.   Totally off topic and random but I have this thing where I can't burp and instead my throat makes WEIRD noises that my friends say sound like frog noises lmao. When I was in school it would be silent and my belly would start up of course and then my bloody throat would start up too, I can't even imagine what everyone must have been thinking... It honestly must have sounded like there was a fight between a frog and a whale inside me every. single. day.  ",False,True

My stomach growls in my lecture halls during the morning all the time and I feel like people are hardcore judging me.  Coffee is my BEST FRIEND now.  It's barely any calories, I love the taste, it suppresses my appetite, and even if I'm having hunger pains I can take a sip and the pain will diminish, and when it comes back I can take another sip.  I drink energy drinks pretty often as well.",False,False
