I talk to him about it sometimes but he doesn't really understand. It's easier to avoid binging when he's around, that's for sure. He doesn't seem to care that I measure all my food or have meals that are tiny. It's not easier or harder, just less lonely maybe.",False,False

He’s such a good person, and if he loves me so much, that must mean I have some good qualities too, right?",False,False

I, on the other hand, since living together, do not go to the gym as regularly and have been absolutely stuffing my face. I will devour all my food and then eat his leftovers because I hate to waste it. And then I tell him not to judge me as I'm eating it all...  When I lived alone I could go all day without eating... I've asked him to help me control myself better, but he just tells me he can't stop me and does nothing... No comments on when I talk about how much I hate how different I look now either.   Honestly, if I could eat the same way he does, I would most definitely eat under maintenance and lose weight. Which usually couples eat similarly when they live together, yet that hasn't been the case for me.",False,False

I thought you meant couples who use this sub together.  Ha ha  He decided to get off of here and stop reading because he thought it was invading on my space. He knows I'll give him the good memes. So yeah,False,False

Men have a completely different experience with body hate growing up and express it very differently. My money's on his sharing is from comfort, not toxicity.",False,False

He makes eating easier. But he’ll also point out that my twice daily weigh-ins, nightly mirror ritual, body checking while we’re chilling on the couch, incessant worrying, etc. make him sad. Since it’s something I can’t just give up, I feel sadder about it, too. I’ve also noticed him start to talk negatively about his own body and that hurts even worse. Maybe he’s more comfortable and open with me after years together or maybe I’m just so fucking toxic it’s splashing onto him?  on the flip side it’s comforting to not have to hide a big part of myself from someone I love.",False,False
