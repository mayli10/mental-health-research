May I suggest that when you cook, just use a little extra of things? If you're making veggies, add some olive oil. It's pretty high cal for a very small amount. If you have toast, start small and spread a spoonful of peanut butter on it. Or maybe buttered toast. Just take the time to enjoy some foods that are still healthy when eaten in moderation that you havent eaten in a while. Dont rush into recovery- eating a lot after eating so little for so long could be painful for your body. Just slowly expand how much you eat. Consider packing some Ritz crackers when you leave the house. Easy way to get some extra calories while you're on the move.   I hope I've helped at least a little bit. Please be kind and gentle with yourself, you're doing great so far. Good luck",False,False

Recovery is a slow process with ups and downs. You ate 750! Awesome! Maybe tomorrow you can eat 850 or 900. Thats like one extra snack. Its scary but its something like a protein bar or a 2% yogurt or a glass of milk/chocolate or banana or hummus with carrots. Its endless possibilities. Its noy a problem if you can't eat 1700 to 2200 calories right now. You'll get there  Thats just the physical part (and slowly building exercise). Then mental part is as hard/harder, but the pain and anguish you may experience is worth it. Journal, make art or music, talk to someone like a friend or family member or a professional. As your body gets the nourishment it needs it makes things a bit easier. Ups and downs happen. Progress not perfection.  You are worthy of love from another and also worthy of love for yourself. You are beautiful and strong. The answers to this are simple but not easy like at all.   I'm rooting for you. I believe in you. Believe in yourself too",False,False
