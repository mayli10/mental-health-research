It can be hard to let go sometimes though. This was lovely advice, and I really appreciate it ❤️",False,True

I always binge whenever I'm near my GW which leads me to constantly gain/lose the same 10 lbs. It's so frustrating when I'm so close and then have to start all over again. I wish I could have a nice middle ground and eat normally instead of the two extremes of restricting and bingeing 😞,False,False

Now I’m 190 because I almost exclusively binge now. I would rather be restricting and on adderall and in the gym 3 hours a day and taking laxatives and throwing up at this point if it meant I wasn’t this fucking fat. ",False,False

Unfortunately our bodies do have a unique weight range they wanna stay in and will do anything to stay in that range. That being said, I feel your post so hard. I’ve been trying to get to 110 for like ever but every time I get close to it, I end up overeating for several days and get back up to 120. 🤦🏿‍♀️🤦🏿‍♀️🤦🏿‍♀️🤦🏿‍♀️ I haven’t found a solution for it yet but this week I have been kinder to myself and letting myself indulge in some cravings and not waiting until I’m starving to eat has helped me not go overboard.

I don't think you'll like all of the following advice but this is how I see it, and how my own doctor/therapist/nutritionist see it too:  It sounds like your body really doesnt want you to be that weight, and releases hormones to override your control and make you binge. That's normal, and it's not your fault. That weight just happens to be outside of your body's unique healthy range, that's all.   Is there any way you can tolerate letting go of that number? Can you go down to 117 instead, for example, or 120, or 125, and see if you stay there naturally? At your height, all of these weights are lower-healthy and I assure you you do not look fat at any of them, that's just impossible and it's body dysmorphia telling you otherwise. That said, you don't even look fat now at 130, I promise. It may be that that is your body's minimum tolerable weight, but it's still very much in the healthy range for your height and I bet you look amazing there. Bloat goes away, and I bet if you tried to eat semi-normally at that weight or higher you'd find that it does, and you'll look and feel a lot better than if you were at 115 or 126.   I'm really sorry you're going through this, yo-yoing is so frustrating and torturous, but it may be that your body is trying to tell you something. I think you might be happier if you tried to listen. And remember, if it gets really intolerable at a higher weight, you can always lose it again like you have probably loads of times before. Just try it once for a few months and see how you feel. Also, I promise that if you let your body take control, you will not become obese. You are nowhere near obesity, and even if you overshoot weight restoration, once it redistributes and your body trusts you again it will come back down - but it definitely won't go so far as obesity.",False,False
