The only way she’ll ever recover is if she wants to, literally no one else can make that decision for her. Definitely still suggest she seek help but the way you phrased it like you were telling her what to do? If you were my friend I wouldn’t tell you anything about it anymore either. ",False,False

There's nothing you could have said that would have made her eat.  Family and friends might be well-meaning, but are usually ill-equipped, and even if they aren't, the dynamic of being family or friends does NT include the dynamic of being a therapist/medical advisor.   Trying to fulfill both roles will destroy friendships.  There's nothing more you can do, you can't make her get help. You have to decide if you can deal with not bringing it up again and keeping silent when she does. You are under no obligation to continue this friendship, especially not at the cost of your own mental health.  If you can't keep yourself from bringing the topic up, she might be the one to end the friendship (that's what I would do... and have done).  If you think your friend is in immediate danger of death or serious harm, you should, if at all possible, contact her family or authorities to protect yourself.  ",False,False
