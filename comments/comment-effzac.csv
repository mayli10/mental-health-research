Sometimes I'll be standing in a grocery store aisle for way too long, or at a restaurant looking the menu up and down. I think things like, *'Life is so short, I could die any time and it would suck if my last meal was a carrot or something restrictive. I should just eat what I want!'*  And then literally 10 minutes later, it changes to *'Life is too short to be so indulgent and hate myself and my body this much. There's no way I'm eating that.'*",False,False

I've never thought *that* far but you're right.   And the thought of never being satisfied with our appearance and being miserable AND on top of that being counter productive like you said.. yikes. That's a recipe for living in misery.   And hey I'm turning 21 next year too. How can we help ourselves get better?,False,True
