I've been high restricting a lot lately, with no fasting, pretty much for the entirety of November and I feel REALLY guilty about it. Like I'm a big phoney faker and I'm just choosing to do this and I could quit at any time.  Never mind that 1) I'm still restricting far below what I should be eating, it's just not what I personally consider ""extreme"", and the thought of going over that limit causes me a lot of anxiety, even if my limit is ""not that low"" 2) my average caloric intake is lower than when I used to yoyo between binging and fasting/low restricting so I am actually eating less than I ate when I felt more ""validated"", and 3) I spent the month BEFORE November (and like... the two months before that) in a severe binge cycle, so literally just eating at maintenance would still be a massive improvement  Anyway truth is that we all have such a messed up perception of ""normal"" eating now that when we are slightly less wacko than normal we feel like we're eating like ""normal people"" when actual normal people would look at us like... what are you doing",False,False

I'm tryna recover and some days I eat a normal amount for my weight just fine whereas others I feel SO GUILTY. Just remember that you don't have to fit perfectly in any category to be validated about your experiences with an ED.,False,False

Basically I’m composed entirely of guilt and confusion.   Something my therapist pointed out is non-ED people don’t usually have an existential crisis after eating adequate nutrition for their needs. Helps me chuckle a little at least.,False,False
