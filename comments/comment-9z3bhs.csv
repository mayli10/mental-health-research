I come from a family where everyone is freaking perfect. I got my first B junior year of college, and I was devastated. I ended up getting a few more and graduated 0.005 away from Summa at my school. It was incredibly frustrating.    But you know what? Even not being Summa I still got into the top graduate schools in my field because of other experience I acquired while I was in college.    At the end of the day does it still bother me that I wasn't perfect? Yes, but my world didn't end. It turns out the only expectations I fell short of were my own- everyone else still saw me as successful.    I think realizing the world won't actually end if I fall short of my own expectations does sort of help.    Also, dealing with failure is *important.* The more failure you deal with, the easier it is to pick yourself back up.    ",False,False

It’s just easier said than done to not be irrationally hung up on ‘perfect’ numbers. It seems to be my trademark these days. I’ll try to keep this info in mind. ",False,True

NO ONE cares about the difference between a 3.6 and 4.0, particularly if you are taking science and math courses (Summa Cum Laude is not listed on any file we would get from you). What will matter a lot more is your personal statement. The GPA stuff is really only about making it passed an initial cut at most graduate programs. So really GPA only matters for getting you on people's list... I don't care at all about GPA for graduate students---their personal statement matters a lot more.  Anyway, you can have irrational hangups about the 4.0 thing, but it shouldn't be because of how this will impact your life--it won't. ",False,False

But my mind won’t accept the logical side of it.   I can’t stop thinking that I should have done better, I should have made sure I got an A. I still have a few pretty difficult classes left so I wanted to have more of a cushion with grades for them, and now that buffer has gotten smaller. It’s just a deep personal disappointment in myself.   What area(s) of study do you evaluate grad students for? What would be the lowest GPA that you would accept for a grad student?",False,True

You still got that.   I understand the perfectionism thing. I made it to my last semester of undergrad with a 4.0 and at the end I got a B+ in sign language of all things. It sucked at the time, but did not change a single thing in my life :).   I can tell you that as someone who evaluates people for graduate school and jobs, there is no difference between someone with a 3.9 and a 4.0.   You really need to stop the black and white thinking (but not all the time...hope that joke is ok).",False,False
