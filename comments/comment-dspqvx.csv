No those probably aren’t the  healthiest eating habits.   Clinically Abnormal eating habits aren’t the same as thing as unusual eating habits or unhealthy ones. Even when eating habits are abnormal they typically aren’t deemed eating disorders unless it’s an ongoing behavior that is occurring due to psychologically pathological reasons (ex. *compulsive, anxiety/panic related, maladaptive coping, among others*) because EDs are mental illnesses.  So we aren’t capable of telling you If you have an eating disorder or not based on you not eating healthy for 4 weeks, it’s not possible for us to do.  It’s best if you confide in your parent/guardian, counselor, or medical professional",False,False

Alternatively, you can give that food away to peers or even teachers (who can give to students who are hungry). I just hate to hear it's being thrown in the bin!",False,False
