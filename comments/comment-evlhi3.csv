I‚Äôm actually pseudo recovered but it was always soul crushing for me at my lowest weight to still be bigger than all my friends (who were all very slim East Asian girls).   Even when I had like 13% body fat I would still be unable to fit into a size 0 top because my shoulders were just too broad. My hips were also too slim comparatively, so I just felt like a wannabe body builder who neglected leg day üò≠  I ended up just wearing tank tops a lot of the time because the smallest sizes fit (without the interference of my manly man shoulders lol). Of course, that also meant that my already freezing ass was constantly shivering, but at least I felt skinny lmao.",False,False
