I think this might be the first time I‚Äôve actually done it because I want to, and not because I‚Äôve felt pressured into it? My trouble is I‚Äôll do really well for a few days, and then slip back into eating less. I guess it‚Äôs like how it was in the beginning with restricting, but in reverse! Something that will take dedication and training. Good luck to both of us &lt;3 ps I‚Äôm a cappuccino girl ;))",False,False

""Curly hair or straight hair depends upon genes. The crust of bread has no bearing upon one's genetic make-up. Although the origin of the myth that eating crusts can curl hair is unknown, it is thought to have emerged at least 300 years ago in Europe.""  Although, if it's going to get you to eat your crusts then I'm calling google out for fake news.  Yeah, we were told all kinds of crap as a kid like if you eat your carrots you can see in the dark.

I believe you're right that I deserve it.  This damned ed's been telling me otherwise for so long and all they do is make people suffer.  Stuff raw carrots and celery as a night snack.

Feeling something substantial to settle my stomach instead of scrappy bits and pieces like cereal bars and raw vegetables.  I love coffee for the warmth inside but even that gives me stomach ache.  Toast is so good.  I used to like warm bread too but it's weird how I'm thinking untoasted bread is worse than toast.  Stupid EDs.  X,False,True

I hadn't gained any weight and so didn't qualify for the sessions after that which are supposed to help with body image and dealing with weight gain.  I have to start some PTSD therapy in the new year which is linked to my ED and after that I go back to the ED clinic.  I think that if I'm trying on my own to eat foods I was kind of forced to eat (but couldn't), by the time I go back I'll be in a better position to actually do the meal plan suggestions because the actual foods won't be as much of an issue (the range of foods I eat is extremely limited which is a problem).  One of my bugbears about recovery is how there doesn't seem much flexibility in how they approach it.  I know it works for lots of people, but I found it impossible to gain weight when the sessions about dealing with the gain comes afterwards.  I really wish I could be someone who's given a 3000 cal a day meal plan and I can just tuck in and do it, but I really can't.  Thanks for the comment.  X",False,True

Reliving the smell of it (which I love, but which triggered the panic attack when I tried eating it) and remembering how good it tasted.  I don't want to link it to anxiety.

The afterwards was the thing I struggled with most in therapy.  I felt I was being pushed to do too much too quickly.  I wasn't offered any more sessions because I hadn't gained and so didn't qualify.  I was going to maintain but very slowly I'm gaining.  Very slowly.  It feels better to know it's ME who's deciding to do that and not someone else.  Still a control thing, but a positive one maybe?  No idea how I'll deal with things when clothes become too tight, but I'll wait until I get there.  I still don't feel okay when I treat myself to a latte once a week.  I think about it all the rest of the day and I've been doing it for a couple of years!  Still, once I've drank it, it's done.  I like to keep a couple of things off limits to the ED whatever.  I'll be damned if it robs me of my latte!   X",False,True

I'm kind of figuring out that having panic attacks is a relatively small price to pay for achieving some kind of food goal.  I mean, they're so hideous and you want to avoid them, but getting through it is worth the pay off.  I had agoraphobia for some years and going out was the same deal.  It was hell to deal with, but in the end I got my freedom to go out and be ""normal"" in that way again.  I'll take it in small doses, but there's no rush.
