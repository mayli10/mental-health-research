This is abuse - highly suggest you talk to someone; the police, your GP, therapist or anyone you trust. Even if you decide not to officially report them, it's a good idea to tell someone in case this event happens again.   I can understand she might have something like ""carer stress"" or feel burnt out from being around someone with a mental illness (a legitimate and valid feeling), but her actions are unacceptable. Limiting/cutting off your relationship with her might help protect you and also stop her from feeling ""overwhelmed"".",False,False

I’m so sorry that happened to you, and anyone who views that kind of violence as justified is frightening as fuck.  The father of my children was physically abusive, and some of the most traumatic incidents of his abuse were honestly times when he choked me. It’s just not something you ever exactly expect, you know?   And it could very easily kill you, so. There’s that, I guess.  Gah. I’m just...so sorry... I think the element of her doing it because she was “at the end of her rope” with the self-destructive behavior you trusted her with is particularly disturbing. Like you can’t actually express *concern* for someone hurting themselves *by hurting them yourself*...like???? That doesn’t?? Actually?? Make sense??? (Or was she trying to “punish” you in some way? Because that’s equally disturbing, if not more disturbing! God.)  Sounds pretty scary. That is 100% unacceptable, and you deserve so much better. I hope you can feel safe again soon.",False,False

You don’t owe her or her roommates anything. I know it can be hard, especially if you’ve been friends with her for a long time, but she doesn’t deserve your friendship or even your time. Put yourself and your own safety first. Don’t go.",False,False

That's really extreme behaviour that I would expect only from someone immature and unable to control emotions, or someone abusive.   You don't owe friendship to this person, especially if your own safety is at risk (I hate sounding dramatic, but if they think it's okay to choke you and excuse that, then they may be more extreme down the line).   Ugh, I'm sorry this happened to you. I hope you can mentally disconnect the chocolate milk from all that soon :(",False,False

That's totally justified. What she did was awful. Please be careful. I read an article a couple of years ago that found a correlation between people who have choked someone before and people who are more likely to actually kill someone. Something about the fact that choking is so... ""intimate,"" for lack of a better word - it requires that they be very close to your face while harming you, unlike shooting someone from far away. I work for a judge, and when we were on a family court calendar he actually started asking me to highlight if someone has been accused of choking before because it could be an indicator of DV being present in the home. All of that is to say - please please please be careful around this person if you do find yourself around her again because this kind of behavior could be an indicator of more violent tendencies.",False,False
