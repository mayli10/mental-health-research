I don’t think that high number is typical but I’d been carrying so much water weight from upping the ante at the gym and from my period that I legit woke up one morning 7 lbs lighter. It was my first whoosh ever and I’ll never beat it but lemme tell you - it was real. Have faith. ,False,False

I restricted suuuuper low for like 2 months and barely saw a lbs gone. Bumped up to 1200 for my pseudo recovery and start of recomp and I’ve no joke lost 3lbs in a week. So honestly I don’t believe in anything anymore and I’m pretty sure god has abandoned us. But for real, Don’t worry. Math doesn’t lie. Bring it back to logic and remember it’s physically impossible for you not to be losing even if you can’t see it yet. ",False,False

Don’t know your height but if you are at a low/underweight BMI your body doesn’t have “spare” mass it can sacrifice for energy anymore so it’s doing everything possible to conserve energy before it starts burning up muscle and vital organs.,False,False
