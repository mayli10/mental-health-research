I got into ER once for cutting myself in a panic attack covering about 30% of my arms legs and neck, I was freaked out. But from then on, I got a therapist (that I asked for many years, but I was not taken seriously) and support and I don't feel I have to hide and suffer alone (reason why no one believed I needed help). So Although this is a hard scary moment, it is a moment to get up from, it will be a jumpy long road, but life can get better with some work. I truthfully hope you feel better soon and keep feeling better over time. We are here to support you.  I tent to also abuse clonazepam, take 3 times (3 pills of 0.5mg) my dosis at once or many times a day (making up to 5). I know it is wrong but I was not sure how much is a dangerous amount. And I have wonder that not only to avoid harm but to intentionally cause it (depending on the mental state). Idk what dosis are your pills but it is not as much pills as I though. I really need a new psychiatrist =/. Please be safe. ",False,False
