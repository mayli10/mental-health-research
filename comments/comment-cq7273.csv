I mentally prepared myself to have gained at least 4kg, but I got on the scale (after a full day on eating and fully dressed mind you) and was only 2kg heavier than when I left  I seriously believe that all those TDEE calculators massively underestimate how many calories an average teenage girl burns, because theres *no way* mines the 1500 I estimated, it just looked that way when I was weighing myself religiously because of fluctuations",False,False

I’m sure you don’t weigh nearly as much as you feel like you do",False,False

Its easy to change your mind on the spot at the doctors and decide to look, so what I always do is chug heaps of water, put on heavy clothes, and get out of the house before I can have any other thoughts. That way the number is unreliable if you do decide to look.",False,False
