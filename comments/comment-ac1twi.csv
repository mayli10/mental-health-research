I took it every day/ every other day my senior year of high school and ended up doing some great things, choir, yearbook, AP classes, straight As, even won student of the month in October. Lost weight too.  I stopped abusing it because I started having hallucinations that made me question what was reality and what wasn't. Not scary nightmare stuff, just straight up hallucinations of normal everyday things, except I couldnt tell what was the hallucination and what was real life.   This may have been from the sleep deprivation that this drug can cause? Idk, for more info pm me",False,False

I take vyvanse for BED and it is sort of like a sister to adderall. It is a longer release as opposed to a quick release. As said above, it did wonders for motivation and depression. It has also helped significantly with binging and it seriously has been a wonder drug tbh. The downsides are things like teeth grinding, insomnia, hypertension, irritability, dry mouth (omg srsly the worst) etc etc. The reason I mention OCD is if you do have repetitive thoughts, you can be forced into a loop when on a stimulant. I take another med to help the repetitive thoughts associated with OCD which helps with the vyvanse. Because adderall is quick release as well, a lot of these symptoms can be more intense (for lack of a better word) and lead to a higher chance of addiction. Regardless, just be safe, don't abuse them &amp; check with your doctor when you can :) ",False,False
