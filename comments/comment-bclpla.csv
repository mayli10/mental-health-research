Making an unrelated comment that has nothing to do with the current conversation will make people uncomfortable. If you're talking about eating, or disorders, or something similarly related, make a small joke and continue to read the room. If someone expresses concern or shock at you joking like that, just tell them that you're dealing with some stuff and humor is something that helps. If it makes them uncomfortable, you're the only one here that would know your friends well enough to know if you should just stop for good, or slowly integrate it into what they know of your personality. Respect their comfort levels just like you'd want them to respect yours.  I made a freaking joke about my sibling's death the other day, and when one friend was shocked I just said that the topic we were talking about (witnessing death) reminded me of their death scenario and I could either laugh about it or start crying. They completely understood and we moved on (other than the continued guilt for making the joke... yaaay). I don't joke about it very much at all, but they're not going to treat me like a weirdo (any more than they already do lol) for having my own way of coping.",False,False

Of all the times my friends have joked about their addictions, eating disorders, suicidal thoughts, cutting, *even if I was struggling through the same shit,* I was always super uncomfortable because I didn't know how to react, other than to have a very frank discussion with them about whether or not they're okay and need to talk to someone.    They care about you and they want good things for you, and they probably don't know how to react in a way that will be comforting or supportive or acceptable to you because they're not sure where The Line is.  They don't know if you're asking for help in a roundabout way or if you're going to snap at them for asking if you're okay.  Hell, *you're* not sure where the line is, either, to be fair.  And that's okay.    If you need to talk about it with someone, please definitely talk about it, but I would recommend against joking about something others aren't ready or equipped to handle.",False,False
