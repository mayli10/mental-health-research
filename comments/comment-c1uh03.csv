I try not to keep any binge food at home so sometimes I end up eating the weirdest things. Just the other day I was eating spoonfuls of coffee whitener. Or another time I mixed flour with a bit of water and ate that. It sucks because 90% of the time these things don't even taste good but I eat them anyway,False,False

This was a symptom of either emotional deprivation or physical deprivation. Just be determined to eat in a way that you can cope with moving forward. If you insist on being mad, be mad that you didn't allow yourself whatever calories the breadcrumbs have, to eat something you'd have really wanted. Like I said, interpret what happened as a need. I promise, it won't do you any harm. Hugs xo",False,False
