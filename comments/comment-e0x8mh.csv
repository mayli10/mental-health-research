It just shook me to my core because I’ve been admittedly kind of failing at my recovery, I’ve barely been eating, I don’t drink a lot of water so when I stepped on the scale expecting the number to be the weight I’m managing to maintain and it said 5 extra pounds I literally gasped and I just stared at myself in the mirror for a long while, my facial expression was like I was just told I only have 6 months live, like “oh my God, this is the end of the world!” But no, my fuckin underwear just weighs a lot.   Lmao, that was a trip.",False,True

I always weigh significantly more after drinking any liquids, like I know I did not consume 5 pounds of liquid but it adds on and gets me every time. Still don't understand it.",False,False
