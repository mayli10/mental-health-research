I've never been a fan of hers (as a musician or as a person honestly) but I've been literally waiting for the moment in her career when she came out about some  type of disordered eating. Like even in the (brief) years of my adolescence when I didn't even have body image/eating issues. I'm still amazed that my suspicions were confirmed 10-12 years after the fact.,False,False

Some might call it promoting unhealthy eating habits, but I like that she shows the harsh truth. I prefer that to people who claim ""I eat soooo much and stay sooo skinny!!!"", because I find that more triggering personally, like there's something wrong with me that I can't do the same.",False,False

And it seemed like with Lover she started alluding  to it in the album notes, but I was so glad she talked about it explicitly in the doc! I loved how she said “we don’t do that anymore” to herself, which is something I try to do in my recovery too! Super relatable and I’m glad she’s able to talk about it now, for her fans",False,False

So then people think those body types are realistically attainable if they just eat and exercise the “right” way.   But you can’t call it out for what it is because it’s “skinny shaming.” And TBH I don’t think we should be “calling out” skinny celebs, but I wish more of them were honest about their actual diet/exercise routines and the cosmetic and plastic surgery they get. Nobody pretends their tattoos and piercings are “natural,” why can’t we acknowledge other cosmetic forms of body augmentation?",False,False

Honestly she was too stick-ishly thin and when she did get to a healthier weight it just seemed to click and make sense. I think she looks phenomenal and she should be proud that she’s recovering!!

We’ve been around the same weight when she was her thinnest and I always tried to find out how much weight exactly so I could feel safe at that number.

It’s nice (for lack of a better word, you know what I mean lol) to know that actually, she’s not naturally that way and she really had to put a lot of effort into being so slim. It was a problem and a burden for her to be that way. So I shouldn’t compare myself to her for not looking like that, as it’s not naturally possible for her and so why should it be for me?

I mean, yeah, maybe you wanted her to be the stronger person and realizing she's human sucks, but at the end of the day she has millons judging her, magazines talking about her looks or comparing her to other women. I can see why she felt like she needed to be a certain way. We (probably, I can't assume) made the problem ourselves. Yeah, the media and society might have some influence but no one is actually talking about our bodies. More often then not, it's just us thinking they are judging when in reality no one gives a fuck. BUT to be honest untill not so long ago I thought that was how she was. I thought she was a natural skinny girl that didn't had to worry about her looks. I idealized her a lot. I guess I forgot she was human too",False,False
