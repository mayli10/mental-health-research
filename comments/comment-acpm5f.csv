I can legit buy identical jeans from the same store, same day, same display, the blue will fit, the black will be tighter. It's not just you!",False,False

I haven't actually worn the blue pair out and about yet since its summer here now so I know they're not stretched from wear. I laid them on top of each other and the blue pair is almost an inch wider than the black. No wonder why my thighs were so squeezed. ,False,True

It's not common, but it happens. I recently bought my sister a t-shirt and the next size up was clearly mislabeled, it was more than 2 sizes up. Clothing store employees don't check for this, they only check to make sure they have tags and are on the right hanger.",False,False
