Idk about you but I have a tonnn of loose skin which if you took it off it would put me down quite a bit more. I always wonder if doctors take that into consideration. Not that I’ve ever been to one bc I’m terrified of not being sick enough. Even though I’ve been dealing with this demon for 15 damn years!! 😩,False,False

Then I got to 17 and tried to self-recover after binging at Xmas because everyone was commenting on my body and I figured I would end up IP if I didn’t gain some weight. Setting a BMI for an “official” dx is so outdated and wrong and dangerous but that’s the DSM for you.,False,False

The eating disorder experts know you have AN (although OSFED is NOT a less severe eating disorder, some studies show OSFED has a higher mortality rate than AN). On the flip side I’ve been very underweight with AN but have never been put on a medical hold/had severe medical consequences so I feel like my ED is invalid.",False,False

People don’t give a shit if it’s extreme- and like if someone starting at BMI say 20 lost ****119**** pounds well let’s just say that’s very well impossible. It’s so drastic and the rate makes it even more so. I mean of course you’re sick! You’ve got anorexia! I hate the way they make us have to feel sick enough.,False,False

I’m so sorry that you’re surrounded by ignorant people. I wish you the best in your recovery, and just remember that you’re valid to everyone here. &lt;3",False,False

I’m so sorry you had to go through that. I’m of the belief that anorexia can start at any weight, it really only matters to people when either you’re sick for long enough or there wasn’t much to lose in the first place and that’s bullshit because people are sick of they’re sick. You are so valid and real and your anorexia is too. I really hope they change the diagnostic criteria, just because more people need help BEFORE they get to a 17.5 BMI. And the criteria makes them feel like they can’t. It gives us sickness goals and that’s just wrong.",False,False
