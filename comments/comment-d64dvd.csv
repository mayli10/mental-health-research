Sounds super unnerving. :( I hope they have the Hippeas next time, friend!!  From what I understand, sweet potatoes are like...*very slightly* lower in carbs and on the glycemic index? Plus, they’ve got a fuck ton of Vitamin A? BUT ALSO...regular old potatoes have a whole bunch of micronutrients as well??? ??   And NO potato is low cal! Clearly! AT ALL. Wahhh.  FUCK POTATOES honestly. *Fuck them all* for being *so delicious* and *so high* in goddamn overall calories and ~SpooOooky Dreaded Evil Carbs~. My dumb no-self-control-having ass definitely needs to stick with cauliflower.",False,False
