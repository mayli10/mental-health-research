So, sorry for the length.     Oh Lordy ðŸ˜³ Iâ€™m both ashamed and glad to identify with this in the way that I do. Ashamed because, duh, arenâ€™t we all?! But glad to feel less alone in the whole, ^I love my man dearly, but sometimes his body and/or eating habits can be super triggering to me!^  I definitely can never eat more than him when weâ€™re together, without ed brain trampling all over me for the rest of eternity.   Like, Iâ€™ve been trying not to admit it, even to myself, but I see how little body fat he has (Iâ€™d estimate zero lol), and I have this tug of jealousy. Heâ€™s ~6ft tall and has been consistently underweight or bordering it the whole time Iâ€™ve known him (and from what I gather, thatâ€™s just his natural state). I donâ€™t think heâ€™s ever even reached 150lbs, though Iâ€™m just guessing.   Iâ€™ve lost over 50lbs in the last year, and am only NOW (the last several weeks) finally the same as or less weight than him... (though I have boobs and actually have muscle mass, both of which he lacks but thankfully he loves both on me). I know itâ€™s not even a valid comparison anyway, but ofc #ed #brain do be like that.   I donâ€™t know where Iâ€™m going with this anymore, but I feel you &amp; send internet hugs and commiserate with you. ðŸ™ƒ",False,False
