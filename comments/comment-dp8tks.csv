They didn't mention if theres a dietician there, but they must work with one or be certified because every therapist there works with eating disorders so we'll see. I'm mostly just scared for the diagnosis and physical part. My heart is already a little messed up and I really dont want more bad news.",False,True

I had separate medical &amp; therapy intakes but it'd have been so much easier combining them because we covered so much of the same ground. Which was basically any and everything about food/ED-related thoughts/behaviors, body image, etc. All kinds of questions about any past trauma, household environment growing up, that kind of thing. History/family history of any substance use/abuse, other medical or mental health history, so on and so forth. Exercise habits. Household dynamics.   At the end of all that with the doctor, had a physical. Blind weighed in just a gown. Lying down and standing BPs.   The therapist didn't actually \*tell\* me a diagnosis until visit #2, but I'm not sure if that's because I just didn't ask or if she had to actually stop and evaluate later or something.   The doctor gave me a couple tiers of meal plans (because the dietician had no schedule openings for a while) and a portion guide to help get started.",False,False
