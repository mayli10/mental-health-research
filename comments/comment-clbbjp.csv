I hope you found something delicious, and you get a chance to eat some guilt free because you 100% deserve it.  And if you’re into dark chocolate that’s usually low cal so you can have chocolate and slightly placate the ED gremlin in one go hopefully!!",False,False

I hope you feel free enough to have some nice iced coffee and juice, and that the day turns into a nice celebration of self no matter what you end up doing 💓 🥳   I can’t relate to restrictive culture but I can relate to being separated from your doggo so I’m sending you same hat vibes thru the internets.
