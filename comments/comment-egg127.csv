I know that feeling of panic when you realize you’ve eaten a lot, but freaking out is only going to make things worse. The best thing you can do is drink lots of water. If it’s any consolation at all, you’d have to eat well over your maintenance calories for days to actually gain (not just water weight). I know it’s hard but try to be kind to yourself. You can DM me if you need an ear. 🙂",False,False
