My bf and I just moved in together, and I was going through a really rough time wondering if I should tell him about my ED, and if I did or didn’t, how would it affect our relationship. I didn’t tell him, and I feel like shit, but it’s just too hard to talk about my mental issues with anyone (even therapists). Plus I’ve always been at a normal (or almost overweight) weight while in the relationship, so I don’t want him to think I’m lying or it’s just another “diet.” I just feel like he wouldn’t believe me. And then if he knows I have an ED I won’t be able to get away with all my ED habits. But I’ll definitely tell him if we start seriously considering marriage....",False,False

Been there. But as a lifelong solitary (despite reaching out, including marriage, ×3) I've learned valor in aloneness. It's not all pain. So keep reaching out, but be your own bff too…",False,False
