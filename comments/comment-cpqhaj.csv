Feel your pain - my aunt told me my broad shoulders were the reason I weighed so much at 12 (was 5'5 130). 12 years later it still bothers me. My mom on the other hand.. she is big herself and liked when we could commiserate over big calves, broad shoulders and she's pissed now that's I've lost so much. Don't let her bother you and do what makes you feel best.",False,False

She’s always saying things like “oh you’ve gained weight” “you should really go back to the gym” but then again she says “oh you need to eat more” “oh my, you’re loosing weight”.  It’s not really the things she says, it’s the way she says... I am completely broken.",False,False
