Films her struggles and when she's doing well. She tells you what she's feeling and what her ED brain is saying. She's still in the process of recovery. She has a long way to go, but I've gone back and watched older videos and you can see the difference and the progress she's made. Her family is so fun, so supportive.. idk I just love seeing the good and the bad. Most ""recovery"" channels only show the good and it feels too much like glamorizing ED recovery. Like it's the easiest thing in the world.",False,False
