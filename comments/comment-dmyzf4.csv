When he sees us cry, it hurts him in a visceral way, I know he has litteral nightmares about me being sad haha. He does not reflect a lot on himself, so when he feels bad emotions he let it out on us often and then commits to it or goes for a walk, and he does not talk to us until he can talk without feeling angry. It is proper immature, but it is not from a lack of empathy. I am not mad at him anymore (even though he made me suicidal from the age of 4 haha) and i love him so much it hurts, but I know I can expect absolutely no emotional support from him.  I just did not want to stop talking with him so soon during the holidays.",False,True

If he thinks he is in the wrong, he does not talk to us for a while ans we all act like it never happened. If he thinks we are in the wrong, he will never let us live that down.
