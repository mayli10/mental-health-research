I wish I could help more, but she is the only person who can tell you if it's about control, or punishing herself, or being loved more. I can tell you that in my experience people thought my ED was about ""control"" and it never rang true to me. It took me years to figure out that my ED was a way to decrease my very intense anxiety. People did the best they could; at that point (this was 13-14 years ago) the running theory was that ""it's a control issue."" You sound very open-minded, and I'd add ""is this anxiety related? is it depression related?"" to your list. If you can also - and I am not suggesting you're doing this - avoid   putting her in a 'box' (I got so mad when people put me in the ""this is about control"" box). ED sufferers tend to have some traits in common for sure, but we are all individuals and nothing sucks more than people who think they have you all figured out because they read a book. (I am NOT saying you're doing that; I think you are doing the opposite).  What I really appreciated was people being there for me - I think you said you live in a different country and I really think the ""little"" things like texts or sending postcards or whatever could be more important to her than you realize.  You sound like a great friend, btw. ",False,False

This comment of yours just struck me because chances are, what she needs to hear isn't actually practical advice, but something more along the lines of: ""You are enough just as you are. You don't need to change or 'control' your body in any way to be good / worthy / loved."" I know your heart's in the right place, and I can't tell you how touched I am to see that you're trying to help &lt;3",False,False

I definitely need to revisit how I approach bodies and what she could be experiencing. My therapist was very firm with telling me that I should not jump to admit to thinking she could have an eating disorder. I’ll definitely make sure to let her take the lead and focus on the fact that she is not just a body and surface level appearances ,False,True

Like how getting thinner isn’t going to stop your arms and legs from being soft and weak, but getting muscle and eating a lot of protein will give those results.   Can I offer some feedback here? No offense meant, but this kind of advice isn't very helpful. It actually reinforces the notion that her body is the problem that needs to be fixed (even though I know you don't man it that way). It suggests that changing her body is still the right answer, and her only mistake is the way in which she's approaching this task.  Really, the issue is not with her body. It's in her mind. It doesn't matter what her body looks like, she needs to not be so attached to the idea of improving it to reach some imaginary ideal that exists in her head. There's nothing inherently wrong with what you're saying, and lots of people diet or work out with aesthetic goals in mind, but for someone with an ED, they need to take the focus off of external appearances and disentangle their ego from how they appear or what their body composition might be.   From a purely physical perspective, yes, it would be healthier and make more ""sense"" logically to eat more and exercise and do all these things. But mentally, she needs to let go of the idea that her identity is tied up in the surface-level stuff about her body. This is where therapy usually uncovers the true roots of an eating disorder and how/why it's taken hold emotionally. It's really not about the body.",False,False

I’ve watched and read about 6 hours worth of material and the #1 thing just trying to understand. The only things that come to mind are that she’s trying to get her boyfriend to love her, she is trying to cope with work, and is experiencing a flare up of her dysmorphic view of her face.   Her bf is a piece of work. He is trying to end things and has been trying to end things for 2 years. He sucks tbh, I wish they would break up but I can never tell her that. She’s completely blinded by him even though he’s a narcissist. She just got a new job and i thought she was handling it well, but from recent convos I can tell she’s been crying for help at work. And severe couple of years she fixates on her facial features for hours a day.   Do you think it’s a control thing? Or is this a way to like... punish herself? Or does she think being thin and getting surgeries will make that guy love her?   I feel so sick not being able to help her. I want her to rely on me but I wish I could convince her to get some help. I feel like if she had the clarity to see that guy for who he is and some help coping with the stress from work she would be living her best life. ",False,True
