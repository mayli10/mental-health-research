Nowadays the growing popularity of tracking macros, calories, and the origin of food is just,, way too overwhelming for people with EDs  Good luck to you friend! Food is meant to be enjoyed!",False,False

I really think life was so much simpler as a kid.   I ate when I was hungry, and didn't know of these calorie monsters that plague my brain for the past 10+ years",False,False

So now they're gone and when I think about doing what I used to, I get terribly sad. I just want that simplicity back. But instead of dealing with my grief like an adult (which I am), I do weird stuff like eat a specific amount of watered down porridge out of a baby bowl with a teaspoon.",False,False

I'm so tired of obsessing over EVERY aspect of food. I wish I could at least stick to one thing like watching the calories OR the macros. I just can't ALSO obsess over whether something is processed or whatever. It takes way too much mental energy to do that.",False,False

Not just those who suffer from ED‚Äôs. Getting the chance to hit the reset button and start again a new. A second chance to put everything right and feel safe again. Dwell on the past, wait in the present and fear for the future.   I spent seven years trying to get to year one when my ED took over my life and I lost everything in the fire of anorexia. I wanted to be able to eat certain foods without guilt and repair the relationships I damaged and even apologise to people who left my life.   Your story is so familiar to me. I ate cereal for my dinner and drank coca cola and pepsi for my breakfast. I had a poor diet and as result gained a lot of weight as a kid. Won‚Äôt go into it now. I talk about it in my other posts.   After treatment and a lot of group. I am somewhat stable. I do restrict a lot, KCAL count and still exercise probably too much. I never lost that pavlov's dog feeling. I would love to be able to eat without guilt or miss a day in the gym. Reset and start over but I am what I am and if I can‚Äôt be that child in the past maybe in the future I can be that adult.   Stay strong. The universe has a way of breaking through the binge/purge and providing the insight to grow. I can‚Äôt reckon the past but you can shape the future. You have plenty of life to live and maybe someday you will have a couple of bowls of sugary cereal, seconds at dinner if I wanted them &amp; a bowl of full fat ice cream after dinner in the not too distant future.   Hope this helped.",False,False

I was a little bit of a chonky kid and I was made aware of it constantly by my mom. I think I ate as a coping skill after some traumatic things too. I‚Äôve literally been obsessed with food in one way or another and feeling guilty over it &amp; fat since age 8. I literally don‚Äôt remember a time when I wasn‚Äôt weight &amp; food obsessed.  Yikes this post made me realize it might be time to get some help.,False,False

My dietician told me a lot ‚Äúmy stomach doesn‚Äôt have eyes,‚Äù in the sense that it doesn‚Äôt care where your food came from, it‚Äôs going to process it and break it down to basic components no matter what. And with overly sugary foods, if you‚Äôre eating a balanced diet some extra sugar really won‚Äôt make a difference.   Kids have the best diets tbh",False,False

When I‚Äôm full-fledged in recovery, I basically do revert to eating like I did as a child‚Äî what I want when I want, but in controlled portions. Eating like a kid was actually a huge help to me lmao.   Honestly the golden age of my adult life was buying a box of Smucker‚Äôs unctustables and being so excited to fit them into my meal plan.
