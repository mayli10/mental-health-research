They used to never care about calories, only sugar content. After they saw how much weight I lost in a few months, they started praising me, saying that I was successful and doing what other people couldn‚Äôt. Calling me strong and in control. Whenever I do try to recover they make it worse by commenting on things I‚Äôm drinking or eating like ‚Äúwow! That has so much sugar! Look at the calories in that thing!‚Äù Or ‚Äúgeez only one of those is 160 calories? That‚Äôs crazy.‚Äù It‚Äôs so fucking annoying. I can‚Äôt event attempt to recover for longer than 2 weeks or so without relapsing.",False,False

He uses the word tiny with so many girls I know purposefully because he knows it triggers me. It triggers tf out of me and idk why tbh. But it does. Idk how he knows it's annoying but he does.  He also calls me fat and has low self esteem around his weight too and encourages me to lose more. Even gave me the name of diet pills(he's a doctor for fucks sake üôÑ). Ugh fuck him I'm fueled with anger rn",False,False

My mom called me fat on my 19th birthday despite my losing 10 pounds. I don't like eating out with my parents because I fear they're going to comment on my eating habits or weight.  Jokes on me, I'm not fat but my stupid brain will never let me believe that.",False,False
