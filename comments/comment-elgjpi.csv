Even if it was not her (the post was very old) she still seems like someone who struggles with food. She was a ballerina (already a red flag) and looked very not well for a really long time. She was already pretty skinny before she did heavy drugs but after that (especially the visions - artangels era) she looked absolutely not well. Not in a *oh i am naturally skinny and have a fast metabolism* but in a *i have issues with food* kind of way. Yet again she also admitted to struggeling with her mental wellbeing and she seems to have a fitting personality (controlling, neurotic she also refers to herself this way in interviews so thats not me making stuff up)",False,False

Pretty sure she said somewhere too that her dad was very strict about what she and her brother ate and made them exercise for multiple hours a day.,False,False

I resonate with her on a traumatized girl level but I don't think she has a full blown eating disorder despite the above,False,False
