I went out to by vitamins for me and there in the same aisle I saw a girl, as tall and as skinny as me, also looking for vitamins. Later I found her near the baby food aisle because I wanted to check out shit there too. Then at the protein bars. Then where the gluten free things were (they have little pretzels there that are less than 300 calories a pack). It's like we were looking at the same shit and I looked at her again and I just knew. I knew she is going through the same. Hope she is doing better.",False,False
