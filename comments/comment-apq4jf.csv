Even if you eat enough if you're not at a healthy weight you're at an increased risk of such things happening.,False,False

I've been drinking a ton of water today but I'm still really thirsty, the feeling won't go away. I'll get a powerade or something tomorrow and see if that helps at all. Thanks ",False,True

I had one a few weeks ago and scared my sister because it was so severe it looked like I was having a seizure. It can happen if you are dehydrated, overheated, stressed, move too fast, experience pain, etc. Basically anything can cause one. My suggestion would be to 1. Drink fluids, 2. Try compression socks/stockings (helps with blood flow), 3. See a doctor. Syncopes are a symptom, not an illness, so there may be an underlying problem (like an ED). Thankfully mine was just dehydration and overheating.",False,False

Try drinking water with a pinch of salt (sodium) and lite salt (potassium), as well as taking an Epson bath or pills for magnesium citrate. Stay safe friend ðŸ’•",False,False
