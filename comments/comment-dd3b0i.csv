Mood is a mess. Tomorrow or the next day I have people to see and I start working Monday. I want to isolate (not talk to anyone unless I‚Äôm at work) for at least a month or so and I know that wouldn‚Äôt be good for me but it‚Äôs so tempting. I feel so bad.

I just don‚Äôt want anyone to know anything about me anymore which is really dramatic.,False,False
