But you're beautiful, you deserve recovery and happiness. If you're not there yet, that's ok too. One step at a time. Just try writing down ""I am worth loving"".

Even if you're not ready to reach out to a loved one/counsellor/doctor, you will always have a whole community of people here ready to support you.   You ate the soup!!! Yahoo!!!!! That's one step forward! And tomorrow you will maybe eat nothing, or a pickle, or absolutely everything. And all of those are okay. There's no arriving point, no solid-black line between 'ED' and 'Healthy'. Which can be scary but it's also comforting, because nobody can be perfect all of the time.

I know this is hard to acknowledge (and trust me!! I don't believe this most of the time either!!) but you deserve happiness. Legit. And what you eat or don't eat is never an indicator of what kind of person you are.
