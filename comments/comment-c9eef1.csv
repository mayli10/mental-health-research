I’ve been working at a bakery this summer and I’m just CONSTANTLY surrounded by the smell of butter and chocolate and bread and cake and it makes me wanna just eat everything and then cry because I ate everything. It’s kind of wasteful but I’ve learned to just have a bite of something when I crave it and throw most of it out (it gets thrown out regardless).,False,False

My boss was super super awful BUT it was slow a lot, I was the only one working a lot, and we had 0 inventory maintenance practices... so basically I could eat whatever I wanted as long as it wasn’t super super noticeable.    Anyway I’m a slut for Starbucks whipped cream so I would make myself drinks with extra whip or just have espresso-shot cups of those all the time. We also made the most amazing brownies that we then kept in the fridge until we needed to put them out on display... eventually I discovered putting whipped cream on a chilled brownie. So good. So good. I have no idea how many calories it was and I don’t want to know.    I feel you 💖💖💖",False,False
