He looked to be UW or close to it, especially for a teenage guy. Only one to order a water. Then he looked through the menu for a long time. Asked me some questions that I know I‚Äôd be asking in that situation. Then decided to get nothing. His mom tried to coax him or suggest something small but he wasn‚Äôt interested, she even n mmh entiende he hadn‚Äôt had breakfast. It made me so sad to see someone so young and honestly saw myself a little in him, being a guy as well. I wanted to suggest a low calorie option or something but I also didn‚Äôt want to be rude or out him, especially if I was wrong and he just wasn‚Äôt hungry. Such a weird and sad situation from the server side too. I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about it the whole day and felt like I had made a mistake by not doing anything.",False,False
