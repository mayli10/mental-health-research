Although collagen is an important component of the skin and hair follicles, it will get broken down by your digestive system, rather than being directed to the areas you are hoping to treat. These breakdown components will not have an effect on your hair growth. Studies do support improvements due to Biotin supplements. But these types of results will only occur in situations where there is a severe deficiency of this vitamin to begin with. And such cases are very rare. Hair growth is really contingent on a rather complex array of factors which often start with the health of your follicles. Besides the building blocks themselves, you would also need to consider [oxygen flow via red blood cells, energy metabolism of your hair follicles](https://ugro.com/studies-on-the-relationship-between-riboflavin-and-hair-loss/)and the ability to counter the oxidative stress of free radicals through abundant levels of antioxidants.",False,False

It's better to buy the ingredients yourself. Mostly proline, lysine, and vitamin C for skin. Throw in biotin, flax, and zinc for hair.   Biotin doesn't cause a reaction unless it's not pure (common occurrence, as many pills have fillers), or people took way too much too fast. I recommend Bulksupplements powders. A bit pricey at first glance, but their stuff lasts you months, so it comes out cheap in the end.  Also, ignore collagen creams. They're a scam. Collagen is actually too large to be absorbed by the skin unless it's been modified and those tend to be outrageously expensive, like several hundred dollars. That $12 collagen cream isn't going to do shit. Same thing for vitamin E, another scam. Doesn't really do anything taken topically, most studies at best show inconclusive results, and at worst, can cause bad skin reactions. Lastly, keratin shampoos are also fake news. They coat your hair which may make it appear thicker at first, but eventually they'll weight it down and do more harm than good, as you'll have to then strip your hair to get it off.",False,False
