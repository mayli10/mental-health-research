I am not particularly hungry when I wake up but once I start eating my stomach asks for more. So I usually don't eat until the afternoon before work and 4 pm on weekends.

I think most people eat breakfast, even people with EDs, because while you're asleep you aren't eating anything for an extended period of time. You digest everything during the night, therefore, you're super hungry in the morning. Also, for those who are good at restricting, just eating breakfast is a good energizer for the rest of the day. Instead of subsiding on nothing all day, they eat and then lessen the risk of a late night binge.   Idk, that's just what I'd gather why people would eat breakfast if they so choose",False,False
