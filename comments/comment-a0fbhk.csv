Problem is I don't trust myself to have trigger foods around and feel like I am purposefully putting myself in the danger zone if I have a whole cake in my fridge - kinda like exposure therapy through constant exposure.   So far it's helped a bit, and I also keep some staple safe foods on hand and lots of water enhancers and teas I try to use as a distraction in case the bingey feels are fleeting.  I'm not sure what I even like food wise because I've been so fucked up on my relationship with it for so long.    For me, the exposure thing works because I would buy binge foods with the sole purpose of binging on them.  And I would eat them all or throw them out or chew/spit and it was only in my house for the purpose of binging and it led to incredible guilt and shame.  I eventually would plan binges and have cheat days that turned into cheat life.   That kinda stuff has lost its luster now that all foods are on an equal playing field and indulgent treats or whatever I considered bingey/no control items aren't explicitly linked with negative times or segregated into a restriction cycle that I'd beat myself up over for not sticking to. For me, cheat meals were a way for me to remain disordered indefinitely, but it felt like harm reduction when I was doing it since it kept me in a routine vs utter chaos I gravitate towards. Cheat meals aren't bad for everyone, though, and I'm glad it helped you!    It's still crazy hard and everything sucks sometimes, and the mentality shift is a work in progress and super non linear.   Establishing a better relationship with food takes teeny tiny baby steps in my experience in order for it to stick.  Even things like ""allow myself cereal"" but requiring berries or something with it is still disordered for me, but eventually I'll upgrade myself to ""allow cereal with no caveats.""  Not sure if any of this is helpful, but just wanted to share. :)",False,False

This is hell and I'm over it. After a little while I'll change it to slight gain. It's time to actually keep improving my fitness. I'm sure in the long run I'll like my body much better.

Check the calories beforehand and decide that you are okay with it.  You will be over for the day, but THATS OKAY.  I will sometimes do this and it stops a binge/purge cycle that usually lasts days.  I allow myself to eat something I’m craving, something potentially high calorie, but I make sure it’s not junk.  Something really satisfying and delicious, not just a fast food burger or some other garbage that I don’t even enjoy.    Eat it slowly.  ENJOY IT.  This is not a binge, this is not you losing control.  You are making a very controlled decision to take a day off and give your body some well deserved calories.  You will be okay.  I promise.",False,False
