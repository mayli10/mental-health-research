Grats though, when I got my first period after a long old time last year it felt...obviously painful and messy, it is a period, but it felt really RIGHT somehow as well, like my body felt better for it having started.   A year later it's mostly a pain now haha. But it's nice to know my body still has that function I guess. And for reassuring me that I'm not pregnant lol.",False,False

I did not cut out all exercise. After treatment, I built up running (from 2 days/wk, to 3, to 5) but now that it's cold out where I am, I've been running less and doing more strength training/ab circuit type stuff.  I normally swim 5-6 days/wk in the winter (club) but I chose not to do that this year because honestly it reminded me of when I was deep in my ED because I don't find it as fun as running so it was purely for calorie burn for me. I wanted to avoid that in my recovery.  So I think a combo of being weight restored and reducing cardio-type exercise is what helped me.",False,True

I haven't had mine in almost a year now, and I guess I shouldn't be surprised about it. In the last couple of months my mental state has been a lot better and I'm truly making an effort to eat proper meals and not overtrain, but it's hard.

I lost weight again but when I then gained weight back to 105 and exercised less, I got my period back. Then when I lost weight again by eating less but not doing as much exercise, I still had my period at lower weights than when I had been exercising lots.
