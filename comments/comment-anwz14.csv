I weighed myself and it‚Äôs like 4 lbs less than my starting weight which is!!! really bad!!! but at least it‚Äôs not more than my starting weight so that‚Äôs better I guess. I‚Äôve really got to get back to restricting fr. ,False,True

If you‚Äôre ok with what you look like now or want to continue to get better but the number will trigger you then just fuck the scale. Leave it alone. You gotta remember numbers are just numbers at the end of the day and they have no affect on you as a human being ,False,False

The scale doesn‚Äôt change anything. It‚Äôs just knowledge and knowledge is power! If you have gained then it‚Äôs ok! Just try to eat healthy and treat your body right! It will come off in due time. You didn‚Äôt gain it over night and it won‚Äôt come off overnight. It‚Äôs a process and that‚Äôs ok :) good luck! ,False,False
