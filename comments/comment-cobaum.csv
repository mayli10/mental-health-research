I tend to get very caught up in labels. My mom and I talked and I told her how I was feeling and we agreed to cancel the appointment until I'm a little bit more stable. I'm planning on getting back into therapy and seeing a dietitian when things have calmed down a little. And then once the stressor was taken away I managed to eat a decent dinner. Thank you so much for your help!",False,True

Maybe that's an unhealthy thought, but it makes me feel a little better to know that I might not entirely be in uncharted territory. I did end up talking to my mom and deciding to cancel the appointment for now because it was putting me in this headspace. I'm going to try to focus on just eating a little bit more and not feeling guilty for eating at maintenance. Thank you so much for your help!",False,True

I needed to hear validation. I was given the validation but then still didn't accept it, even after a professional read the criteria for AN and I had the symptoms she was reading. Had an eating disorder mindset, and with it I had the ""I'm not sick enough"" mindset.  But, I was also told by a professional that you don't need to be ""sick enough"" to receive treatment. If you're suffering from disordered eating/eating disorders, labels don't matter. If you are suffering, you are worthy of treatment. Worthy of a life where you might still have thoughts and urges, but are able to overcome in healthy ways.  I hope you get something positive from treatment, and wish you the best.",False,False

Also if you were underweight before then you'll be AN- partial remission or full remission.  I'm 19.6 right now and just got the AN diagnosis because I was underweight in high school from an episode.",False,False
