I went from sedentary with normal exercise to walking and moving a lot in the workplace  and naturally started dropping weight, and from there, I just couldn't stop.  Then it turned into ""Intermittent Fasting"" and it's all find and dandy apparently when I bring it up.  I mostly say this because I just don't want my coworkers to ever go through any disordered eating behaviours, even when I observe small bits of ED behaviours from them.",False,False

It’s the same as any other restrictive diet or exercise regime. You can use any method to abuse your body, it’s not exercise’s fault any more than it is IF’s.

The worst is when people ask how you lost so much weight..
