Maybe 4 years ago, I was at a low healthy BMI and I ate whatever the fuck I wanted. Fast food sometimes, big bowls of cereal, many snacks in the morning (I always get hungry before noon). I was praised for being effortlessly skinny. IDK what the fuck happened but at some point I decided being at a BMI 20 was unacceptable and I started restricting and now here I am, on an endless diet because I feel like even if I go back to my previous habits I'll swell up into a giant balloon of lard.   Except you know what? My friends who know me from the time I was a child say I was very serious with eating well by then as well. So maybe I had an ED all along? I'm going crazy LMAO",False,False
