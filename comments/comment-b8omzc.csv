It‚Äôs hard to know what dress size I‚Äôll need to get. :( at least if I see myself in mirror, I‚Äôll def be restricting after that.  It feels so impossible to accept 1lb a week but I need to stop my b/p pattern.   It‚Äôs so tempting to go double digits and stay in the 90s but I don‚Äôt want to be super dizzy again and end up getting bloated from dehydration in hospital which is the sad state of my high weight right now.   obviously I‚Äôll word this better next time and post on my other account.
