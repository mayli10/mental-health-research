The one who shaved her head was on in 2013. The most recent season from this year also had a contestant named Ruby.,False,False

Don't get me wrong, I don't think she's hideous and I don't want to appear hateful, but I literally see her as no one to get triggered over. ESPECIALLY now since she's shaved her head after the show.  I guess what I'm saying is that, OP, beauty is subjective and, in some people's eyes, you can and probably do already look more attractive than she does. You're okay, OPüíï.",False,False

In the season that was just released on Netflix, Ruby triggers THE SHIT out of me. In the first episode, I talked openly about how physically perfect she is with my fiance and he agreed that she was super attractive. Don't wanna spoil anything, but she was in that series way longer than I initially thought she'd be (she is indeed a great baker). I don't normally compare myself to others that way, but I just keep thinking about how I can never look as perfect as she does.",False,False
