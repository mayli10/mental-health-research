My phone number for the loyalty program is 867-5309.    It's still fucking awful to go in there and make small talk while buying safe food, but at least it's a small comfort that they don't know my real name ü§∑",False,False

I went there earlier this week and one of the employees REMEMBERED MY ORDER and then told me that she was wondering when i was going to be back.

Honestly I don't think it's petty, but I'm also more liable to speak up when somebody makes me uncomfortable so others may feel differently.

I get that this is a small, local, family owned business so they probably encourage this sort of thing from employees but it's 1000x worse than if I was recognized at, idk, Walmart or some other generic grocery store because there are a million other generic grocery stores I could go to in my area but this dumb fucking natural foods store is the only one in an hour's radius that has my safe foods. At least he hasn't started commenting on what I'm buying yet. Maybe I'll just point blank tell him I have an eating disorder if he tries to do that so that I can make him as uncomfortable as he makes me. Is that too petty?",False,True

Stuff like ""oooo this looks good"" or ""oh I love this flavor of chips"" and it was always so hard for me because I knew how much I hate that as a customer. I feel it's rude. I always assume if someone tells me ""oooo that looks good"" what they mean is ""oh that's pretty high in calories"" cashiers should stick to talking about the weather or what types of bags you want. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",False,False
