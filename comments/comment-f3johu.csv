I don't think there's any risk for him treating me(he's a doctor at the university hospital where I'm a medical student, it's more that we will be likely to see each other from time to time, but luckily it's a very big hospital), so I will try to avoid him. I will look into the suggestions you gave me also. It made me feel so validated, since I previously didn't even think this could count as harassment. Thank you again for taking your time to answer me and for your kindness❤️❤️❤️",False,True

It sounds like you’re dealing with a lot of trauma due to his harassment. Are you seeing a therapist at the moment? I think it might be worth looking into if that’s an option for you. Mine has been a tremendous help with my PTSD (from other men, not my stalker, but that’s besides the point).  I really wish I had more advice for you other than to try and avoid him when it’s best. If you ever end up assigned with him to treat you in any manner, I’d DEFINITELY recommend either firmly requesting a replacement or refusing service. You don’t have to put up with that, you know? You always ALWAYS deserve to feel safe.  I’m also proud of you for working towards recovery, you’re fucking awesome!  Also for what it’s worth, you did nothing wrong. That shame is common when you’re in a place of feeling triggered, especially involving trauma/harassment etc. Sometimes it helps me to look up other people’s stories about harassment (not graphic ones) and think about how much I’d support them if they were telling me their stories - i wouldn’t blame them for anything that happened, but show up with compassion and kindness. Show that same compassion and kindness to yourself. ❤️",False,False
