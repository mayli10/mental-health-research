He knows how I am about food and calories. And I make all of his meals so I am aware of what he needs. No one “needs” a high calorie dessert. It’s just a treat for his birthday and he doesn’t even like sweets that much. He just likes getting something I baked on holidays bc I love baking,False,True

Or you can do ice cream cookie sandwiches with halo top ice cream? I made vegan ones that were pretty good. I think it was a tasty recipe.  Or if you wanna treat him to a birthday breakfast treat you can search low cal cinnamon rolls. I did a vegan 70 cal one that was soooo good.   I think the fondue idea is good too. Fruit, marshmallows, gram crackers, gummies!",False,False

Literally just cut up a variety of fresh stuff, have whichever kinds of dipping sauce you think he'd like (melted chocolate, a lighter whipped topping, whatever), and arrange it carefully with toothpicks on the side.  Easy cleanup too. Would be hard to save in the fridge compared to some of the others here, though.",False,False

I wouldn’t trick him and say it wasn’t low cal... I’d definitely tell him. But since he isn’t a sweets guy, it’s always my call on what to make bc I’m the one who likes desserts.

No one can tell the difference when I do. Cuts out like 600 calories. I haven't found a low calorie sweetener that can replace sugar yet. Sad days.,False,False

Like brownies? Cookie cake? Cookie? It’s his birthday so don’t try to fill it by feeding him low cal ED food. I know because I remember when I first got my eating disorder my friend really wanted chips but they were SO many calories so I was like what about an apple LMAO and she ate an apple with me, come to figure out years later she was hella disappointed bc homegirl just wanted chips. My recommendation is to have two desserts a safe dessert for you and one that he wants for him!  With that being said -you can do halo top -sugar free jello -fiber one bars and hide the wrappers -fruit parfait  -MERINGUES -apple confit w just apple/ cinnamon/stevia/vanilla extract  I just have found people in my life hate my ED/Safe food, so I separate the two so we’re both happy! You can pass off the apple confit as apple cobbler though! Or do two small ones in pie crust and use the exact same things for the filling and just don’t eat the pie crust!",False,False

Basically it's layers of an angel food cake kinda pulled apart into chunks, prepared sugar-free cheesecake pudding (from the box mix things), cool whip (you can find light cool whip), strawberries, and blueberries. And then you just repeat the pattern for a second set of layers. No baking or anything, just chill in the fridge for a little.
