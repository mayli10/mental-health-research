He’s been trying to put on weight recently but only succeeds cus he’s basically eating a week’s worth of food I’d eat for every single day. It’s insane how much he has to eat to gain anything. I’m here starving most hours so I don’t gain...,False,False

This definitely contributed to my ED. I never felt good enough for him, because he was eyeing up stick-thin girls on the sly.   Comparison and giving a shit is the real disease here.",False,True
