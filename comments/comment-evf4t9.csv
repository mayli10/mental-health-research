Unfortunately, they didn’t even care until I was literally almost dead.   It’s not worth it and you won’t be happy.   But of course, the ED will try to convince us otherwise.   I recommend therapy. Not sure if you have went through therapy or not.   We are all here for you and I’m glad you’re introspective enough to notice this.   Eating disorders often are seeded in childhood and pop up during adolescence. They distract from whatever is really wrong.",False,False
