I usually exercise everyday but yesterday I didn’t. I spent the entire night eating and eating and eating. I probably ate like 5,000 calories or something. I don’t even wanna count because I’m scared. I was pretty sure I was gonna gain like 4 pounds but when I woke up I didn’t. I’m also curious like, how does this happen and why?? Human body is weird",False,False

If this happens, it’s water weight, you haven’t gained fat.   It’s my understanding that no, you won’t become any heavier than you are now due to fat gain if you restrict, but if the meal/binge in question was particularly salty or carb heavy then you might find that you retain more water over the next couple of days.   Ofc if there’s anybody who understands human biology better than I do and I’m wrong please correct me!",False,False
