It's like, I can't trust my own judgement about when and where to eat, obviously, because I'm a pig, but if other people are all eating then obviously it's okay! It can't be helped! It's almost like I HAVE to eat, if everyone else is!  Then, of course, I end up eating more than most of the people there. I can't just enjoy it in moderation lol.

I use other people/social situations as internal ""permission"" to eat or over-eat sometimes. Often times if I'm planning on meeting up with people, I'll restrict more leading up to it because I'm anticipating being able to eat something I normally wouldn't.  Then they say they're not hungry. Record scratch. It's such a gutting feeling, like, not only do you have to deal with the disappointment of not getting something you were really looking forward to - which, when many of us suffer from food insecurity issues, is especially difficult and triggering - but you also have to deal with feeling ashamed for being ""weaker"" than everyone else and for sticking out. And you have to simultaneously hide all of the negative stuff you're feeling because you'd look like a weirdo if you threw a tantrum or even pushed the issue over going out to eat.  Almost nothing makes me feel more garbage about myself than meekly sending my feelers out to ask my partner if they're hungry or if they want to get \[X\] food I'm craving, and they respond strongly that they're not hungry or interested.  I feel like such a failure and a fatass and pathetic. I know that's not what they mean, and I know equally on their part they're probably frustrated seeing me binge and regret it, so they have to put their foot down, so to speak. But still...
