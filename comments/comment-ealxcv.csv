I was essentially dry fasting. It didnâ€™t last long before I had to go to the hospital ðŸ™ƒ  Caffeine is a diuretic so it makes you pee and doesnâ€™t really count as getting liquid. Being hospitalized gave me a wake up call to start drinking water again but yeah it can be hard and I was still more scared of water than getting kidney failure. Water has no calories, it wonâ€™t make you gain fat. And with all the caffeine your drinking, youâ€™re not going to retain so much water either. But either way, fluids push fluids. Water retention is only temporary if youâ€™re dehydrated.  I just kind of force myself to drink water. Get a cute water bottle and always keep it with you to encourage you to drink more. Please be careful!",False,False
