I think that what surprises me about this mukbanger is the frequency of her videos. She is eating this food every single [day](https://day.You). Where are the fruit and veg? Other mukbangers upload maybe once a week. I kinda get how one huge meal per week os easily doable if you  take care on other days but the rate of Steph's videos is really surprising. I truly hope her health is ok.,False,False

She also drinks so much water is like it's part of the mukbang.   I think it's more enjoyable to watch even if I know she's hiding food, most mukbangers chew then cut the camera which ruins the video for me as entertainment as well as I see chewing and spitting being more disordered than not finishing a big meal.   I think maybe she compensates with not eating the rest of the day or exercising (she mentions a personal trainer), and she seems to be affected when she talks about being called fat in school. she doesn't sound like someone with an eating disorder though, just someone with insecurities ",False,False

You could also tell that her boyfriend was SUPER hesitant to participate in her destructive behavior, because he'd obviously worked very hard to get his body and did not want to binge and destroy all of his hard work. I mean, I know nothing about him and his own waist was pretty tiny, so maybe he has his own disorder, but it was pretty telling that as a bigger man who is capable of processing even more food, he was reluctant to participate. I also was a little disturbed by her 'food porn' type shots of what she was cheating on and the 'mms' she made after each bite. Anyway, she clearly has a destructive relationship with food and I hope she gets some help, or that it doesn't cause harm in the future.",False,False

When you're accustomed to training a lot and are fueling yourself properly and getting adequate rest, the odd day spent exercising for 3 hours is not a big deal. I did about 3 hours yesterday myself, split between cardio (spinning) and a pull workout with some accessories. I felt absolutely amazing (hello endorphins) for the whole rest of the day and didn't even end up eating really any differently than I eat any other day, other than, it looks like I ate more carbs than usual, which makes sense (I follow intuitive eating but I'm tracking at the moment). This level of activity is out of the norm for me. Normally I do like 45-50 minutes daily, with about two rest days a week, and I take recovery rides (usually endurance zone, 115-130 bpm for me) on an as-needed basis to help myself heal faster. I've been training on the bike for a long time and my body is well adapted to it, so it feels good to do something more challenging once in a while and there is benefit to doing so from a progression standpoint. Now if the only thing I posted on IG about my exercise routine was the odd 2-6 hour ride I do, you might think I have a problem, but you wouldn't be seeing all the other times I'm resting and eating like it's my job.     And as far as restricting goes, while I agree that she is likely compensating outside of her cheat days, she isn't necessarily doing so in a restrictive or disordered way. A metabolically healthy body with normal digestion can process a pretty insane number of calories without too much issue and without significant impact to your physique, and then it'll tell you that you overdid it by making you feel less hungry the next day. The biggest difference between me today (being physically recovered from AN), and me when I was in my ED, is that I can pound a massive dinner and wake up the next day the same weight as the previous, whereas during my ED, weight would stick around for a very long time. Steph's cheat day weight took a couple days to come off (her digestion was probably a little slower from cutting), but ultimately it did come off. I personally do not do cheat days or anything of the sort but that is because I don't want to have that kind of relationship with food.",False,False
