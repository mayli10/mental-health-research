The thicker the socks, the better. I buy boots 1.5 sizes too big so I can wear thick wool army socks over top of other ankle socks and still have my feet fit in my boots.   Tank top, t-shirt, and then flannel, then a quilted vest is one of my go-to uniforms. If your jeans are big enough, wearing tights or leggings under them helps too.   Blanket scarves are my saviour. I wear them as shawls 24/7, at home and in the office (and at university too, before I graduated). I usually get home from wherever and change immediately into big sweats and dive under my blankets.   Hot tea and black coffee also help warm you up from the inside, while also warming your hands!

This is key! I wear long johns, an undershirt, then my pajamas, a sweatshirt, and socks  - lots of blankets. ALL the blankets!! Fuzzy ones &amp; comforters! It’s best to sleep w a fuzzy one on top of you and not the thin sheet or comforter first, it traps all the heat in this way  - pillows, lots of them! It makes you more cozy - if your dorm is the same as mine and if you can help it, do not put your bed against the wall, they don’t insulate the outer walls so in the winter, anything that touches the walls are ice cold   Out and about:  - get those hot packs you can put in your shoes - wear fuzzy boots if you can - avoid rubber shoes! They make your feet colder  - double layer socks or triple layer, make sure the socks are at least ankle rise.. if your feet are warm, your body generally stays warm  - undershirts!!! Always always always wear an undershirt or two underneath any sweater or long sleeve shirt you wear  - jackets with long sleeves are your friend! Good for rolling down over your hands to keep them warm when you need them but can be rolled up when you have other stuff to do. Also they’ll keep you warm - hats!! Anything that covers your head and/or your ears (they have those cute ‘stylish’ ones that may be work appropriate) - if you can, take a bottle or hot water w you to work in those cups that insulate them. Put like lemon and honey or whatever you want in it and sip on it throughout the day, it’ll warm up your core temperature  - big red gum or those hot tamales are kind of like “spicy” so they actually help a little bit in tricking your body to rush some blood into you but only for a lil bit   I wish there were more ): I feel your pain!
