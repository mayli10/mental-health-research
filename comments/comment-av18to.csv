I was inpatient for two weeks and they just feed you lots and take lots of blood tests, blood pressure checks, etc. ",False,False

There’s also intensive outpatient (meets 2-5 times a week for a few hours for groups, meals, etc), partial hospitalization (5-7 days a week for more like 8 hours), and residential (24/7 care but tends to offer more freedoms as you progress and doesn’t feel as medicalized).  It’s amazing that you can recognize that you may need the additional support. Your team may be able to evaluate what treatment level will be the best fit for you and which centers they’ve seen the most success from. Also, when you interview at the actual place, they can let you know more about what will fit your needs.  I just dropped down from a residential program to their partial hospitalization. Feel free to pm me if you have questions or anything!",False,False

Honestly, I'd rather jump in front of a train than go back again. In a lot of ways it did more harm than good. I hate the locked doors, hate being treated like a defiant child when I'm a grown-up woman. Too many idiots work in that field, at least around here.  It did save my life though, so I will get them some credit for that.   It's an excellent way too get back into eating regularly again and putting some weight back on simply because, well, there's not any other option. They're not going to let you starve yourself, or get away with leaving food. Once you're in, it's a total loss of control - which can be a double-edged sword.    Socially, it can be an incredibly toxic enviroment or it can be an incredbily supportive enviroment (sometimes both at the same time). One or two people leaving or getting admitted can completely throw everything off balance and it's really difficult to not get affected by that. Likewise, if someone else is struggling, it can have tendency to snowball, because it affects everyone else. But on the other hand, you can also get inspired and borrow some hope from other people as well. It's amazing to see people go from being sad and depressed and on the verge of death to being weight restored and energetic and vivacious, even if they're still struggling. I've met so many wonderful people in treatment who have affected my life in a positive way.   Having access to around the clock support who take your experience was great, and I do miss that sometimes. I think if you're willing to give it a try, and if you're motivated to make a change it could be helpful. At the end of the day you won't know until you've tried it.",False,False

For me I hated it. It was like a popularity contest, who was the most sick, who was ""faking"" their ED, etc. That energy is and was so toxic and exhausting. I also personally dislike the lack of privacy. I understand why there isn't much to start with and there's steps/levels but as someone that really enjoys privacy to do things quietly like read, write, crochet, etc it annoyed the hell out of me. I also disliked the meals moreso because of how I felt like I couldn't voice my opinion or express dislike in anything without nurses/doctors/RD's thinking I was regressing in behaviors. Like yes, they were ok with my veganism as in they didn't force me to consume animal products but still I got a lot of ""you're not eating enough of this food group"" or this is why you need supplements, or you won't eat the entire veggie burger with bun, you're restricting too much. Shit like that drove me up a wall. I did like the art therapy, and when I was in IOP and not in-patient I did like the group therapy.",False,False
