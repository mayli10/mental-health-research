I've heard despite the pain people sometimes accept death during heart attack. I just don't want to have a stroke.  Now I can't tell if the feeling in my chest has been anxiety this whole time or something else. It's definitely anxiety now. Why the fuck did he tell me that? He knows I'm not going to the doctor. Just let me die suddenly and without knowing it. That's all a human could ask for. Come the fuck on.,False,False

It also ruined my food. The fact it was a woman makes any tactics I have for men that make me uncomfortable out the window. I have to live here.

So on the one hand I was annoyed bc I'm working all weekend and I was looking forward to a break between shifts, but on the other it was an excuse to eat party food and I had been cruising for any reason to binge all week.  But I didn't binge. I overestimated what I did eat but even then I still did pretty good. I mean, on the one hand it was easy bc almost none of the food they serve is vegan, like if I could've eaten the party pies or sausage rolls then I would've been in a lot more trouble lmao. But OTOH I still showed some actual restraint. There was a vegan dip I only ate a little bit off with veggie sticks, and fresh fruit. The one big thing I allowed myself was a thick slice of fairy bread because my sister made it vegan specially (well for my niece with food allergies but she checked everything for me too which is so so sweet) and it was sooo good and nostalgic lol.  But then. Folks. Let me tell you. They had RITZ CRACKERS just SITTIN there. I love those buttery salty bad boys so effin' much and so you know what I did? I had TWO. TWO. I had one and it just melted in my mouth and I wanted to grab the rest of the sleeve and run off and hide in the kids treehouse to go feral lol. But I put it in MFP instead and saw they were only like (cals &gt;!18cals each!&lt;) so I had another one and then I stopped before it became too late and I decended into cracker hell.  Ritz cracker are such a binge food for me. I would eat whole sleeves at a time, sometimes with nothing even on em. To be able to physically stop myself in an environment where eating is encouraged is like... huh?  Anyway I successfully finished No Binge November so that is my BIG achievement!! This time last month I was eating thousands of cals every day. Guess it's time to binge tomorrow LMAO actually no. I would like to see myself next Saturday still not having binged. That would be nice.",False,False
