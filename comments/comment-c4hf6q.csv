Purging is really dangerous. I got to a point where if I saw a toilet after a meal, my body involuntary vomited. I started vomiting blood. It was terrifying. I hate to think what the dentist would have found if my mum had taken me to one. I had tooth shaped calluses on my pointer finger for YEARS afterwards.
