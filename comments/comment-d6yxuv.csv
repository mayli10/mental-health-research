This is literally, like, the worst.      Also, when people try to tell an anorexic person to eat a cheese burger or some other highly caloric, fried, unhealthy meal. Why would you tell a person with an ed, or anyone for that matter, to put in super crappy things into their body? It makes me feel like they're dumb and don't know how to avoid getting fat because they lack nutritional knowledge.   Also, commenting on anyone's body period has just become a trigger for me. I feel like people with ED's are usually less judgmental (or more) than the average person because we know how it feels to be over thinking our own bodies/relationships with it as opposed to someone who doesn't care.   I feel like everyone has some kind of love/hate relationship with food, unless they are very self disciplined and naturally don't care for food.
