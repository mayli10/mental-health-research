I gained back all the weight I lost through a heavy restriction period in the winter and I am so uncomfortable in my own skin and desperate to get back to my thinner self. When I feel this way, I find myself seriously judging overweight people, even my family and friends. It's awful and I hate it so much. I promise I'm not normally so judgmental, especially because I have such a fear of people judging me, but the voice in my head is so loud and I can't shut it up...",False,False

I'm always hyper-fixated on other people's bodies nowadays, but depending on how I feel about myself, I focus on either people who are larger or smaller than me (and their eating habits). Also I feel ashamed of myself when I see someone thinner than me turn down food or leave food on their plates. if I'm out with a group of people it's like I need to give myself permission to pig out -- if the other people aren't finishing their food or ordering something calorically dense, I can't either. I also try to estimate people's tdee it's fucked up...if I eat the same thing as my father for example (who is taller than me and male obviously) I feel awful because like, I shouldn't need the same amount of food as him etc.  but like you said, when I am restricting, I look at other people's Normal food with envy and when I'm not, all I can pay attention to is the skinny girl holding her iced black coffee",False,False
