The year I started self-harming and the year I switched from BED to bulimia. Very overweight. The year I came out as transgender to my therapist and mum.  2011 - started my GCSEs at school. My mental health got even worse due to the stress.  2012 - suicide attempt at 15. Spent three/four months in a psychiatric ward.  2013 - dropped out of school after only getting 6 GCSEs. Lost contact with my friends. Turned into a NEET.  2014-2017 - gradually worsening mental health. Spent my days in bed, b/ping, and self-harming. Started taking testosterone after contacting a private clinic because the NHS hates me.  2018 - started on medication and felt some improvements to my mental health.   2019 - took my first steps to recovering from agoraphobia and signed up for a one-day-a-week class.  Barely anything happened this decade and most of it was negative. I'm *hoping* that the 2020s will be better but it's doubtful.",False,False

Steadily gaining weight but no interest in physical activity. Full adult height and actually heavier then than i am at age 21  2011- discovered MPA after a news site. Did the ABC diet lmao but I did dance classes and was happy  2012- very self conscious, always logging on MPA but never really doing much about it.  2013- peak weight, still healthy but body comp is all out of whack since i quit fall sports. Developed a crippling phobia at the end and ate almost nothing for a week out of fear, with my good metabolism i dropped 10lbs.  2014- joined cheerleading as a flyer, got a bad abusive bf. still healthy though and mostly happy, i was doing well as a flyer  2015- All went downhill. Bf became really crazy, bad rep at school, the squad got 14 year olds who barely hit puberty and were still like 4’11 and had good gymnastic skills so no spot for me on varsity. Then i worked pizza and started gaining weight so I went on a ~healthy~ diet and broke up with bf who stalked me. Hit LW. Took the SAT. Fun  2016- got a little less depressed, made some awesome friends, got back to my usual weight. Applied to college  2017- got rejected from most colleges. Cried a lot. Gained some lbs. lol. Started university 1000 mi away and lost it all again. Began working on getting over my phobia tho  2018- made uni friends finally, still hated it tho. Went back in fall and rushed a sorority but hated it so i dropped. Joined a sport, made some good friends, but still unfulfilling and i was sleep deprived. Was so busy had no time to diet bc needed mental clarity. Met my current, stable, wonderful bf at a shitty college bar  2019- quit the college sport, applied to transfer schools, got into my old dream school. Moved to a major city Currently in an LDR with the bf  who went back to his home country but I applied to study abroad there next semester. Relapsed nicely but still not at LW.

And drinking a lot.   2011- very uncomfortable with my weight, was over 250lbs at 5’7”. In hindsight I never really had any issues with food besides eating too much of it. Never tried to restrict or purge. But I hated my body and spent the year fascinating about how I would look if I was thin.   2012- this is where it starts. My mum paid for me to go on Jenny Craig (UK/Australian diet program). I was at 260lbs when I started. I lost 95lbs in about 10 months and got down to 165lbs. It was great, I was so happy, I was a size 10-12 (Australian. So a 6-8 US) and I felt attractive and happy!!! Girls paid attention to me (this was also the year I came out officially as a lesbian) and it was great. I also graduated high school with amazing grades. Truly 2012 felt like the best year of my life.  2013- I became terrified of gaining weight, which I was because I was binge drinking a lot. So I started exercising 2+ hours a day. I would do that all week then binge drink all weekend. Hook up with girls (and boys, self harm!!) and get stoned to deal with the hang over. I then got hungry and the binge eating started. But I wasn’t purging. And it was rare. Maybe once a month? No big deal. Kept over exercising.   2014- my first year of university. Things were ok, then some really bad stuff happened to me and I started to restrict. I didn’t really lose weight but got stuck in a over exercise + over eating + restriction cycle. Just kinda kept keeping on. Until I had a huge breakdown and attempted suicide.   2015- eh I just binged and purged and binged and purged. I discovered laxatives and puking. I gained a lot of weight without realising but made myself so so sick from laxative abuse, I ended up in the hospital twice so ended up stopping and “recovering”  2016- meh just kept slowly gaining weight   2017- got back up to 220ish lbs and decided to lose weight again. Got down to about 170lbs with weight watcher this time so that was ok. Met my girlfriend in January and we started dating in June. Long distance. Spent 2 months with her.  2018- was eating ok. Nothing really eating disordery. Moved to the UK to be with my girlfriend in August. Slowly gained weight.   2019- hoo boy here we go. So I was at about 200lbs in April, I’d been eating a lot as I do in a relationship. I decided at the end of April to start counting calories to lose weight. I’d never counted calories before (weight loss programs basically do it for you) so it was all great and exciting. I lost about 40lbs healthily between then and September, eating at 1500 calories and exercising. Until that stopped working so well. I then kept cutting and went down to 1200. And still exercising. I was hungry. So my body rebelled and I started bingeing. And then restricting even more. Down to 900. Then fasting. Then BINGEING. then back to purging and here we are at the end of the decade. Stuck in a stupid cycle and down to 140ish pounds and not losing any fucking weight for the last 2 months lmao kill me",False,False
