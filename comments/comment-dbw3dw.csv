One thing I have noticed is that nuts are really friggin calorie dense. Why is that? Not a nut person myself but when I was looking at all the labels when I reached the nut section I was blown away but the sheer amount of calories. A worker came up to me asking if I needed help finding something and I was still in my haze of just starring at the labels and I mindlessly said why all these calories bro? They CRACKED a joke saying IDK its pretty NUTS huh. (i'm a sucker for puns so I guess that means i'm doomed to be a dad someday.) I guess it's a good thing I'm not a peanut butter person either.,False,False
