Garlic powder and onion powder also improve taste. I also love to add chopped veggies to my eggs. Onion and peppers üòç   Chicken: salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder. Cayenne powder.   Not with the other stuff, but Lemon and lemon pepper on chicken with broccoli is really good.   I also like to make chicken in curry, if you're not afraid of oil. Cook up some onions with cumin, curry powder and oil to toast the spices. Throw in your veggies and simmer. I usually cook the chicken chunks in a separate pan and add them because I'm afraid of raw meat.   My favorite condiment (after hot sauce) is mustard üòç I didn't used to like it but now I pour it on sandwiches. It's good on pretzels. Mustard is the bomb. But I wouldn't put it on chicken or eggs.
