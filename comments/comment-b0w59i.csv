She is thinner than myself and sometimes I can't help but feel competitive.  My advice is to not let your inner demons bleed into and destroy a good friendship.  You can compare but keep it to yourself.  Exude support and love.  Self-examine jealousy and engage in mindfulness.  And re: your concern of her getting thinner. I think it's best to let sleeping dogs lie at the moment.  She's been in inpatient before.  She has confronted her disordered eating before so she's self-aware... but maybe just needs time?  A person can't recover unless they're ready to.  Make her feel comfortable, keep an open mind, and maybe talk about your own struggles with disordered eating without pressuring her to talk about her own.  Do not accuse, but be ready to provide a lot of support and love if she ends up opening up to you.",False,False
