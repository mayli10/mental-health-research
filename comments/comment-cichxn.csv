You fall like a plank of wood. I feel face first, literally fell on my face. Broke my nose. I was lucky I didn’t smash my teeth. I’m just grateful I didn’t fall backwards and crack my skull open. Also thankful I wasn’t crossing the road at the time or on the stairs. It would have been stupid not to break your fast if you felt like that.",False,False

Then it's just like... ""well that was weird"", and nothing happens.  I hate how in movies/tv shows, passing out is really fucking dramatic and unrealistic. People don't need an ambulance for a little fainting, unless they're head landed hard on concrete or something.",False,False

My arms and hands feel strange and my knees are weak... I almost can't breathe properly and it feels too warm and i get sweaty and I become lightheaded until it feels like I am looking through a tunnel. That's when I have to lay down on the floor to not pass out completely. But when I get up, it happens again, so that's the moment when I have to eat and drink something... because it won't get better until I raise my blood pressure and blood sugar...   It's annoying because I get a headache from that for the whole day, and it's the reason why i can't fast. I couldn't study anymore, couldn't do my job.",False,False
