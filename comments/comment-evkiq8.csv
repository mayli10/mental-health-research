Try some unsweetened almond milk next time if you'd like.  I don't notice the difference in taste a that much. :),False,False

It's basically carbs lol. Cow milk is more filing which makes the most out of using coffee and tea to curb my appetite.,False,False

The oat milk we get at home (both unsweetened and sweetened versions) is way lower than cowâ€™s milk. Clearly Starbucks make their own version from sugar.,False,True

I guess the calories of the plant/nut are not necessarily a great predictor of the calories of the milk. Confusing. Iâ€™m sorry your latte didnâ€™t work out as hoped :(",False,False
