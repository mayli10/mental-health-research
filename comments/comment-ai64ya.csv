I'm sure she didn't realize what she was saying was going to trigger me lollll. It's just really hard to open up about my eating and I know she's not a therapist so I shouldn't expect that out of her.",False,True

I'm so sorry about your experience though. Did the doctor know you were suffering with an ED at the time? Weird experience aside my doctor did really well explaining the medication and it seemed like it was just assumed weight loss was a side effect.,False,True

I can definitely understand how migraines might make you not want to eat, but I just force myself to and then I start to feel better.",False,False

I've been prone to headaches since I was a kid, when I was doing keto I almost never got headaches. It's only been the past maybe 8 months or so I've had full blown migraines. They usually end up making me super nauseous so I've never even thought food could alleviate it. I should mention though both of my parents have migraines so I probably would have ended up with them either way lol.",False,True

I have been a binge eater pretty much all my adult life, when I discovered keto it was pretty much the only thing that allowed me to control my eating without feeling like I was starving myself or missing out, on top of the health benefits I have when I'm on it. I know some people find it too restrictive but for me it's a good balance of food I enjoy but don't trigger me to bingem",False,True

I'm not very familiar with what the different diets entail, but if I remember correctly keto is low carbs/high fat, right? I used to get really frequent migraines, but instead of recommending medicine for it she recommended that I try having something high in carbs and/or caffeine whenever I had a migraine. So that was basically permission for me to start drinking soda all the time again, but it actually does help. Of course these days I'm avoiding sugar so when I get a migraine I have a Coke Zero and eat food with actual nutritional benefit. Even if it's something cheap and processed, it's better than throwing away 200 calories on just sugar. I find that pretty much anything I eat has enough carbs in it to help with my headache when I'm also having caffeine. My doctor did specifically suggest eating bagels though. Something about bagels being a complex carb. I don't know what that actually means, but I assume it means that they're carbs the body can use for more than just a quick burst of energy. I should probably look that up tbh.",False,False

Were you on keto when you gained the weight? If not, do you think being on keto for an extended period of time led to the binging because you felt restricted mentally or physically while on keto? Because if that is the case, I don't see how getting back on keto could help you unless you're just doing it temporarily because you don't see any other way to stop the binge behavior. It could just lead to a cycle repeating itself as it has with many other people.",False,False

But for you to sit there and say to her I binged my way to this weight and it’s making me miserable seems like there was a disconnect for her in that moment between mental and physical health.  I mean conceivably the theory could be that you’re inherently triggered to binge because of societal pressures to look a certain way but I think that’s way deeper than what could have been gleaned from the consult and it sounds like you never indicated that anyway.",False,False
