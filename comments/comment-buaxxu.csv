I just remember seeing some family after 6 months (when I'd been restricting/over-exercising like crazy) and all anyone said was ""Wow you look so HEALTHY"" and I could have laughed. Healthy? I think not, lmao.  Then there's my bff who's recovering from b/p disorder at the moment, is technically in the overweight BMI category and constantly gets told to lose weight by her (ironically obese) mother. Yet she's actually packing away nutrient-rich meals everyday.  I really wish more people would be aware that bodily appearance =/= bodily health.",False,False
