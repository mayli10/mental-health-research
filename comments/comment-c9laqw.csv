I made cupcakes for friends and started with “ok I’ll let myself have one to make sure they taste good” which turned into eating my weight in batter, and then multiple cupcakes.   Much love and health friend, I believe in you 💕",False,False

Once they left I had about 15 minutes of trying to tell myself not to purge it (SINCE MY BF WAS STILL THERE) but nope my anxiety just kept rising until I gave in and purged until my throat was swollen. Fml.  I wish I could eat normally too, it sucks that even during holidays and friends gathering all that is in my head are numbers and fear 😭",False,False

I didn’t eat all of today but decided, despite being so close to the end of the day, to have a small dinner because I don’t want to begin a binge-fast cycle all over this. I logged on to reddit just now specifically looking for someone to relate to about this.   Wishing you the best 💕",False,False

I’m also having the day after guilts and it’s hard. I’m just trying to hydrate and chill and remind myself that one day of food weight isn’t going to kill me.  Please stay safe, you’re not alone!!!",False,False
