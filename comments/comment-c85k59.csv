She changed a lot in the last year or so, since she started dating this one guy who we all hate. I feel he makes her a lot more self absorbed and vain because he is too. She spends almost all her time with him and cancels on us constantly so I don't see her often, and when I was on the trip with her was when I first really grasped the extent of how selfish she has become.... I'm going to talk to her about it soon, my hope is that she is so full of herself she didn't realize how her comments would come across but she lives with other aforementioned friend who struggles with an ed so I'm quite worried about her if she's around that type of commentary. I couldn't wait to get away from her at the end of the trip so I just shut off and ignored her but I'll probably ask to see her soon and then just tell her that those types of things can be very triggering and hopefully she will listen.   &amp;#x200B;  But if not, then I know she's just too far gone I guess.",False,False

He doesn't have an eating disorder but he was poor growing up and never developed proper eating habits. I've given him some advice to gain weight and he's been following it pretty well. Today he came up to where me and my coworkers were gathered for work and when he grabbed a cookie he said ""I didn't eat enough for breakfast so I'm eating a cookie"" to me.   &amp;#x200B;  I wasn't really thinking when I said ""It's a healthy eating habit to not have reasons behind wanting to eat things.""  &amp;#x200B;  He was kind of confused and I clarified with ""You don't have to justify why you're eating it, you know. You can just eat it."" (I said it with a smile so I wasn't coming off as aggressive...)  &amp;#x200B;  If I eat a lot at one meal, I will eat less during (or skip) my next meal. My meals are an exchange process. I overreacted to his comment because I'm so sensitive to relationships with food. I feel awkward because my coworkers/bosses were listening and it's kind of obvious that I struggle with food. I said it with good intentions but it was a weird thing to talk about.",False,False

One of them has struggled with Anorexia her whole life but is mostly recovered but we have a lot of conversations about how it never goes away and shit and it‚Äôs something that we help each other with, she knows about my bulimia as well. The other knows we both have had issues with EDs and i think she feels kind of left out. I also lost most of the weight I gained in recovery this year so I think she feels bad. But I feel like she says and does stuff to trigger me/us a lot. Like recently she went to the hospital for some stuff and had to stay there a few weeks (she has this chronic intensified problem that hospitalizes her so it sounds serious but she is used to it) and she lost 25 pounds. She would NOT stop gloating about it and saying all this stuff about how she is sooo thin now and she can‚Äôt eat very much anymore and has no appetite and blah blah. I think she was really milking it because I had lost 30 pounds over the previous six months (dropping my recovery weight) and she probably felt a bit like the chubby friend.   Well we went on vacation and she gained it all back. Which, whatever I figured that would happen since she was essentially bragging about losing water weight but I didn‚Äôt say anything about it. But maybe she felt embarrassed because she really fucking doubled down the triggering comments. I noticed right at the beginning of the trip that my friend who has struggled with Anorexia and often has weird and bad eating habits was eating way more than usual. Asked to stop for three meals a day, usually ate like 3/4 of her meal and then wanted to get a snack like two other times per day. I was really happy and wanted to encourage her because I worry about her. But our other friend was making all these comments like ‚Äúomg you want a snack? We just ate lunch and I‚Äôm sooo stuffed I couldn‚Äôt possibly eat anything else.‚Äù When we stopped for breakfast everyday she wouldn‚Äôt get anything and then would be like ‚ÄúI NEVER eat breakfast, I‚Äôm not hungry during the day ever and I really only ever get hungry like for dinner.‚Äù Or making self deprecating comments at lunch ‚Äúugh my thighs and waistline won‚Äôt thank me if I get this but maybe I will? Omg no actually I‚Äôll just get a salad.‚Äù   It was so performative and gross and the whole time I‚Äôm just thinking what the fuck are you doing? Like your friend who has fought Anorexia since she was 11 and your other friend who you listened to puking up every fucking meal in our shared bathroom for 3 years and cried to you about how her bulimia was ruining her life and how ashamed she feels of eating and everything are sitting right here. Why are you saying this shit?  The final straw was on the second to last day, she got a pretty big lunch and my other friend and I also did but didn‚Äôt quite finish ours (but we were already talking about getting ice cream in a bit) and maybe she felt embarrassed. But she goes ‚Äúwow i‚Äôm Never going to be hungry again‚Äù and I said well I will be since that‚Äôs how my body works and she goes ‚Äúhonestly that will fill me up until tomorrow. I‚Äôll probably just drink coffee for dinner.‚Äù And I just...ignored her for the rest of the fucking trip. I‚Äôm so annoyed with her.  Like I don‚Äôt think that she has an ed either or is developing some problem. She DOES eat enough,she just tries really hard to make it sound like she doesn‚Äôt. I know that‚Äôs also not healthy but emotionally I just can‚Äôt fucking deal with that. I didnt really have a serious conversation about it with our other friend but she still ate enough the whole trip so hopefully it didn‚Äôt affect her and she‚Äôs just ignoring her and waving her off as being fucking ridiculous and trying to get attention but.

My only safe food they didn‚Äôt make me feel guilty (even though all I do is eat) was diet soda and I‚Äôm noticing now when I drink it I feel bad/guilty.    Also my obsession with being thin is growing to a point where I don‚Äôt know if I can turn it around myself. I fell asleep last night doing the math over and over of how much weight I can lose before next semester.    My boss (someone who is like a second mom to me and I love very much, and have known since I was really young) get at least one compliment a day about how fit she looks. I feel like a fat duck next to her.    I am a natural athlete and I used to be so fit and now I just keep sabotaging my goals and potential. If I‚Äôm not thinking about how skinny I want to be I‚Äôm thinking about how good of a runner I could be and used to be.    I went to a bar the other night (broke my sobriety so that‚Äôs fucked and now I have to tell an internet friend I did and I‚Äôm ashamed) and all I could do was stare at my arms and legs and think about how fucking obese I am.    Lastly, my best friend texted me some [unhealthy ](https://imgur.com/a/77fH1Ef) shit last night and it makes me really want to distance myself from her more bc her undiagnosed but SUPER obvious BED and her overall disordered thinking affects me really negatively but I love her.",False,False
