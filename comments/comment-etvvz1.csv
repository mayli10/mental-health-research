Not being as active and being highly anxious definitely feeds into the disorder, and sometimes one problem triggers another and it's a huge dumb cycle :/",False,False

I have celiac and I had abdominal migraines and seemingly random allergies as a kid so I started associating food with being sick, which lead to ARFID (extreme picky eating), which in time lead to the unholy ARFID/AN combo I now have.   AN feels like it comes from a very different place somewhere in my psyche than anything else I have going on, the most foreign and out of control part of me even. Not sure if that's just how it'll be forever or if I feel that way bc it's a relatively new development for me tho.",False,False

I don’t think my bipolar has ever impacted my AN (in 11 years), but I’ve also been medicated for the last 8.   I have been thinking about the connection between PTSD and AN for myself lately. The AN numbs me. Since I relapsed, I still have my trauma symptoms but I am not so reactive to them. I’m so tired and literally just numbed emotionally. And the thoughts and intrusive images happen less frequently because I am so obsessively thinking about food and size and calories and weight instead. The ED is a huge coping tool.   I’ve also been thinking about how there is such a difference mentally between the two for me. I’m going to explain this poorly. But it’s like, the PTSD makes sense. For me, AN doesn’t make sense. I keep observing my ED thoughts and they are just so illogical and insane and I am so intrigued and fascinated by how my mind is doing this, because they are so irrational.",False,False
