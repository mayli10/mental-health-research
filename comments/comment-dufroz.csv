I only have one day a week that I *dont* do anything (Sundays). The rest of the week I'm always going like mad and I know I should use Sunday to let my body get some much needed rest, but by about 5 pm I'm going stir crazy and end up doing calisthenics for hours until bedtime.",False,False

Despite that, most of them still eat several meals a day without going crazy and without getting extemely obese.",False,False

It doesnt matter if its active or inactive - do something that sincerely makes you happy.  If you're counting or logging calories burned, please stop. If you do it mentally on accident, give it time. Without the habit of actually logging, the mental adding will slowly disappear.",False,False
