Look even closer and you notice that they take a huge bite, are overly messy and make distracting noises, chew FOREVER, and then jump cut without ever showing them swallow it. So they edit themselves spitting most of the food out. Nikocado Avocado has admitted to doing this. I feel like I just explained the weirdest conspiracy theory but I swear it’s true",False,False

A lot of the comments said it looked like she was eating for the first time and asked her to slow down. Anyway I suspected that she restricted or fasted for a lot of days leading up to her mukbangs so that she wouldn’t gain weight afterwards.",False,False

For me personally, I would fast the days after a binge, take weapons grade doses of stimulants, and work out fasted for like 8 hours a day the next few days (I'm a powerlifter) until my next binge. It's an exhausting cycle, and my personal/academic life definitely were severely affected in addition to my health. But also during that time, my lifts shot up, and I gained a lot of muscle, so people just assumed I was healthy since I looked relatively fit on the outside.",False,False

Essentially it’s various combinations of disordered habits.   They all must either fall into two (and a half) categories. The half category is for the handful of  people who’s body simply doesn’t digest things properly and so they have to keep themselves alive through other medical means.  The first category though is those that don’t actually eat the food. They use frequent jump cuts to hide their chew and spit but the cover this fact up by pretending it’s part of their storytelling style. The second category is those who purge in some form. This can be vomiting, over exercise for days, or fasting.   All in all though, mukbangs are hella disordered simply because consuming that much food (regardless of where your weight goes) requires an unhealthy relationship with food and your body",False,False
