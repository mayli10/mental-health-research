Earlier this year I actually tried to gain, hit my highest weight since my binging days, felt normal and *cringe* healthy. Now it’s ED restriction like crazy or being “normal” where I’m too apathetic to care, and I almost never gain weight during those periods so why can’t the ED just shut up?",False,False

I have been dealing with disordered behaviors for about 13/14 years and it always has ""cooling off"" periods where I'm able to be ""normal"" for a few days or even months before I inevitably get the restricting bug again. Or binging. Or both. And I totally relate to the depression hitting during the normal phase.   I think maybe stress or depression is built up so much that you lose the ability to focus on food like you used to. It's like you just shifted focus from food to, you know. I tend to completely give up on making food choices when I'm depressed to the point of being su\*cidal. I hope things improve for you. :(",False,False

My ED has different symptoms in response to different stressors and then I have days where dysmorphia is barely there and I don't think twice about food except trying to be healthy. But only for days/weeks, then I just kinda lose it again.",False,False

I go back to eating mostly normal, feel really depressed, sleep a lot and am angry thinking “I might be in recovery now I guess” and then I switch back a few weeks later/as soon as a next trigger appeases",False,False
