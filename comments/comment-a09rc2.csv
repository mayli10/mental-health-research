I feel OCD was a huge factor in this. Then, I turned to food after that, and skyrocketed to 180 again. I ended up getting exercise anorexia, and got down to 134, and stayed there from 8th grade to freshman year. Freshman year, I went through a had friends who I'd spend all day with walking around town and I ate reasonably, and got to my healthy weight of 145. That summer to junior year, I was depressed due to losing my friends due to a huge spat, and had an awful OCD spell up until this spring. I was 225. At that moment, I realized I couldn't sit there and go the direction my family was going (my dad went from 265 to 300+ due to stress eating and not exercising), and that I would have to put forth more effort in taking care of my body, or I'll be in his situation. I started with drinking a ton. of. water. ~80 oz. a day. It kept me full to bursting. The only downside is a lot of burping and peeing. Then, I limited my calories to no more than 1800 and no less than 1200 a day. Fasting just makes me binge the next day. That amount may seem like a lot, and y'all may want to look at your BMRs, but that's what I chose.  I was extremely choosy about what I ate, especially breads. My whole summer was filled with broccoli, eggs, tuna, grilled chicken, spinach, and those neat Bird Eye steamed vegetable things. I allowed myself one thing I wanted a day. I figured is wasn't good to feel bitter that everyone else was eating what they wanted, so why not? Instead of obsessing over eating as little as possible as I did with my anorexia, I (this is kind of a paradox, but I'll say it) healthily obsessed over sticking to this plan I had laid out for myself. I walked a minimum of 2 miles a day with exercise in mind. Casually walking I didn't count.  I'm just gonna say, that sticking to an agenda is really what helped me. Going throughout the day with absolutely NO goals was really self-sabotaging.   Plus, with all that water, I couldn't mistake thirst for hunger.  This might seem too broad, but if there's any inconsistencies, just ask!",False,True
