I've actually thought quite a bit about that episode quite a bit while exercising lol.     There are definitely dystopian elements I'm not down with: constant intrusive advertisements/consumerism stuff, people's entire lives being reduced to game shows, lack of freedom, the lemon underclass people...     That said, if the circumstances were different I would love a system where I could cycle all day for money.",False,False
