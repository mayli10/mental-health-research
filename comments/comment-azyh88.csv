It does get better and the pain subsides, but it took me a few years before I noticed a difference. Every now and then it‚Äôll act up, sometimes it can kind of lock for a few seconds or it‚Äôll just hurt really bad or my cheek will be a little swollen or I won‚Äôt be able to chew on that side. It‚Äôll also most likely make a popping, crunching, or scraping sound when you move it a certain way (you‚Äôll be the only one to hear it) but that‚Äôs par for the course. Anything related to the jaw can also cause headaches or sinus problems so just keep that in mind if you start having any of those frequently! Mine healed fine outwardly but now when I open my mouth all the way my lower jaw kind of goes to one side lmao but it‚Äôs really only noticeable to me.   Of course I got no medical intervention during this time bc I had no insurance so I‚Äôm sure if you have access to actual doctors and dentists/orthodontists these things hopefully won‚Äôt apply to you, but just in case I wanted to mention them.  Good luck! ",False,False
