I am recovering from BED right now. It‚Äôs an atypical case because I rid myself of the calories by restricting after for a few days.,False,True

I‚Äôve had BED for years, but eventually converted to AN, but after 3 months I ‚Äúrecovered‚Äù and then quickly relapsed into it after convincing myself I never truly had AN since I only had it for 3 months. Now it‚Äôs been 6 months and I‚Äôm still struggling a lot and often my AN tries to trick me into ‚Äúrecovering‚Äù so it can convince me I never had it in the first place and I‚Äôll relapse into it harder.",False,False

I feel like I don't *really* have an eating disorder because it's been on and off for the past 8 years with long periods of being ""normal"" inbetween relapses. This time it's because I've mostly stopped self-harming and needed some way to fuck myself up.",False,False

ED isn't a competition between each other.  it is a war we wage inside our own minds.  I have swung between AN and BED for 25 years.  I've almost died many times.  I've wrecked my body and my mental health.    I feel like the mama in this sub since I'm so much older than everyone else (or it feels that way).  Please don't compare your ED to someone else for validation.  If you had the flu you wouldn't look at someone else with the flu that was in the hospital and say you don't have the flu, or your flu isn't as bad. I damn well could be you just haven't been taken to the hospital, etc.",False,False

Stopped doing drugs? Obsess over weight. Sexual assault? Start up on your bullshit. Not self harming anymore? Lmao chew and spit hoe.
