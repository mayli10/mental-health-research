I really want to say fuck that noise, what human being needs to be around such toxic crap as that. But maybe you enjoy clubs like that and I don’t want to just write that off. But!!! There are plenty of freaking normal clubs where you can dance and have fun and not be at some kind of sexual cattle auction.   Only you know what you are looking for with bonding with friends, with a night out, or for friends in general. I WOULD say though, I used to go clubbing a ton and I would fuck the hell out of any place like that. My sister is hella hot and so are some of my other friends and I know they would nope out of any place that tried to keep one of the rest of the group out. I’m so sorry you’re being made to feel this way. Ugh. Sorry for the rant, I’m just all fired up and mad on your behalf. :/",False,False

The main job of a bouncer is not security, it's picking hot girls to come in. Men are assumed to be the big spenders, so the whole club economy revolves around stocking the building with sexually attractive women (as judged by the bouncer).   Like, it gets even worse than plain fatphobia, too. In my city bouncers are pretty notorious for racial profiling. Like, they'll """"mysteriously"""" reject all Latinx people at the door, or pull crap like not letting in black women or Asian men.",False,False

Do they have a scale at the door? Wtf, fuck that honestly, and your friend was kind of rude. I'm sorry you had to go through this.",False,False
