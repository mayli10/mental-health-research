This is the best advice I can give. I've got Bipolar Type 1, anxiety, PTSD, and AN (all diagnosed). My university's access center for accommodations for students with disabilities has been a godsend. I've been inpatient psych hospitalized twice and in rehab once during my college career. I am about to graduate in 2 weeks with my bachelors in biology. But I couldn't have done that without all the flexibility regarding attendance and due dates and exam retakes, etc. and all that was only possible through getting these accommodations.
