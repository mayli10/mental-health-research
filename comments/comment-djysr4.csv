Honestly I can already tell tomorrow is going to be a better day because I didn't binge today and don't feel the urge to. I had a fruit salad and coffees and even a piece of chocolate. I'm so ready to wake up tomorrow and not look 9 months pregnant.   I agree - it's the all or nothing mentality that screws everything up. I'm glad you managed to get over it. Best of luck to you :),False,True

I just got out of a terrible binge cycle (like, get high and eat like shit every night for a month). It had quickly become the new normal, so much so that I became anxious when I considered not spending another night like that— it felt like I’d be missing out on something. Also, I hated how it made me look and feel in the morning, but I figured I’d look/feel like that even if I didn’t binge, so I might as well get some sweet dopamine out of it.   Then one night I’d decided I had enough of that lifestyle and went to bed early so I wouldn’t be tempted. The next day— not the next week or even a few days later, the next DAY—after not treating my body like total shit, I felt amazing. It was like a switch had flipped in my brain. I felt more energetic, happier. I was astounded at how much better my morning was when my night was spent sober and binge-free. Who’d’ve thunk.  I think for me, it was the sunk cost fallacy— all-or-nothing, in for a penny in for a pound. Like, I’ve already been binging this whole time, one more binge won’t make a difference either way. We have to stop thinking like that.   Just give it *one* night where you distract/force yourself to not binge. Drink water and sleep sober and honestly, the next day is so much brighter. Also, now that I know that, it no longer feels like I’m missing out when I don’t binge; I prefer feeling good in the morning to feeling numb and full at night.   Hope this helps :)",False,False

I feel you. It’s so hard to gain control. It’s so hard to not just smother everything in food.,False,False
