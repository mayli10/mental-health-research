Most people I know don't go into these typical german ""restaurants"", they go eat pizza, also burger are really popular right now. Or  asian food. Older people (grandparents) are basically cooking a whole lump of meat with (oh now I know what you meant with dumplings, the potato balls, right?) dumplings every sunday for family-lunch. But that's more of a tradition in Bavaria, and more older people or ""less-educated"" farming-/small-village people. (That shouldn't sound as harsh as it does, I mean, I am living in an area like that, and my grandma still likes to make dumplings (that I don't eat :D).   But mostly we're cooking at home and basically everything... Potatoes, rice, pasta, meat (pork, beef, chicken), fish, vegetables, salad, etc. But also pizza, burger etc. I mean, you can eat healthy and unhealthy in every country, but what you can eat in german restaurants is really not that much of habit for food at home. Like in sweden, they don't eat Köttbullar all the time, just because it's this ""typical swedish"" meal you can get everywhere and like IKEA tries to tell us :D",False,False

Carb central. I actually needed up losing some weight. I decided to ‘take a break’ from the ed lmao but I did in the sense that I could only eat with other people and not go on binges which lessened guilt and therefore I could eat more normally. Drank a lot of water with meals. Some bullshit about jet lag and that I don’t normally eat breakfast. Told myself that I needed to eat to repair muscles from the few body weight exercises I did and that once I come back I can start restricting.,False,False
