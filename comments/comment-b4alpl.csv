No matter how much weight I lose my body will still never look the exact way I want. ,False,False

Seeing someone with an amazing body that I would kill to have hating themselves for not being “perfect” really put into perspective that I hate my body for silly reasons that wouldn’t matter to most people. Granted that mindset only lasted the rest of the night and I’m back to hating myself but I haven’t fasted or purged since. I’m still disordered garbage but that video has stopped me from completely ruining my health and even got me to start eating apples again. I wish she knew how much a simple 5 min clip helped me,False,False
