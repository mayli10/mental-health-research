This is something that everyone in recovery should be told. Healing is not linear and relapses do not erase progress.,False,False

I've felt like I've been faking my recovery recently because I've been having some difficulties at it and some recent slip-ups. But really, I've been recovering since late November, if I compare my current self to my self even in September, there has been SO much progress that has been made since. Even if January was a bit harder, that doesn't negate all the work that I have been doing to get better and all of the progress I made. Black-and-white thinking is what got me in this mess in the first place, and it's a cognitive distortion. I can't allow myself to fall victim to that now and relapse just because I've been having some difficulties recently. It's *not* black and white. Thank you for this; I needed it.",False,False

I've gained weight, to quite to normal, but close, and Ive cut my daily b/p number in half. I'm proud, even if i'm not doing what everyone would consider well. ",False,False
