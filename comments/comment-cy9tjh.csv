I always eat in the evening, because I see food as a reward after a long day. I don't get hungry in the morning or at lunchtime either so that's pretty easy. If you feel like you can't stick to it just start by setting a longer eating window, let's say 3hrs, you break the fast with a snack, like a fruit or a yogurt and then one or two hours later you have your meal. Another great thing about it is that you feel full very quickly so for me it stops binge urges, and because I save all of my cals for one meal no guilt afterwards and can basically eat whatever.",False,False

I’ve tried and failed OMAD again and again. But I was on it for a good month or so in preparation for a vacation in the Bahamas lol. That was a huge motivator. Every time I try, I just get grumpy and angry by 1pm. Ideally I’d want to just eat at 4-5pm since I’ll be home by then. It’s also great not worrying about meal prepping everything and bringing meals around all day.",False,True

For me food tasted better also because I always binge on mediocre food, but when I restrict I actually take my time and cook quality food. I always do OMAD so it's important to me to not waste the calories.",False,False
