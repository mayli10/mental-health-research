I say, “stay safe” to my irl pals now and I have for years—I thought it was just a kind thing to say, especially for mental health. But no, I realize now, 1000% I got it from the proAn / ProEd communities. Wow, it’s incredible to reflect on this. Our community has shown so much kindness... we all just want each other to be safe. Love y’all. ",False,False

It makes me so sad that people couldn't see what it was and got caught up in the name of the sub :( ,False,False

Even in the depths that we can sink to you always have to remember to care for yourself and stay safe.  I’m not sure if people who don’t need to hear Stay Safe could ever understand what it means to see that over and over again, it was such a touch stone for me, something that reminded me to care about the body I’m in even if I hated it.  Such a simple thing but so meaningful and powerful, just like our sub that they took away.  Thank you to all of the beautiful people who ended their posts with those simple words. You changed my life. ",False,False

I somehow try to take care of myself more or am at least pulled back a bit from the ed behaviors because I'm reminded that what I'm doing can be unsafe for me. ",False,False

In no small way the ""Be safe"" sign off helped me finally accept help from medical professionals when I went to the hospital. For a time I felt like I didn't deserve to recover from, or even survive my ED, and those little words made me feel like I did natter and deserve to live long enough to get help. ",False,False
