I eat a lot of nuts, beans and grains and I've found it has worked well for me, just been reducing too much but I'm going to cut the near fasting altogether, it made my mood swings intolerable.  Thanks for this!",False,True

And try to cut out the vegan aspect if you‚Äôre not doing it for moral reasons. You need fats and proteins to do keto correctly bc you‚Äôre relying on fat for a primary energy source instead of carbs. It hard to find good fats and complete proteins on a purely plant based diet. Eating meat will help with your hunger.   I actually lost weight in a very healthy way when I stopped being vegetarian. I guess I accidentally did a keto diet bc I really cut down on processed and simple carbs and ate a lot more fresh vegetables than I ever did as a vegetarian. I have a slight insulin‚Äôs resistance from PCOS so lots of carbs were not doing me favors. The complete proteins from meat helped me stay fuller longer and I ended up eating less overall even though my daily meals had way more calories in them bc after lunch, I wouldn‚Äôt be hungry and mindlessly snacking.",False,False

I was trying a vegan ketosis diet with periodic fasting, hence the salad and banana but i think I'm gonna curb it back a bit next time. I'm actually overweight and heard this would prevent the sudden weight gain and cravings.",False,True

It‚Äôs your body‚Äôs natural response to starvation. When you fast for a while, your digestion slows down and your body gives up on sending hunger cues bc what‚Äôs the point of asking for something that isn‚Äôt going to happen?  When you eat more again, your metabolism revs up again and your body is desperate to repair the damage done from starvation. After going through a ‚Äúfamine,‚Äù it makes sense that your body wants to load up on as many calories as possible to help you get through the next famine.   Your hunger will not stabilize until you are weight restored for a while. It can take over a full year after being weight restored for your body to trust that it‚Äôs not going to starve again. Many anorexics actually overshoot their ideal healthy weight in recovery, until their metabolism stabilizes, then they lose the extra weight without even trying bc their bodies are healed and there‚Äôs no need to hoard that fat.",False,False
