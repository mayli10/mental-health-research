Binging without purging is the first step for bulimia recovery. It's a really difficult step but as your body gets used to retaining binge calories it will start to remember that 3000 cals of binge food =/= only say 500 calories of energy when you've digested it.  Something that may help if you give yourself time, grace, and space to repeat it, is making your entire grocery list before you leave. If you find yourself wanting to buy something outside of the list, figure out why. Is it because you miss that taste, but it will also be a binge? Try grabbing a single serve of it, or the smallest container. The goal shouldnt be to have restricted foods, but to be able to comfortably and safely eat any food in regular amounts",False,False
