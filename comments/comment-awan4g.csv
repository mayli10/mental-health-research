Ended up getting a massive scholarship from a decent state school (not like it matters cuz im on the verge of dropping out due to mental health LOL) so I'm in the same boat,False,False

Something I learned first hand of professors that do admission for college and grad school is, that grades do not really matter much for them, they look for people that have will rather than someone that learned how to pass a test. (It is proven that standardized tests are not an accurate representation of personal potential).      But lets be realistic now. Sure you might not be the best or fist entry but you are not the last one there either. Focusing on this is mostly inevitable, I know but try to not compare yourself to others but to you, to improve yourself with time, to bring the best of you and what will make you happy. Each one of us has different interests goals and definitions of happiness and looking to others will not let you find out what is all this for you in a given time.       I also got in a hard school, and to physics, I was not the best at all, occasionally the last tbh (only 7 people in my year). I spend years crying and feeling like a failure because I compared myself to a friend that is brilliant. By doing this I forgot all the good things that I do and can do that made me special. Now that I try to focus on that I am in a great place, working in a dream job as a researcher. I do not want you to waste years measuring with others, you are unique and you can give your best potential without the frustration of unhealthy comparison.  &amp;#x200B;   A tip, every time you feel like this, right in a paper what things you have or you can do that make you special or what are you good at, any quality you like of yourself and save it to read it later. This can be anything, even having good posture. and it is proven to reset to a good mindset. ",False,False

I was in the same situation as you 4ish years ago. I definitely did not have the test scores to get into the college I am in right now. But the admissions team sees you as a good fit.
