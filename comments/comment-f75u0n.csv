They must be HEAVILY caffeinated, bc I was immediately addicted to it and wanted like, at least 3 more, lol. But they're crazy expensive, I think I found them at the Wal-Mart in my old hometown for *slightly* cheap, but on Amazon Prime they were $4-7 each, last time I checked.. ðŸ˜¤",False,False

It tastes like cereal milk left over after a bowl of Cheerios imo. The plain kind, strawberry, and coffee flavors are best. When I first tried the coffee (I think I had the mocha one?) I didn't like it, but after a couple sips I was hooked. It seemed to pack way more of a punch, caffeine-wise. Damnit, now I want one!!!",False,False
