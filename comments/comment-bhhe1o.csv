Decaf quad shot (two double espresso shots)... Sugar free Pumpkin Pie Syrup... Triple white chocolate powder (12 scoops)... Half almond milk, half coconut milk... Steamed to 135 degrees... Half foam (*very* difficult with coconut milk)... Shaken over ice to cool... Two tablespoons of cinnamon... Extra whip with caramel drizzle...  and if you ‚Äúmessed up‚Äù a single part of her drink she‚Äôd demand it was completely remade. Sorry this turned into a barista rant now but I‚Äôm just trying to calm anyone‚Äôs worries that sugar free and skim is too much!!",False,False
