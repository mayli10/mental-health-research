Burger and a sundae and it took alot of willpower to eat that without feeling any guilt. Surprisingly I didnt binge after eating that and felt happy and just full (after eating a not safe food I tend to simply binge and make it the worst since I already ruined my diet that day followed by fasting or restriction),False,True

Im now adding also healthy fats like olive oil and some peanut butter since I also do moderate amounts of exercise. Sometimes I exceed 100-200 cals but idk with an OMAD it makes me feel ""safe"" compared to my typical restricitivr multiple meals diet lol",False,True

I get to worry about logging/weighing food only for one meal and if needed, I can make the meal have more cals. Whenever I eat multiple meals a day, it always turns into a binge because my stupid stomach thinks it needs to have more more more.",False,False
