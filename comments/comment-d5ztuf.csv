I do plan on telling my fiancé tonight- I was going to this afternoon but he slept in way later than he intended to (he works night shift and switches back to night sleeping on his ""weekends"" so he meant to be up around 2pm today to switch back but ended up waking up closer to 5) so I'm going to wait until after dinner tonight to talk to him. Wish me luck!!",False,False

I see your posts and remember that you were recently considering recovery- if you havent told your fiance yet please do. Please reread the comment you made meant for me but try to apply it to yourself as well. I have so many problems and my eating disorder is a coping mechanism for it- the ""goal aesthetic"" is just something my brain has made up for me to distract me from what else is going on. It's so hard to give up that ""goal"" because it's actually just accepting that I have hard work to do to fix myself (because I have depression, anxiety, OCD, PTSD, and this ED). I dont want to do that yet. I want to get better but hold onto the eating disorder until I have fixed everything else. Idk. I'm so tired of it",False,True

I'll say this in the nicest way possible: you will not reach your goal weight. You will not reach the aesthetic you want.  You MIGHT reach what would have been your goal weight, but it will be a hollow victory. You won't like how you look at that weight either and you will just move the goalposts. The underweight aesthetic you seek is based on thinspo pictures, I'm sure, but what's the reality behind those people? How many times did they nearly black out just trying to get dressed that morning? How many of them have to carefully do their hair to hide the balding and thinning spots on their scalp? How many times do they get sick in cold weather because their immune system can't fight off a basic cold?  Your aesthetic is a fallacy. You cannot be ""naturally"" severely underweight. You CAN be sick, malnourished, cold, dizzy, with teeth that chip and skin that's dry as shit and hair that's dry and falling out and a body shape that doesn't make your skeleton look nearly as good as you'd hoped for all the work you put in to make yourself that sick.  You're already underweight. Being more underweight won't magically turn you into your aesthetic. It will just make your medical bills higher.  Change your goal from an aesthetic to a reality. If you don't want to die, move forward with that as your goal.",False,False
