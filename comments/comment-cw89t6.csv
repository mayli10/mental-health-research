People keep saying how OMAD changed their life or whatever. Totally screwed up mine. So thanks for being one of the rare people nowadays that agree with me.,False,False

Calculate your TDEE and eat at it to maintain or 250-500 calories less if you want to lose. Eating less than that is extremely likely to cause you to binge.   * Eat the food pyramid. Don’t cut out carbs or fat.   * Spread your meals out to keep your blood sugar steady. Eating OMAD is a good way to force yourself into a binge because your body will react to low blood sugar by forcing you to binge.   * Eat lots of veggies and a healthy protein and fat for dinner. Example: salad with an oil-based dressing and chicken.  * Drink enough during the day, but don’t drink all at once or it just comes right out. I recommend the Hidrate app because it tells you how much water you should have drank by this hour so you drink steadily throughout the day.   * If you’re binging out of fear of lack of food, don’t tell yourself you can’t eat xyz. Eat whatever you want, just at a decent sized portion. I haven’t binged in so long I can’t even remember because I eat *literally* anything I want. I once lived on corndogs for a week because that’s what I wanted, but I lost weight because I didn’t binge out of fear I’d never have a corndog again. This one takes time to reprogram your brain’s pathways but it’s the #1 most effective tactic.",False,False
