Depends whether or not I can justify it to myself.   The Silk nutmilk I drink has a prebiotic, which my dermatologist recommended I take, so even though it is one of the higher-cal almond/cashew milk options, I still add it to my coffee without regret. Also every time I read ""nut milk"" on the box I laugh.   Powder coffee creamers have no nutritional value so I have a hard time justifying that.   Also low-sugar Gatorade. It's 50 cals for the bottle I get, but with 50 cals I don't have a headache, I'm energized through the second half of my day, and my OMAD when I get home isn't a binge that ruins my day's progress.

My appetite for food and my appetite for beer are 100% linked together (in fact one thing I struggled with once I got past the extreme hunger during my recovery was that I didn't have as much of an appetite anymore and beer didn't taste as good anymmore). For some reason during my ED I'd restrict myself to whatever my calorie limits were on the weekdays but when the weekend hit I'd have no qualms about downing 1000 calories in beer in an afternoon (a few double IPA's or Imperial Russian Stouts will add up to that). Now ironically I'm a lot further in recovery but I have this irrational fear about alcohol calories and yet I have no problems downing a protein shake once or twice a day which is more or less equivalent in calories. Don't get me wrong, the protein shakes are way healthier, but still. It's so weird.",False,False
