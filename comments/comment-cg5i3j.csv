They are separate arguments, and if the article had just focused on the first, I would feel it has more merit.   I absolutely agree that being fat is a barrier to appropriate healthcare access. Not just socially due to stigma and feeling like everything is already against you, but also costwise - insurance companies may be less inclined to give fair insurance rates to people who are obese. Doctors absolutely can be more dismissive to their obese patients. It's a vicious cycle because doctors can be dismissive of their obese patients which leads to noncompliance by their obese patients and that keeps going on. At least when I was working in a cancer clinic and a liver transplant clinic, the vast majority of the obese patients weren't being honest about their habits. Which isn't unique to obese patients, but a high percentage of the patients there were obese or overweight (as would be expected in a cancer clinic or a liver transplant clinic) and losing weight would have been really helpful in addition to treatment. Like I mentioned, there needs to be better education for healthcare providers on nutrition to give better plans to their patients outside of ""diet and exercise,"" and I think that being referred to dieticians and making sure they actually have appropriate follow up care should be standard in these treatments.   The part that really got to me and will make a lot of people stop reading the article is the lines: ""For 60 years, doctors and researchers have known two things that could have improved, or even saved, millions of lives. The first is that diets do not work. Not just paleo or Atkins or Weight Watchers or Goop, but all diets. Since 1959, research has shown that 95 to 98 percent of attempts to lose weight fail and that two-thirds of dieters gain back more than they lost. The reasons are biological and irreversible. As early as 1969, research showed that losing just 3 percent of your body weight resulted in a 17 percent slowdown in your metabolism—a body-wide starvation response that blasts you with hunger hormones and drops your internal temperature until you rise back to your highest weight. Keeping weight off means fighting your body’s energy-regulation system and battling hunger all day, every day, for the rest of your life."" This really misrepresents what the research actually shows and you know that because they fail to link any specific studies.   I do agree that weight is not equal to health. There are a plenty of overweight (not obese, and certainly not morbidly obese) people who are healthier than skinny people because they have more active lifestyles, eat better types of food, genetics, etc; and I do think that the range of BMI's considered ""healthy"" needs to be expanded across different populations. But this is true of any biomarker. Cholesterol levels by itself doesn't necessarily indicate you'll get a heart attack. It's just that you're more statistically likely to be at risk than someone with normal cholesterol levels. It's the same thing with obesity. Just because you're obese doesn't mean you're metabolically healthy. But it does indicate that you're in a group that statistically has a higher  odds of a heart attack down the line. Obesity can have indications about your general lifestyle. You're overeating and likely sedentary, which is likely to cause health problems in anyone down the line. Unfortunately, obese people wear the evidence of their lifestyle on a day to day basis, while normal weight or even slightly overweight individuals with similar lifestyles don't.",False,False

I thought of some of them myself, too. But, I do think the article does a good job of highlighting that the way these conversations with obese people are being handled isn't the best and how the nutritional training doctors receive is quite lacking. I don't think it'd be a bad thing to implement some of the ideas the article puts out.  It's important to go to the doctor, but if fat people feel too shamed about their weight by the doctors to go, then that's a problem. I don't think many of the women there are just being sensitive; I've personally seen many doctors be more dismissive toward their more overweight patients (I'm an ER scribe, so I work at a hospital). The article also provided relevant statistics to support those claims.   I certainly agree with you that eating at a caloric deficit does indeed work. I would know, given that I have anorexia. But, there needs to be more mindful education on how dieting works and on eating disorders, but these patients unfortunately aren't often exposed to that info. I think doctors unfortunately miss the mark on a lot of them, not recognizing their eating disorders and/or not referring them to a dietitian.   I also agree that doctors aren't out to get obese people, but implicit biases do exist and becoming more aware of such a problem can only do good, I believe. I think doctors need to do a better job of recognizing that they're not the most qualified when it comes to giving advice on a patient's nutritional needs or food habits.",False,True
euevwmj,t3_cg5i3j,t3_cg5i3j,ddmar,1,2019-07-21 19:30:20,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/cg5i3j/everything_you_know_about_obesity_is_wrong_article/euevwmj/,"To be completely honest, while I really feel for the people on the article because a lot of them sound like they have eating disorders, I felt like it was kind of disingenuous to the healthcare industry and gives blatant misinformation on how weight/fat loss actually works.   The author takes examples of people getting bullied for being fat which obviously is bad, and then does some really unclear extrapolation into being morbidly obese is ok for health  In the same article, they managed to say that overweight/obese people are starving themselves while also saying they starve themselves, then binge at night, then say diets don't work. It's not that calorie deficits don't work. It's that they're not actually properly utilizing a diet with a calorie deficit.   They also made the analogy ""smoking is a behavior, obesity is not."" But lung cancer can be a result of smoking, just like obesity can be a result of overeating, which is a behavior.   Like, yeah, there are plenty of shitty doctors out there. But the majority of them don't tell their patients to diet and exercise because they're being assholes; it's because the alternative (pills, surgery) can be unsafe or cause other problems if they're not accompanied with lifestyle changes. And it seems like some of the obese people in the article take that as a personal attack.  Also, they mentioned how ""anywhere from one third to seventy five percent of obese people have no metabolic problems""which is another way of phrasing ""anywhere from 25 - 67% of obese people have metabolic problems""  Also, the general population, in particular those who are overweight, are notorious for being bad at figuring out how many calories they're eating, which is likely why they're obese in the first place. This isn't necessarily their fault. We don't have systems in place that educate people how to actually know how much they should be eating, and the food industry makes billions by getting people hooked on really tasty, sugary, fatty, calorie dense, addicting foods that are easy to overeat and feel like not much food at all.   I agree it's a really bad thing to say ""eat less, move more"" to an obese patient because it isn't concrete advice. But this article just really misrepresents what most doctors actually say in these conversations.  Like, I've been in these conversations, I know how they go and they're not just ""you're fat; eat a salad."" But they often lack concrete advice on what to do because most doctors aren't really trained to give nutrition advice, especially for people who are obese.   When i was trying to lose weight but couldn't because I was stuck in the binge-purge-restrict-fast-binge cycle, I knew I was full of shit when i was saying things like ""idk why i can't lose weight."" It was obviously the extra spoons of peanut butter and the bits of snacks i would eat and then under-represent when tracking and the night time binges after restricting all day or for several days. But i think because i spent so much of my time and energy actively trying to restrict, it felt harder, even if my caloric intake were higher, and i'm assuming that's a common sentiment among a lot of obese people who are trying to lose weight. I was tired all day from not eating and exhausted from trying to restrict, but would binge at night anyways, so I would still gain weight, without any of the benefits of having food as energy for the day. Once i started being honest with myself, at least i was able to pinpoint the problems and do something about them.   I don't think a lot of people understand what's meant by ""diets don't work"" because any calorie deficit will work; it's just that once you stop that deficit and go back to your normal habits, the weight will come right back. Or that you weren't actually using a calorie deficit, especially if you starve for as long as possible then binge back more than you would have if you had just eaten normally. I think if the phrase ""starvation mode"" is going to be thrown out so often, its definition should be changed to something like ""rebound behaviors as a result of dieting,"" at least for people who are overweight, because metabolic adaptation isn't so severe that a normal calorie deficit wouldn't work on someone who is obese and has a lot of fat to lose.   Honestly, I'm a little scared of posting my comments because I know they may sound fatphobic (not my intention at all, but there's really no scientific evidence that a calorie deficit won't work on certain people for weight loss), but I can't imagine how shitty must your life be if you think that everything is unchangeable and you're doomed to be obese forever and it's not something you want. I also imagine that a lot of obese people have eating disorders and may be stuck in the binge-restrict cycle.   I totally acknowledge that there are diseases that make it much harder, like prader-willi. Like, I felt like I had extreme hunger just for a few years when I was binge-restricting all the time, even though I was gaining so much weight. I can't imagine going through that for my entire life, every day. At least after a binge, most of the time, my satiety signals would kick in eventually, even if it took like 8000 calories. But this article is just so misleading and pins doctors as the bad guys. Not all doctors are wonderful and have their patients' best interests at heart, but I would argue that the vast majority of them are not out to target obese patients.   I really feel like having higher corporate taxes on the sugar/fat/processed food industry would solve a lot of problems, as well as having more subsidies for healthier food, but i guess i'm not an economist so i can't really speak on that. But let's be real, the diet industry only exists because the obesity crisis exists, which exists because processed, calorie dense, nutritionally void foods are so cheap, convenient, and readily available and that industry has enough money to lobby against policies that don't work for them. The money going to subsidies for those industries really should go into education and healthcare for better nutrition, preventative medicine, and counseling for both wellness and mental health.   This was really hastily written, so I apologize if it wasn't cohesive. I also have studies for my claims if y'all want them, but I figured they weren't super relevant since you asked for opinions.",False,False
