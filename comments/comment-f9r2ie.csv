In my head I'm like yeah I was now I feel like a cow and I'm gonna think about this for a week.  When I'm genuinely not hungry he accuses me of starving myself and gets genuinely upset, so I eat, so I don't hurt him.   I'm content with a salad but he's a bigger boy and likes eating shitty food. Scary foods.   My mom keeps telling me ""don't let him get you fat!"" In my last relationship I gained about 60 pounds, since I found my current bf I lost it all and rebirthed my disordered eating and habits.",False,False
