There is always stuff about weight loss, or eating healthy. It does nothing but feed into EDs. Everyone says, ""skinny is good, just don't get *too* skinny."" It doesn't help. At all.  Plus what even is a normal diet? Cavemen lived off nothing but meat in the past. If anything, literally everyone has an ED. It's just that you only get punished (see: involuntarily committed to hospital) if you meet a certain BMI criteria. The fat diabetic in that same hospital totally isn't disordered eating when they eat a cupcake and shoot up insulin though. That's different clearly.",False,False
