No one knows I was and am anorexic. I continued to work when I was at my lowest weight 8 stone 10 pounds (I am 6ft 1). So I guess some suspect. I did have an ED.  I have worked here for a long time and built up some strong bonds but when it comes to my weight, how and when I eat that’s off limits. Not something I will ever discuss with colleagues. It can be draining explaining “I did go for lunch” and what I ate because usually I eat by myself.   I am not an aggressive person but I do feel like I have to defend my choices and my eating habits. I am recovering slowly but I feel people don’t have the patience to let me recover at my own pace.   I am very sociable person. I like to be around people. I like to help people and if I can I will. In the past I was a volunteer with the St Johns Ambulance till the anorexia became too much.   I Just feel like everyone socializes around food. Discussing it, reviewing it and fetishize it. Eating is something I have to do to recover and stay well. I don’t want to discuss it or be reminded of it.  I understand the fear you have. I have lived it many times but with something like this. It’s better to discuss it with your SO and his grandmother. Try and explain. The fact they never suffered from an ED. They are not really in a position to suddenly provide advice. It could come to a point where you have to discuss it. All three of you. Maybe do it on your terms and when you’re prepared. If you can’t lie to people and fasting is being noticed it might be time to discuss it on your terms and not have it suddenly surprised on you.   Hope this helps.",False,False

I have a friend which always makes sure to ask me if ive eaten, and because I suck at lying, she always figures it out and gives me loads to eat.",False,False
