I'm in recovery so my meals are going to be bigger than yours (assuming you aren't in recovery) but i still think they can apply.   - Vegetables. This one is said a lot but it's true get your mum to get packets of frozen vegetables and have them for dinner. Literally for dinner tonight i had 600g of vegetables for 168 calories.  - Porridge. Pretty filling for relitively low cal. My dad gets the plain instant ones and i mix it in with some no fat yoghurt and it tastes really good and is filling. Would reccommend sugar free maple syrup if you're looking for a lower calorie option.  - Potatoes. I know that they are packed with carbs but trust me they are filling. Are *kinda* high calorie but even if you have a little bit, it will definitely help you feel full.  ",False,False
