You can’t stop after you start doing it. The act of chewing the food causes your body to release digestive enzymes and begin to digest the food that you’re eating, but if you’re not actually swallowing it, it’s going to cause A LOT of digestive issues. It can ruin your teeth, destroy your stomach and wreck your body pretty badly once the addiction gets severe. I know it sounds super tempting to just do it once, but it’s never just that one time. You won’t gain weight just this once, but the long term effect will haunt you. Just think wisely, okay?",False,False
