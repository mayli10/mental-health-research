I was suuuuper skinny growing up and would constantly get comments about how skinny I was...up until high school, I gained a lotttt of weight but I still thought I was skinny and was super confident about my body even though I had an average ""healthy"" BMI. Even looking back on pictures I'm just ??? how did I think I was skinny???  I've lost it all now but IVE NEVER FELT FATTER AND MORE INSECURE. What kind of scam????",False,False

I was at the healthy weight at one point, then started turning to food emotionally. I used to see myself as a ""normal"" girl for my height, then people started to make fun of me and I realised, I had to stop it or I would kill myself.

I was so convinced I was this beautiful sexy beast in perfect size and shape that when I came to senses about my real apparel - nice looking, soft, curvy, definitely not skinny - God it hit real badly, stumbled me on the ground.

Even after losing a significant amount of weight I saw myself as looking nearly the same. Now that I am restricting and losing I still cannot tell what is going on with my size except through numbers. I never know what I look like and it is deeply confusing.,False,False

I had a baby 4 months ago so I'm at my highest weight in years and I cannot discern to any degree of reality what my current size actually is.  I was 2 weeks post partum trying on a pair of my old size 0 jeans and for some reason incredibly distraught and confused as to why they didn't fit. I went to buy new pants and tried on a size 12 that were comically large and was also extremely confused. So in my mind I either look as skinny as I did when I had a raging eating disorder or I'm next to debut on my 600 lbs life.,False,False
