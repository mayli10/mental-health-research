Its nasty but at least I feel empty af after that last trip,False,False

I hope this helps. Its called magnesium citrate and comes in a bottle for 99 cents at walmart. Theres grape, lemon or cherry flavor. It tastes like sour ass though unfortunately. I think its technically a laxative but its so disgusting tasting i dont think youll want to use it other than for emergencies. Lemon is my favorite, but its still like a thick,salty nearly flat sprite flavor. It really helps when im dying for a BM though.",False,False

My only other suggestion would be apples: low in calories and high in fibre so it’s been a win win for me. I guess it’s trial and error for a lot of people which sucks.,False,False

Have a morning pattern, like don't get up at noon and skip all of that (that's what i was doing and it was not good for me). I was in the same boat you are, sometimes worse (like ten days y'all it was BAD). Now, I wake up, eat a half cup of oatmeal and drink a cup of coffee. Then I listen to a podcast or some music and I do stretches/yoga that are meant to help with digestion.  Honestly I Would've thought it seemed stupid but now that I do it, it doesn't. My diet hasn't really changed at all, I still high restrict a lot of the time with a binge weekend thrown in here and there. But somehow the morning routine really helped.",False,False

Celery, carrots, broccoli stems, basically stiff vegetables you really have to chew, are natural “laxatives” that just help pull food through your GI tract. I usually pair them with caffeine which helps me immensely, but if coffee doesn’t really do it for you then just the vegetables might be your best bet!",False,False
