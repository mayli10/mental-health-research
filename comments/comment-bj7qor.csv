It was really disheartening because I've been tracking consistently for 2 months and the math has been pretty spot on that whole time (i.e. 3500 deficit = 1 lb lost). All I can suggest is maybe eating more than usual makes your body retain water for a while for some reason? We had a lot of salty snacks like tortilla chips, hashbrowns, frenchfries etc so if there was salt in what you ate that could also be part of it.",False,False
