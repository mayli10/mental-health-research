What I would do is to tell myself that I'm going to try it, all of it, just once.   If I don't like it, I can lose weight like crazy, so I can get rid of whatever I put on if I want to.  Then take a deep breath and go.  Beats dying.  And if everyone is giving me the same advice, they are usually right and I'm usually wrong.    You've put your whole life on hold over this, it's probably best to just rip the bandaid off, so you can move on.  It hurts, but then it's over.",False,False

Kind of what led me to post this. Because I feel like I'm being given the option of pretty much zero support (other than my weekly therapy appointment) or residential (which I really foresee myself leaving after a day.. if that).. i just wish there was another option.. i will talk to my therapist about it this week,False,True

It sounds like your treatment team wants the best for you, but resi is really scary and if you don't want to be there, MAY not be useful.   That being said, would you be comfortable in a higher level of care than you are now? (Like outpatient or PHP?) It sounds like you need help, and you deserve to get it and get your life back.",False,False
