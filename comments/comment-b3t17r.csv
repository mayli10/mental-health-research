One of my biggest pet peeves is when someone points out who others are more attracted to them/treat them better since they've lost weight and people chime in and say things like ""oh you just put yourself out there more or have a better attitude, which attracts others."" Like, no. Sure, that may be part of it. But I can say with certainty that people were nicer and more attracted to me when I was at my thinnest. And it wasn't because of the vibes I was putting out because I've always been awkward/socially anxious/introverted. It was because I was thin. ",False,False

This is the conversation I‚Äôve been trying to have with my therapist lately because I‚Äôve just gained and gained... I finally feel like I‚Äôm getting a grip but not in a recovery oriented way.   She keeps trying to tell me that it‚Äôs to be expected in recovery, that I should be okay with maybe being overweight again for a while because my life is more important, etc. But I just can‚Äôt stand the idea of going back to being regarded how I was at higher weights.   If I can just get a grip on the b/p behaviors that could have serious implications for my health, if I can just manage to be even *slightly* less obsessive about everything, well, that‚Äôd be wonderful (and might be necessary)‚Äîbut I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ready to Actually Recover beyond that, at least not at this point, in large part because of these very real differences in what it‚Äôs like to navigate the world at different sizes. It‚Äôs sad, but it‚Äôs true. I‚Äôve felt it. I feel it.  To Actually Recover now, I would have to accept getting kind of fat again for a while because I know it‚Äôs going to take me a *very* long time to find any real semblance of balance. I don‚Äôt think I can do it, not yet.  Anyway. I really appreciate how eloquently and honestly you put this out there. You‚Äôre very brave. üíõ I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre struggling, and I‚Äôm sorry your husband doesn‚Äôt quite seem to get it.  I hope we can both acquire access to that privilege safely, friend! I mean, I started developing an eating disorder when I was about nine, and it‚Äôs taken on all kinds of different forms at various points in my life since then.

I've gotten free drinks at coffee shops, free food at restaurants (the waitress or waiter will often comp my drink or meal apologizing for slow service when the service was perfectly fine), I once got a bunch of free phone accessories when I was replacing a broken phone, my customers would bring me gifts when I worked in a coffee shop (and tip better), discounts at random stores that I didn't ask for, etc.   Then I gained weight and it was like I turned invisible. People mostly ignored me. Waiters/waitresses/retail employees etc. were just fake-nice because I was just another customer.
