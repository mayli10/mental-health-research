Going to a restaurant and not knowing which Coke is my diet and which one is my friend's full sugar one. The sound of the stove turning on (and it's not me boiling water), the knowledge that I have two scales that give me different weight readouts, pasta. Knowing I have to eat nothing because even an apple can cause a hell spiral of binging that might just go on for weeks. Months without my weight budging. Sitting cross legged in shorts. Ugh. It's killing me, literally.",False,False
