(12 weeks paid leave iirc)   I was lucky to also have a small 401k to liquidate later on (the early withdrawal penalty was waived because I was on disability and using it for health expenses, which are also tax deductible).",False,False

I'd take a deep dive into your budgeting to look at your rent situation. If there's any excess spending, start there. I know I have a tendency to eat out or buy random shit way more than I realize.  Anyone you know that'd be interested in renting your apartment for a month or two? Can you end your lease?  Ultimately though, if you do have to take a loan, you're investing in your future. If you don't go to treatment, what kind of hellish life are you setting yourself up for, even if you are able to pay your rent? What about down the road when you lose your job because you can't perform? Or are too sick and are hospitalized anyway?  Who do you bank with? There are loans that are better and worse. Some may not be all that bad, especially if you can set up a budget where you can pay it off quick.",False,False

I'm 21, and if I would have been living on my own, I would have most definitely had to move back home anyways. I quit my job because of this illness but I am so thankful that I live rent free with my grandparents. I don't know how anyone can recover and get help when they have semi functional lives. It's like the Healthcare system just wants us to die to be honest.",False,False
