Esophagus and teeth are also permanently damaged.  It wasn't untill I spent 3 months with a feeding tube shoved down my nose, that I finally started to understand that I was dying. My small intestine was beginning to fail and I had been sustaining on just  bananas and popsicles for quite awhile at that point.  I couldn't keep food down anymore even if I wanted too. Everthing was coming back up, even liquids. After they removed a ""dead"" section of my intestine and sewed the ends back together I remember that was it.
