I don't eat the toast and just kind of track it.   Also, see if you can go later. Some breakfast places will open up their lunch menu at like 10 so you can get a salad or something. ",False,False

FIRST you can always ask for egg whites scrambled! Everyone is saying avocado but honestly bacon is lower in calories depending on how much you order (1-2 pieces is ok in my opinion)   SECOND just drink regular black coffee, tea or water   add a side of fruit and you’re golden! Good luck ❤️",False,False
