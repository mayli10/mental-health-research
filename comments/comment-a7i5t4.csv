Slowly increasing from Alpen Lights to Nakd bars and all that.  The past two weeks I've been eating popcorn from Aldi (117 a bag) and it's a pretty big bag.  I hadn't had any for soooo long and it's a favourite.  I want to move up to the microwave stuff at some point soon.  I kind of pull back from it thinking OH NO, then I think Nah, fuck it.  After a while the Nakd bar over Alpen Light doesn't matter after being crippled with anxiety and guilt in the beginning.  You're doing great.  Doesn't matter when recovery comes, taking steps to recovery is a giant leap really.  x",False,False
