And relatively low cal!! Did you know they sell snack bags of their kettle corn for 120cal/ea? In a pack of 6? It's amazing!! But for my binging brain it just means more waste as I destroy each bag so ayy no more of that.  I literally only go to TJs to get their snacks and so I've stopped going. Same reason I stopped buying cereal and milk and even ice cream. Too easy to binge on. :( moderation/restriction? We don't know her.,False,False
