Even if you are burning off slightly less then you eat, muscle (even muscle that isn't visible) weighs more then fat and makes it harder to gain weight. So eating and working out is good.  Plus, if you feel faint and sick everytime you work out, it's much harder to keep going.  If that advice isn't something that you'd be able to follow though, just please drink plenty of water. I dont want anything bad happening to you (and aside from the health part, fainting at the gym sounds hella embarassing)",False,False
