They FaceTime constantly and also post gag-worthy conversations on Facebook, I'll try to find some but they've calmed down now that they've been together for a while. He goes and visits her a few times a year, I don't think she comes to the US very often but I'm not sure. He is quite a character, everybody thought he was making her up until we saw pictures üòÇ",False,False
