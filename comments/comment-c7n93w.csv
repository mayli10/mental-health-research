That's kind kf the point",False,False

I think a lot of language around recovery focuses on attaining the ideal recovery, one where you’re truly out of the ED mindset in most of your day-to-day food situations.  I guess I don’t know/haven’t seen data on this, but I sometimes wonder if some people can’t achieve this at first, and that maintaining at a low weight is the closest they can get to recovery. I think of this as kind of a second-best option or a bridge to full recovery that may last for a while. To your point, I feel like getting to this sustainable weight might require some weight loss, depending on where you start out. It’s complicated, though- I know that what I’m describing sounds a lot like the “ill lose weight....but not in an ED way” lie that we tell ourselves as we continue to lose weight in an ED way. I guess I’m thinking of this as subtly different, even though I can’t totally clarify why. You’ve given me a lot to think about- thanks!!",False,False

Someone with had an ED doing the same thing all of a sudden is not fully recovered?! Makes literally no sense to me? I would argue you are more recovered if you are dieting and exercising in a healthy way.  I know there are triggers so it’s a case by case basis but I also think it’s really hindering to someone who is just watching their weight to say they have an ED and aren’t recovered because they still watch exercise and diet. If you’re doing it healthyish, what’s wrong with that? Why is being more restrictive on exercise and diet so much worse than being less restrictive and eating too much sugar or whatever? Feels like a double standard.",False,False

I have a friend who also had an ED and they told me that the idea of CICO is super triggering. They believe, due to the treatment they received, that being recovered means not caring anymore, and accepting gaining weight, etc etc. I said my goal is to be healthy in body and mind... to be able to work out moderately, eat healthy foods at a good calorie level rather than starving myself, not to feel guilty when I indulge, but also not to have mindless binges either.   They insisted that if you focus on food and exercise to try to change your body, it's an ED still. This is what a lot of inpatient treatment teaches people. That is where they got this idea. It seems so bonkers to me.",False,False

When j decided to stop starving myself / binge cycle, I decided I'm gonna be healthy and only eat certain foods and I will exercise most days. And that was the case, the only things I don't eat are dairy and cakes, but I have pasta for lunch everyday, have sandwiches, eat carbs, eat 4 large pieces of dark chocolate, but I eat a normal amount and I exercise, so I have lost a lot of weight, and I'm actually at one of my lowest weights. Yes. I am a bit obsessive over the fact I have to exercise most days a week, but if that's the worse that could happen, I think that's pretty good",False,False
