So when we see our pain hurt those around us, that hurts more than actually experiencing it ever did.  Really strange feeling. I get why it knocked around your head until you put it down onto paper.  I don't know if this helps at all, but if you're struggling with thoughts and feelings, try treating yourself like you think your brother would treat/see you. When you criticized yourself, what would your brother say back to it?  It's not easy to care about yourself as much as it is to care about other people, but I've been trying to hack my brain into doing it like that. It's got its flaws, but sometimes it helps me when I'm being pointlessly self-critical, so maybe it could help you too.",False,False
