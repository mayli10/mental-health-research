Sometimes I can play Overwatch for an hour, sometimes I can watch a movie. Most of the time I just watch youtube, rewatch AHS, browse reddit and play games on my phone. I donâ€™t really enjoy it, but it makes time go a little bit faster.  I find that itâ€™s easier for me to enjoy things I do with other people, but itâ€™s also really exhausting and I donâ€™t do it very often. ",False,False

When I'm restricting I feel like I'm just constantly waiting for the next moment I let myself eat. Like I will count down the minutes to my next meal, and then when I'm eating it I'm already counting down the minutes to my next meal. I've been doing this for so long and it makes me wonder what type of person I'd be if I actually put my mental energy towards something else. I feel like I'd be more genuine and lively. I like taking walks, sipping tea and doing homework, sometimes I can get myself to watch a youtube video or tv show, although rarely. When I was reading this, the picture of a person just laying in bed wishing that time would pass made me sad. But then I realized I'm like this a lot too. I don't really like my job, but I like having homework as a way to pass the time. I've lost interest in pretty much anything that gave me a personality.",False,False

When I low restrict, I don't have the energy to hold up my guitar or concentrate long enough to get a good amount of practice in. Even when I take all my supplements properly.
