Had a hard time making friends during oreintation, my mind quickly went to the thought of, ""Its because your a fat pig and no one wants to talk to you because of it"". Lost a lot of weight.  I isolated myself I never ate in the cafeteria, pretty much just ate my salads alone. Studying was pretty ok, just was occupied with my weight always.",False,False

I actually dove deep into my eating disorder in college. I was over two hundred pounds and lost a vast, vast majority at that weight. I recommend living off campus as soon as possible to not have to be on the meal plan. I personally am at a residential college so that isn‚Äôt an option for me. It‚Äôs been absolute fucking hell. My eating disorder made making and keeping friends harder because a lot of socialization surrounds food. My eating disorder destroyed my GPA (3.3) which is going to extremely limit my changes of getting into graduate school later this year. However, I did also get free counseling through my school which was nice. If I could go back and change anything it would be to get more intensive treatment earlier because my eating disorder stole the ‚Äúmost fun time‚Äù in my life.",False,False

I ended up on a binge spree. If you can, try to avoid the all or nothing mind set. I know it‚Äôs hard, but it helps a a lot.",False,False

I remember leaving parties to go to the gym. I gained a lot of weight and was just generally unhealthy. I wish I would have used the university mental health services and gotten some counciling for my depression.   Get help for everything. use office hours, tutors, etc. You don't need to be stressed. Make a schedule to study, socialize away from food as much as possible.  Take the smallest food plan you can, and supplement with groceries. Find some friends and move just off campus. Get a bike to get around. Try the different exercises classes they have at the gym, take different physical education classes too. My favorite class all time was a liberal education requirement called Introduction to Dance, it was a history class but we had a dance lab in it, look for things like that. Stay active but don't go overboard (easier said than done). Join clubs and activities that will keep you busy, away from food and socialize with many different groups of people.",False,False

On one hand you‚Äôve got a dining plan with unhealthy options and friends that wanna go eat. But I‚Äôm on the other hand you‚Äôre on your own for the first time with no supervision and freedom to restrict as much as you please.   I did both. The beginning i definitely did the freshman 15. My friends wanted to do ‚Äúfamily dinners‚Äú every night and one would always get lunch with me. It definitely took its toll tbh.   But then once midterms and finals came around, I became so busy with studying that I genuinely forgot to eat some days. Then add intentional restricting days plus too much time at the Rec and you‚Äôve got yourself a relapse üòé.   But after that you become an adult and how much you eat is all on you and your grocery shopping. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø",False,False

They would always complain about how fat they were getting and would cut out carbs or constantly be doing ab workouts in their rooms at night. Thrust me right back into the disordered mindset and, alongside a slew of other factors like the loss of control over my cooking because of dining hall food, made me experience the worst relapse I‚Äôve ever had/made my ed so much worse. It‚Äôs not like these girls even managed to keep the weight off, since most of them would gain it back through snacking and stress eating and drinking. Vicious cycle and awful rhetoric to be forced into. And the actual dining halls‚Äî Jesus fuck, the lack of real vegetables and the lack of certainty in counting made it all unbearable.  Tl;dr college made my eating disorder hell.",False,False
