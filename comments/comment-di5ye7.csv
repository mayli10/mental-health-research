People who are concerned just say all this random stuff to me so I don’t know what’s true anymore.  What is also kinda concerns my ed brain from wanting to slowly increase my calorie intake is the whole idea that when you lose a bunch of weight then eat again you gain the pounds back and then some. Like a lot more. You apparently just hold onto all the calories instead of burning them off like you normally would? Thus gaining way more weight than expected?

When there is a lack of energy, the body will shut off/slow down nonessential functions in an attempt to conserve energy. You might have personally noticed it with you digestive system. The reason why your stools take forever to move through you when restricting is because digesting food and getting waste flushed out of you is not a priority compared to keeping your heart beating and brain functioning.  Yes, starvation mode exists, but for most people, the effects are way over-exaggerated. Yes, the human body can slow its metabolism up to 40-60%, but the thing is, those extreme numbers won’t happen unless one is anorexically underweight. On top of that, the body is great at healing itself. A permanently damaged metabolism is mostly a myth. So, even if you get sick enough for your metabolism to be affected by 50%, once your body gets nourished again, it’s metabolism will pick back up. Based off studies, it might not be back to 100%, but overtime, it’ll get pretty damn close to it.  [please keep in mind, I’m referring to metabolism ONLY. I am not a doctor, and while metabolism will mostly get fixed after anorexia, I can’t promise the same about your organs..please stay safe]  Idk, I just a threw a bunch of information out, not knowing what you necessarily wanted to know, so I hoped I help.

Long periods of energy deficiency can certainly mess with metabolism in that the body will decrease your BMR in order to compensate. This effect is multi-pronged, but seems to be related to thyroid hormones (which play a role in things like thermoregulation and general level of mental/ physical activity).   It’s sort of complicated but broadly, T4 is the primary circulating form of thyroid hormone while T3 is the active form. T4 can be converted to T3 in the target cells, but most of it is converted in the liver and sent elsewhere via the blood. Reduced caloric intake or long periods of fasting has been shown to reduce levels of circulating T3, which is linked to reduced levels of thyroid hormone activity in the body. When thyroid hormone activity is reduced, you start to get symptoms that look like hypothyroidism, with a marked slowing of metabolic function, dry skin, reduced brain activity, and slow action (like if it’s bad people literally start moving and thinking slowly), which are also symptoms of starvation.   There’s a lot of other things going on, like it impacts thermogenesis, glucose metabolism and how other body systems function.   So anyway yes, restriction does lower your BMR. But wreck isn’t really the right word/ it’s just a compensatory method the body has to conserve energy? And there’s probably a limit to the effect. Also it doesn’t seem like the effects are permanent, things seem to level out after a period of everything being wackadoo.   Interestingly overfeeding can raise you BMR which might explain the hyperactivity and hot flashes that come with refeeding 😊",False,False
