[This article](https://www.scienceofeds.org/2013/03/06/your-bodys-response-to-chewing-spitting-the-role-of-ghrelin-and-obestatin/) is currently the most comprehensive on the physiological response to C/S and basically states that it sharply increases hunger hormones and decreases ""fullness"" hormones, and similar research suggests it causes huge spikes and drops insulin which may be bad news for blood sugar. . . one may assume having an intake of a small meal with protein and fat before C/S may blunt this effect but there is nothing to support this. Obviously it's not good for your digestion, but to what degree and how much can one control the damage???",False,False
