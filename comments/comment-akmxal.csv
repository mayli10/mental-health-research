I know it’s the truth, but I feel so deep in this hole right now. It’s been 4 months and I feel so damn good doing this whole low restriction thing, and I’m absolutely terrified of eating more, not being able to stop, and ending up worse than when I started.   And honestly, although I know it’s not good for me, I’ve had 18 years of crazy irregular and totally unpredictable periods, so I just can’t make myself believe that doing this is going to make anything worse. How could it? I already possibly don’t ovulate, and certainly not to any schedule.  I plan to get to a BMI under 30 and then switch to a healthier method whilst starting the fertility treatment stuff. I know it’s not a great plan, and I’m not convinced I’ll be able to stop when I get there, but I’m on waiting lists for CBT and counselling which should come through around the same time.

Even if you are at an above-normal BMI. For context; my BMI fluctuates between 24-29 and I still completely lose my period or my period becomes unpredictable if I’m undereating.  Plus what happens when you become pregnant, and your body is so worn out and you have gotten so used to restrictive eating habits that you can’t carry a healthy pregnancy.  I know it’s hard and you feel like you’re in a massive rush, but I think that the best way to pull this weight loss off is HEALTHY. Consult a doctor and a nutritionist, tell them your exact goals, and let them set up a weight loss plan for you. Keep swimming - exercise is great and swimming is especially soothing when you’re pregnant, so good to have that habit set up already.  Please don’t “give” yourself an eating disorder, because I PROMISE you it’s never worth it. Please, please try to reconfigure this mindset and behaviour while you can, and remember that there is an entire tiny human relying on you.",False,False

Just always remind yourself that you're not just losing weight for yourself anymore, it's for your baby. And if you have trouble treating your body well just remind yourself it's going to be hard but so worth it!!",False,False

I’m not good at talking about it and have really shut down since first telling her.   I don’t think I can cope with losing weight slowly right now, but when I get under that magic 30 and can relax a bit then hopefully I can concentrate on growing a good baby making environment!

I know eating disorders arent easy but I'd just like to say, if you lose the weight healthily, it will be slower, but you risk less damage to your body which would make it a better place for your baby. Maybe your doctor does understand but didnt explain herself and was asking what she cn do to help you healthily lose the weight.  Anyways, good luck on your journey. Love seeing wlw here",False,False
