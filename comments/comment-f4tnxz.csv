Like I got used to the way my face looks now...so sometimes it’s not as bad, cause I get used to looking at the roundness all the time, but I still dislike it obviously lol. But once I look at old pictures when i wasn’t fat, I suddenly hate my face so much more, because in comparison the roundness is SO obvious.   I feel like by eating the things I ate yesterday my face will grow into a literal fucking circle now and I hate it.",False,True

My biggest bother is my face looking fat or puffy so I freak out and then begin looking at old photos where I see myself as skinnier everywhere , especially my face and then I internally freak out and want to starve for eternity and wish that food was not real or a thing that I need but if I eat less in a day I immediately feel tired and drained and it’s annoying , so yea I spiral 24/7 and am not of a great help here but COMPLETELY understand you because it’s fucking painful and no one understands",False,False
