It’s really strong bc it used to only be available from dermatologists office but now you can get it from amazon for like $20-$25. I started out using it once every few days but now that my skin is used to it i use it twice everyday and i honestly think i wouldn’t have clear skin without it.   Also doing your skincare twice a day everyday helps (just saying that bc i get lazy about skin care). And a charcoal or a clay mask with deep clean everything from your pores. I couldn’t honestly ramble on forever. I have oily acne prone skin so i understand wanting to have clear skin but you can’t seem to find anything that works :/,False,False

I'll share the products I use because I'm really loyal to them, took me a long ass time to figure out shit that works for me and doesn't cost an arm and a leg.

I feel like a lot of the zits we caused by the internal stuff, so not a lot I can do externally will help. But there are two tricks I use.  So my skin in dry and flaky and pretty lifeless, and then overcompensates by getting extra oily. It’s super fun! Not. So, raw honey is antibacterial, hydrating, and super gentle. Sometimes I’ll use it as a wash at night or, if my skins really bad, the replacement for any wash at all. Also, aloe Vera after sun gel lotion. Hydrate my skin, doesn’t clog my pores, and helps heal breakouts. Like I said, when the root of the problem is internal issues, the most you can do outside is help your skin heal. Aloe Vera gel makes my zits go away faster.",False,False
