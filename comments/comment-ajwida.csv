Then I purged. THEN I went to the shop to buy MORE binge food and I proceeded to binge on: two cheese pasties dipped in bbq sauce, a white chocolate cookie,  two cinnamon and raisin bagels, a quarter of a jar of cookie butter, six custard creams, three spoonfuls of cream cheese frosting, and three more cream eggs.
