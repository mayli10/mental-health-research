I practice CRON (calorie restriction with optimal nutrition) as best as I can given my dietary limitations, and Iâ€™m convinced that itâ€™s the key to longevity.  I used to have a serious substance abuse problem, but I think that having a relatively clean diet back then helped mitigate some of the damage... and I since I quit using and rarely drink nowadays, Iâ€™ve noticed that the fine lines around my eyes have virtually vanished, and my skin is a lot clearer (also, giving up dairy made a radical difference as far as reducing breakouts).   My husband is significantly older than I am, but heâ€™s been ortho since he was in his 20s, and when we were first dating, I assumed he was 15 years younger than is, so I hope that Iâ€™ll age as gracefully as he has since Iâ€™ve adopted a lot of his habits. Iâ€™m almost 32, but I still get carded, and most people guess that Iâ€™m 21-25 depending on how much makeup Iâ€™m wearing, lol.",False,False

I never thought as a perfectionist driven teenager I would have so many problems with my direction in life but as soon as I moved out of my parents' house it was like BOOM depression and now anxiety to boot. It's hard to imagine what my life will be like for the next 5 years. Best of luck with your degree!!,False,False

That's why now I tend to rush things (to make up for it).  Also I'm scared of looking older. One of the reasons i want to lose more weight is to look younger.",False,False

I made this comment when I was over at my boyfriendâ€™s parentâ€™s house and his mom (who struggles with an eating disorder) says there are some metabolic changes but nothing drastic to the point where your body is no longer efficient in losing weight.

Iâ€™m 23 and for the last year Iâ€™ve been insanely anxious that Iâ€™m getting old and Iâ€™m an old lady (Iâ€™m asian too, doesnâ€™t help).
