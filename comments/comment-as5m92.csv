But yes, I'm trying so hard to be as healthy as my eating disorder will allow me but every single person ever has differing opinions on what is healthy or not. Dieters and especially fad dieters are the worst in that regard!   I like EDfood but that's more safe foods and very low calorie food than truly healthy food. I would definitely love to see a subreddit that's geared towards wholesome food and open discussions on healthier choices while being completely honest about our disordered behaviors. I'd start one but the thought of running a subreddit gives me mad anxiety.",False,False

You probably struggle with control whether it be over controlling yourself to the point where your health is at risk or being frustrated with the inability to control yourself.  Either way, both this group and the ones you mentioned still rely on rigid rules for ‘success’.  Your problem probably lies in your mental health and view of yourself and less on whether or not you are actually physically healthy. (Basically, you probably want to tackle your viewpoint on yourself and health before actually taking steps to make this new/less distorted viewpoint real).   You are only emphasizing that you need to be ‘fixed’ by following all the diets and rules out there, instead of treating yourself as a person who deserves to be treated well.  I suggest you make some small goals for yourself that have to do more with your mental health. These can still be gym/fitness/food related, but they should be about how you feel and less about the physical.  And what I mean by being a person that deserves to be treated well. I started doing this the other day, I abstract myself. Like, make another person and that person is still you but look at them like they’re just another person. You want that person to work hard and achieve great things. You want them to try their best and not get discouraged because they really do try hard. Give them the healthy body they need without abusing them in the process. Give them compliments sometimes because while there are things that they need to work on, there are things they do well at too.  If it’s hard to love yourself, maybe it’s easier to show that to another person. Just make that other person you. Then you can hold yourself accountable.    ",False,False

I think here we're so careful about encouraging ED behavior but maybe if you added ""i just want to feel better for my body and be drinking less alcohol and eating foods better for it and I want to feel healthy. How can i balance that and an ED/Recovery"".  I know it'll be annoying to make that disclaimer but then maybe more people will see where you're coming from and have different responses.   Overall, i'm sorry you feel that way! I hope you find the right place for support soon &lt;3",False,False
