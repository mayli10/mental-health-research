(Assuming anyone is looking at this anymore), I really appreciate all the feedback! With what I've been hearing, I'd like to propose some changes/ideas; I know firsthand how difficult and delicate of a subject EDs are, and I want to help them and handle this with the respect it deserves.  I'm ashamed that I hadn't even considered BED; I've met some BED sufferers and believe that their struggle is worse than ana/mia and actively bring awareness and diminishing the stigma. In think in order to do my part, I could set up a weekly food delivery where you pay a flat rate for the delivery of 3 meals + snacks instead of relying on your willpower to not binge. I know that they could still just go out and buy food, but I'm not sure if I see an alternative given the concept.  That being said, I **love** the idea of working more as a ""catering service"" working with ED clinics, it would definitely be the most beneficial, but I also feel sad not being able to use my ""platform"" as a way to help cats. I would prefer to be able to do specifically a cat cafe, but I would not sacrifice the wellbeing of others just for that.  I've also decided that it would be marketed as a ""healthy food"" cafe. I was always on the fence because I recognize that it might negatively impact sufferers, but I see the greater benefit of marketing it as ""health food"". As far as the menu, the separation is sort of a crucks of the idea, but again, I would never sacrifice the wellbeing of others over making changes that help the goal of ""recovery"".  Love to hear any thoughts about this would be appreciated!",False,True

It can help girls come together in a safe space. Just serve coffee/drinks and snacks and make a big calorie range so that everyone can enjoy! That's what I would do anyway. You don't even have to have small/med/lg calorie sections. Just list the calories! These girls can read :) I think that would make it feel more ""normal"" while still catering to a specific genre of people kind of under the radar!",False,False

They get a lot of attention and obviously you arent allowed to pick them up, chase them or otherwise harass them, nor are you allowed to feed them .  They sometimes distain to approach you but mostly they just like the adoration from afar. Lol. ",False,False

Maybe there's some other way you can achieve that goal by pairing up with eating disorder treatment centers and existing restaurants or catering services? You can try and create a similar experience of ordering food prepared by someone else, but not in a specialized restaurant where you'd also have to consider rent and other staff costs.",False,False

I'm sorry if it seems like I am glamorizing it, the intention is because the times I have been most successful in recovery has been when I've been ""forced"" to eat at restaurants where I can't control the calories, but that's a very daunting task to get to. My aim would be to allow people to start slowly into ""not controlling"" their calories and building confidence with food and working their way up to ""normal foods"". If I continue looking into this concept, I would do so with the desire to make it as beneficial to sufferers as possible (again, assuming that it could be)!",False,True

So many anorexic people don't want to eat at all, or have food rituals that rule out eating food in public or prepared by someone else. People with BED or bulimia likely wouldn't be interested in going to a cafe meant for restriction. The only people who have a reason to go to this cafe over others are those suffering with anorexia or ednos, but not so severely that they constantly fast or low restrict.",False,False

Marketing it as an eating disorder cafe is a terrible idea and creates a feeling of ""otherness"". It doesn't help, it alienates. The best approach would be to do a health cafe, with your branding focusing on how you used to suffer from an eating disorder and want to create a safe and body positive and inclusive space for everyone to relax in with cats to ease stress. Separating your menus into those categories also would not be good, as it might come off as promoting behaviours.   Also, looking into the logistics behind running a cat cafe is very important. All the ones started up in Toronto/Ontario have gotten terrible reviews and were eventually shut down for improper care and handling of both the business and cats. It would be a lot to manage.  OP, I'd suggest if you're serious about the idea looking into courses on running a business at your local college/online resources.",False,False

If you are marketing it as an ED cafe, I don't think many people would want to go there, as it's such a niche thing. Many people with EDs don't want to be open about it, and going to a cafe labeled specifically as that would turn them away. People who don't have EDs would likely feel uncomfortable about going there. There would probably be media backlash and you'd be accused of glamorizing EDs, and tbh, it kind of sounds like you are.  I think it could be a good idea to label it as a cafe focused on inclusiveness and health, to explain lower calorie options and calorie counts on menus. Maybe you could even say you've struggled with eating disorders and wanted a place like that. But I think marketing it ONLY as an ED cafe would be a bad decision.",False,False
