For example if you are making a pizza but don't need an entire onion, block of cheese, tomatoes, mushrooms, etc. More expensive in terms of price per item but helps reduce food waste!",False,False

I had to throw out a whole container of mushrooms today because they'd gone moldy while I worked up the courage/found the ""right occasion"" to make the pasta dish I bought them for.  If it helps, food waste is not the reason people in the world are starving, it's infrastructure and shitty business practices. Companies that torch or throw out excess product instead of donating it are the problem, not people like us. Just focus on taking care of yourself. Sometimes that means you have to try things that might not work, like cooking a meal you aren't 100% sure you'll be able to eat.",False,False

I feel like this is actually a healthier attitude than I've had in the past; I used to feel like if I committed the act of wasting food, I'd better not eat something later then because I had the chance and I wasted it.

I hate grocery shopping because all the reasonably priced foods come in larger containers, and they almost always go to waste.
