If you hide information it'll take much longer than it should to get things sorted out.  You don't have to say you have an ED. just say you wanted to lose weight so you've been (insert what you've done).   He can then run appropriate tests (probably a blood panel with specific markers and maybe ekg). If you aren't honest they might not test for what they should.   Please take care of yourself. It's scary but any doctor worth a damn should take it seriously,False,False
