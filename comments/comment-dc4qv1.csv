ED's r soooo complicated, it's like being addicted to cocaine or heroin. like it's not just what's on surface, it's much more than that.  im so glad u realized something was wrong, that's where u start. recovery isn't impossible but it isn't linear, it's what i try to remind myself. some take longer than others but we all get there",False,False
