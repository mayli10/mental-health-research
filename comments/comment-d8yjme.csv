Even at 14 years old to have a BMI of 17-18 I was often eating a bowl of cereal for breakfast, skipping lunch, having a small snack after school, then eating mostly meat and salad/vegetables at dinner in modest portions. Now I have eat 3 times a day, but have to count my calories instead of just no-nonsense portion control.",False,False

I was just eating Chicken Penne a la vodka and cried because today is my last day of eating 3 square meals.

I had a bit of a spontaneous recovery while I was pregnant, and allowed myself to eat what I wanted because of the baby. I gained 43 pounds during the pregnancy, even while teaching fitness classes, but I was okay with that, because I knew it would come off eventually. A few days before I went into labour, I found myself in tears thinking about how I didn‚Äôt want this period of loving my body and feeling so pretty (despite the weight gain, the pregnancy glow is real!), and having to go back to dieting and restricting to lose weight. It was an enjoyable 9 months of food freedom, and it did continue for my year off while I was breastfeeding and able to go to the gym 5 days a week. I dropped the baby weight in about 8 months, but then as soon as I had to go back to work and stopped nursing, I gained 10 pounds back. So now we‚Äôre back, dieting and restricting, and losing weight slowly, but I just want to be able to eat and not worry, or not feel like I can never enjoy food again.",False,False

I‚Äôm trying so hard but I‚Äôm tired :(  I get you. My instinct though is to tell u we don‚Äôt have to give up food, there has to be another way that just hasn‚Äôt clicked.
