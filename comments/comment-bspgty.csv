A bit nutty and very vaguely cabbage-like when cooked. It’s nice because it can be really good on its own (roasted is really good and you get those nice brown bits) but can also disappear into a sauce or pair well with a lot of food because of how neutral the taste is. It’s also really low cal :),False,False
