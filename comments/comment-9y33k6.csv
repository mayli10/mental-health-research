I know it's meant to be a parody, but there was this line on Channel 4's *The Windsors* (a ridiculously campy British sitcom currently on Netflix) that really resonated with me. Essentially, Kate Middleton (the character) gets fat and has a panic attack in front of the mirror, exclaiming ""I had one USP, being thin! And now I don't even have that!"" Ouch. Comedy, why so painful?",False,False

I can vividly remember my ex boyfriend saying ""stop saying that, you're not fat"". So I should just stop saying it instead of fixing it, that's the thing. Just shut up...   Coming from someone with a mental disorder himself, I thought it was ridiculous to just say someone to ""stop"". ",False,False

When I hit size zero I replaced a good 60% of my wardrobe with my new size and threw my size 2 and 4 clothes straight into the garbage.

It was empowering in a way when I had to regain weight because I could go back to pictures of myself at my low weight to remind myself that restricting wouldn't make me feel any better about how I look.  Obviously it's more complicated than that because restriction feels amazing in other ways and for other reasons but it helped me deal with at least one of the factors and realize ""this crappy part of my life is something I need to just get used to"".",False,False

Jesus christ, this speaks to my soul.   I got down to my UGW, still felt fat AF, but received lots of positive comments and attention. But it was too hard to maintain that low of a weight, and now that I've gained I am even more disgusted in myself and my dysmorphia is at its worst.  I'm obsessed with sizes too... I refuse to buy anything that's not a small, because I used to fit into S and XS. Now that a medium would probably be a better fit, I refuse to accept that reality and just don't clothes shop anymore.  Currently on day 4 of relapse into low restriction. But in my head, if I'm going to hate my body either way, I might as well be fucking skinny and hate it. ",False,False
