Iâ€™ve found that cutting back on salt and drinking ginger and turmeric tea (decreases inflammation) helps my stomach feel a lot better after a binge, especially with that deceiving water weight. Also stretching the next morning and laying on your stomach after it doesnâ€™t feel so full. Try to forgive yourself even though thatâ€™s much easier said than done ",False,False

I know binging, that pain in your stomach combined with the post water bloat, and crushing guilt/shame is excruciating. But coming from a bulimic animal who kept trying for years until it worked; please please donâ€™t. The first time I threw up is legitimately my biggest life regret by my mid twenties. Itâ€™s not worth it. Itâ€™s honestly the lowest form of self harm I can think of at this point, I wish I had never been able to. After I started I had to hit absolute rock bottom just to not do it three times a day and Iâ€™ve had to drop out of college because of it. Now I have chipped teeth, my enamel are MIA, and I have to get an endoscopy next week because I somehow ruined something in my esophagus or throat. Iâ€™m glad you recognize itâ€™s a good thing you couldnâ€™t, I wish you the absolute best! I donâ€™t want to scare you but I really wouldnâ€™t wish that on my worst enemy ",False,False

I thought maybe after that time I would be able to do it but nope. I've spent countless hours on trying to force my body to do something it won't. I totally have just felt like I'm doing something wrong cause it's so simple. All anyone who can purge tells you is be thankful you're saving yourself from xyz symptom. And I am but at the same time I'd like to even have the option in the first place. It makes me feel incompetent at my own disorder. ,False,False

I know myself. But i am still curious. Will i die when i get a bad food poison because i cant throw up? Or will my body get that out but refuses to do it manually? ",False,False
