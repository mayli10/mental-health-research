The only thing it ever did was give me a very, very small distraction from not eating.  Earlier this year I had to quit because I was getting surgery and I actually lost weight. This was because I was coming out of a depressive episode, started keeping better track of what I was eating and going outside more, and just became more active in my life. It didn't really have anything to do with the cigarettes.  For a while I chewed nicotine gum, which weirdly did have a noticeable effect on my appetite. After a while though the effect of the gum went away and it no longer did much of anything for me.",False,False

I quit for over a year at one point. I didn't gain weight. I feel like im definitely an anomaly though. I did notice that i confused a lot of my body signals due to smoking. For example...I often smoke when I am thirsty and didnt realize this until I quit for a while.,False,False

I finally quit because I was scared of aging faster and noticed I was having a harder time with exercise because of my lungs. I didn’t have an issue with weight gain when I quit honestly, I felt so much better, I didn’t have to try to cover up the smell, etc. that’s just my experience though.",False,False
