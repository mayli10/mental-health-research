I think in Australia it’s 50kg and bc I’m so short it wouldn’t be any lower than that. All my friends are giving blood at the moment and I have this strange disturbing pride that I’m just under the cut off. I want to be so little though that it’s OBVIOUS I’m under the cut off and there’s no way I’d be able to donate. Both motivating and disturbed myself at the same time.... ,False,False

Like if you're 5ft you have to weight at least 138 lbs whereas if you're 5ft7 you have to weight at least 110 lbs. ",False,False

It was more calories than I ate in a day so fuck that. ,False,False
