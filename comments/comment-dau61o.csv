I'm struggling with that with my boyfriend right now. He doesn't know about my ED so this has obviously caused some problems for me with comments he makes about food. Neurotypical people are fine with talking about food and their weight, so try not to resent him for this, recognize it's a YOU problem and that he needs to understand this if you guys want to have healthy, happy communication.",False,False

When you have an ED, it‚Äôs easy to hate fatter pictures of yourself and find it difficult to imagine someone else could not feel the same. But, that usually isn‚Äôt the case. He probably thought you‚Äôd be embarrassed that he was looking at old photos of you, in the way any almost anyone would. But he probably didn‚Äôt realize you‚Äôd be so affected.  If you really like him, I hope you find the courage to talk to him about it. You should consider requesting his most embarrassing old photo in return. Bonus points to him if he truly follows through because everyone has them lol",False,False
