He made me think that maybe becoming professional would be an option for me. and then..anorexia happened...going to a psych ward for a suicide attempt, i felt too ashamed and guilty to say anything so i took the coward's way out and hid away, not speaking to anyone.   &amp;#x200B;  I saw him on the street, somewhat recently and he stopped what he was doing and just stared in shock, im guessing because I look so sick and unhealthy and pale and weak now. My legs can't even get me up the stairs some days. I literally fucking fled before he could say anything. This wracks me with guilt and misery. Sometimes I feel as though i've lost everything. and it's my fault. I let people down. My coach, my team; I let myself down. I cant speak to anyone anymore. cant leave the house. fuck eating disorders. fuck them.",False,False
