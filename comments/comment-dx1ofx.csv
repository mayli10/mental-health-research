Throughout the day but especially at night. Sometimes the pain triggers a panic attack cuz I get scared I'm dying or shortening my lifespan :/ Last time I was still tracking my heart rate when I was having daily pain w/restricting, it was right around where yours is. Of course you already know that it's dangerously low and you should see a doctor, so I won't push that but I do hope you're okay or able to get better/get the help you need",False,False
