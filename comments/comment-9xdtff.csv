Thank you for doing this.   When asked what I wanted the Reddit staff to know about ProED, this was my answer:   *It was support when I needed it. It was a community of people that are ostracized so often in real life. For a lot of us, this WAS our only safe outlet. This is where we could talk one another down off the ledge. Where we helped with harm reduction..Offered encouragement when people were ready to seek treatment. It was our one place to not feel so ashamed, unworthy, and alone. It was an incredibly valuable community of support and understanding for a group of mental illnesses that are SO misunderstood and villified. There are a LOT of us now who are hanging by a thread with no where to turn when we need to vent. I for one am lost and that community was my beacon of hope. Yes I receive professional help from doctors and mental health providers but they are not my friends, they are not my peers, and they do not understand my struggles outside of a clinical basis. That community and all of stood for can't be replaced by a shitty ""Get Help"" image and 800 number.*  ",False,False

BTW, this was my end of survey comment:  *For the first time in over a decade, I was able to begin working on recovery because of the help and sense of community I found on r/proed. I never thought I could regain control in a healthy way and had given up on trying. This sub and r/proedmemes provided a relief in realizing I wasn't alone or crazy! These places encouraged me to try, and didn't judge me when I struggle. I'm slowly getting better because of the support I found here. Taking it down is going to do more harm than good for the people who used it*  Everyone involved in bringing this sub up and running so quickly- THANK YOU! and everyone on proed &amp; proedmemes who gave me a desperately needed sense of belonging in the first place.
