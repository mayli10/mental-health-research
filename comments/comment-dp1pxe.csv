Usually I can’t compromise and MUST have what I wanted, so I would have driven in the rain to get the candy but I was too tired and settled for a packet of ‘sugar’. at least it got me to sleep.  Love your reply, it makes me feel.. not so silly or alone lol",False,True

If food plans change at the last second and I don't have a viable alternative, or if I can't find something that I had my heart set on, my face will literally go numb with panic lol.  I really hope you found it or at the very least had a pleasant night's sleep. Don't feel crazy for feeling this way, it's human nature &amp; survival instinct to be protective of your food stores. It doesn't matter if we've evolved to the point of pink starbursts, that was YOUR meal!!",False,False
