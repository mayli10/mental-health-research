I’ve had terrible, bad, no-good haircuts (usually by choice tbh) and they’ve always been made less worse after a trip to my mum’s hair guy and some decent product.  I know it feels like the end of the world, but in a years time this will just be a really funny story.",False,False

I don't agree w/all his advice but with hair he's mostly on point.)  I also have a '69 bookmarked yearbook I carry around to capture the tipping point in American culture where even prep schoolers started growing their hair.   From all this info, my previous stylist devised a style that is 100% me. But since he knew he was retiring soon, he also made it fairly straightforward to cut (IN THEORY).   That man was an angel. Now I've met the devil. *cue country music fiddle*",False,True

Black can definitely be dicey that way.  My neighbor is actually lovely, she's just a blunt Brooklynite. She's only allowed to say that cuz she loves me, haha. The hairdresser, though...I'm fuckin pissed. I searched all over Yelp, but like, every salon has a bunch of people raving and a couple who got fucked, and looking at the pics how do you even tell if the stylist is bad, if they can only do one cut, or if people have bad taste about their own hair? But yeah someone else was complaining about this guy saying ""HE COULDN'T FOLLOW REF PICS AT ALL!?!?"" and that's what happened here :/ I lost so much hair that really only time can fix this, but I'm thinking of shelling out to see someone who fixes disaster hair before film shoots (yes this is a thing).",False,True

I was sick of how brittle my hair was and it was an impulsive thing.  My hair's black.  I looked really bad because short hair and hair colour that really made me look so ill and pale.  &amp;#x200B;  It grows back quickly though.  I was stupid enough to get mine cut in winter so I wore a lot of hats.  Seriously, it does grow quickly when you've had it cut.  Your neighbour was really insensitive to say that and sounds like a twat.  Honestly, you're experiencing what we've all felt after a haircut we're not happy with but times 1000 because of a stupid comment.  Maybe backcomb and give it some height?  Tie a scarf around it?  Don't get too down because it'll soon grow back to a length you're comfortable with. If you give me the address of that stylist, I'll post some dog shit through their letterbox.",False,False
