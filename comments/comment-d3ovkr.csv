[here's a good article on the topic.](https://eatingdisorder.org/blog/2011/05/eating-disorders-and-the-all-or-nothing-trap/) it also has a click-through link on there for questions to ask yourself in terms of cognitive distortions.,False,False

It happened this morning actually and the guilt has stayed with me all day. The best advice I can give is to just sit with the guilt. It’s done, don’t let it go any further and don’t let the binge voice win. It’s disappointing but no need to make a small mistake any bigger.  This may sound stupid but I try to separate the binge voice from myself. Accept the guilt for now (and try to use it to prevent it happening again) and choose not to listen to the voice telling me to give in and eat the lot. I know I don’t really want to do that.  It takes some practice but it does get easier. I think it’s partly habit too.  Hope this helps a little x",False,False

The minute I allow myself to eat something, the floodgates open. I can't stop eating.  The only thing that allows me to control my weight is extended fasting and/or OMAD.",False,False

I try not to purge it anymore because it messes up my stomach for days. I end up working out, but not to the point of exhaustion just until I feel a little better and then restrict even more the next day and drink as much water as I can before I feel sick. It's not the greatest thing to do but it works for me.",False,False
