I started getting them as a withdrawal symptom from a medication. But then I started getting them while fasting. And now I get them almost all the time.   For me, they usually present as a heartbeat that is ""hard"" but not necessarily fast. My heart might be at 40 bpm, but each beat will feel like my heart is pushing against my ribs, or like it's a tiny jackhammer inside my heart but going in slowmo",False,False

I read (from a registered dietitian!!!) That BMI was created as a way to estimate a healthy weight range for populations. If this is true, it means that not everybody's and every bodys' (hope that makes sense) true healthy weight range is the same as their BMI range for their height. Using me as an example, TW WEIGHTS my dietitian and I discussed that I am pretty underweight for my particular body at its height. Due to my excessive exercise, low body fat, height, and other factors (very heavy periods when I am getting them, hypoglucemia, etc) a weight between 125 and 135 is where my body functions its absolute best. Above that and I would probably feel sluggish and tired (although I have never been above 130) and below 124/125 (accounting for natural weight fluctuations) I start to feel very low energy, my blood sugar crashes far more often. Once I got below 116, I started getting chest pains and heart palpitations on a daily basis. This is my body telling me it needs more fat in general and is underweight. Despite this, according to a BMI scale, I am healthy. I only recently dipped 2 pounds under a minimum healthy BMI for my height, but I feel so awful all the time. My muscles constantly cramp even when I am completely relaxed. Heart palpitations happen nearly 100% of the time, same with chest pains, and my heart rate regularly goes below 43. I am sore all over, if I get an injury from strenuous exercise it doesnt feel better. I've had 5 injuries for WEEKS that usually would take 1 day of rest to disappear. My lifting is getting weaker. I can't run as fast or as long without feeling like I'm going to pass out (but I push myself anyways). I've lost my period, my hair is falling out like CRAZY (luckily my hair is very thick and it's barely noticeable atm) and I regularly have bowel movements that contain completely undigested food. This started happening at 114 pounds, still a ""healthy weight"". Yes, part of this is due to restriction, but even with multiple days of binging 5000+ calories (thanks extreme hunger) I was still getting all these symptoms.   The worst part? Even knowing my body is pretty quickly deteriorating, I'm relapsing again. Did a 48 hour fast. The chest pains and heart palpitations have never been so bad. The muscle cramps were awful. I still worked out during the fast, and cramped up so badly during that the cramp in my foot and hip stayed for over an hour after the workout.  This is an insanely long post, but my point is: every body is different. There will be bodies that function best *slightly* under or overweight. (Emphasis on slightly because no body wants to go very far outside the BMI range, it is based on populations after all, large sample size and whatnot). But its likely that your body has it's own healthy range (likely within the BMI range for your height) that is a smaller range than that of the BMI range. Try not to focus too much on a number that is meant to cover as many people as possible, try to pay attention to your body and how it feels at different weights. K thx (-:",False,False
