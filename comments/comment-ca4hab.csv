Everything I eat I either use a knife and fork or rip apart with my hands.  There are certain foods I eat in a strange, ritualistic way. I know there are many but the only one that comes to mind right now is Luna bars even though it’s been a minute since I last had one. But when I did eat them I would break them into ten pieces, eat the coating off the sides, then pick apart each piece (you know the puffed rice or whatever it is, I’d eat those bits one by one).  I have some weird food combinations although no current ones that I can think of. But even as a kid I would mix the weirdest shit together.",False,False

I hate wasting food. Idk if the others are weird, but I always use the same plate. I have my own plate in the house, and everyone knows that I am the only one allowed to use it. Same thing goes for the fork and the knife. The only times I don't use that particular plate it's a binge day, because I feel like I don't deserve my pretty plate. I don't drink with glasses, I have my own bottle.  What else...I like to have my veggies placed in order by color when I'm cutting them, but I guess that's just me being a perfectionist. If I'm eating I must have savoury and at the end of the meal something sweet, always. That's what comes to my mind, I'm sure I do some other weird stuff lol",False,False

For ex I would nibble the skin off a pickle, then suck the seeds out of the pickle, then eat the actual pickle.

Idk if it’s because I’m super cheap, don’t believe I deserve good food, or am afraid to see it go to waste but avoid eating it until it’s out of date but then feel obligated to eat it because throwing it out is a waste of money. Last week I ate sausages that were a whole month out of date.  Do I like the risk??? So I want food poisoning???   Maybe.",False,False
