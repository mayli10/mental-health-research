One of my best friends was an atypical anorexic who was overweight or obese, but her anorexia was absolutely valid and no one took her struggles any less seriously than anyone else. A lot of girls were a normal weight, and some of them were among the sickest, because eating disorders are mental and not psychical illnesses. Of course, there are gonna be extremely underweight patients. It's gonna be triggering. But just try to remember that it's not your body that defines your ED, it's those messed up chemicals in your mind. Good luck, OP &lt;3",False,False
