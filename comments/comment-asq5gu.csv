Yeah I'm going to try making myself a little crazier about drinking calories. Frankly I wonder how okay that'll be for me? I was still (slowly) losing while drinking almost daily, though usually no more than 2 or 3 drinks. ",False,True

I've stopped drinking because every single time I fucked up real bad. Turns out low restricting + bad mental health + alcohol is a terrible combination. ,False,False

The first is not really a healthy reason to give it up (considering my background): the calories. All the calories and the fact (/possible myth?) that alcohol temporarily slows down your metabolism lent it the same anxiety that any other unsafe food or drink would get. The second was that I latched onto caffeine in place of alcohol. I actually think I enjoy the buzz of caffeine more than being drunk, and I certainly make less of an ass of myself. For instance I would grab a monster zero whenever I knew I was gonna be around people drinking. If you don't like energy drinks I'm sure coffee or soda or something could just as easily replace it.  Anyways, best of luck to you.",False,False

I'm feeling a little better now (thank you rock star recovery). Thank you for the kind words.   If you don't mind me asking, what strategies did you use to help give it up. I usually have a decently strong willpower but apparently not with booze.  ",False,True

Don't beat yourself up too bad, everybody makes mistakes. The difference is you care enough to make changes to rectify those mistakes. That sounds like a good person to me! Feel better ",False,False
