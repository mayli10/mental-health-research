Laxative abuse can cause major physical problems and is obviously a symptom of a larger issue.   I'd look into eating disorder clinics and resources near you so you can be ready to offer them. Your general doc might be a good place to start, too.   Approach the subject with only love and support. Try to resist assumptions, judgments, accusations. My reaction is not to get mad with this sort of thing, so it's hard for me to know how she'd react.  This is how I imagine you could start the conversation: ""I want you to know that I love you and I'm here to support you in any way I can. I accidentally found several boxes of laxatives. I am concerned for your health/happiness.""  /End. It's not about assuming why she's using them, accusing her of an ED or hiding something from you, or even asking her any questions about it, just letting her know that you care. There's nothing for her to get mad about here.  Hopefully, that will be enough for her to consider beginning a conversation with you or at least a doctor. Has she ever seen a therapist?",False,False

Maybe say she hasn't seem that happy lately and if there is something that is bothering her? See how she responds and the take up the diet thing? It might not work at all, but might give you a chance or at least plant a seed to the possibility. My best friend did this to me and although it took about 6months or something until I actually started to admit I had a problem/ask for help I think it planted a seed for me. Good luck, it's hard and you sound like an amazing husband!",False,False

I think you should tell her that you love her and that you want her to know that she can talk to you about anything. Maybe say that you get a ""vibe"" from her that everything isn't alright. Focus on support, not on snuffing out the dangerous behavior because if someone is in a bad place and their avenue of coping with it is being threatened, they'll move onto something else that could be worse (or they'll get better at hiding it).  &amp;#x200B;  She may also not be abusing them for diet reasons, but might be doing so simply because she has a chronic issue - some people legit take lax for so long that they essentially fuck their GI tract up and can't NOT take them anymore.  &amp;#x200B;  Edit: If you feel she's in a better place eventually, bringing up your concerns might be okay. But if you know she's going to respond defensively, confronting is a bad idea. That's all I mean. Not that ""naaah, just let her stew in her destructive behaviors forever"" - just that you seem to know her well enough to know an intervention isn't going to work \*right now\*",False,False
