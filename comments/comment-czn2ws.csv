Like, you can't possibly be disordered if you weigh above X, or eat more than Y calories, or do/don't engage in Z behaviour. It's like, great, you know you're just encouraging people to get worse so that they'll be able to get SOME recognition/help/support, right? It's ignorance at best and malicious crab-bucketing at worst.  OP, if you're looking for help/support, then you're sick enough. Stay strong xo",False,False

Me: still struggling to eat. Therapist: you look so good for someone whom claims to be not eating much and not sleeping well. Like... I can't even notice anything is wrong with you!    Me:.....       &amp;nbsp;  Also me when looking in the mirror 30 mins later:     'someone needs glasses and it ain't even me. I do look like shit. My eyes are blueblackish from my brows till the bags under my eyes that I did not use to have. I have lost my red-faced  'angry' look, because I am pale.'    These stupid comments that make me think I should be sick enough first before recovery are just that. Stupid comments. Comments from others or the sick voice in our own heads.   Everyone deserves better.    In my heart I know I don't deserve the punishment I put myself through. This torture.        &amp;nbsp;  I decided I will stick with those stupid commenters for meds and Im gonna pay out of pocket for a therapist to actually listen to me and help me. Not one whom tells me I don't even look sick. Or whom interrupts me in the middle of my sentence about how scared I was yesterday when I saw a family member for the first time since long. Just to ask me a question that popped into their head and never come back to the topic of me meeting with the family member.      &amp;nbsp;  If you are sick, you are sick enough. You wouldn't tell someone with a broken leg to wait till it breaks some more? Or stump on it. You would get them help.   Truly no one knows you better than you. And as cruel as it is, as hard as it is. You will have to do it for yourself because it is a lonely disease. Most people don't understand. Most of the people whom want to help will say all the wrong things and urgh you can love em but oil is easily added to ed fire.  (good to realize that). Finding help is important. If your appendix needs removal you ain't gonna wait till you get bronchitis too.     You are valid. You are worthy. You are deserving.   And I'm sorry for the whole speech haha, just wish someone would have told me to be much more steady and true to my own beliefs in myself and how I knew what treatment I wanted but let myself get talked out of because I always believed people whom said I looked too good. Or I was too (fill in) for (fill in).     No one knows you better than you do.   And if you don't feel sick enough, you should realize that that also is a symptom of being sick. ‚ô•Ô∏è.  &amp;nbsp;  Have a great day/night/week.",False,False
