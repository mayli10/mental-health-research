It makes a lot of people suffering feel like they are doing it ""wrong"" somehow. But like, you wouldnt tell a person with a burst appendix that it burst wrong because it didnt hurt as much as it did for you. Like mental illnesses are still illnesses and I think most of us for get that diagnostic materials should just be a general outline and that each person experiences different things.  Anyway, I dont know if you need to hear this but your suffering is just as valid as someone who doesnt have the physical limitations you do. If anything, maybe when you move out of this stressful time you'll be glad you couldnt ""properly"" fall back into old habits because it reduced further harm to your body.  Much love &lt;3",False,False
