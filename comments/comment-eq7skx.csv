Maybe it sounds sneaky or whatever but if she even knows it exists then that might cause problems (it depends on her and her own progress in recovery). Donâ€™t keep it in a common area of the apartment,False,False

I would prefer not to know.  Meanwhile... I have a scale in my bathroom because my boyfriend uses it. I didn't even want to replace my old one when it broke. ðŸ™ƒ,False,False

It doesn't take much more effort on your part. Very thoughtful of you for sure! I wouldn't bother having a conversation with her about it. She might not feel comfortable saying 'please don't put it in the washroom'. So I'd say just keep it in your room :),False,False

Everyone is different, and itâ€™s hard to know how an individual would react. You seem like a wonderful friend, and the fact you have hesitation is very caring of you. Iâ€™m sure you would be able to have a heart to heart with her and gauge her feelings appropriately.",False,False
