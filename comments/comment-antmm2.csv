The majority of guys do like thin girls, even if they try to be *hip* and say they like girls with a bit of meat on their bones. Maybe they do also like thicc girls, but they like thin girls too. I really wish it would stop guys from being attracted to me, but that's just not how it is...  And I feel like old dudes are the worst for it. Like they either grew up or were middle-aged while thinness was becoming the trendy body type, so they don't feel a little bit of shame ""complimenting"" you on it. I literally had a guy who must have been 60 or 70 in my DMs hitting on me by saying things like ""women my age aren't as thin as you"". Like yeah sure shaming other women for their weight is going to make me feel good.",False,False

I told security about a situation and they radio/paged all the security officers at the mall for lookouts. They didn't press me at all and after a couple questions I went my way. It's shockingly common scary creeps",False,False
