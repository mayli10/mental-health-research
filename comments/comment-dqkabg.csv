You deserve to feel safe in your home. Its not some weird way of the universe punishing you for binging, it's just that the world just sucks sometimes :(   I hope you feel okay emotionally and physically (in sure your hand hurts!) and can get some rest.",False,False

I can’t have the window fixed until Monday so I’m gonna sleep on my couch in the living room but I honestly might be sleeping there for a while, just walking into my room makes me anxious. I also initially thought it was a gunshot that broke the window (gotta love America) so that freaked me out a lot and now I just imagine someone trying to shoot me through my window. I will definitely need to see a therapist or something I’m kinda traumatized",False,True
