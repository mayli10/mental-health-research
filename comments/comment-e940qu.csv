Waking up early like that is caused by stress (i.e., high cortisol levels) more often than not, and those with EDs tend to have high af cortisol.",False,False

I started taking CBD and the problem literally went away almost overnight.   I recommend taking it right before bed and throwing on a podcast so you can fall asleep gently to a comforting sound.,False,False

That might be the culprit.  Plain old hunger does this to me too though. Sometimes Iâ€™ll just eat half a banana or some applesauce because it helps me fall back asleep and doesnâ€™t mess up my calorie count much.,False,False

And that stress will not only make it harder to get back to sleep, but you'll start worrying about it before you go to sleep which will disturb your sleep further. Vicious cycle.   What're you doing when you wake up? Just lying there won't help. Read. Listen to some relaxing music or an audio book. Try and relax your mind.  If you're concerned it's hunger, maybe adjust your meal times so whatever it is you eat and keep down last is closer to when you go to sleep.",False,False
