When I told my therapist and doctors that the 25mg was too much, they told me to try taking half. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be fine. I have heard of people taking half and of people who have to take more (advised). I would never up a dosage without approval, but I think decreasing is okay in this circumstance because you haven‚Äôt been on it long and atarax isn‚Äôt a medication that you have to taper off of either.
