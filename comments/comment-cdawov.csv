Ugh this whole comment feels humble braggy but I'm not trying to. I have two sisters, my family made it clear to us I'm ""the pretty one."" People tell me I'm cute, I think I'm in that same approx ""rating"" zone as you, and the ""wish I could be a 2 so I don't have to compete with 8s"" resonated so hard I almost fell out of my chair.  I know that people are statistically nicer to thinner and prettier people, etc. ""grass is greener,"" downsides downsides.  If you're attractive, it gets you **attention.** There are valid frustrations on both sides, but that's a specific frustration it's hard to compare directly. You get constant, irritating attention. Sexual attention, out-loud-comparing-you-to-another-girl attention, people asking you for advice when you just got lucky with your face bones... just... strangers are up in your business.   There's a type of expectation created by being attractive or thin, so now if you ever ""slip"" some it's topical. I've seen people look up old acquaintances on Facebook and basically rejoice that they ""got ugly"" or gained weight. Feeling involuntarily invisible is awful, I haven't had it in this context but others so I can't imagine it all the time (there's even a whole Buffy episode about it being hard). But *never* being invisible is awful too. I can't go to the store in no makeup and leggings and get like diet soda and laxatives without some old man being like ""let me carry that for you."" Dawg, you're like 90. I could probably push you over. There's times I definitely wish I could experience that invisibility and like you said, stop feeling pressure to ""compete.""",False,False

Seems like no one is ever happy. Helps to remember that everyone has something theyâ€™re insecure about. And the shit weâ€™re insecure about doesnâ€™t matter most of the time. Go ahead and tell someone who loves you what you consider your worst physical quality and they would definitely tell you they donâ€™t see it that way.   You should be more kind to yourself. You wonâ€™t feel the need to judge others when you stop judging yourself so harshly. When you are comfortable with yourself, you wonâ€™t need to compare and rate yourself against everyone else in the room. Itâ€™s hard to do and takes practice but donâ€™t let yourself get wrapped up in shame whenever you catch yourself feeling this way. If you beat yourself up over it, you are not being kind to yourself, which feeds into your inner self-critic. When you feed the fire of love within yourself, eventually it grows big enough to shine a light on everyone around you.",False,False
