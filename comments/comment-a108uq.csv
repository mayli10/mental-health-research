I am normally overly emotional and very reactionary to things. To a frustrating level. Now I don't really feel much and I find it odd to say the numbness to virtually everything makes me really happy because my everyday existence isn't bogged down my the noise of my feelings all the time anymore. ,False,False

No happiness, no sadness, no fear, no guilt, no shame, and it felt confusing but I felt no empathy either. I didn't care about anything, and it was amazing tbh. It's heaven compared to feeling emotions when none of the emotions you're feeling are positive. Like sadness, worry, fear, low self-esteem and self-loathing and the like. I really miss not feeling any emotions. I was alive but mainly just ""floating"" through it all",False,False
