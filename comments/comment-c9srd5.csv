It's just an OCD thing with me. I don't like how my skin touches and how certain parts look. Like, when I started growing boobs, I wanted to just cut them off ðŸ¤·",False,False

I think my ed mainly stems from need of control and is a form of self harm. Losing weight gives me a sense of satisfaction because Iâ€™ve achieved a goal, not because Iâ€™ll be more accepted or prettier to others or whatever.",False,False

I just want to feel comfortable and like what i see, even if it's just a little bit.   That and control, obviously, since i have no control over my mental state, i can at least control how much i weigh.",False,False

I don't have a great face so the only way I can be pretty is by being skinny, to me. It's been an obsession of mine since probably 4th grade, to be one of the pretty girls who gets to wear all the cute crop tops and cutoff shorts and never have to look far for boys. Not that it worked though, I'm still massive and hideous Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯",False,False

It's almost become less about specifically losing weight and more about the little voice in my head constantly berating me anytime i fuck up and telling me i should starve.",False,False

I have health issues that get infinitely better or disappear entirely at a healthy weight. I'm currently hovering at the upper end of healthy BMI, and every time I cross over to lower overweight BMI I feel it right away. The problem is that I'm having trouble finding balance and not letting weight management and maintenance consume me. And that's its own Pandora's box.  That being said, I still feel inferior if I see someone with the body I imagine I would have if I were at their weight (even if it's completely ridiculous and irrational and they're actually my same weight, just different shape).",False,False

Like I dont really care what others think of me nor do I want to look like others. Itâ€™s more of the fact that I have my own idea of what I want my body to look like and Iâ€™ll do anything to get there. Itâ€™s weird.,False,False
