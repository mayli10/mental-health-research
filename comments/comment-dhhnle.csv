I do still get irritated near the crash at such a low dosage",False,True

Those little miracles are the only things that keep me sane. They have a much""cleaner"" feeling than Adderall meaning that you don't get the drastic ups and downs even from a delayed release and you get none of the bodyaches.    As for weight loss, it definitely curbs your appetite but since the delivery is stable, you don't feel as jittery as you do with adderall so it makes day to day activities easier. I can do cardio and drink coffee and not feel like I am going to have a heart attack.  As for personality, I am a lot happier and more productive because it helps my brain fog so much!Since it helped with my adhd I am also less frustrated by little things and have a more positive outlook.  I will say make sure you pay attention to how you feel on your dosage, when I was on a lower dosage I would notice a drop in mood in the early evening as the meds wore off so I got a higher dose and it worked well for me. I take 60/mg and I also EC stack midday and feel great. I hope they help you feel better!",False,False
