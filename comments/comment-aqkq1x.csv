It feels I'm stuck between being not-fat but not-skinny either and my arms (enough fat to warrant an E cup) and thighs (sorta okay) are fleshy but my calves and forearms are bony. I'm losing from my torso too (chest bones?) and the sides kinda but I still have the belly pooch and at this point I don't even check for bloating.   Just take advantage of it still being winter, be more careful and aim for optimal pillow usage and just relish the bone-sticking-out feeling, j guess? ",False,False

My BMI is between 19-20 right now (ya girl ain't weighing herself) and the butt bones, the shoulders, the hip bones - it's all so uncomfortable/almost painful! Even jeans stretching over my hip bones is weirdly uncomfortable. Sitting for extended periods of time, lying on my side - all painful.  And I seem to have banged my butt bone (left buttcheek) today and ugh it hurts. At least I hope I banged it somewhere and I'm not falling apart.   Good luck to us both ðŸ˜­ ",False,False
