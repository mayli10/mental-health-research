I won't tell you not to, cause we all know how well that works. But drink a shit ton of water and be prepared to feel like shit. Literally lol. I get all cold sweaty, feverish and feel like I'm going to puke when I take lax. It's not a fun time. Make SURE you have access to a bathroom for a good 30 minutes straight. I'm not kidding. It might be tmi, but yeah, it's not fun. And that's just short term effects. Maybe try miralax or something more gentle if you decide to go down this road. Idk. I don't want to say ""stay safe"" or whatever, but be careful.",False,False
