It is just safer to keep those kinds of comments to yourself, as you never know how someone will take them. In my case, knowing the hell Iâ€™ve gone through to lose weight, I see it as a compliment. My logical side knows that the comments were made out of a place of concern and not meant to be encouraging, but my ED brain is letting it add fuel to the fire.",False,True

It is why you should never  mention weight loss or gain at all to someone you know or suspect is dealing with an eating disorder.  As a general rule ( because you never know who is dealing with it) you should never comment on people who lose or gain weight, the focus should be on if they look healthy or happy, not skinny or fat.",False,False
