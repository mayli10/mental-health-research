My sister was always a bit larger than me (and very tall) so especially next to her I looked like I was a skeleton. I didn’t have any unhealthy relationship with food. I often had people asking me if I was anorexic too. My metabolism and size had probably to do with the fact I was born very early so I was a tiny baby tiny child tiny teenager. My mom would try to put extra butter on everything I ate to keep me from being underweight.   Well guess what, I went to college still ate all the crap in the world. All of sudden I was 24 unhappy and gained weight like a normal person and I couldn’t figure out what do with that. Like I was told my entire life “I was so skinny” and “oh you’re so lucky you’re skinny” and “oh I wish I had your body you can just eat everything don’t you?” Aaaand my ED was born.",False,False

I do think that there are naturally skinny people but it's just because they naturally eat less and probably don't have a fucked up relationship with food. My bf has a 15-16 BMI and it's just because he gets full quickly and forgets to eat half the day. That's just what his body is used to and he doesn't intentionally do it.",False,False

When I met him he had a BMI of like 16.91 but he’s put on like 20 lbs in the ~5.5 years we’ve been together bc I make all of his meals and lay out his breakfast and lunch for him to take to work and pack snacks in his lunch box so I know he’s eating enough  If I went out of town or I don’t make dinner one night he just forgets to eat. He just doesn’t care about food whatsoever. He finds eating to be a chore.  On the other hand, the only time I’ve been at a healthy weight (&amp; not underweight) was when I was pregnant. All of my life I did competitive cheerleading and was really muscular and I was still like 3 lbs underweight. I ate a bunch of junk food, I’d eat sooo much candy, chips, icecream, soda all the time in addition to meals. I was always hyper aware of my body and cared how it looked and thought I was fat a lot of the time but I never did anything about it and it didn’t effect my eating habits. I just ate to my bodies hunger cues (which I had higher calorie needs bc of cheerleading but that doesn’t make someone not “naturally skinny”).   Now I’m super underweight bc I’ve lost muscle since I graduated high school and after having 2 kids but I’m obsessed with food now. Getting pregnant twice and having to lose the weight and learning about calories fucked up everything for me. I’m really scared to try to go back to just eating normally and not count calories or obsess about everything I put in my mouth but hoping eventually I can go back to that and maintain my weight like I did the first 23 years of life",False,False

I know teens just have a higher metabolism as they’re still growing so they burn more calories as a baseline and along with your sister’s exercise it makes sense. In college I gained some weight from eating out and drinking almost on a daily basis. I was still at a normal BMI (but definitely skinny fat) and didn’t look like I could eat as much as I would when we went out (I would frequently keep pace with my larger guy friends to where it became a thing and we would jokingly compete). But what I noticed was my body would self regulate and I would eat very little after periods of eating a lot, whether because my stomach hurt a lot, I got nausea, I got really busy with things that didn’t involve food, or because I skipped a meal because I genuinely wasn’t hungry.   Now I eat so much healthier and try to restrict and just end up maintaining...",False,False

She ended up having a heart attack at 48 though, and the scan showed that all of her major organs looked like someone who was morbidly obese for years, she was overeating terrible food and rather than putting any weight on externally her body was just shoving it into her organs.  Idk I'd happily die from heart disease in my fifties if it meant I could eat pizza every day and still be skinny.",False,False

I don’t want to make her feel bad so I always just agree but I’m living with him I see that he really doesn’t eat that much, he’ll get 4 beef grillers at Taco Bell and eat maybe 2.5, which is nothing for a 6’2” man.

She can't eat dairy or eggs without getting sick, and still gets sick regularly after eating. Like, shakes, hour in the bathroom, lethargic for the next day. Her body just won't let her eat. No sports in her life. Constancy riding the line between underweight and normal bmi.   Could you fake not being able to eat a bunch of food, and get ""sick"" randomly anyway? Yeah, except she hates it. She has said, privately after years of knowing her, how insecure she is about her weight. She doesn't feel adult or womanly. She's afraid her body won't let her have a pregnancy, which she wants more than anything. She drinks 500 calorie nutrition shakes every day.  So yeah it's possible but I think it's literally like one in 300 people or something",False,False

I had a friend who constantly munched on a lot of junk but she never went ham and ate the entire thing. She shared a lot, would snack on it here and there. To a normal person, that friend may appear like she ate *alot* because she was constantly eating (unhealthy junk too) but she just ate less than normal portions, thus, giving the illusion of *omg she eats so much, all the time yet is so small and skinny*.  Edit: also if you look at certain korean mukbangers like banz etc. their bodies are designed to put on muscle before fat so overeating does lead to weight gain but the weight is *muscle* not fat so visually people can’t tell the difference since muscle is leaning whereas fat gain makes a person look pudgy. (Also I must note, banz went to an athletic high school and worked out 8hours/day so he can eat the exorbitant amount that he does on camera, but overall he does have a larger appetite than the average person).",False,False
