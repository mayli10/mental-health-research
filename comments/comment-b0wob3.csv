After a while I got to the point where I would eat solely to purge. It has screwed up my teeth, my body, my life, everything. My family thinks I am disgusting. I know the feeling and the appeal, but fight it if you can. I know if I didn't fast every other week (5-6 day fasts, just water) I would be gaining weight. Right now I lose at a rate of less than half a pound a week, and I gain most of it back every b/p cycle. It will not help you lose weight, and I urge you to find another coping mechanism.

I remember writing in my journal about it- said ""it was easy.""  I also remember feeling surreal and satisfied.  Just like that, my anxiety went down the drain.    It's been almost 8 years since and I'm still purging, but I never got thin from it.  Maybe you're the 1% that manages to lose weight from purging, but maybe you should try using that luck somewhere else if you are. (: It's widely acknowledged that purging helps people stay at maintenance at the most, because you gotta eat to purge. And sometimes when you eat, you're not at home- you're at the mall, at a restaurant, in class, at work.  It sucks.  I like the exercise option.  Exercise isn't punishment for eating, it's a celebration of what your body can do.  If you could once run 7 miles, you can do it again because you are strong.  Plus this time getting up to 7 miles will be easier than you first started, because you have the foundation of doing it once before. (:",False,False
