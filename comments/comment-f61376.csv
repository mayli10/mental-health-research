And that’s the point where I’d say I went too far with trying to lose weight. From then on, it was like, “I guess a *little* starvation wouldn’t hurt, right...?” And before long I was eating &gt;!&lt;1000kcal!&lt;, sometimes as low as &gt;!200kcal!&lt; while occasionally fasting for &gt;!24-48!&lt; hours, depending on what my family allowed.",False,False
