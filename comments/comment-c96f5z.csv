Alternatively, get some long length tank tops/t shirts to wear over the more sheer pairs. That's what I end up doing!",False,False

It will conform to the body and whatever it's wrapping around! Panty liners showing is just what happens when you wear leggings or yoga pants.  Try no-show panties, thongs work too, or lululemon's namastay brand underclothes made for yoga pants.
