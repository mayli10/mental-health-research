But fuck, I don't know how so many ED people consider protein bars a safe food. Like hahahha, they're a preferred binge food for me; on the same level as things like cinnamon rolls and ice cream.",False,False

What's been working for me is bringing my floss/toothbrush to the table with me and immediately after I've hit maintenence calories for the day I floss so I don't let myself eat anymore, but I'm sure you'll find your own methods eventually. I believe in you, you will overcome this one day at a time.",False,False
