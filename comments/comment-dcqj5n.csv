That being said, having my daughter really motivates me to get better, deal with everything I have to deal in order to get better, and, in my quest to model healthy eating habits for her, learn those healthy eating habits myself. She's only two, but I make it a point to not talk about any of these stuff in front of her, sit down at a table to eat, and when I have gotten bad I have kept it ""secret,"" so to speak.  So in short, it really motivates me to get better, and be well.",False,False

Well fuck you, you won't. [Three days later] Is this really the example you want to set for your daughter? Eat everything. Now. All the Fall foods.
