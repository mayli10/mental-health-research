Because there is actually good information to draw from and discuss and debate. We need to be able to lean how to look at things critically. I think the attitude of never allowing anything in academia that isn't 100% accurate or proven is a big reason people are having such a hard time with critical thinking skills. Don't assume information you read/view is 100% accurate, draw from many sources, question things etc..",False,False
