Its at least kept me from purging 4 times a day and destroying my teeth. I find that the thinf i go for with it is carby foods too, i guess its cause they have more weight to them to chew and are easy to get all out. I always go for donuts and french fries and sandwiches. Its a disgusting habit but its progress from vomiting i guess",False,False

I do the same as you. I eat like 1/4 to 1/2 then just taste the rest and spit it into the trash. I do this once or twice a week if at all so it's not addictive for me either and it doesn't make me feel better just like I'm not taking in so many unnecessary calories.,False,False
