This type of surgery can be a big deal for people and something thats really important to them. You can use it as healthy motivation :3 The next year may suck, but it’ll be worth it in the end!",False,False

I just don't know what kinda help I can seek without tripping any alarms. Idk if they even will but I can't take the risk. Bottom surgery is the only positive thing I see in my future... Wanna get there as quick as possible. ,False,True

If it were me, I'd look into getting help to get through that year. Maybe therapy, support groups (there's online ones too), even reading books on recovery might be helpful. It seems like your main goal is to get bottom surgery, you can always get thinner later.  I'd hate for you to struggle alone and not get the body you want. ",False,False

At least I'm at a ""normal"" BMI, although barely usually, so if I keep it up I can do it. I wish you success with recovery, we can both do this &lt;3",False,True

I’m not even on HRT yet and I’m honestly afraid they’ll refuse me since I’m cruising at a 14.9-15.2 BMI. I’m not sure if I’ll be able to do SRS if it means gaining to a healthy range because that just is terrifying. Can’t give any helpful advice but hey you aren’t alone,False,False
