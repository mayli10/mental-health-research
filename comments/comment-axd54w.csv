When I came back from winter break and got on the scale, it was the same as before I left school to go home. Makes no sense right because I swear I had been over-eating. Apparently I had been eating at maintenance instead of starving and then bingeing. It's weird to look back and think 'omg is that what normal people do?' I don't want to speak for you, but I think its possible that after years of disordered eating patterns, we lose touch with what our body actually needs.  And the perceived weight gain is so so real. I think a lot of it has to do with the Body Dysmorphia that accompanies eating disorders and this kind of experience really highlights how we have no way of stepping back and objectively assessing how we look :(",False,False
