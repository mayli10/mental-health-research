My sedentary TDEE is fucking 1146 a day.  How.  How do I eat that without living on broccoli.  Throw in a desire to just eat chocolate all the time and you're screwed.  I hate being me.  I really hate it.  I'm always fucking hungry.,False,False

I know everybody is different but ED had me so convinced that somehow at 5'9"" I won't be able to maintain something like 130 unless I eat like... Not enough?

Thank you",False,False
