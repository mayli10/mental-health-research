I can say there're other reason more than just metabolism for Asian being so Skinny: diet(less process food, eat more veggies, portion size, eat less dessert or dessert less sweet,etc), culture.  1. **Diet:**  \- **Eating less process food:**  i don't know about other asian country but deep fried stuff, process food, frozen already cooked meal,etc is not a part of our tradional meal. We do buy fresh ingredient and then froze it but not frozen frite, frozen nugget, etc i would say my mom bought frozen frite like twice a year.   We don't have that much variety for process food except instant noodles, people prefer to shop in traditional ourdoor market, everything fresh. We usually bought fresh ingredient like veggie, meat,etc nearly everyday, may be 3-4 times/week. My mom would froze fresh meat to conserve it but she doesn't buy already frozen meat.  We also eat fast food for speacial occasion, if it was a quick lunch, breakfast, we would prefer our traditionnal meal : healthier and more affordable. Vietnamese quick breakfast is ""banh mi"" - contain a lot of veggies  \- **Eating a lot of veggies**  In Vietnam there is so much variety of veggies and fruits and a diverse way to cook it too. A tradionnal vietnamese meal would contain at least 1 veggie dish or 1 veggie soup, 1 stir fried veggie dish, sometimes we cook meat with veggie.   Every meal has  to contain veggies and we love our veggies. I live in France now and i'm craving for my vietnamese veggies all the time, i can't live without it.   \- **Portion size**  There is an experience proving that if people eat from a bigger plate, they would fill the plate till full and over eat thing.   We asian usually don't eat from a plate, we eat with a small bowl fill with about 100-130g of steam rice and then we take smal amount of food in our bowl, eat lil by lil.  **- Less sugar:**  ok, we put sugar in our food, not just dessert but then we don't eat a lot of dessert, our dessert is not as sweet as what i eat in France now. In vietnam, our dessert is fresh fruit, cake, pie or chocolate,candy is that popular, we eat it on speacial occassion too.   Some French dessert or sugary snack is crazily sweet for me and other viet people, we just can't handle that level of sweetness.   **2. Culture:**  Well, we have more pressure to be skinny in Asia, Korea is famous for the crazy kpop diet, people eat insect in China to lose weight. In Vietnam, we are not that bad but overall, like other asian country, dieting culture and fat shaming are popular here. You know, you gain some weight and your neightbor would straight up tell you you're fat (not saying fat/body-shaming is effective, it's not, i was body-shamed my whole life, never lose any pound from it, i lost weight because of depression and go to the gym to recover from it along with changing my eating habit)  From a mild level, as everyone is skinny, it's mostly that if we gain some weight, we would eat a lil bit less, our diet is already healthy so no big deal. At least from now, i'd never heard of any extreme diet in Vietnam. My aunt was overweight so she lose weight by drinking dieting milk for dinner, the other meal she ate like normal. There are chubby/curvy girls in Vietnam and some people prefer it.",False,False

And I think she definitely doesn't eat all that she grabs, uses camera angles to make things look bigger, and exercises a crap ton more than most people. I just hope she isn't purging or doing anything unhealthy.",False,False
