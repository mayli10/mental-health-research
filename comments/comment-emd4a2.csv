Have a snack or two of cookies or chocolate or whatever a day and then after that if you are still snacks have a fruit or veggie. Really adding more fruits and veggies and lean protien and whole grains to your diet can do wonders for your body without even thinking of calories. Especially if you eat a lot of junk like white bread and pastas andpre-packaged foods or meals that typically contain a lot of salt and man made ingredients.,False,False

For me, it helped me lose weight, but also now all I see are numbers when I look at food. Sometimes it stops me from eating, sometimes it doesn't. I don't know if that's how a typical person thinks, in numbers, but it can help from under eating if you're a severe restricter.   I was using myfitnesspal to keep me from binging and try to decide which would be the better choice to eat to keep me satiated and not over eat later.",False,False
