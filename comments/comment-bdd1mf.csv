I see people of all shapes and sizes looking fucking flawless, glowing and just seem to be happy and comfortable in their clothes. I know what you see isn't everything, but it really hits home that I can't even pretend to be comfortable in my skin. Also, the look of their shiny hair, and clear skin is pretty undeniable in comparison to my shedding, sallow appearance. I don't know what their mental health is like, but just from an outsiders perspective these women look so...normal, and natural. I'm starting to realize a large part of me wants that and being all buddy buddy with my ED isn't going to get me there.",False,False

I was so thin and my acne was so bad, and my hair was falling all the time and looking like a mess. But at school, chubby girls had all the vibrant face and the clothes they worse just fit them perfectly. Their hair was so good and they were laughing all the time.  That’s probably why I started recovering. I have BED but I still haven’t gained much weight. I’m still afraid for my health and getting fat in the future",False,False
