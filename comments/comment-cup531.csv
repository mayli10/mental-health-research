Yesterday my sister got into a car accident and everyone was so nice to her (she destroyed the front part of her car) and I felt so jealous, it makes me feel so much worst thinking I’m so selfish and I have a terrible attitude towards my parents.",False,False

I also thought at some point that it happened because I was restricting for a long time (about 9 months) and since I had to maintain my weight I took the opportunity to eat more and note if my view (?) on sex had changed. It hadn't lol. As for hormones, I remember my doctor saying they were fine so I really dont know",False,False

But yeah, I have zero sex drive. I think it might be due to a hormonal disbalance as well as anxiety. Do you get your periods?",False,False

Honestly I feel like shit. I've self harmed since my girlfriend left for her holiday (unrelated to her going I fucked up taking my meds and the depressive/mixed episode hit me like a truck). I bought batteries for my scale and despite thinking I'd gained weight I've maintained (129.8lbs) and that makes me feel fat. Bought in a load of binge foods as well and am trying not to eat them.   I guess I just feel so alone.,False,False

I for one feel like a freak because I cant seem to be interested in sex anymore. I'm a 20 year old woman, I have a girlfriend which I've been dating for some time now, but due to circumstances we've never had sex and I dont think its gonna happen any time soon either. I dont talk about this and havent posted about this on another sub (especially one about sexuality) because I'll be told I'm asexual. Nothing wrong with that, honestly, but I used to be into sex when I was younger. I've never been sexually abused, my ""first time"" was not disappointing at all, so I dont think or feel like I fit into the ace space.  I just continuously feel fucking weird about it, plus, the whole hypersexualization of everything in today's society isnt helping. Am I like this because of crippling (but undiagnosed) anxiety? Is it the ED that's made me hate myself so terribly much that I cannot be seen even half naked by someone else? Who fucking knows, I just want to crawl under my bed and starve.",False,False

I already have the broken teeth from doing this for so long and looking at all the negative consequences from ED HELL while I’m gaining weight is SO PAINFUL.   so I feel u love bug hang in there!!!",False,False
