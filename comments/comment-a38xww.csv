I’m sure it’s the whey in the quest bars that’s getting my stomach grumpy. I really just need to eat less than 3. That seems to be the magic tipping point into gastown for me.   Thanks for the advice! It’s really helpful! ,False,True

Here's some pointers  \-Are you getting enough fiber? It can be found in the form of vegetables (great if you're a volume eater) or a fiber supplement if you can't bring yourself to eat a lot of vegetables  \-What kind of protein bars/shakes are you having? You may have trouble digesting soy or whey or whatever it is that's in them. Switching brands or taking a digestive supplement could help.  \-Do you eat meat? White meat and white fish are easier on most people's stomachs than protein supplements, and often have better macros.   \-In the meantime/if you don't have the energy to deal with this right now, an over the counter gas pill will help a lot.
