Tonight after the gym; my wife (a girl that has no eating disorder, and just ran the Marine corps marathon) I find her tonight in bed, crying because she is scared that this will be my third hospitalization.   With questions like: when will my dearest Ana take my life forever?   I am digging into my tool box to find anything to throw at my disorder-   HONESTY- is all that I have left-  “ the - good- the bad- the ugly”.  Just honesty-  As a person with Anorexia I can Suggest; it may be brutal to hear about my-intrusive thoughts. Please take a moment and help me- any any pace.  living with my intrusive thoughts and perpetuating them for so many many years. Is awful.   @Rivka90: I feel some of your calm, and peace vibes I feel something other than my intrusive thoughts; that’s REALLY GOOD! I feel love- that needs to outpour towards my family and even you (just a little- my wife and kids got 99.9%)! I feel about your friend; hoping and praying that they are ok too. Thank you for caring - out there in the void of the internet.  I REALLY appreciate your kindness and respect. -Hugs- BE WELL-",False,True

But I can make it through another day: just sitting here drinking hot sauce for lunch so I can just punish myself. Eating... talking... hospitals... fat...  it is all to much for me at this moment in time: hugs - don’t you worry I am sure that some fucking doctor will pump me full of meds and food soon enough-,False,True
