Also the foods themselves, the acids and sugars are damaging and by c/s you cycle a much higher volume through your mouth than regular eating",False,False

ebc2u9n,t3_a46lk7,t3_a46lk7,IkarosFalling,1,2018-12-07 21:39:36,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/a46lk7/advice_on_how_to_stop_weird_behavior/ebc2u9n/,This is fucked up but it's better in the long run to C/S then purge. It still fucks your teeth but doesn't fuck you esophagus or electrolytes. If it's harm reduction that matters... Try not bringing up food at all. I also compulsively brush my teeth after eating because my teeth feel so smooth and look so nice I don't want to dirty them again. ,False,False
