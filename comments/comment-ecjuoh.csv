Itâ€™s literally impossible to be gaining fat second by second. Yes you FEEL fatter but feelings arenâ€™t facts. I know itâ€™s very hard to battle these thoughts but you donâ€™t have to let it control you. Observe the feeling, donâ€™t let it overwhelm you, you are a cork bobbing on top of these huge waves of feeling. Sometimes you feel these waves swallow you but you will always bob back up above it. Remember that these feelings cannot drown you. They are not bad, or good feelings, they just are. With practice, you will be able to crawl to shore and observe these waves from a safe distance, but for now you will just have to ride the waves. You are safe. Youâ€™ll be okay. Youâ€™re not getting fat, I promise.",False,False
