Right now they are F but have been from G to DD from years of disordered eating. Gotta love constantly switching from rapid weight loss to rapid weight gain. My boobs are like large sagging deflated balloons. I‚Äôm having surgery in a couple years to fix them. I just hate having the extra skin on them and them being so saggy.,False,False

Coupled with the fact that I have a large rib cage I feel like my torso literally looks distorted compared to the rest of my body. I wish I could have my boobs removed tbh, I hate them",False,False

They're just small and not really noticeable. I kind of like it a little, but I wish they more boob-shaped. Usually people with a D cup have way fuller boobs meanwhile it barely looks like I even have any. It's too bad you can't just trade when you have something someone else wants and they have what you want.",False,False

I‚Äôve gained some weight recently and honestly the way I first noticed was because my boobs started feeling heavy in the morning, which was...new. Then I noticed that the band of my bra (just got it like 2 months ago) no longer touched my chest between my boobs, and that they were spilling out of the cups more than they should be. I wanted to throw up.   Personally I‚Äôve never been a fan of big boobs for myself, i love dainty breasts and think they look so elegant. I‚Äôve always been insecure about my boobs bc they look pretty grotesque, not only bc of their size, but they‚Äôre just all veiny and my nipples are way bigger than normal and I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôre inverted.  Anyway sorry for the rant, but I feel your pain üíï",False,False
