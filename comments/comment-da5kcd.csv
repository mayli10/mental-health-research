Most exercises are in the floor. I will warn you that I can’t even get through some of the holly dolke ones. They’re really tough.,False,False

Her workouts have my legs shaking and I was a figure skater so my legs are pretty buff from that. Also Gabriella whited has some great workouts( I am not a fan of her personality tbh but her workouts are amazing).   What you can also do is buy resistance bands, ankle weights and kettlebells. Walmart has heavy dumbells at cheap prices and you can start with like **2.3 kilograms** and move up as you progress. I only do these workouts twice or three times a week for like 20 minutes and my legs and butt are noticeably lifted. I managed to build a lot of muscle in my butt and has helped a lot.   I will never go to a gym. Home workouts are lit and they give you a nice firm body  that isn’t overly muscular.  _____   ^(I'm a bot) ^| ^[Feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=Ttime5) ^| ^[Stats](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=Bot_Metric&amp;subject=stats&amp;message=Sent%20this%20message%20to%20get%20some%20stats) ^| ^[Opt-out](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=Bot_Metric&amp;subject=Don't%20reply%20to%20me&amp;message=If%20you%20send%20this%20message,%20I%20will%20no%20longer%20reply%20to%20your%20comments%20and%20posts.) ^| ^(v5.1)",False,False
