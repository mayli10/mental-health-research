I don't know what supports you used to help with that but maybe start reflecting on that a bit? I only suggest that because you are realizing it is unsafe to run while restricting and that you feel like you are getting more and more stuck in your enjoyment of feelings related to fasting. IDK  I myself feel more productive when I restrict and I kindaunderstand the feelings you describe- I kinda ""chase"" the good feeling I get when I restrict too... but then I get kinda paranoid and even more fragile than usual after a while... When I feel paranoid I try to help myself realize that I should push myself to be nicer to myself ",False,False

Originally I was going to eat so that Iâ€™d have enough energy to complete my assignments. But then I completed my assignments even while fasting. And then I was going to eat as a reward for my productivity. But then I figured, my work is done, what do I need energy for?  I finally decided to break my fast this morning at 52 hours because the hunger pains literally kept me up all night lol. The few hours that I did sleep I was dreaming about getting rid of the pain. Iâ€™ve got to say, fasting made me forget how nice it feels to nourish your body. I also feel kind of high when Iâ€™m fasting, but itâ€™s because of the brain fog that I feel that way...eating made me think so much clearer and I felt much happier afterwards too.  Anyway, thatâ€™s a long way of me saying I relate to what you said, but donâ€™t forget to take care of your body too. Hugs ðŸ’“",False,False
