I am in my 30's and all of my back teeth are deteriorated and cracked, and I am missing a tooth from years of purging. My frount teeth are practically see-through. My esophagus is all messed up too and it took years for my stomach to learn how to digest again. I also had to have surgery to get a peice of small intestines removed, and my gall bladder removed, and suffered hair loss. Stomach acid is very powerful, you don't want that coming back up. The damage is irreversible. Not to mention that even the most dilligiant purgers can only get about 40% of the calories consumed back out. Also having to live with the guilt of all the wasted money/animal products going literally down the toilet.   I wish someone had told 15 yr old me this stuff, so I am telling you. Maybe then I would have chose a different path if I had known what I was really signing up for.  Get yourself a good dentist and prepare yourself fo loads of pain. ",False,False

Wait 30 mins before your brush. The rinse is alkaline and helps negate the acid from purging which will reduce the damage. ,False,False
