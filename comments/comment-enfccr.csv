I wouldn't say I have any more life experience than you do, in fact I'd say I've spent most of my time trying to avoid it.  I'll take the advice on fasting, I know you're right, it can just be difficult to eat sometimes. I'm sorry you can relate to anything I've said, it's not an easy thing to deal with or talk about, and I wish you all the best in finding the happiness you deserve in life too. I'm really grateful you took the time to respond, it means a lot to me. I'm sure it's going to be a process but hopefully we'll both work through this and find what were looking for soon.",False,True

I can't offer much advice because, frankly, I'm only 19 too and you likely have far more life experience than me.  That being said, practical advice: please please stop fasting. You are already probably well aware, but fasting just breaks your brain and you can't think rationally, let alone care for yourself in such a difficult and complex situation. If you can, just try and bump up to at least 400-500. Obviously this is still bad and totally unmaintainable but it'll help you at least have a stronger grip on the world. At least in my expierence, the longer I've gone fasting/low restricting the worse my sense of worthlessness and dysmorphia gets.",False,False
