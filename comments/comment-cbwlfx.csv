There's really nothing I can do about my suffering so having a community I can turn to at the end of the day helps a lot. When I'm not relapsed, going to these communities feels exhausting and just makes me feel worse, but I occasionally go on them to provide emotional support and advice to other users.  BUT. I also know I do a lot of self-harming online. I feel like this sub is a mix of both. On one hand, having this place to open up, seeing others struggling with what you go through, and having people that provide you with advice and support is amazing. But seeing others talk about how much they eat, how much they weigh, and stuff like that? It's super triggering and just makes me want to eat even less. I feel like the community was even more prone to harming others back when we were r/proed and allowed thinspo and had the wiegh in and daily calorie threads.  I had to quit r/proed to pull myself out of my last restrict cycle, and I had to stop going on actively harmful places like thinspo tumblrs and EDC. It helped a lot. But when I relapsed again, having this place to come back to helped a lot. So for me personally, how much this place helps or harms me depends on how I'm doing and what I need from it.   If you feel like being here helps you feel better and cope when there's no other possible way, then I'd say go ahead. It's better than being on pro ana boards if that's the other option. But if you feel like we're hindering your chances at recovery, please don't be afraid to let us go!",False,False

Despite the name it wasn't pro-ana--or it claimed not to be at any rate, but it was pretty toxic. The admin/founder literally harassed and stalked me when I was 17 (called my home phone, called my aunt at work, posted my full name and hometown online, etc). I don't know if it still exists.   If you are serious about recovery and online spaces aren't helping, an in-person group with a facilitator might be a good option. I would also suggest trying to find a therapist.",False,False

I did end up finding a great, more supportive, small (\~40 people) private online group that was a bit stricter about what was allowed. I actually ended up the forum admin for a while. However, after getting out of the hospital for the last time at the end of 2014 I did step away from online groups eventually, including recovery spaces. Any reminder of ED stuff, however positive, was detrimental to my recovery. But obviously that's not the case for everyone.",False,False
