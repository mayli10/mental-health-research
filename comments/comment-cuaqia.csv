I also on the petite side and about 19 bmi and there is this girl pretty much exactly my size who works out, she has a slightly higher bmi but looks the same (except maybe more toned). However no one would question that I'm small, and most people would say we are about the same size even though I am kind of a lazy blob currently.   The rest is body dysmorphia/ distortion which I definitely get sometimes when I'm bloated I start to feel chubby even though I know deep down I'm not. Don't worry it's not physically possible to be big whatsoever at the 19 range bmi, just like it's not physically possible to gain weight at &lt; 1200 calories. Physics is our friend :D very predictable no matter what we are going through mentally",False,False

I was morbidly obese, and I'm definitely not doing bad for an ex morbidly obese girl, my body looks better than it probably should, but the loose skin is a reminder of how I could have been if I had never gained weight growing up.",False,False

I am super underweight but have a paranoid suspicion that every other girl in my city also has a severe eating disorder because my body seems super average compared to all of them.,False,False

I see other people and I'm convinced they're skinnier than me and then I find out their BMI is 2-3 points higher than mine and I just can't believe it. It's maddening because I don't know if I'm actually that fat or if it's body dysmorphia messing with me,False,False
