A BIG cup of coffee or tea. Sit down with it and watch your Netflix with a fuzzy blanket. This always helps me because having something to consume while watching TV makes me feel more whole, if that makes sense.   Bonus: if itâ€™s a sweetened drink you can usually curb a bit of that late night craving. Low cal hot cocoa packets mixed with decaf coffee is my go to night time distraction!",False,False
