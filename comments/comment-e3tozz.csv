Being to heavy yes. Just because of big boobs no. And just as a note figure skating and gymnastics coachs do have one thing in common. It is better business for them to push their young athletes especially the girls to be thin and light. Unless I personally knew the coach I would not just trust their say so on things that involve weight gain. Because honestly to have huge boobs you either need the body fat % to be decent or implants. If the body fat % is higher then that extra weight is far more likely to impact the jumping ability then the boobs are.,False,False
