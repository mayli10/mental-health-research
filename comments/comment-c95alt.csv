I took your advice and I drove my cousins around after eating to distract myself. I'm  really sorry for your loss ): I want to be able to cherish my parents and their food before it's too late. . .,False,True

My mother passed five years ago, I would always get so annoyed with her trying to get me to it the food she made. I would give anything to eat something she cooked now. Enjoy your time with your family. You are going to college and getting older..cherish the time you spend with them!! Even if you can’t get yourself to eat much, try! There is so much more to your life than your eating disorder!!",False,False

For purging urges:  try to eat slowly and mindfully, fully chewing each bite, and then stop eating and switch to drinking water for a bit after maybe 20 bites.  Try and block your eating into small, manageable periods to give yourself lots of time to notice once you are sated, but before getting actually full.  If you don't get the full feeling, it will be easier not to purge.",False,False

I’m assuming this is the last time you’re seeing your family for a while, and you should cherish these last memories with them :) it’s also fourth of july, please go celebrate!! one bad day isn’t going to ruin your progress forever, go spend time with your family!! and good luck in college :)",False,False
