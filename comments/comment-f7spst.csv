And then really never  mind the same stranger 4 times in one morning ! but I just kept reminding myself that itâ€™s ok, they are professionals, also I canâ€™t really control it and Iâ€™m trying to get better which is why Iâ€™m there. I only wish I could flush the toilet on my own ðŸ˜‚ like I promise Iâ€™m not flushing my meds or meals and we both know it wasnâ€™t a #1",False,True

Iâ€™ve been in the exact same situation, and Iâ€™m sure like half the other people on this sub can relate too. Itâ€™s embarrassing as hell, but I promise you that staff member has 100% been in that exact situation at LEAST once before.",False,False
