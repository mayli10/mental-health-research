I think that food isn't numbers, it's nourishment for my body and try to focus on the nutrients I'm getting from the food. Honestly, the best line that I use comes from megsy recovery on youtube- ""feel shit and do it anyway"".",False,False

I would pick some foods that you really enjoy and try to add them back in. For me, porridge and bananas have been my go to foods when everything else feels difficult.  &amp;#x200B;  I totally get the water thing too, I've had similar freakouts. It helps me to remind myself that my body s not meant to stay at the exact same weight throughout the day, and water will pass through my system and I'll go back to the weight I was before I drank it. I also remind myself that hydration helps me to feel better and keep my physically stable.",False,False
