In Australia we have different labeling laws, and use kilojoules instead of calories, so most sugar free soft drinks are labeled as having 1.4-5kj (0.3-1.2 cals) per 100ml.   I personally don’t count of any of these to keep my sanity. I think it’s good for harm reduction and stops u getting too obsessed / feelin a little bit normal",False,False

Monster Zero actually has 11 calories but is shown as 0 calorie.   So I just assume it's 5 calories per 100ml. ,False,False
