It’s very common for identity to get tangled up in being seriously ill.   There can even be some appeal in hanging on the edge of life. People take care of you. Other people make all the tough decisions for you. You’re kept in a very safe environment. Expectations are very manageable. As much as I hate being in the ICU/psych ward/etc. I had to admit that part of me was also desperately seeking to fill some need through those experiences.  I also realized I had a lot of black/white thinking...either I was a perfect “good girl” or I was going to double down on being broken.  Entering recovery is often very uncomfortable. I have really conflicted and confusing emotions about it. Talk about them. Express them. Challenge them. Ultimately, I think it’s braver for me to try to make a new life than to continue circling the drain, which was painful, but in many ways low-effort. When my brain tells me I’m a weak POS for recovering I tell it thanks for the input but I’m choosing something different.",False,False
