The only other doctor they've let me see was a temp doctor (aka she's gonna leave soon, just filling in) and she wasn't interested in giving me my antivan refills after I said I needed them (the psych i saw prescribed them to help me eat) and refused to listen when I mentioned my BPD symptoms were getting worse. They just don't care. It took a lot to actually seek help but it takes them months to do anything if they even bother to believe you.",False,True

I'm so sorry she invalidated you and didn't consider discussing your prior psychiatry or eating disorder diagnosis. :(,False,False
