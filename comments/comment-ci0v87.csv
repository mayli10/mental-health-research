Why your uncomfortable, things he says that put you in a bad mind, things he could/should say instead, and ways you'd like him to support you, or could be supporting you better.   If he doesn't listen when you're ~~trying to~~  are be serious, if he isn't willing or going to try considering your emotions, then you should read up on some of the words of Dan Savage (nsfw columnist). Potentially going as far as to DTMFA (dump that mo~ f~ arsehole) if he acts like it.   Or if you genuinely like him (and he's improving, or making an actual effort to) get some friends (not mentioned by you) to build yourself an emotional support system.",False,False

Not wearing deodorant is repulsive. Not wiping your ass is repulsive. You existing in your body? Not repulsive. Your boyfriend probably said it without thinking and once you compared your body to the one he just put down, he felt bad and immediately told you he’s attracted to you to try and not make you feel like shit. When I’m having particularly bad episodes or relapses with my ed, I become very overly sensitive. I think most of us with an ed are like that, especially when we’re in sexual relationships with a person who doesn’t have an ed. I think you should explain to him what you explained to us, that you may say things about other people because it’s your ed brain talking and you feel comfortable venting (even though it isn’t fair to fat shame anyone). Tell him that it’s similar to when someone says “God I look so fat” when they’re thin in front of a fat friend. What does the fat friend do? Immediately compare herself to the thin friend and think, well if you think you’re fat then I must be obese. It’s not hard to be mindful, considering he’s aware of your ed.",False,False
