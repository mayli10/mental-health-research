Idk why but its more comforting to think of it as something separate from me that just takes over sometimes, because I know I definitely don't feel like myself but I'm also so numb that it's hard to tell, and I end up blaming myself for either failing to be a normal person or failing to succeed at the ed...which is stupid cause if I succeeded I'd be dead. A huge mindfuck for sure. I'm glad you found it helpful!",False,False

It totally makes sense. Makes you feel ‚Äúfake‚Äù so that you try harder. Makes it feel like a being or entity that‚Äôs in control.. EDs are wild man! ,False,False

Right before my wedding, I hit my almost LW (save about 2 pounds) and was close to a 16 BMI. I liked how I looked, but realized very quick that I couldn't maintain that low and still feel okay. Around the same time, my anxiety started going haywire and I also started running into some health problems (body aches, headaches, feeling weak, chest pains, an abnormal autoimmune blood test result). My mind automatically linked my low weight to those health problems, even though several doctor's visits and EKG's confirmed that I was healthy, at least concerning cardiovascular and vitamin/nutrient levels.   At this point, I've gained a little, but I'm still at a barely underweight BMI. In my head, I look huge, even though I know I'm realistically not. I'm in this weird limbo where I want to just get below 100lbs but I'm also terrified to get below 100lbs because my brain has convinced me that I'll definitely die if I do. I'm not sure why my anxiety has suddenly spiked but it's been hell for the past few months. So time being, I've been just hovering between the same 3 pounds, up and down, not quite recovered but not quite on a downward spiral. I panic if I eat below 800 calories, but I also panic if I eat over 1000. I can't win.",False,False

But do you blame yourself for getting sick with a cold or the flu more than once in your life? I know it's not exactly the same but it might help to think of it that way. 4 years of remission is no small feat though, you should be really proud. A little lapse or even a short relapse is nothing compared to that.",False,False

I never wanted to lose weight, but was so terrified of gaining weight that I ended up losing as a result. I very slowly got down to an unhealthy BMI (\~17.5) by eating in a pretty small but consistent deficit. Then my body gave up on me, I binged for like 1.5 months, and gained to a low healthy BMI. And now all I can think is how I have to get back to my lowest weight. :( I still never restrict below 1200 and am 100% miserable because I am constantly obsessing over food and can't enjoy any kind of a treat due to the guilt. I also struggle with not feeling like my ED is valid, which makes it more difficult to seek the treatment I need to recover. ",False,False

And now it's not anymore and I want to back out because I feel like I've wasted everyone's time and I'm just faking.   I expressed some of this to my therapist today though and she says no, I still need help, this is the disorder trying to trick me to keep it alive. It doesnt matter what I'm doing now, though she's glad I've made improvements, but this is going to take longer than I think because it wasn't that long ago that I was in a really bad place. One day it eating normally and not thinking obssesively and negatively doesn't mean I'm recovered - it'll take months, maybe years of that until I'll be okay.  Hang in there please. I'm going to keep fighting, you should too. I'll be thinking of you!",False,False

I am in treatment and trying to recover. But somehow I feel like if I let myself eat at maintenance, I'm going to be obese overnight which is absurd. Right now my treatment team is ok with me doing exercises but I'm afraid it will get taken away from me because I'm still losing weight and skipping meals. ",False,False

I fluctuate on being able to eat enough and I have a list of fear foods and situations that greatly limit my social interactions. I feel extra fake because I dragged my ass to my doctor and my therapist and even started with a nutritionist because when my relapse started I was going so HARD I felt I was spiraling out but now I'm just ..... Hovering? Like I stopped the crisis spiral like I intended but now I'm just in limbo. Not quite recovered not quite disordered enough to be DIAGNOSABLE again. And it just... Sucks.

I‚Äôm pretty happy with my weight and have little desire to be underweight. But I am terrified of gaining, and even gaining one pound makes me panic. And every time I lose weight the acceptable weight range moves down with it. I used to be perfectly happy at a BMI of 23, now I‚Äôm around 20 and feel a strong desire to not go above it. I still allow myself a generous intake and eat pretty normal outside b/p episodes which are not super frequent. But it‚Äôs still miserable. I couldn‚Äôt enjoy the holidays because I was afraid of gaining weight. I think about food constantly, I count calories compulsively. But I feel like I can‚Äôt/don‚Äôt have an eating disorder anymore because I don‚Äôt really restrict or have the same symptoms as others do or that I used to when my ed was severe. It‚Äôs a strange limbo and a very uncomfortable place to be. I go back and forth on whether i have a problem or not....",False,False

I'm well versed on the nutrition of body weight and body size and bmr and TDEE and cico and hormonal fluctuations and the biochemistry behind weight loss and gain.  it's the disordered fears and anxiety I can't seem to get rid of and it's frustrating because I've BEEN recovered I KNOW how to eat and remain relatively the same body size.

There are some calculators online that can help you with that but you'll also need to experiment a little. You'll lose if your intake is too low, you'll gain a little if it's too high. That's normal.  Besides that there is of course also  periods if you're a girl, which can make you gain weight. Don't worry period weight gain usually goes back off within a few days after period (at least for me it does).  Once you've figured out your BMR you can work towards eating that much. If you exercise you get to eat more than your BMR. ",False,False
