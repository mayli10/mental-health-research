Of course, I‚Äôm like BMI 22.something now so I have a big old pooch (: But I was running 3X a week with heavy restriction and got to just above underweight before it started being flat.  I am SUPER SHORT though, literally 5ft 0in, so it might be easier for a tall person",False,False

I teach anatomy at a medical school. The uterus is actually situated behind and on top of the bladder, so if anything it would be the bladder pushing the belly out‚Äîexcept it doesn‚Äôt do that either as these organs are both too small to be ‚Äúseen‚Äù from the outside in the manner you‚Äôre suggesting.   The uterus expands substantially when pregnant, of course, but until then is quite small and does not cause excess stomach skin.",False,False

Tight psoas can alter your posture ever so slightly to make your stomach stick out more than it should. Look up some yoga videos targeting the psoas and do them often.    We sit far too much nowadays and it contributes to this kind of thing. Give it a shot and let us know how it goes. It really helped me and tbh the limberness that came with it made me feel better in general.,False,False
