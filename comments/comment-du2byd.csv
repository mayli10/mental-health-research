The whole purpose was to get some rich guy to admit to being an arms dealer, before killing him. She dated him. Totally unrealistic scenario, but there were a few scenes of modelling.  It got me thinking about modelling, so here's my questions  How many full or part time models are there in your country?  What do you typically model, and what medium (television advertising, magazines, leaflets etc)?  How many modelling photographers are there in your country?  I'm trying to get a feel for the size of the modelling industry. Google searches aren't particularly useful.  Thanks!",False,False

I've had a lot of people say I could be one and have had photographers reach out to me, but nothing ever seems to happen. At the very least I see it as a way I could get a little extra income to support myself while I finish college, but I have no idea how it works.",False,False

My agency hasn't actually pressured me to lose weight yet, but I think it might come up soon. There are definitely more clients I would be able to attract if I were smaller. But I've worked with a lot of ""in-between"" (anywhere between size 0 and plus-size)/""plus-sized"" models who have had really cool, high-end clients!

As in, was it pressure from work to be skinnier or was it something else entirely? And do you ever think about if someone else uses you as thinspo?
