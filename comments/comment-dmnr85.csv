Like I need energy to workout but also working out makes me ravenous af, really canâ€™t win. Usually triggers a b/p but running is the only thing that keeps me mentally sane so itâ€™s like *what the fuck do you want with me. Let me be.*",False,False

Like if you run five days a week, maybe change it to three, and the other two days you can stay home and do low impact workouts like barre/pilates at night. So youâ€™ll have three days where you eat a bit more, and two where you eat your usual amount (while still exercising). This way you also give your knees a break, and barre/pilates make your muscles burn like crazy, so afterwards youâ€™ll definitely not be in the mood to eat.",False,False
