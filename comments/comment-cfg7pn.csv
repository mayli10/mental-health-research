We encourage people to share these thoughts as hearing feedback from other community members (like yourself!) helps us be more aware of how our ED's have warped our perception, so we can avoid making the same judgements in the future. That's how people can grow. Hence why both your comment and the original post have been approved.  Censoring this content won't help OP realise that their perspective is harmful.

Personally, anyone can experience dysmorphia and hate their bodies regardless of weight. Thin people suffer just as much with this. On the other hand, I think it's pretty disingenuous to say that ""skinny shaming"" is the same as ""fat shaming""- there aren't communities where people post pictures of skinny people and talk about how much they hate them or tell stories about how vain and disgusting skinny people are. It doesn't invalidate the suffering thinner people experience with body hate, shaming, and dysmorphia, it's just a different experience. I'm overweight, but I know that objectively people with BED who are several pounds heavier than me have it worse socially. It doesn't mean that my personal experience is any better though.
