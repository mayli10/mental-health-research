If you’re feeling ok and you’re enjoying being healthy that’s absolutely wonderful and I’m very happy for you.   I probably relapsed because only my weight restored but the psychological roots were not fixed at all.  To be content with your wellness sounds really promising and i wish you all the best. A shorter-lasting ED does not mean it was any less valid at all, it just means a recovery that succeeded sooner, before ED grew more ugly and hard-to-kill roots. It means success! Congratulations 😊",False,False

The thing is I don’t know if I see myself relapsing? Like I’ve come to have such fondness for not controlling my food as much (although I do restrain myself around my family and still do eat healthily) that thinking about doing it all over again sounds so tiring. But then again it’s like I guess I never saw myself getting so bad in the first place when I started “dieting” so it could happen.  But thank you so much it actually made me feel so much better!!! It’s so interesting that your first refeed was also incredibly easy (it felt good to eat a lot esp when I was skinnier and just beginning to refeed) ,False,True

I do seem to find recovery harder as I get older (and ED gets older) but the first time refeeding was much easier, too easy in fact. It’s the only time I overshot my natural weight (btw it did level out again, don’t panic!) and from reading posts on here it seems like this pattern is very common. Imo it’s because typically the first bout is the most hardcore (certainly was for me) which leads to rebound hunger.",False,False
