One of my close friends lost a noticeable amount of weight a little while ago and EVERY TIME i hung out with her, she'd inevitably run into someone who would gush over her new body. or like i'd be at her house and her mom would go into a ramble about her body and her weight loss and just. IDK. I don't know if she literally got nonstop attention over it or if it just always happened when I was around but it would make my blood boil.  It's good that you were able to recognize your hurtful comments, working on an apology letter is a really mature idea and I think your friend will really appreciate that.  EDs can be so cruel. They not only torment us, but they push us to do nasty things we never would do otherwise. I hope you start feeling better soon. &lt;3",False,False
