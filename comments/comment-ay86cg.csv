I'm sorry your parents are... Rude? Idk like you said, it's not right for them to hold your therapist over your head like that. And how are you even supposed to recover when your mom is making comments like that?? ",False,False

I had to stop seeing my old therapist that I could actually talk to and I got sent to residential for 5 months and then I got sent to this shitty ED therapist to do FBT which sucks ass. Then that therapist left abruptly (hopefully got fired because she made me wanna kill myself) and I got sent to a new one. Luckily but unluckily I am getting kicked out for making 0 progress in the last like 5 months so she can help someone who can actually get better.  &amp;#x200B;  My parents won't let me get a job or get my drivers liscense and they won't help me pay for college until my ED is under control. Like bro WTF.   &amp;#x200B;  But now I'm just being a little shit because I turn 18 in like 3 months and I got a job by myself and I'm not going to quit.,False,False

Im a minor in recovery and i'm pretty much dragged around to different appointments and stuff. I'm being made to see this psycologist and i've seen her like 4 times now and she just keeps asking me questions about how it all started, what made you start restricting etc and has done nothing to help me cope with it. I want to leave and possibly get another one but my dietician insists that i stay with her and i barely get a say in it.   Also, because im a minor my dad is in there with me when i see the psycologist and it makes me uncomfortable and i find it harder to open up to her.",False,False
