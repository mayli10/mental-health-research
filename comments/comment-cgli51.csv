As fucked up as it is, they're part of my identity. Whether I choose to hate them or accept them, they'll still be there. They've actually helped to attract the right people into my life since I've stopped hiding them.

Theyâ€™re a product of a lot of anger and self hatred, and I have to see them and be reminded of it everyday.

One night when I was seventeen I was sitting on my bed around three in the morning and Iâ€™d been crying because of how fat my thighs were. I impulsively got up and went to get a razor from the bathroom, and absolutely shredded my thighs. The scars are massive and deep and still thoroughly visible today, over ten years later. I didnâ€™t have any bandages and I couldnâ€™t tell anyone what Iâ€™d done, so I had to duct tape cotton wool to my legs for three days because they kept bleeding. One was so deep I could see the ridges in my flesh and genuinely thought I had cut deep enough to hit muscle.",False,False
