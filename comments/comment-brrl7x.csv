It's true that some people with EDs have partner who are trying to do what they think is right, but the way they act unintentionally does more harm than good. Unfortunately I think the reality is that many people with EDs are emotionally vulnerable and either consciously or subconsciously seek out abusive partners who will intentionally trigger their EDs because they want to continue their disordered behaviour, and they find that easier with external pressure from a partner. I don't think many of these shitty partners are well-intentioned.",False,True

I remember giving my hell girlfriend hell because she wanted to go get icecream while we were walking home. Its frustrating, because to me, her depression and anxiety were exhausting to deal with, and it was exhausting to see her beat her self up all the time. In my mind, I saw that her anxiety and depression were caused by her poor body image. I thought, all she needs to do is lose 20 pounds and this chapter can be behind her. She could focus on actually living life. But its like she never saw the light at the end of the tunnel like I did. She kept yo yoing. It was frustrating. It seemed like such a simple problem - you want to lose weight so badly, then just quite eating things that make you fat. In my head, it all made sense to me. Yet, in 3 years of dating, she could never keep to a goal. So, when she asked to grab ice cream, I was cold with her, and when she inquired, I told her how I felt. I see now that Ive been a controlling little twat my whole life, and Im grateful to have learned this lesson. I wish I could take back all the rude things ive done or said. I think maybe this situation is common for people with ED. People with ED like self-dicipline and probably seak it out in their partners. These partbers, being diciplined, may have achieved that characteristic by being (self or otherwise) controlling, cold and logical. They could also have achieved it through self love and passion, but my case was the former. Anyways, thats my 2c",False,False

I'm talking about *all* of this from the experience of someone who got out of a bad relationship, and my point is that the victims are stronger than what we give them credit for.  The entire MO of an abuser is to target someone who is vulnerable, likely because they have a much higher tolerance for BS *that other people do not innately have*. It's not normal to let people beat the shit out of you. It's not normal for your partner to tell you that you're worthless. That vulnerability is something that is learned and developed, and just as it was learned, it can be unlearned and these girls can have healthy relationships.

I deeply relate to finding wlw relationships more supportive than relationships with men because they can relate to what society expects of us. I like your first parenthes and I agree, wlw relationships are just as capable of being abusive. In this case what you're saying is less about men being abusive and just a general low-level of dismissal so many men hold for the problems women experience and their particular relationships with body image. Even well-meaning men can tend to assume that women are exaggerating or mistaken, or just not be able to understand/relate, which can get exhausting.  That said. I know you probably already understand a bit because you edited your post, but the ""dump your boyfriend, get a girlfriend instead"" mentality is still in your post, and still damaging for a couple of reasons. One, it perpetuates the stereotype that lesbians/wlw are ""predatory"" and actively try to turn women, especially vulnerable women who have just broken up with a man. Two, it suggests that sexuality is a choice, which is an old argument I think some of the younger LGBTQ+ crowd has not been exposed to as much, but it always circles back around to the idea it's possible to choose to be straight, to undergo conversion to become straight, etc.  Like I said, I feel like you know this already, on some level. And I don't want this to detract from your own personal experiences with relationships and your own feelings of validation and joy and relief (all good!! very good!!) dating women after dating men.

He knows that what he did wasn't okay, and he knew it wasn't okay before he did it, too.  You're right. He IS weak. He's weak he's weak he's weak.

Do you really think they enter into relationships being cruel and abusive from the start? They're nice and sweet at first, then slowly start pushing boundaries for how mean they can be, and vulnerable people are less likely to be confident in their self-worth. The abusive person is manipulating the situation to make them seem like they're in the right and the person being abused is left questioning their sanity, especially since many abusive partners swing wildly from abuse to affection, which lulls the abused party into thinking that they can still fix/save the relationship.  You sound like you think abused people choose to be abused, and that they're not already in a vulnerable position or being actively manipulated over a long period of time by someone they thought they could trust, especially when most abusers are able to act normal and caring around other people, so everyone else in the abused person's life is telling them things are okay. The answer to abuse is not ""well just stop being abused then"". Especially not when trying to leave an abusive relationship can be dangerous without a support network, something else abusers often cut out early before the abused person can realise what's going on.  I guess you feel like it gives you power over yourself, control over your own life, to think that abused people are abused because of a personal weakness or failing? And so because you don't want to be abused, you could never be in an abusive relationship? The truth is that anyone can find themselves in an abusive relationship. Nobody is ""safe"" just because they think ""I would never let that happen to me"". And if you ever do find yourself in an abusive relationship, it wouldn't be your fault, either.",False,True

I had already told him in the past to not share my medical information with my family. He then said well you didn't tell me not to share it (actually I did but you forgot)  When I told him how hurt I was over both those things, that I wouldn't be telling him any more of my medical information because I know he can't keep it to himself, that I cried on one of my classes at uni because of the fat joke (he said it whilst we were on our way to campus), he replied   'I give up'  okay. guess I give up too. I'm sick of being half-loved because he never fucking acknowledges that my ED is part of my worldly experience. I love him but he's so fucking stupid when it comes to giving any type of apology without a 'but!!'. I know he knows my Reddit username and I honestly hope he reads this. You treat me like SHIT when it's all of me not just who I am when I have my eating disorder under control. Fuck you. I went to your relative's funeral and held you when you cried and although said relative was pretty much a stranger I went to his hospital bedside and watched your whole family cry not knowing a single thing to do or say. I was uncomfortable but I loved you and stayed because you needed me. It's not a nice feeling meeting your extended family all at once at a funeral but I took it because I loved you.
