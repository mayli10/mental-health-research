I’m a grown up. No one gives a shit anymore about what I do. I was talking to my best friend about cutting (we’re both recovered but seriously self harmed back in the day) and about how no one gives a shit if we relapsed and no one would even try to help. Just push you away because they got their own problems to deal with. Which, is fair enough, my problems aren’t others responsibly. I dunno what the point of sharing this is. Maybe I’m just sad I’m not a child who can use destructive patterns as a cry for help.",False,False
