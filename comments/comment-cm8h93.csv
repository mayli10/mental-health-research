If so, ease find some neosporin etc to put on the knuckles and get some bandaid on it, and maybe make a cup of tea to soothe your throat, and maybe take a nap to help your body heal from that shock. A quick warm shower to wash off the sweat and ""reset"" your body temp, get snuggly, and just relax a little. It may seem ""wrong"" (it would to me) but times like this are when self care is most important (I would feel guilty for ""rewarding"" myself after a purge which is why I am saying that)  Also it's been a few hours so it should be safe to brush your teeth now if you havent already",False,False
