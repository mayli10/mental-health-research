I also find that watching tv/reading often makes me restless, I get distracted when doing art/colouring/knitting) but I really love doing sudokus on sudoku.com on my phone. It just really calms me down, in the same way like counting calories etc. ED stuff, but it's not harmful. It's actually really good for your brain/cognitive skills and I don't feel so guilty about it either. I usually also do it simultaneously if I eg. watch tv and it calms me down. I also like all kind of housework, esp doing the dishes, falding laundry and ironing. Different things work for different people, this is what works for me :).",False,False

So choosing all the colours for all the tiny bits is very absorbing.  But the main thing that helped me? And this is going to sound SO WEIRD....  **Dungeons and Dragons podcasts**  I had never played D&amp;D, and I didn't know anything about it at all, and then my friend suggested I listen to The Adventure Zone. I reluctantly tried it, and I swear to god that was the main thing that made recovery bearable for me. I hadn't laughed so much for years x) I STRONGLY recommend just trying one episode ❤️",False,False

I do feel like it helps. It keeps my mind off of wanting to eat constantly so I can finally focus on something else, something that makes me happy for awhile. Sometimes I have to start timers to remind me that I still have other things to do because I can get pretty lost in it. It can be repetitive, which I like and feel like helps me the most. But if you feel it being too repetitive you can always use multiple types of knots in one piece of work and I feel like that gets rid of the monotony of it, but then I have to pay extra attention to figure out where I'm at in the pattern. It's really all about finding what works for you:)",False,False

What I like about about crochet is that it keeps your brain and hands busy but if you mess up there's no real consequence because you can just pull the yarn to undo everything and restart. I find myself not even really making many things and just practicing different knots and unravelling everything to do it all again. But it's also nice because it's super easy to make a scarf or hat for gifts and people usually love them because not many people crochet anymore so getting something homemade feels special. I've also made a couple stuffed animals for family/friends' birthday gifts just by watching YouTube tutorials, which is a huge help in learning and there are so many good crochet videos out there. It's also really easy to just keep a ball of yarn and a crochet hook in my purse so I can literally pull it out and do something wherever I am.",False,False
