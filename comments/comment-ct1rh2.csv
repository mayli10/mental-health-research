When I was younger, the goal was to be as skinny as possible. I think that before we reach our lowest weights, the thought of being too thin is literally unfathomable to us, because we're so used to losing weight and spending so much time and effort on it, and it never being a bad thing. The thought of taking it 'too far' is not even conceivable because it's like, before we get there, we kill ourselves, and invest soooo much time and energy into it, and it always brings a desirable result..until it doesn't, and it's so difficult to switch mindsets from ""losing weight is and has always been and will always be a good thing that people will compliment us on"" to ""oh, I lost...too much?"". It's like someone telling you that the way to get into a good college is actually to fail every class, when you've been working your ass off getting straight As for 12 years. It's like a foreign concept that you could ever get too skinny, because for your whole life up until that point, that's never been true.  &amp;#x200B;  I think for a lot of us the struggle is this: we do want to have a good body and we don't want to look unhealthy, but we're also addicted to the thrill of losing weight in and of itself-- and that thrill doesn't disappear even when we've gotten the dream body--we will continue to crave it. I honestly feel like for a ton of people with EDs we don't want to look disgustingly underweight (although I'm well aware this illness has a ton of differing manifestations and of course some do), we just want to look beautiful and skinny/thin/fit, but not to the point where people would think we're sick, to the point where people think we look amazing. And the thrill of getting closer and closer to that amazing place is so exciting and rewarding, and we're so used to NOT being there, that we don't even comprehend when we've actually reached it and it's so engrained in us that we need to keep going that we can't stop. I think the ultimate goal is getting a body that we enjoy/can live with, and then just training ourselves to understand that despite what our mind is telling us, we don't fucking need to lose anymore weight because we did it. I think in a strange way it's like we have a problem accepting that we actually accomplished something, and we can relax now- the hard work is over. We're so hard on ourselves and we always think like, it's too good to be true that we don't have to starve anymore to have the body we want, that body's already here, even if in some moments we can't see it. I kind of went off on a rant here but I just totally relate to what you're saying. Now that I'm older I don't even want to be as thin as I was before but it's going to be difficult adjusting to not wanting something that for what seems like the longest time, I wanted more than anything.",False,False
