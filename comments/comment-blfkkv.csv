Ffs, even people who *are* trained/licensed run this risk. Aspiration of vomit is a hugeeeee risk I worry about, especially when I remove the tube, and so is everything else involved in a normal gastric lavage. Like, there's a reason stomach pumping is rarely done nowadays.  Haha, I wasn't sure if you forgot or you purposely ignored ðŸ˜… don't think too much about it though, but thank you so much regardless for intending on responding! I usually forget the questions I ask people on Reddit 5 minutes later and never return to them, but I have to admit that I checked for a response from you twice on following days. Thank you!",False,False

I just don't want it to inspire anybody, and anyone who isn't licensed to place a tube or trained by a medical professional will always run the risk of something going wrong. I still have a comment of yours to reply to, I haven't forgotten. And thank you!",False,False

The salt purging tube is very well-known online too, so I definitely see this as worse. I'll go ahead and remove it after typing this comment.  Perforation is minimized by chamfering the tube and stopping at any sharp pain, infection is minimized because I use silicone and primarily though boiling of the tube (through spores cannot be killed like that ofc, so replacing of the tube as well), and GI problems are there when I purge regardless tbh. If anything I get less acid reflex now lol. But yeah, perhaps even more weakening of the lower esophageal sphincter.   Sorry about this. I'll go through other means perhaps, but not this.  Congrats on getting the mod position btw! Haha",False,True

All I can say is this is extremely dangerous because you risk perforation, infection, and other gastrointestinal complications.",False,False
