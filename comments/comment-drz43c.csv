I hope he's not at all affected by the comments. He's been one of my idols since I was a kid, and i'd hate to see him change his current image just to satisfy judgmental fans. Based on what i've seen from him that probably won't happen, he seems pretty well balanced and happy, which is nice to see. Makes me feel like recovery and happiness are possible :)",False,False

They took a pause from playing and he talked about how if you were struggling, or if you knew someone who was struggling, to reach out - reach out for help, and reach out to each other with kindness. Felt like someone both acknowledging who their audience was likely to be and speaking from some experience.",False,False
