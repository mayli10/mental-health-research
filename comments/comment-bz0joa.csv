It makes me feel like I donâ€™t really need to change, Iâ€™m not really sick or thin. In treatment they keep saying Iâ€™m underweight and I donâ€™t believe them. If the new BMI says 17.69 and the underweight cutoff is 17.5 then Iâ€™m fine. Iâ€™m physically feeling better and able to do more than I was a month ago. I havenâ€™t fainted in two months. I havenâ€™t reached my goal weight. I feel like I need to at least get to BMI 15 on the new BMI. I feel like I canâ€™t trust the standard BMI anymore.",False,False

I don't even feel like I'm thin - I look at people who are definitely larger than me and I'm like 'wow, I wish I was skinny like that'. Please get help.",False,False
