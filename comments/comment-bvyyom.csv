I hated every second of it. But I’ll tell you this, other people absolutely do not see you the way you see yourself. I 210% guarantee it. It sounds like you haven’t worked there for very long. I’m betting you’ll get the same kind of annoying attention other girls do. I say annoying because while, at the time, you think it feels nice to have someone validate your appearance, the reality is, they’re just being slime balls. You are much, much more than your appearance. With that said, I get it. I’m guessing if you just got this job you won’t be looking for another one any time soon? Is it temporary (like, just for the summer) or no?",False,False

I wish I knew what else to say - hopefully you get a different job soon?",False,False
