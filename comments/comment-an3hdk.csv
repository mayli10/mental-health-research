Once I pulled back the curtain on how nutrition and CICO works, I couldn't look away. And now it's a constantly running background process in my life.",False,False

You whole family is begging you to eat because you’re wasting away but how can you swallow poison? And then you do and it feels like you urgently need to get it back up or you will die. It’s illogical and utterly consuming,False,False

And now, that's manifested into me setting unrealistic goals for myself that I intend to achieve by any means necessary. Anything that hinders me reaching the goals (e.g. ~~bingeing~~ normal eating) gives me irrational severe anxiety. That's the best, most concise explanation of my story anyway.",False,False

The best way I could was that it has very little to do with my actual body, and so much more to do with “failing” or “succeeding” regarding food. Being insecure about my body isn’t what mostly gave me an ED, being emotionally insecure and fragile is. Yes, I hate my body, but all in all my ED is more of a form of self harm and control ",False,False

Say something like ""it's a psychological condition stemming from chemical misfirings in my brain that gives me increased anxiety and obsessiveness surrounding food and my body"" before going into what it really feels like.  Beyond that, it's so different for everyone that each person you ask would probably have a slightly different experience. For me, it feels like my mind loses control of itself and I'm forced to watch helplessly as I ruin my life by starving myself to death, while at the same time actively and enthusiastically doing so.",False,False
