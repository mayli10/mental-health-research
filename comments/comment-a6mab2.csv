I mean for me the colostomy is kinda inevitable because of my fucking colitis but I’d prefer to not have it right before I go to college. Thank you. I have been doing the miralax but it just sucks. I’m never taking ducolax again.,False,True

I used lax for 14 yeas and just recently had to quit cold turkey when I found out I was pregnant. It sucked. Uncomfortable doesn’t even come close to describing it. I was going 5-15 pills a day and quit cold turkey. My advice- eat fats and small amounts of fiber, sip water throughout the day, take a double dose of Miralax 2x day, use digestion/ probiotic tablets and get some good stretchy pants. I never thought I could have another bm on my own again but my system works! Kind of...you have to keep putting things in in order for something to come out.   Quit now. You don’t want to destroy your intestines and have to walk around with a colostomy bag for the rest of your life. It’s going to be uncomfortable but it’s worth it. ",False,False

My digestive issues haven’t been diagnosed yet and haven’t been going on for as long as you, but I’m in a very similar boat. I’ve been personally using magnesium citrate (the liquid stuff). I’m worried about how often I use it and my reliance on it but my response to worry to to avoid thinking about it. Being constipated is just the worst and I don’t understand why miralax isn’t working.   I hope you’re okay. Do you have anything that needs doing out of the house tomorrow/when the ducolax takes effect? ",False,False
