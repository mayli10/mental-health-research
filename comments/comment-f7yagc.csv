Not exactly sure how to best word that but in my brain that's my reasoning.  The shredded cheese blend option at Taco Bell winds up in more cals than just the extra shredded cheese option so that's another thing guiding my thought process,False,False

Good luck! I hope you let yourself get one eventually, maybe you could still let yourself have something light that day so you're not having just a milkshake like a salad of some sorts?

I've never had the oreo mint milkshake and did want an Eggnog one back in December but never got to go. I've had their watermelon one, cappucino one, chocolate one, and banana I think.  I just saw the cals boy I was blind, I could have been remembering wrong but I think I've tried contacting them for the info on their cheesecake toppings since I know their menu says a number but the online info doesn't mention it or available toppings. It irks me that their menuboard is off when some items are compared to the PDF.  Think you would mind asking about the chocolate chip cheesecake milkshake if you can get a hold of them?

Godspeed friend, I honestly want to go one day to try a chocolate chip cheesecake milkshake and have them combine it with banana pudding (never had either kind but I've had a couple of theirs)  I doublechecked their nutrional info download off their site and didn't see it but maybe you could just gueestimate it somewhere between one of their peanut butter ones?  https://cookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Nutrition_Website-1.pdf",False,False
