I feel like binging for me was self harm in a way. I was hiding beneath a body I couldn't recognize. Rude comments and stares didn't affect me because it *wasn't* me, at least in my eyes.",False,False

It's also why self harm and EDs have a high correlation. We don't see our body as part of us, there's some kind of disconnect. I think clinically it is called depersonalization- you kind of separate from yourself.   For me I notice it happening but I haven't figured out how to fix it. Honestly it can also feel like there are multiple ""people"" running my body. The one who binges- nothing matters more than shoving as much food as possible into my body. Then there's the one who purges- nothing matters more than getting as much of the binge out as possible. Then, there's me- a ~logical and rational~ person who definitely isn't a crazy person who binges and purges.   It's hard because in the moment I am so disconnected I feel like I have no control over what's happening. Then I also think it makes it more difficult to stop because my normal self distances herself as much as possible from the crazy one, so I never address the behaviors after it happens.
