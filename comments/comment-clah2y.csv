I could've written this post. My ex is out having fun, hanging out with his friends - and he just got a new higher paying job and a new girlfriend, and I'm all alone and too poor to afford a new place to live. It feels horrible, but please don't let it drag you down!! It really DOES get better, I swear! Even if it takes a really long time. If you talk to someone, do some things that makes you happy and start over - get a fresh start. There are lots of ways to make new friends! ‚ù§Ô∏è Please take care of yourself! I don't know you, but I care.. Message me if you need a friend üòå‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False

It‚Äôs something that you don‚Äôt want to wait for but it‚Äôs what you have the most of. I read a quote on here before and it was about healing. It went something like this:  When your hurting it will be the first thing you think about when you wake up, it will constantly be hitting you throughout the day and it will be the last thing on your mind when you go to bed. But then after a while one day you‚Äôll wake up and it will be the second thing on your mind. And then the third, and then the very last.   The big breakup is the hardest especially if it‚Äôs your first love. I wanted to die but now looking back I roll my eyes and laugh. You are much more than someone else‚Äôs partner.",False,False

I have had very little food the last couple of days and managed to lose 10 pounds. However, it saddens me because not only did I lose somebody I love, but I also feel the need to punish myself physically because I desperately desire control over something nobody else can.  We‚Äôre both going to get through eventually. Please remember that you‚Äôre not alone in this and keep your head high. ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False
