I wouldn’t say I feel dissociative when I eat and I feel like I can stop myself. If anything I would just consider it overeating and not binging. When I eat I definitely feel aware, in reality, all I think about is the calories when I overeat. The main reason why I overeat is because the food normally just tastes really good and not because I’m unable to stop :-( Thanks for your advice though, it means a lot!",False,True

Basically, did you feel unable to stop yourself while eating? Was it somewhat dissociative, where it feels like you no longer have control over your hands? If so, it is what we'd consider a binge. It's more nuanced than that, but that's the basic idea behind it, at least in my opinion and from what I've seen here",False,False

I wouldn’t consider it binging necessarily because it’s not a gross amount of food (i.e I just eat majority of my day’s worth of food in one sitting which is roughly 1000 calories...unless that is binging, I guess you learn something new everyday.) but it’s just more than my other meals and that’s why I feel so “uncomfortably full.” Nonetheless, I wish you the best as well. :-)",False,True

It basically means that you both restrict and binge, worry about calories and weight, and it has a major impact on your life. You do not have to be underweight to have an eating disorder. You do not have to have lost a significant amount of weight to have an eating disorder. Please seek help from your GP, before it goes any further.  Good Luck x",False,False
