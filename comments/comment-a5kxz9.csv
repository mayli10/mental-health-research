I still have all those awful teenage memories, every time someone called me fat, commented on my body, or when guys would clearly reject me for my skinny friend who wasn't interested.  Even adults, at the time, seemed to write me off as a waste, and I honestly think my weight contributed that.   Unfortunately, how people treat you does change when you're thin, and while that isn't why I started, it's a driving factor now.",False,False

I kind of resent it, especially with men and with my mother. The Dalai lama says that suffering is good because it allows you to have empathy for others, so I try to think of it like that. I remind myself to treat less socially desirable people equally. ",False,False
