And then got back into it during a deep bout of restriction. I find that caffeine can be bad for my sleep, but only if I drink it after certain points in the day. Tbh, I haven’t really seen any major effect on my mood with/without caffeine, but that isn’t to say it isn’t there. After I cut out energy drinks, I might consider a complete cut of caffeine, but tbh it’s pretty low on my priorities.",False,True

I used to drink 3-4 cups per day for the past couple years. I had a pretty bad caffeine dependency as I used it as a way to power through school work and as a mood lifter.   My motivation for cutting coffee is getting mentally healthier. Drinking so much coffee was ruining my sleep which made me prone to bad mood swings. I did not realize how much caffeine was affecting me until people I love brought it to my attention.  It was affecting my relationships so one day I just cut it. It was tough to do so. I had headaches, more mood swings, fatigue.   I am glad I made the decision. I am getting reacquainted with what my natural energy level is. I do get sleepy more often, especially because I heavily restrict. I am slower completing papers and I am not as focused reading textbooks. But in return, I am more stable emotionally and in better control of my thoughts. It is taking time to fix my sleep schedule but I consider it worth it.",False,False

Like I guess the caffeine/smaller amount of calorie tradeoff is worth it for me, but the flavor alone wouldn't be rip.  I think I'm probably just going to have to go cold turkey; it's just a matter of working up to that lol",False,True
