You’re breathing out acetone, a ketone that’s one byproduct of the body burning fat for energy. If you stay in a state of ketosis (which doesn’t require fasting) some people find the breath dissipates, perhaps because the body gets more efficient at the process.   Note that if someone diabetic, I think this breath is no bueno (?) I think it can indicate ketoacidosis which can be very serious. (Though I assume the finger-prick test strips would be alerting to this fact too.)",False,False
