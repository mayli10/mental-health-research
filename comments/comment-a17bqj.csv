But also try different roasts and coffees prepared different ways. Dark roasts are the most bitter. Medium is less so with blonde being the least bitter but also the most acidic. Coffees from the Caribbean and central/south America tend to be more fruity tasting to me while African ones tend to taste faintly herbal. Coffee made with a French press tends to be smoother and less bitter but takes longer and can be a bit muddy. ,False,False

It's called Intermittent Fasting. ‚òïÔ∏è  So I only drink Coffee black in my fasting window. But within my 8h eating window starting at noon, I know I can have a Coffee with everything I want. I often drink decaf, just because I like hot coffee drinks, hot chocolate, shakes... but I only have them within my feeding window! That's how it works for me! üôÇ",False,False

Try lighter roasts to start because they are usually less bitter and have more caffeine.   If you love milky coffee maybe try getting black coffee and adding half n half to it? 20cals per Tbs, so if you added 5 Tbs you‚Äôd have sweet milky coffee for only 100 cals. Slowly cut down a Tbs as you see fit. (Trust me I‚Äôd be THAT bitch with a measuring cup at Starbucks to make sure it‚Äôs accurate)   I mean if you think about it the espresso in the latte is so watered down you‚Äôre basically ordering a glass of steamed milk that happens to have caffeine in it.

Find a roast you like and get a good French press. One of my favorite things is going to a good coffee shop and getting a pour over or something where they REALLY spend the time making the coffee the right way. Comes out so smooth and delicious. Milk and sugar would ruin it.  I'm also a huge fan of cortados, which are pretty low-cal.  I do like sugary drinks from Dunkin or Starbucks, but those are special treats and I usually alter them. Look up @themacrobarista on instagram - he has a ton of lower-cal drinks and instructions on how to order them!",False,False
