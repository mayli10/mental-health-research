This is also just a really weird situation for me to be back in, I used to live at home with my mom and do these behaviours but have been living with my dad for the past two months (haha succesful adult here) and felt 14 years old again in that moment.  Can totally relate to the hand thing, not so much with my hands but I used to think my cheeks and face ruined otherwise nice pictures with cute dogs and cats.. now I have worked on my self esteem and it really helped! Even at my hw some years ago I felt a lot better than at my lowest, that's the magic of recovery I guess. If only one could stay recovered, hmm",False,True

I wish him a speedy recovery!  I can totally relate lol when I was younger I used to scour my mom’s room for her scale whenever she left the house. On a similar but unrelated note, if my hand is in a picture or my pets, I’ll delete it because it looks fat to me :^(",False,False
