I was about to tell him the same thing this morning. We had a good conversation about my “fasting” (cringe ED excuses) and I feel okay about him coming now as long as I can get to a somewhat normal health level before Friday.

My bf wanted to come visit me this weekend and I told him not to because I'm relapsing and I just don't want to be around him when I'm like this. It's not fair to him.,False,False
