I know you might not see it right now, but it is a very low BMI and I can assure you that other people definitely see it. Getting into even lower BMI will not get you satisfied, you'll still not view yourself the way you actually look like and it will not feel like enough.  In the other comment you said that you only saw 13/14 BMIs as the dangerous ones but that's not quite true, you're definitely in the concerning and dangerous territory at the moment.",False,False
