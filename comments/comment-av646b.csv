Although Iâ€™ll need to be on T one day, the thought of increased hunger scares me :/ hopefully by then Iâ€™ll be in a better mindset, because my restriction is definitely influenced by everything going on pre transition...

Iâ€™m not underweight though and my ed doesnâ€™t have a super significant impact on my general physical health.  There is a person on YouTube that is transitioning and talks about their eating disorder.  I believe they identify as non-binary but they are on T.  You could check them out and see if there is anything insightful there.  There name is [Jade Eliot](https://www.youtube.com/user/cooltbones)  ",False,False

And man I can relate.  Before T I barely ever felt hungry unless I like didnâ€™t eat for a day and even then it wasnâ€™t bad.  Now itâ€™s like Iâ€™m always hungry and itâ€™s hella triggering.  For awhile I was eating fine but I started waking up in the morning hungry and my brain (of course) would take it as a challenge to teach my body it isnâ€™t going to get its way.  So like I relapsed and I lost weight for awhile.  Now though itâ€™s on the ups.  Iâ€™ve been eating sometimes even like a regular human teenage boy and that super T means Iâ€™m gaining muscle and Iâ€™ve been keeping my weight stable so itâ€™s good.  Iâ€™m not low enough weight that people are monitoring me though so itâ€™s a different experience.,False,False
