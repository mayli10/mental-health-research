I tend to think about running that way too - probably because it's exhausting so it feels like I'm doing a lot üòÖ  MissFitandNerdy on YouTube has some really good videos on the topic üëç,False,False

I think I was under the naive impression that running would solve my plateau problems and provide quick results! In reality I just ate more but was simultaneously more tired. I'll have to check out HIIT when I next feel inspired to exercise lol.  ",False,True

I'm 5'0 and 95 pounds and to make any meaningful calorie burn I'd probably have to be running 10k. Restricting is just easier :( ",False,True

So stopping has probably cleared out that water weight &amp; chilled your body out so your metabolism can go back to normal.   Tldr: HIIT is the way to go my dude (&amp; keeps burning cals for hours after you finish),False,False
