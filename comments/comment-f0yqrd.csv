Now the idea of any butter or syrup on anything makes me disgusted.  Also, my family goes to burger chains a lot and I used to always get a cheeseburger, fries, and a milkshake. That's not cringe, but now I can barely get through just a cheeseburger (on the rare occasion I let myself have one) because I'm thinking it is a lot of calories. It's wild how much you can eat when you're not thinking about calories and have no idea even how many foods have.",False,False

Because teenagers (kids in general) have high calorie needs for their size bc growing bodies. That's not just height either, but internal organ development. So even if it was high calorie, that could have been a smaller percent of your TDEE than you think.  Also it depends on how much ingredients you used, but even with butter and nutella, that is unlikely to top 500 calories. Which is actually within the range that lots of people diet at (3 meals a day x 500 cal = 1500 calories, a substantial deficit for a lot of dieters)",False,False
