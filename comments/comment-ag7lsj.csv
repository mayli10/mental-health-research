I do all of the things you listed, watching YouTube videos and reading, knitting, playing with my pets. I have been binge free for almost a week now, which considering how the last few months have gone is pretty good. What has been helping me recently is reading Brain Over Binge (I downloaded a pdf) and also listening to podcasts on binge eating. The technique described in these is basically as follows: recognize the voice telling you to binge is NOT coming from your conscious brain, but from your lower ""animal"" brain. Separating myself from my urges has made it easier; as there is no reasoning with your animal brain but your animal brain also CANNOT physically make you do anything. When I have urges to binge, I just try to feel them. Nothing can physically make me get up and go to the fridge unless I make the decision. Good luck! Here's to trying!",False,False

And trying to hit my goal weight by my birthday at the beginning of February. Also I don't buy/keep food, so if the urge does strike I stay in my bedroom and have literally nothing to eat anyway. Or I drink lots of tea/water/zero calorie soda",False,False
