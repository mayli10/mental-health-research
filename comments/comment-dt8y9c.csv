I had children (relapsed after each birth) went down to bmi15. Restored again and maintained 19/20 for several years until I was 35 when it started dropping back down. My bloods are acceptable levels, some of them borderline suggesting malnutrition and immunosuppression, but they‚Äôre ok. During my most lengthy LW period (ages 17-22) I used birth control which I believe helped to preserve my bone density and fertility, also I‚Äôve always taken supplements. I feel generally well physically, but I realise that I may be on borrowed time here üòè hopefully I can recover in the eleventh hour üòâ",False,False

I‚Äôm probably still obese now (threw out my scale a while back). I was a fat teenager, and my first tiny bout of an ED in high school brought me from obese (31 BMI) to overweight (27ish BMI). Through college I cycled through extreme weight loss and gain, with my lowest weight being really on the cusp of normal and overweight. The year after college (22), I had an episode of depression that brought back my ED + I was really poor and eventually got down to 22.5 BMI. I‚Äôm genetically predisposed to being overweight and have a lower than usual metabolism (measured at a sports nutrition thing), so I never got to be goals thin before my ED made me physically ill.  Anyway, I spent ages 23-25 bouncing between small weight gain and ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù diet and exercise phases to lose the weight and maintained around a 24 BMI. The past few years I gained a lot of weight‚Äîbinging, aging, living with my husband‚Äîand now I‚Äôm back to my old ways since the healthy dieting never gets me close to where I want to be and honestly makes me just as mentally sick as high restriction so I might as well get results.   Anyway. ED never went away for me, just changed. I never maintained my low weight or even a healthy weight. When I was younger I think there was a lot of social pressure and shame but now it‚Äôs just something for me, I have no real reason to be thin.",False,False
