One, you were drinking over 1000 calories from fruit juice so you weren't exactly starving  Two, YOU KNOW I was VERY RECENTLY at the time this happened (like two months into my recovery) I was anorexic  WHY THE FUCK DO YOU THINK TELLING ME THIS IS OKAY  they're just oblivious.. But.. Come the fuck on?",False,False

I made it a real serious habit that after 6pm I can’t consume anything but water. I usually eat dinner with my family around 5pm. I then skip breakfast and don’t eat until around the 18 hour mark. Sometimes I do 23 hours. It’s been working well. Night eating was a big problem for me. I’m honestly never hungry anymore.,False,False

I’m recovering from BED and while food isn’t currently something I’m obsessed with anymore it was *bad*. Meanwhile I have skinny friends who forget to eat things simply because they’re 20 year olds in college who can’t really take care of themselves so they skip meals and aren’t motivated enough to care.,False,False
