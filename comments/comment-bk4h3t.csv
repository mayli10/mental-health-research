I did it at the force I have been all my life..but I've been losing weight, and I didn't realize that this weight loss meant I needed to reevaluate how much force I put into certain movements. My back is a problem area of mine, and I typically have a bunch of extra padding. But I didn't realize the middle of my spine is starting to stick out..and when I hit my back to the wall, there was like direct force between a concrete wall and a single spine bone..it literally sent pain radiating throughout my whole body. And I rarely say ""ow"" in public when I'm alone, but I couldn't help but yelp it in pain. It wasn't even *that* much force, but I didn't realize how sensitive bones could be.  But yeah, my hip bones, butt bones, and lower anterior rib cage are all issues now because I don't store a lot of fat in those areas. When they jut out more when I'm less bloated, I usually shift around a lot. But I have a lot of padding in my limbs, so I wonder if my arms and legs are gonna start hurting too..I know my elbows do a little more now, but if they start hurting as much as my butt bones do, it's gonna be an uncomfortable time :/  That being said, what you can gain from this is yes, water weight helps fill in everything and make everything hurt less without actually gaining any weight. So perhaps, you can try that if you're up for it",False,False

It literally feels like nothing now.  I hope you can recover and one day experience the same thingüíï,False,False
