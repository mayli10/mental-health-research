So, so, so many non-dieting people view losing weight as just going to the gym. After losing some weight a friend asked me if I ”live at the gym” - no sis, I go maybe twice a week, I just no longer binge 6000 calories a day!!!!  Here’s another edgy opinion as a side note, these are the same people who think when you hit the gym you’ll immediately start looking like big Arnold with huge bulking muscles.",False,False
