I can’t focus at all, I think people were actually staring at me due to how sunken my eyes were and all the shivering I was doing in class today. I’ve averaged ~20 hours a week doing outside of class studying (could probably get away with like a quarter of that and still get A’s but I’m fucking obsessive), but this last week I haven’t even touched anything school related. I almost ditched class today (would have been a first) because I’m so fucking lightheaded. Finals are next week for me, and I’m so scared I’ll ruin all of my hard work over the fact that I can’t fucking eat like a normal person.     God, sorry to make that about me, just wanted to let you know you’re not alone ❤️. Honestly I’d be willing to bet that the stress of finals has played a role in it (atleast for me), but that’s just my two cents",False,False

Sometimes it helps to just take a step back, go for a walk, and clear your mind for a bit.   If you need to commiserate, I’m here ❤️",False,False
