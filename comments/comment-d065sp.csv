On the flipside, I get so happy when I do finally get to eat the food I saved up for. It's euphoric.",False,False

It's a lot of food. I was told, you don't need to eat it all, just getting it on your plate is a start. I also decided to sit with a co-worker at this time to socialize, which I don't usually do while eating. He looked at my plate before I ate anything then said, ""Wow, that's a LOT of food!"" I ended up not eating at all that day.  People just don't get it. He didn't mean anything ill by it, I don't think.

Well, aside from the fact that actually being hungry does make me feel like I have a ""right"" to start eating.
