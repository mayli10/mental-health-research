I seriously felt like such a failure because from my (first incredibly positive, then incredibly negative) experience, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone **ever**. Like, I'm embarrassed I may have ever suggested it to anyone. I don't think I did but the fact I KNEW I had to be secretive because people ""wouldn't understand"" is a huge red flag. It's blatant pro-ana bullshit, advertised differently so men don't feel emasculated for having anorexia and women don't feel bad for having an unecessarily restricted diet. For me as a guy, thinking of it as basically having immense self-discipline and being super healthy rather than spiraling into a fucked up spiral of obsession (which I did) was so tempting. For once, I could finally engage in self-destruction and justify it as 'healthy',",False,False
