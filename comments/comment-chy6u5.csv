Luckily she has an awesome dad who doesn't praise ""fragility"" or women who always cook and barely eat like most of the men in my family so hopefully she has more tools for success than I did",False,True

But I think you should try not to shoulder guilt about it. You don't do body talk around her, so you're really doing all you can. It is NOT your fault that your cousin has absorbed these messages about her body...I was a little younger than her when I started to feel fat, and it was almost entirely due to broad societal messaging.   Furthermore: if she does develop an ED (is there an anti-""knock wood""?), that wouldn't be your fault either. If you want to try and put this in a positive light, maybe think of your family's ED history as an advantage. You already *know* your cousin may be predisposed. *You*, in particular, can probably recognize the signs. If your cousin does end up with a problem, you are in a uniquely excellent position to see that she needs help, and to advocate for her before shit really goes downhill. You can be her guardian angel, you know?  You can't control what happens with her mental health, but you can certainly contribute to how your family deals with it.  If you want to feel like you're helping right now, though, I think you should feel empowered to push back on her negative body talk. I mean, man, if I'd known as a kid that literally everyone has thighs that ""pool"" to some extent, and that it is NOT a sign of being pudgy, I'm sure I wouldn't have felt so bad about myself.",False,False
