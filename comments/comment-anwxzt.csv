It’s easier to publicly restrict when you can tell people ‘oh I can’t have any. I’m vegetarian’ and they won’t question you any further. I remember passing out at random and my mom telling me I wasn’t allowed to be a vegetarian anymore because the lack of protein was making me sick. It was really that I had been starving myself for weeks. I stopped getting my period because I was so sick and just told myself ‘haha my body is just not ~used~ to this new diet’. Most people that claim going vegan will cure you are probably at the lowest point of their ED.,False,False

The “cure” for eating disorders is still unknown because they’re primarily genetic. In essence at the moment they go into remission.
