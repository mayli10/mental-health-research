Cuz when I’m in distress my brain tends to suggest only the destructive tools I’ve used so often, and having a suggestion list to pick from is helpful for me.   It’s been challenging to switch to new ways of coping, and it seems to need a lot of repetition (maybe because I repeated the unhealthy stuff so many times).  Plus it took some tries to find what works well for me personally. But last night when I was losing my mind - the me of 18 months ago would have ended up at the ER. Instead, I lit a candle, did breathing exercises, journaled, and eventually fell asleep safely. It wasn’t easy but damn was the outcome better!",False,False
