My hips are really wide, and my waist is very tiny. I never had a big bust even at my highest, but I used to have a really big butt.

It's removing the excess that covers the barebones (no pun intended lol) of the curves, and I guess I lose a lot off my waist too, so that makes for a more noticeable ratio.",False,False
