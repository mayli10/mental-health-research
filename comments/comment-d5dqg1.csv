Grapefruits interact similarly with a bunch of different meds.",False,False

BUT it also made me go a bit nuts and in the end I stopped taking it. I take fluoxetine now (at the highest poss dosage) and it’s much better for me, and I’ve not noticed any weight gain ❤️",False,False

How it will effect it varies person to person. So just be aware of appetite changes.  Some SSRIs take a bit to give actual change, so dont worry if it's not perfect right away. Also, speak up if you have any side effects - finding the right anxiety med can take trying a few and that's okay. You never have to settle for meds you don't like.  Good luck on this! The decision to medicate can be hard for some people but it has greatly improved my life and I hope it helps you as well.",False,False

In the beginning (first few weeks or month) diarrhea is a frequent side effect for most people (not me) so you might actually lose some weight.  I've also noticed that even though I'm hungry I can't find any food appealing enough to actually eat, so again, actually losing weight.  And once your mood stabilizes/anxiety levels are lowered, the chances of you bingeing go down as well.",False,False

Most people don't get any such effect from them.   Try them as prescribed, but if you find you are noticing these side effects, or any others you can't deal with, don't be afraid to go back to your doctor and ask to change to a different med in the same family.",False,False
