As much as I hate it I know that’s the point where I need to eat something. When I do, I always feel better about 20 mins afterward. I’m only eating at a mild deficit at the moment but I’m still clearly malnourished all to shit lmao",False,False

Last week I was in a rehearsal (I'm a dancer) and both my hands cramped up and I couldn't open them. I was trying to act like nothing was wrong but after I literally had to force each hand open with the other. That honestly scares me.,False,False
