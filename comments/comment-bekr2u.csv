Tell yourself this every single day. You are not responsible for anyone's actions but your own. It's okay to be worried and to want to help, but it's not your responsibility to help her. This is so importamt to remember, especially if you're struggling with an ED yourself. She is your parent and she holds the responsibility of caring for you.  With that in mind, I think you're right; the only way you can really help her is to work on your own ED. It would be ideal to have an honest conversation with her and maybe you both can seek help together. I totally get that you're not ready to recover, but you're going to have to take care of yourself before you can try to help your mom.",False,False
