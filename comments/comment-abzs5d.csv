That's really annoying. But. It's also annoying to basically be making donations to your therapist's office. ,False,False

Still going through all my background BS even though I see her almost weekly. She's an intern so I *only* pay $40 each time. I don't use insurance bc I'm on my parents and don't want them to ask questions. It would be the same cost out of pocket even if I did tho. Regardless I'm def not looking forward to eventually having to switch (or quit bc I can't afford more than this) once she finishes her internship idk when that even is but whatever. ,False,False
