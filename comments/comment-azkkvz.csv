Personally I use sweetener because zero calories + too much sugar makes my stomach hurt. I like my tea and oatmeal sweet, if I used sugar it would be way too many calories and a lot of pain afterwards. It would be nice if people kept their noses out of our business and didn't spout unscientific, unsupported nonsense to make you feel bad.

No study has ever proven that artificial sweeteners make you sick. To say they're worse than cigarettes is completely wrong. Cigarettes have very obvious effects on the body.
