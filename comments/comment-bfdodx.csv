I consider my EDNOS to be a manifestation of my OCD, because because all of my behaviors are equally obsessive and compulsive. I have a theory that my obsession is being underweight (which started as being a specific weight) and I developed this obsession a year after being diagnosed with OCD. Either the ED is a manifestation, or seriously exacerbated my disorder, but I do believe it really is primarily apart of what I already struggle with. I notice when my ED behaviors get worse, the  compulsion I have had since childhood, which led to my diagnosis, gets really bad as well. I don't even notice it getting worse until it becomes alarming, because on the surface the ED behaviors are calming the constant anxiety/obsessive loop going on in my head.",False,False

I 100% see what I'm doing food-wise to be in that boat more than an ED boat. There are a lot of similarities, but I can see OCD in what I do more than an actual eating disorder.  I actually stopped following this sub recently and just check it every once in a while because I feel like getting too wrapped up in some of these posts might end up sending me down the actual ED route, which I don't want.",False,False

There's other aspects of my life that I have compulsions with (and obsessive thoughts resulting, which i guess is kind of the opposite of how most OCD cases work) but I feel like I might very well be in the same boat.  I'm not seeing a therapist though. I'd die if a therapist told me I didn't have a real eating disorder. I'd just die lmfao. I need to make myself severely underweight first so that I can technically fit the diagnostic criteria for AN before I get any help",False,False
