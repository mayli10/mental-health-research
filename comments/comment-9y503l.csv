Especially since we live in a culture that uses food as comfort so frequently. ""You did a good job! Here's some candy!"" and ""you had a bad day? Let's go get ice cream"".   We learn to associate food with feeling good about ourselves, and that leds to using it as a method of self-soothing. The ED creates the same kind of reinforcement with restriction too. ""I feel shitty, so I'm going to restrict because then I'll feel better"".   PM me if you ever want to talk. But one of the things that I found helpful is delaying the behavior (at least for binging). If I give myself time to calm down first, I usually can talk myself out of the binge. Because I didn't really want the food, I just wanted to feel better now. ",False,False
