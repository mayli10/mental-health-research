I’ll try to go for a walk, drink a mug of tea really slowly or just sleep to avoid eating. What actually helps me a lot is doing something with someone else or even just talking with someone because I tend to binge more often when I’m alone or feeling isolated, but I don’t always have the energy for social interaction so that one is not always feasible. Hope you find something that works for you! :)",False,False
