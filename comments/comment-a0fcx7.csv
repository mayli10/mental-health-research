I got over the guilt of purging food my parents made me because my eating disorder started when I lived with them so I kind of had no choice.  But I do remember when my eating disorder was at its worst that was when I first met my boyfriend. The first time I ever really talked to him one on one and he said he wanted to make me food. I hadn‚Äôt told him yet but I realize now that it was pretty obvious that I had an ED.  Even though I was eating about 300 calories a day back then, I ate an entire greasy cheeseburger because he made it for me. And I didn‚Äôt even purge it. That cheeseburger felt like love to me and I wanted to keep it inside of me.",False,False

It is not fine if he is worried about your purging his food specifically. Either way, please don‚Äôt feel bad about it.   I have my own huge list of problems with food, but I‚Äôve never purged. I have two family members who I know do, and I love to cook for family. I know these people have purged my food, so I hope I can offer some insight about this.   Cooking for other people is enjoyable to me for three kinds of reasons. First, it allows me to demonstrate a skill I‚Äôve developed  for others. Knowing that people I care about think I did a good job of something I care about is rewarding on its own. My thing I care about happens to be cooking. If you purge, I know that doesn‚Äôt reflect at all on my skills.   Second, cooking is not just a skill, but an art. I‚Äôm glad that I am able to provide an enjoyable aesthetic experience for people I care about. If you purge, I know that doesn‚Äôt mean you didn‚Äôt enjoy the meal.   Third, and by far the least important, is that I want my food to nourish and be healthy. I think there is a lot of evidence that this a low-priority goal for most home cooks. When cooking for someone else, everyone feels a little bit more at ease using that extra 120 cals of butter.   If you have some disease so that you can‚Äôt absorb vitamin D from my food, that sucks. I wish you didn‚Äôt have that disease, and could absorb vitamin D. But I wouldn‚Äôt feel as if anything had been wasted.  If you are not being nourished by my food because you purge, that sucks. I wish you didn‚Äôt have that disease because your life would be better without it. But that‚Äôs because I want your life to go well.   If you purge, what I‚Äôve made hasn‚Äôt contributed to a healthy diet for you. I wish it had, but I would never call it a waste. It‚Äôs far more important that you eat well in general, then that I be the one to help you eat well on this specific occasion. If you purge, I am saddened. But not because it‚Äôs a waste of anything. Instead, it‚Äôs because I want things to go well for you, and if you are purging something isn‚Äôt going right.   If I‚Äôm enabling you, that‚Äôs entirely on me. Please don‚Äôt hold yourself responsible for my enabling. That‚Äôs something I need to work through.   In summary, knowing that people have purged what I‚Äôve cooked doesn‚Äôt hurt my feelings. I wish it didn‚Äôt happen, because I wish my loved ones wouldn‚Äôt purge. But it doesn‚Äôt make sense to feel hurt by it, which would make it all about me.   I can‚Äôt guarantee that your dad feels the same way. But if he doesn‚Äôt, then he is wrong. Your purging isn‚Äôt about him, so he shouldn‚Äôt take it personally. That‚Äôs definitely hard to explain, but hopefully this knowledge will help you to feel less bad about what‚Äôs going on with you. ",False,False
