But yeah like maybe she wanted to let you be the one who tells the psych about your ED and how it effects you. Sounds invalidating though, and maybe you could bring it up to your therapist!",False,False

I just am not sure how I can turn an ED on and off when it's been about 13 years of it but ok. It's very likely I took it the wrong way, I do tend to do this. Just needed to vent about it a bit. Maybe you're right and she didn't want to air out all of my business.",False,True

Maybe your therapist wasn’t sure what you wanted your psychiatrist to know, and didn’t want to break your trust or damage the therapeutic alliance between you two?",False,False
