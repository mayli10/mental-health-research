Life was great as a child - I was tiny and smart and pleasing and teacher's pet and made straight As. I don't view myself as a ""woman"". I view myself as a ""girl"" still. I just want to be tiny and pleasing and small and childlike and not have to worry about anything but doing well in school and making good grades and staying tiny.

When I restrict, I feel very child-like for some reason (which I really enjoy). Like when I'm hard relapsing, I wear comfy clothes and tons of layers and a big puffy coat and feel like a kid again. And I tend to revert to ""childish"" interests when I'm relapsing, like wanting to see children's movies and buying stuffed animals. I also basically stop dating or having any sexual feelings when I'm restricting.   I don't know whether it's a product of restriction or if I'm restricting because I want to get at those feelings of childhood comfort. Probs both tbh.",False,False
