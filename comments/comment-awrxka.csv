Before my ED i was quite good at sports and when i got my ED my performance dropped and even though it probably wasn't because of my ED (i probably just got worse at it idk) i like to think that it is.  The thing is i'm getting better in terms if eating and my performance isn't improving lol i guess i just suck now.,False,False
