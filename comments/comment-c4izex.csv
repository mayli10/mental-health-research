I think I understand what you mean by how he might not ""get it""‚Äîsome people can be unknowingly insensitive about mental illness. Whether or not you should to tell him is your choice and not something I know enough about to give suggestions about. I don't know if this helps, but a good friend would be happy for your recovery if they understood the nature of EDs.",False,False

I told him I have depression (technically true, although it's a direct result of my ED and doesn't really exist when I'm thin/underweight and not engaging in binge eating behavior) as a reason why sometimes I don't want to see him or be intimate.   He's a good person but part of me is afraid he just won't ""get it"" if I told him and that could sour me on the whole relationship.",False,True

It might be a good idea to tell him about any insecurities you might have. If he is a good friend he will be happy that you are recovering and he won't care what you look like. Of course if you don't feel comfortable disclosing something so personal you don't have to tell him.,False,False

I hope we can both make enough peace with our bodies one day so that we feel comfortable being naked. &lt;3",False,True

I think the only way to handle it is to work on self esteem and then the intimacy issues resolution will naturally follow. It‚Äôs simpler in theory than it is in practice!
