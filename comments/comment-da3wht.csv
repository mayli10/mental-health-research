You may be very low in something like iron which would be very hard to resolve just by eating a few more calories. You may need special supplements or more.,False,False

I find it's easy to under eat on OMAD days.  You are describing how I feel when I'm not getting in enough calories.  My number 2 thought is, are you getting enough electrolytes? particularly sodium.  Try a little salted water (like 8oz w/ 1/4tsp of salt) and see if you perk up some.  Potassium and magnesium can also be in play.  You can supplement or add spinach &amp; avocado to your meal.",False,False

A month ago I thought I was having major blood sugar crashes every day, turned out to just be iron. :/  But also, I mean, most likely it's from fasting. Hope you aren't getting sick!",False,False
