Eat enough- restricting to compensate is so tempting, but trust me it will usually only fuel the cycle. Choose a healthy calorie range, (maintenance is good or a small deficit if you must) and try to stick with it! Also try and have 2-3 solid meals even if you‚Äôre not starving when you have one. Keeping ahead of hunger can reduce the urgency of eating.   2. Cut back on the binge foods. Do not stock them in your house. Try and eat healthy balanced meals. Give yourself permission to eat a (single) treat if you‚Äôre feeling that full restriction will lead to going overboard eventually, but only buy one serving if that‚Äôs the case. If you have a roommate/SO/someone else, they may be willing to pick it up so you don‚Äôt have to set foot in a store and become tempted. Practicing moderation can be really good, but for some is too difficult in the beginning. Be honest about your limits.   3. Try to cook more- it‚Äôs harder to binge if you keep around ingredients that take effort to cook. For me this looks like, frozen foods (like fish fillets), rice, eggs, etc. Limit easily prepared unhealthy foods.   4. Do keep healthy snacks. I get hungry coming off a binge, so snacks like apple slices, carrots, sugar free jello, greek yogurt, and other filling (or fulfilling) snacks can allow me to gently come off of a binge without the guilt. You‚Äôre more likely to stop at a reasonable amount with those than processed foods, at least.   5. Drink water to hydrate and take care of that ‚Äúdehydration hunger‚Äù   6. Find things to do instead of binge. Taking a bath, going for a walk, or even going to a friend‚Äôs house can remove you from the situation long enough for the feelings to lessen.   7. Be mindful. When you go to eat (outside of meals of course), ask yourself if you‚Äôre hungry, just bored, emotional, or something in between. Eat slowly and deliberately.   I know these seem generic, but they have been really good to me in the past. I hope you feel better soon üíï",False,False

I eat small meals throughout the day so I don‚Äôt feel the need to eat a bunch at night (another trigger; that‚Äôs when I feel like I have license to go overboard cAuSe It‚ÄôS jUsT OMAD iT‚Äôs FiNe), then I go to sleep early or take a bath; basically anything to stay out of the kitchen.    It‚Äôs important not to restrict to get out of a binge cycle because obviously that just perpetuates the cycle. Stay as close to maintenance as possible for as long as possible. Even if it feels like too much I just remind myself that calorically it would average out to a lot more if I restrict then binge than it would if I just ate at maintenance for a week. Maintenance is also important to be able to perform well academically, so that‚Äôs another motivation not to restrict/binge. When I want to get ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äùback on track‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù I high restrict and allow myself as much as possible so I don‚Äôt fall into the trap of massively undereating/massively overeating again.",False,False
