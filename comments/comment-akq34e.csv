Drs are so into ""weight restoration"" that I think that should work both ways - helping people who are overweight from bingeing get back to healthy weights. I would assume it would. If no then they should just go back to saying ""weight gain"". (rant over)   To the OP I think if you normalize eating habits you will probably lose weight w/o trying. ",False,False

As long as you're eating enough to maintain your current weight and also getting all of the nutrients you need I don't see how there could be a problem. In order to maintain your weight you need to eat more than enough to support your body's basic functions and if you're getting all of the nutrients you need I don't see how anyone could say that you're unhealthy. I'm currently around a BMI of 16 and I think the BMI ranges (UW, N, OW, OB) are just sort of guidelines. I know being obese does cause health problems, but it seems like for underweight and overweight it's just about how people typically get to those weights. If you eat nutritious foods and exercise to any amount that doesn't overexert your body you should be perfectly fine at pretty much any weight.  So to answer your question, I do think you can recover and lose weight. Just focus on healthy eating, getting the right amount of exercise, and overall just living a healthy lifestyle. The key to recovery is entirely within beating your obsession over food and weight. If your obsession is with health, that's a good thing. Focusing on being healthy is a good thing as long as it doesn't get in the way of your happiness.",False,False

""Doctors get eating disorders too‚Äîvery commonly expressed as ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù eating and athletic compulsions. Be gentle with your patient if you have fallen victim to the cultural and unscientific norms of fattism and healthism. Realize that if you have a blown out knee from years of triathlons and you‚Äôre still clocking in your regular runs each week and/or you believe that ‚Äújunk‚Äù food causes illness then you are going to have to recuse yourself from treating a patient with an eating disorder.
