Its always a good idea to recover and establish good eating habits. When in started recovery i was still in the higher end of normal and felt huge. i started to recover because i realized how bad my life was and recovering was one of the things i could control and change to make my life better. Ive been recovered for almost 5 years, not without its ups and downs.   What helped me with recovering was not to just resort to binge eating all the time. Bingeing is still disordered eating. What i did at the beginning was to figure out my tdee and stay at my calorie intake for the day. The main goal was to try and eat as close as possible to that number as i could, didnt matter if it was a whole pizza or 2000 apples as long as i ate it. If you eat over, dont beat yourself up. breathe, meditate, let it out and forgive yourself, and continue on your day. Because in the long term will one day really matter? or will 30 days? the point is to make the conscious effort. Just this september i felt healthy enough mentally to lose weight healthily and its stuck, the point is if you recover it doesnt mean you cant ever lose weight again, you just have to be prepared to catch yourself if you feel yourself slipping.",False,False

It usually leads to binge eating (as you've experienced). I find that filling up on low calorie foods is better than restricting. Like you can make a big bowl of pasta that's only 300-500 calories. Fill it with plenty of veggies and you'll be full and it's a healthier choice than some other foods that I would typically eat otherwise. I eat a lot of junk food if I don't go grocery shopping often enough :l,False,False

I think your best plan would be to recover from the mental aspect of your disorder(s) and then work with a nutritionist to work out a new healthy lifestyle and eating plan. This plus a moderate amount of exercise will help you get to a healthy weight and look and feel amazing, and you'll be able to maintain it because you didn't get there via mental illness. I'm not qualified or anything so you definitely need to speak to professionals, but from what I've seen most people end up in a healthy place after recovering from an eating disorder. Best of luck &lt;3",False,False
