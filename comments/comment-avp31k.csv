So I started the whole discussion of being a bulimic for 17 years with anorexic tendencies and just went into as much detail as possible. After I had finished he had asked if I had received treatment for it because I had seemed to have a really positive understanding of the impact that my issues have had. I was shocked but pleasantly surprised that as much as this disorder has taken away from me, there is still a chain of rational thought buried in me somewhere.  Its scary but worth it. Now he holds me accountable and I can be honest. ",False,False

They were so understanding - they were aware of that constant, intense double-think that comes with an ED. The person I spoke to from the organisation emphasised how terrifying it can be to ""come clean"" about these behaviours, and my therapist talked a lot about accommodating my need to control my weight, how we'd go in small and manageable steps.  The fact that you've told her about the suicidal thoughts is something to be proud of - and the way you've talked about this wearing you down makes me think that maybe you're ready to bring up the ED as well. It's your decision - all I can say is that it felt like such an unburdening when I told my therapist. And no matter what happens, regardless of your worries about judgment, I promise you what you're going through has nothing to do with attention-seeking. I think you're being courageous and insightful in the face of something overwhelming.",False,False
