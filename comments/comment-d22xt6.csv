The only thing keeping me is spite   (that and the fact that I suspect my ED has more to do with my need to Control Things than my need to get thin, and ultimately cutting out eggs gives me more joy for some control related reason)",False,False

But now I can't even view animal products as food. I literally gag at the thought of eating meat or cheese. There's a lot of crazy shit I'll do to lose weight (or pursue recovery, if I'm in that mindset) but eating animal products will never be one of them.

Just get so f'ing frustrated seeing all these amazing low-cal non-vegan options. I know it's just a matter of time before vegan options catch up but it's tempting sometimes.  Is this just a general what-if scenario of ""if eating animals would somehow magically make me thin then I would choose to do that"" or is it a specific product? Because maybe we could find some vegan alternatives. If it's just a general ""I would do literally anything to lose weight"" then big mood lmao",False,False

I'll say this though: 5+ years of eating 100% vegan has had no effect on my weight. The first two months I probably gained a tiny bit, but only because I wasn't familiar with the products and recipes and ended up eating mostly pasta. Since then I've fluctuated like my ED ass always does, and within the same range (excluding my current LW). I get most of my proteins from chickpeas/hummus, tofu, edamame, greens, oat milk, broccoli and other veggies.  It's also helped me a bit in social settings, since it's easier to decline food and especially snacks. 80% of the time when someone offers me chips, it has milk powder in the seasoning.",False,False
