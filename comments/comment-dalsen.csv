I generally do 20+ a day but often 22-24 hours. My longest has been 38.  I'd like to move up to 48 and 72.   I think it's easier when I'm busy and not stressing out.,False,False

After like 2 bites I'm full. But then I'm like uhhh no, no you're definitely starving. And I make myself at least finish a small meal.",False,True

Hey, if it helps...I do think you're pretty sick. 800 calories is no small feat. My fiance *cried* when he had to eat 1500 cals a day for his diet. That's maintenance for me and he CRIED. That really put it in perspective for me how nuts I am even eating 900 calories in a day.",False,True

From what Iâ€™ve seen, the â€˜not sick enoughâ€™ train of thought is unfortunately very common in people with eating disorders and while I know that even thinking that is part of the disorder itâ€™s almost like, oh but Iâ€™m the only one whose actually not sick enough. Which I know is bullshit. Unless......  But no youâ€™re right. Itâ€™s some bullshit. Unfortunately, it so happens that Iâ€™m back on my bullshit.",False,False

I was so hungry I didn't feel hunger. I actually felt full after eating just a couple bites of a chicken sandwich. It started making me so lethargic, though, so I knew I had to eat more. Afterwards I felt incredibly bloated and nauseous, most likely from all the sodium.",False,False

You don't have to purge, binge, abuse laxatives, fast, you don't even have to successfully restrict every day. It's a disorder not a diet y'know? We come in all shapes, sizes, and behaviors.",False,True

Idk I donâ€™t fast or binge I just kinda low key restrict constantly. The lowest Iâ€™ve deliberately restricted was about 800 too, so I guess I just avoid a lot of the extremes of behaviour that I see talked about here. Doesnâ€™t help w admitting Iâ€™ve got a problem at all cos compared to lots of yâ€™all I really donâ€™t.",False,False
