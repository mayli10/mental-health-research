I’m not an expert but I have gained a lot of insight about this as I get older and am able to reflect on it. For me, if I go below around a 16.5 bmi, my mind stops being rational and I genuinely seem to just “forget” the realizations I have or think that they’re stupid and wrong and losing more weight or restricting is “just fine”, the obsession just takes over everything and overpowers everything that I’ve learned and that’s important to me, it’s really crazy. But everyone is genuinely different, what is true for me certainly isn’t going to be true for everyone.   There is that Minnesota experiment everyone likes to talk about where they took completely healthy men and starved them, and lot of them developed obsessions and disordered thinking and eating during the study and some even had mental trouble gaining weight and eating more when it was over. Something that’s maybe more relevant to us is this: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4611244/ where women talk about the obsessive nature and how it did start as a choice, one saying “My experience of the compulsion in anorexia is that it grows as you lose weight”.   I think the first thing to ask yourself is just, why? Why do you do the things you say you do with food/weight in the first place? If you can sit with that and actually understand, that’s honestly half the battle. Because then you can try and find other, healthier things that will give you the same feeling and relief of stress that focusing on calories and weight  does. The sooner you can let go of obsessive habits the better because everyone will tell you that the longer you continue doing them, the worse the anxiety when you can’t do these things will be. And I’m not saying you can’t ever lose weight, exercise, etc. It’s all about the degree of compulsion and interference of your life these things have and how far you take it and how in tune you are to what’s truly healthy for you.",False,False

Hope you're doing ok. Would you mind sharing the BMI where you feel more obsessive, please? Or any info/resources to read about that? Just curious as I'm currently losing weight but still feel like I 'have it under control'.",False,False

Not so black and white.  I'll compare it to anxiety disorder and agoraphobia.  I have both. And there is major choice involved as well as compulsion.  And there are good and bad days/weeks/months. It is confusing and absurd sometimes to even those of us that suffer. Seriously in agoraphobia groups we are often just like what?? Why??? Lol  And everyone is unique and handles it differently.   For example, I work a full time job. It's not always easy and the job is near perfect for my anxiety so yay. And there were times where I could walk, catch a bus and spend all day shopping.  Other days where I couldn't take a step outside without having a panic attack. Days where someone knocked on my door and so I hid in the bathroom in the dark crying because who knows.  Some things are easier, some days are just easier. I think there is so much involved in our heads that we cant even always see or begin to understand why or how.   And often yeah it's just getting past it all and deciding to do the thing. And sometimes it's just that hiding in my safe zone is comforting. And so I dont want to stop. I think that could be part of the thing for you, restricting is your safe zone. It what's your home base that you do have and can choose to go adventuring out, but it's still there for you. And that the real issue is ofcourse it's not really safe because it's not healthy. So that the issue would be seeing something negative as safe.   Which I feel that. When I restrict I feel so good. I feel strong, in control, pretty, and like sane. When I binge I feel like a tornado of restlessness and like I have no control.   And it's the same with the agoraphobia.  I can feel absolutely wrecked, panicked from leaving my safety zone sometimes but other times I can make a conscious choice to do so and be fine with it.  That doesn't mean I have absolute choice and it doesn't mean I have no choice either. It means its complicated.",False,False

I feel the “serving you” thing. E.g. I lifeguard and when I’m working I need to eat because I can’t get preoccupied with my hunger and let a kid drown, but on my days off I’ll restrict because it keeps me sane.",False,False

Does being “disordered” require a reduction in quality of life, or does it mean “anyone who does things that aren’t socially acceptable”? Does anyone else feel this way?  I take the 'radical' POV that anorexia, depression, anxiety, etc. aren't at all different from any other state of mind in how much choice there is involved. Issue is that you *have* to say it's not a choice so people can't jump on you for making a bad choice. But I'm not a philosopher and I'm not smart enough to explain what I mean. Ik this isn't a popular view with people. It means their problems are all their fault but I don't like calling it fault at all. It's all complex and humans want to make it really simple.",False,False

Whereas before, I could sort of 'take or leave it' when I wanted, I started to find myself doing things like not going out to dinner with my mom or friends because I had already planned the dinner I was going to eat that night, and I just couldn't stray from my plan otherwise I'd be a failure and ruin everything and gain weight. I also couldn't stop it even when I could see I was getting dangerously thin and didn't even think I looked good.   in my opinion it's just inevitable that a certain point this change happens and that's why no healthy normal person weighs out food or tracks and plans everything they eat. and exactly, you hit the nail on the head when you talked about it being the cure for stress. it's similar to alcohol or drugs in that way. you know when my ""switch"" happened? after a weird thing happened with the 'mean girl' of my friend group and I basically lost all my friends from one day to the next in high school. instead of dealing with this or even getting upset, I just went into hardcore calorie counting. two years later I was in the hospital and suspended from college on death's door. if you were to ask me before this friend thing if I ever would have been in that situation, I would have laughed and said the typical ""I have it all under control"". just be careful and be aware.   &amp;#x200B;  another thing that's also been studied pretty extensively is that once you lose a certain amount of weight/bodyfat your brain starts operating differently. if you start losing weight at a certain point you may start to become more obsessive and crazy around food and you will genuinely not be able to turn it off. it's weird but I know the exact weight legitimately to the pound now where I know I'm going to start to get crazy and that's why I promised myself I wouldn't ever go below there again.",False,False

I restricted in some form from 13 to 20 and now back at it at 22. At some points it was more “obsessive” than others. I gets “worse” when life gets worse, but outside stress causes it, not the other way around. It’s my comfort when everything else is hell.   I do feel compelled to do things, but only when I turn the restriction brain “on.” For instance, if I make a pot of soup, I measure every ingredient that goes in it to the gram and if it gets off I get really frustrated. But if I decide that I don’t want to restrict, I can make a pot of soup without measuring just fine.   Something that worries me though, and this may just be my anxiety, is that my default is for restriction brain to be “on.” If it goes “off,” it’s because it’s been planned and I’ve weighed (hehe) the pros and cons. I know eventually I’ll have to maintain my weight and I worry about constantly having to make the decision to eat properly and how I’ll handle that. When I was working it was fine because I ate nothing but fast food and didn’t have to really make a whole lot of decisions. I would need to count calories and I’d like to eat healthier than I did back then, and that means many decisions to be considered. How much spinach will I put in this dish? Should I add an egg? Dairy or almond milk? and so on. I worry I’ll just get tired of worrying about it and go to my default, and at that point I won’t be able to afford to lose any weight.",False,True
