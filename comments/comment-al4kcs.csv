Nutritional info : 80kcal/100ml. Instructions say: add 300ml of water. So i just do 80x3=240kcal. Most noodles are like 340kcal/100g ( dry ofc). So It would make sense that 65g of noodles would be around 220 kcal (varies by brand but mostly the same) .  And the extra 20 calories would come from the packet. The only logical explanation I can come up with.",False,False

So I should multiply the fat ×9, then subtract it from the overall calories to get the calories for the noodles. Is this a thing? ",False,True

The flavour package doesnt really add much, except of there's oil in it, but that should already be included then. Hope this helps, ask if you don't get it!",False,False

The packets I have at home don't tell me how much cals are in the noodles itself, just the entire packet. Due to the fact the noodles can be eaten raw (hence they are precooked, likely fried, bc you can't eat raw regular or ramen noodles) and that they come with oil for flavouring, I deduced its unlikely the dried soup powder that makes it high cal.
