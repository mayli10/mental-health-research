I lost a remarkable amount of weight since my ED started(one year ago) but she never questioned how. My mental health is bad. Like I want to kill my self bad. She never told me shit, well, actually, she makes fun of me because I look like a ""skeleton"" and I never eat. I told her I lost my period. She brought me to a gyn, they gave me a birth control pill to restore my period that MYSTERIOUSLY went away, and now I have to go to more appointments to figure it out. Yes, I could tell her, but I feel like she would not understand me. I'll let a doctor explain it to her. I'll have access to recovery only once I'm 18, which is in 4 months so at this point I could care less. Everything I do is a massive cry for help but no one hears me.",False,False

She never noticed. Or if she did, she pretended not to. Now, as an adult, I've come to realize that the very fact that these things run if my/your family is reason enough to believe that your mom probably has a lot of her own battles, and perhaps she's just not equipped to handle someone else's. The best route would be some form of therapy, with someone who is willing and able to listen and help you. If you're still in school, you could start by confusing with a teacher or counselor you trust, and they should get the ball rolling on who to report to so that you get the help that you need.  It's so natural to want your parents to console and comfort you and help you through rough times, but your parents aren't always mentally well enough or emotionally mature enough to do so. This was one of the hardest things for me to accept, and I'm still trying to forgive my mother for not being there for me in a time of need.  For the self harm bit- medication and therapy worked wonders for me. I only had to stay medicated for 2 years, and was able to safely ween off of them. The pills made a world of difference. It's like being vitamin deficient - it takes a few months of putting the good stuff back into your body before you start to feel well again.  I hope you can find the courage to reach out to someone at school, or to make yourself an appointment with your GP who can refer you to a psychiatrist and therapist (if your insurance covers this).",False,False
