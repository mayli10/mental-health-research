They can’t read your mind and you will get the most benefit if you are open with them.   You would only be involuntarily hospitalized if you are an immediate threat to yourself. So in other words, saying you have felt suicidal is okay. But if you have a plan to carry it out, they are obligated by law to alert the appropriate authorities.   Also relevant but probably won’t apply: immediate threat/harm to you or someone else could be reported to police. Ex: planning to hurt someone/someone hurting you (self harm not included)",False,False

""Danger"" in this sense usually means life-threatening danger--not just self harm. You should be as honest as possible with the therapist to get the most out of it; if they don't know what you're struggling with they can't really help you, and if you don't want help with something it's still probably better for them to know. You can also discuss this with the therapist to make sure they know this is a fear of yours, and ask how they would deal with reporting something.",False,False
