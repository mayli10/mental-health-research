I know that before my ED started my weight really did stay in the same 10 lb range for years.",False,False

Normal people don't spend their whole free time worrying about weight and calories. Some people don't even know what calories are while I can count in bread rolls how many calories I used to consume on my worst days.,False,False

People w/o EDs spend much less time thinking about weight so they only have surface-level knowledge and don't care to be as accurate. It's a result of our fixation more than their ignorance. Although some people are a little ignorant when it comes to weight. I would honestly love to be that far removed from this lmao.,False,False
