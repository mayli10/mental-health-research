If you can cut down to weighing yourself once weekly (nude, first thing in the morning, after you go to the bathroom) you will get a better picture of your actual weight and whether it is trending up or down. The body is weird. I’ve been pretty consistent with my diet and exercise and I will still have weeks where the scale won’t budge but then suddenly one day I’m down 5 pounds.",False,False
