I can’t seem to recognize hunger unless it’s trying to bash in my face. Also, weirdly, if I don’t track food I don’t eat *enough*. So not only do I have to eat more than I feel like, I have to try to do it when I’m not that hungry, apparently. Who fucked up this bad when they were wiring my brain???",False,False

I've not been hungry today but I need to stop by the shop on the way home and am already concerned that for some reason I'm going to get hungry and impulse buy literally all the food (I'm not in a binging phase just now so this is totally unjustified but still gonna panic obvs),False,False

I hate being hungry because it makes me want to eat and I panic I’m gonna way too much. Then I panic when I’m not hungry because it must mean I’ve eaten too much because my body isn’t hungry? Lmao,False,False
