For me I had to like, change up the way I was spending each and every day. Woke up on time, made myself tea every morning, did self care, etc. Basically just kept myself *really* regimented with what I was doing as much as I could. Probably like 40-50% of my day was more or less the same schedule, with the other half being mutable so that I could like, actually do things lol.  I don't know if this is an actually helpful piece of advice, but I would go grocery shopping (usually with someone else so that I wouldn't be tempted to just buy absurd amounts of food) right after getting paid, get mainly frozen and pre-packaged stuff so that I was less tempted to just eat *everything* at once, since it was already portioned out. Once I'd gone grocery shopping (and this is the ""maybe not actually helpful"" bit) I would spend *almost all of the money I had* on non-food. Stuff for my room, online subscriptions or whatever, gifts for friends, etc. etc. Not having the money to buy two whole-ass pizzas every night really helped.",False,False
