When I was single I realized that my social life revolved around my ex so suddenly I was super lonely. My ED quickly became my best friend and soon became the centre of my life. As I got more and more underweight I pushed my family and few remaining friends further and further away until I was a shell of a person. I was literally too ill to get out of bed and had no motivation to socialize with anyone. I ended up being hospitalised for months and got back to a normal weight but now I'm out I just want everyone to leave me alone so I can starve myself in peace. I'm hurting everyone around me and it's tearing my family apart but anorexia is such a selfish illness and I think I'll always choose anorexia over having good relationships.,False,False

I'm still restricting to 700-800 cals a day; and still counting my carbs and sugars. also with me so focused on food i never talk to any of my friends online so they have all just distanted and now its hard to talk to them because its been so long and 30 mins in to talking to them i want to leave because i don't feel like talking anymore. I know i don't have any tips im sorry for that, but its probably because i'm going through the same thing in a way.",False,False
