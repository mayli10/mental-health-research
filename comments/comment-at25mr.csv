OP, I've been where you are. At the beginning of my recovery all I did was eat junk. It's okay. Let yourself eat those things. After a while my weight stabilized in the healthy range and I started craving healthier things naturally. Now my diet is well balanced but I needed to let myself have the junk for it to get to that place. ",False,False

It may sound counterintuitive, but I'm not eating anything with added processed sugar. That way, I still eat tons, and it's all super nourishing. The important thing is that if you cut out the sugary or fried foods, you still replace the calories with something healthy. I still feel guilt, but not nearly as much as I would if I was eating sugary food",False,False

Once it's had time to do that things will settle down, even if that takes a lot longer than you are comfortable with. I hope you are able to stick with recovery, it's so hard but you are so strong xx",False,False
