I love fruit flavors, last time I had grapefruit ice cream and it was absolutely lovely.  S - Sushi. Fish is a staple in my diet, and raw fish tastes even better in my opinion.

He always sends them to the whole family when they are in season. I've actually eaten the last ones yesterday. So sweet and juicy.  V - Veggie burger. I usually avoid meat, and while veggie burgers are no substitute for the real thing, I find them quite satisfying. Especially smothered in Harissa Sauce.  E - Extra Virgin olive oil. It's probably because I'm Italian, but it's the only oil I use (in minuscule amounts!) in my food.  R - Raspberries. I had them this morning with Greek yogurt and honey.

Wanna binge on a whole punnet? No problem, you‚Äôre full, and that‚Äôll only be 141 calories. Thank you strawberries.  T ea. Dessert flavours I love you, regular flavours I love you too just slightly less.  R opes, of the sweet tart variety. My go to binge candy. I love you, but you‚Äôll understand when I say I wish I didn‚Äôt even know you existed.   O ne, fiber. Brownies. Fibre fucking one. You are golden. I break you up, I microwave you, and you give me life itself. You sit, a bed of luxury beneath a low calorie ice cream and give me the illusion of decadence without the bulging rolls of fat. I am forever indebted to you.   N ut butter. Almond, specifically (peanuts, I just don‚Äôt like you, you have plenty of other adoring fans, you‚Äôll be fine) you pair so gloriously with a banana, but somehow I can rarely bring myself to justify something so calorie dense unless I‚Äôm binging, and for some reason you‚Äôre just not a binge food. I‚Äôve had the same jar of you all year. A like, not love affair.   G um, ah gum, a tale as old as time. The one thing I don‚Äôt log. I log black coffee and green tea, but not you, gum, I trust you, and you never let me down.   B lack coffee. My caffeine sensitivity doesn‚Äôt let me love you like I‚Äôd like to. But once a day you bring me to life and, if I make you correctly, light up my tastebuds. Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll never put milk in you, I like you just how you are.   U nsweetened almond milk. I mix you with the humble potato, the nooch, salt and my beloved mackerel to make the weirdest, high protein mashed potato of my life. I love it. It wouldn‚Äôt be what it is without you.   T una! High protein, low calorie, and we can all pretend that mercury isn‚Äôt a problem because you and I, well, we get acquainted every single day between the sturdy walls of a Joseph‚Äôs pita and mixed and mingling with the slightly dulled taste of lighter than light mayo. I‚Äôd never hit my protein goals without you, tuna.   K raut. Sauerkraut. Pile it on the plate, eat it from the jar, still barely touched my calorie goal. Thank u.   I nstant miso soup. A giant bowl for under 50kcal? Count me in. Salt to replace my tears? It‚Äôs two thumbs up from me.  N utritional yeast. Nooch. Ah darling, how you are there for me when I‚Äôm pretending to myself that I don‚Äôt eat cheese. You bring the blandest of egg whites to life and grace my potatoes with flavour I could only have dreamed of. When I‚Äôm feeling daring, I even make you into pesto, which naturally will rot in the fridge as it‚Äôs too high calorie for me to dare to touch it.   D ave, Dave Dave and your killer bread. 60kcal a slice. Delicious. Safe, but feels like danger. Every day you pass my lips you make the day better. Also VERY honourable mention to diet Dr Pepper, my saviour.  A pples. Pink lady only. Crunchy, fresh, straight out the fridge, though I begrudgingly have to weigh you both before and after as I‚Äôve quit my habit of eating the core. 9/10 taste, 3/10 convenience   H alo top, you need no introduction in these lands. Only vanilla will do, the lowest calorie and the closest in taste to the real thing. I‚Äôd break my bank the bank for you, halo top.

I need to stop and rest my feet, but really, I don‚Äôt want to eat - what better than a nori sheet! You‚Äôre light and thin (like in my dreams) you‚Äôre always there to comfort me.  G rape flavour Powerade zero. You are the only one who tastes right. You fuel my workout, you make me look like a diligent athlete, you replace my electrolytes and you electrify my tastebuds.   R x bars, a somewhat perplexing choice, as you‚Äôre high calorie and binge worthy, but alas, those times where I need to convince people that nothing is wrong, that I am but a regular athlete woth a regular diet, I pull you from my bag after a workout and the coach says ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a real protein bar! No chemicals, you take care of your body!‚Äù And all we‚Äôre fooled. Thank you Rx bar.   Y ogurt. Low fat, or full fat, you don‚Äôt kill me on the calories, you give me much needed protein and you make me feel slightly sick so I don‚Äôt want to eat too much more.
