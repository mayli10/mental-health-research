You take an *enormous* intake of air afterwards, especially if you held it for a long time.  This is exactly what happens, &amp; will continue to happen, with food if you continue to fast. It is your body's natural reaction &amp; maybe sometimes you can fight through it but mostly, you can't. It takes too much of a toll.  Eat! Eat enough for your body &amp; it stops demanding huge intakes from you. I know it sounds so easy but *feels* so difficult. It's the only way I have found out of that hell personally...Why not give it a try?",False,False
