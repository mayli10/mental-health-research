I feel like I could really understand where you were coming from with it all.   If your BDD ever gets better and you start feeling things like you need to be skinny not “because you’re ugly” but “because you’re pretty” and other dumb junk like that, know you’re not alone 🙏🏼🙌🏼",False,False

Plus the issues that come with being pretty. And like you said, some things might be improved but nothing that truly matters. I'm just sort of spewing out all the horrible thoughts I have lol.",False,True

Things like learning how to do my hair, dressing well, accessorising, etc. It's as though if I *behave* as though I'm confident and think I look good, I might come to believe it as well.   Maybe it might work for you too! Explore hair dyes if that's your thing. Buy accessories that you find aesthetically pleasing. It's pretty fun imo and you deserve it!",False,False

Personally I think unless I do my makeup really well I just look average and most days I look below average but I’ve had enough people tell me and am rational enough to accept that objectively, to most people, I’m quite pretty.  But pretty people are still people. If anything I feel MORE pressure to be thin because being pretty means people pay attention to me more and would notice more if I gained a lot of weight. Or would be more picky about my flaws. &lt;- that’s just my weird anxiety ED brain logic. Heck I even feel like on days where I look ugly people will be like “oh I thought she was pretty but she’s not”.  When it comes to dating I bounce between worrying that the other person isn’t attracted to me and feeling like they’re ONLY attracted to me because of the way I look. I feel like people will get to know me and won’t like me. And I feel like people only pay attention to me because they’re attracted to me and then they drop me really fast because they got what they wanted and were never interested in getting to know me in the first place.  So yeah some things might be superficially better as a result of being conventionally attractive but it’s just that, superficial. At the end of the day looks are not that important when it comes to the real things.",False,False
