So there may be a link there   But i don’t think snoring cares how much you weigh! My mom is 5 foot and like 90 ibs and she snores like a freakin freight train,False,False

My boyfriend is like 5’6 and 120lbs and he snores if the pillow isn’t correct. Could be the one you’re using. They say a contour or wedge pillow is best to promote quiet sleep.   I imagine there is somewhat of a throat and nasal design genetically that can cause snoring to be more likely, I snore sometimes too. I’m not obese, just regular weight. Depends on if I’m laying a certain way. Don’t worry it’s not about your weight :)",False,False

But snoring can be a reaction to dry air, a stuffy nose or simply just a really hard deep sleep.   If it worries you, try some breathe right strips or some of those soft plastic grind guards. Sometimes they will cause you to relax your jaw which can help!",False,False
