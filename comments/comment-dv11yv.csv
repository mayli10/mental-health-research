Yes part of the diagnostic criteria for anorexia is to be underweight, unlike bulimia where there is no weight criteria but the difference is in the behaviours. Bulimics will binge and purge, take part in active complications to rid of the calories that they consumed, but outside of the binge purge behavior, they can sometimes be observed as somewhat normal. They may BP but may also eat a normal meal once a day. Whilst anorexia BP subtype, means that all of their behaviours match up to a normal anorexic, but they BP as well. A fine line is the weight for a BP anorexic, but not the complete factor as there is no weight criteria for bulimia, you can be bulimic and underweight. I hope this gives you a better grasp of the difference :) the psychology in the minds of anorexics and bulimics is also different but I will leave that rant for another time;)",False,False
