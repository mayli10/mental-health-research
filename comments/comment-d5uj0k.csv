My wrists and forearms looks so small and so do my calves but the rest of me looks like it has fat clinging onto it. I don't think I'm meant to have a fat body tbh, like even a normal weight isn't okay for my body type. I need to be skinny.",False,True

When I’m underweight, I look normal and nobody can even tell. When I’m normal weight, even at the lower end of it, here comes the gut and double chin. I’m glad I’m not alone! I’m trying to mitigate it by doing some strength training/body recomp to make me less skinnyfat...if I can lower my body fat percentage and add a bit of muscle, perhaps I’ll look a bit less tubby at normal weights, eh? But I loathe exercise so it is a slog.",False,False

Like I’m tall, too, but my fat literally only distributes to my lower body. Like I can see my ribs and collar bones hella clearly even when I’m on the upper end of “healthy” weight (aka fat and/or chubby), but my hips, butt, and thighs are MONSTROUS and PURE CELLULITE and it’s not even like “ooo sexy thicc booty” it’s like a sad, melted clay sculpture a blind man created trying to mimic a disfigured fertility goddess.",False,False

When underweight I’m a slight hourglass with a 2 pack coming in but when heavier I lose some of my curves. At a healthy BMI of 20 my face starts looking chubbier :( I wish I could look hot while normal weight.,False,False

I saw someone the other day in r/progresspics that was an inch shorter than me, 10 lbs heavier than me, and had a better stomach than I do. Really fucked me up. Like why am I trying lmao, my natural fat distribution has ruined me.",False,False
