I genuinely don't even know if she was actually skinnier than me or not. But I don't know, there's just something about how similar she looked to me but *better* somehow that was jarring.",False,False

I’m clean and extremely anxious- you’ll catch me scrubbing the whole place 2-3x a week to remove any evidence of food or grossness that could be there. I will frequently buy groceries and offer them to you enthusiastically so it looks like I have food but I’m not the one eating it. I’ll never use the kitchen unless my boyfriend is over in which case I’ll make a big elaborate meal and likely try to offer you several portions. I won’t use the dishes because I’ll secretly have a stack of chopsticks and paper plates in my bedroom for the times I order takeout to eat in my bed while the tv plays too loudly. Once or twice a month you’ll hear me playing the same 3 songs loudly in the bathroom and a hacking noise- don’t worry about it. If your BMI is even close to underweight, don’t consider applying. It’s best for both of us.",False,False

Shameful as it is to admit, I ignored a perfectly good room for rent ad because this one girl was my age and looked similar to me (olive skin tone, same hair shade, similar length but hers was glossier) but skinnier than me and that was just way too much of a trigger.
