Sounds like you found one of your therapist’s blind spots! Either that or some of her own beliefs/issues may be getting in the way of her fully accepting where you’re coming from. Projection is a real thing in therapeutic relationships!  Also, I just want to say that I understand the jealousy about the cancer patient. I experience the same thing. The jealousy is so instant, red hot. Followed by guilt and a “what the fuck, brain?!” You’re definitely not alone in this. &lt;3",False,False

She seems out of her depth, like the most she's ever heard about EDs was gleaned from textbooks. This happens. It's not your fault. Not every therapist can know about every topic. I hope you can find the help you need ❤️",False,False

She should also know better than blaming ED on vanity; vanity + ED and body dysmorphia are all symptoms of deeper issues. Whether it be trauma or perfectionism or childhood issues, it's rarely vanity on its own. People don't go to therapy to cure shallowness; they go to therapy to help with deep issues. Your feelings are justified - these are things a mother or friend would say to trivialize and dismiss the gravity of a problem, NOT a therapist.",False,False
