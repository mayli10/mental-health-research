I’m not sure “scare her” is good advice though lol. Maybe “Hey __, your smile is SO pretty, please don’t hurt it.” Idk.  Ultimately, she’ll most likely need therapy to get better. It’s really hard to love someone and want to help, but I feel that EDs are similar to addictions, and you can’t fix it for anyone else. She’ll have to want to put in the work for recovery. You can continue to be a supportive friend and a listening ear though!",False,False
