So I decided to walk to my GF's house.  On a busy road.  In the middle of the day.  I had not eaten too much for it to work, it just took longer.  I ended up spraying my guts out all over the door and entryway of this bowling alley (which was closed, thank god).  I puked with such force that I was frozen to the spot, I couldn't even move somewhere else.  Did I mention that this was on a busy road in the middle of the day?  So after what felt like forever, I was finally empty, and I stood there for a minute, observing the horrifying mess I'd made.  Then, not knowing what else to do (since I didn't have any way to scoop up my vomit, and nowhere to put it if I did), I just.....walked away, and carried on to my GF's house.",False,False
