You are hungry, and you decided to give into it. Your irrational reaction signifies that the eating disorder took back over.",False,False

It’s been a really heavy day with a lot of emotions and having this ED can be really isolating at times.   While my ED didn’t stem from trauma it’s definitely a vessel that use now to cope with acquired trauma.    And thank you for the reminder not to give up❤️,False,True

Sometimes we end up with an ED to handle trauma, whatever kind it is.  What isn't true, though, is that you're disgusting.  Or a failure.  None of that is true.  You're a very scared and upset person though and I wish I could give you a giant hug and say it's okay.    There is always hope at getting better.  Don't give up.",False,False
