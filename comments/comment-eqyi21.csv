I've got really bad ADHD, so it started with me just drinking it every now and then so that it'd act like a weak focus med. Then I started drinking it every *day* to act like a focus med. Then all *throughout* every day to act like a focus med. Then *more* caffeine *more often* throughout every day, until at some point I finally passed over the threshold from ""this helps mitigate my ADHD symptoms"" into ""holy shit I am stimmed the fuck out like I'm taking drugs this is the *shit*"" and then that snowballed more and more until eventually I wasn't just drinking that much for the *stimming*; I was drinking that much because I started to like how it felt to fucking *overdose on caffeine*. It was craaaazy shit lmao.",False,True

I only managed to kick that habit back in late October or so cause it was highkey fucking with just about every single aspect of my life, physically and mentally. I ain't looking to develop a sizable dependency *ever* the fuck again; you can trust me on that lol. The only remnants of that addiction is a need every other day or so to drink a small mug of tea or coffee in the morning. The only reason I had six mugs this morning was cause it was really tasty and my Binge Brain decided it needed to consume as much of that yummy shit as it could lmao",False,True

I developed a dependency on caffeine towards the end of last year. Started as a way to suppress my appetite (used with ephedrine) and before I knew it, I needed more and more to get though the day.
