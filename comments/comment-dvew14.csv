I can't comfort you because I can't even comfort myself. This world has a way of making people feel alone, though, and I just wanted to say that I feel just the same as you. You are not alone. I am a shell of a human being and I hate it. I don't have a personality, I've lost interest in everything but food and I can't carry conversation any more. I'm drifting away from every bond. This disorder sucks. I don't even care about being thin anymore, I just want to disappear. I hope you feel better tomorrow. I hope you get a good night's rest, drink whatever beverage you like most and stay hydrated, I hope that you treat yourself with compassion. Honestly all that any of us have is ourselves, in the end. You are your own lifelong companion. Life is lonely most of the time and sometimes you can spend years in misery for one fleeting moment of happiness but I think it's worth it.",False,False
