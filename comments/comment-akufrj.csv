And for a while I was actually a participant, making elaborate baked goods as a means of living vicariously through my co-workers and win their undying admiration by feeding them. It was like an ED/bipolar baking championship going on in my kitchen every week. I eventually had to stop due to time constraints.   Now I bring my food to work and I don't go in the break room. Ever. I keep my food in a cooler in my locker and I eat that only. It takes huge restraint to not chow down on donuts during ""Sunday funday"" (breakfast every dang sunday) and staff meeting left overs and everyone else's homemade stuff they bring in. ",False,False

People bring so much food that our TWO mini-fridges are filled to the brim with stuff like cakes, pastries, cookies, cheese, ham, bread, butter. Not only that, but I'm the youngest, so everyone feels the need to baby me and monitor what I eat, so I can't just ""forget about lunch"", they /have/ to see me eating something.  &amp;#x200B;",False,False
