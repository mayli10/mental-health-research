It comes and goes and mostly Iâ€™ve found some control so I hope I can help. When I start not eating it can be so hard to eat again. I have a favourite meal that helps if someone else can make it for me, mines cottage pie. I eat just little bits through the day n build up my energy again. If solids are too difficult then I make smoothies and milkshakes that give me some nutrients and fill me a little. Do you have anyone to help bring you things so you donâ€™t have the added stress of staring at the kitchen cupboards? Always remember your beautiful no matter what.",False,False
