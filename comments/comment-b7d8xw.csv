I have been a part of the community since '12, and though I love some of the people on there to death, it has gone to shit. it is steadily trying to improve, especially on the fighting issue, and has come a long way since last year though, but still.      i think the issue is just a looooot of new young people joining, including a fuckload of \`stan' community people, who can have very toxic attitudes. I wrote a long rant on there about cancel culture a few weeks ago and how ridiculous it is and how its ruining ed twitter. ",False,False

Maybe because it skews young there is so much complaining and drama idk but I hated it. So much policing of other people’s behavior. Like I saw one account threatening to unfollow mutuals who followed this one “problematic” account and I just rolled my eyes because who takes social media THAT seriously. ,False,False

I can just spam my stress and self-hate in a way I can't do on here, and I'm too scared to do it on peach.   But yeah. Every time I log on there's new drama happening lmao.... Yesterday it was oatmeal, the day before it was some tiktok girl, and before that it was some girl who called people ugly and poor I think? It never ends... I wonder what today's spicy tea is gonna be...",False,False
