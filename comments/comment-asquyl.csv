I barely even have the energy to lift and I certainly haven't increased my weight in MONTHS. But..I haven't lost as much muscle either.   I'm a cancer exercise specialist and train cancer survivors and patients and am myself a cancer survivor. Weight lifting is beneficial for more reasons than increasing 1 rep max.   1. Any continued load to muscles puts load on the bones and protects bone mineral density.   2. Lifting changes metabolism even in the absence of weight changes. It utilises different metabolic pathways and changes the density of certain enzymes in your muscles that protect them from muscle density loss as well as let you utilize more oxidative processes at high exercise intensities.   3. It's fun. It just is. Even at 10 lbs it's just fun.   4. Variation of lifts is a bit more mentally stimulating than the same steady state cardio. ,False,False
