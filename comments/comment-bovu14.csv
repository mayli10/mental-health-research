Onviously suffering from full on anorexia for years and years and it took a pretty serious relapse to bring me out of my denial. Now i'm trying to be more honest with myself about everything and it really helps me catch the early warning signs of a relapse easier (doesnt always work out though because here i am at 500 k/cal a day again but it's whatever).,False,False

The sample size wasn't the largest, but there is a theory that these two different groups have trends. Unfortunately, the binge-first group tends to be a lot more treatment-resistant than the restrict-first group (who actually respond fairly well to treatment).  It all makes a lot of sense to me though. Of course something spontaneously engrained into you as a child is going to be a lot more difficult to treat than something that developed later on in response to something else. Not to say the other group can be less severe, but it's just different.",False,False

I think I figured out that the start of my disordered eating started with some possible instances of grooming growing up. I don't really remember too much of what happened with that person, and for the longest time I thought it didn't even effect me, but then I realized that my shitshow of a relationship with food started with them.   When looking back at how far rooted this all is, it's like, what chance do we even have?",False,False

Used to even buy food with my credit card that my wife doesn't look at then I would eat again when I got home.

I also will be great for a while then binge for days on end.    It's all about picking yourself up, try to figure out the triggers, and keep trying.  Don't give up.  Seek help if you need it.
