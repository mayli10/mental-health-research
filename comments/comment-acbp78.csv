I've given myself a pre-birthday GW. If I meet it then I can start planning, if not then I'll make an excuse as to why I can't have it.",False,False

One time I was so fucking sick in class and my nose was running like crazy, but I didn't get up to get a tissue because I didn't want to make my fat self more apparent to everyone else in the room. I'm holding off on pursuing my dream career and applying for internships because I'm terrified of showing up to interviews fat, or somehow making it and being the fat girl in the office, or even working at all because I don't deserve it yet because I'm still fat. It's terrible.   That said though. You're totally right, Spanish has nothing to do with your weight. Vacationing and having a good time has nothing to do with your weight, none of you family members care if you've gotten to your ugw yet and neither will all the Londoners. I know it doesn't change anything but please try to remember that you still have worth outside of your weight and appearance, and you're allowed to be happy and fulfilled regardless. You're loved and you always will be, weight change or no.   I say all of that to you and don't yet apply it to myself, so I totally understand if you don't believe it either. But if you repeat it often enough, you will. Be happy today, and again when you go to London with your family. You totally deserve it &lt;3",False,False
