I wrote down food - not calories, never really counted those for a while so ease myself and keep the anxiety realistic.  Then I was told in my recovery program to keep a journal of food (NOT calories) and Ed-behavior like exercise, b/p, c/s on the left side, and feelings on the right side of a note book.  Have been doing it since September. I love it!  I also track my weight, from the weekly weigh in, in my outpatient program :)",False,False

This makes me feel so much better. I thought I was some psycho for wanting to look back and see my behaviors and stuff.

I log my weight, BMI, calories eaten, amount of water drunk, and whether I binged/purged/self-harmed. I find it strangely comforting to look back at the pages from when I weighed less. It makes it feel ""real"", and it's proof that I actually *was* smaller.",False,False
