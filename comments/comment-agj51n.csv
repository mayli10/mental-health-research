Something like sarcastically saying ""I'm such a monster!"" after eating 3 cookies.   I've actually notice it is something my brother in law does too. We were both overweight as kids/teens.  Actually your story makes me remember the time he and I attacked a package of Peanutbutter Oreos together. We were both monsters that night. We were also both high as shit on some edibles he made.",False,False

I'm sure you know that. But i relate. I feel the same way when people comment in any way regarding me and food intake. I just can't take it and I shut right down. Being a grown ass person and not being able to talk about eating with other people make me feel like such a failure. I'm working on it but fuck. ,False,False
