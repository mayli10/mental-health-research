You should of course be able to talk about anything with your boyfriend, so if he does want you to stop talking about your ED I would say that's a bad sign.",False,False

It’s likely that if you stop telling him about your ED, it will make his worry worse. He really cares about you, and hiding it won’t take the concern away—it just adds a layer of doubt, confusion, and sadness that you don’t trust him to be able to bear the burden. He’s told you that he wants to know about it—he wants to be with you, is willing to carry it. Although knowing about your ED makes him afraid for you, it feels way, way scarier to know that you’re dealing with an eating disorder, but to not know how your ED is progressing.   The most powerless I’ve ever felt was when worrying about my SO, but not knowing enough about the situation to even try to help. When they started to tell me more, there wasn’t anything directly I could do to make things better—I’m not a therapist, or a doctor, and I certainly don’t have mind control. But it felt better to know that they trusted me, and were willing to let me try to be there for them—even if it was just giving a hug on a bad day—instead of dealing with it completely alone.   Something that might help is seeing a couples’ therapist together,* so they can be around when you’re talking about your ED—preferably one with some experience with ED’s. They can help your boyfriend understand how to be there and provide support, and that it’s normal to not know what to do, and it isn’t his job to ‘save you’. In my experience, having a confidential third party around when talking out confusing, scary, personal topics, like an ED, helped make it seem less overwhelming.  *Ask during the first session what their policy is on disclosing information (usually it’s ‘if the client is in immediate danger of harming themselves or others’, but different therapists have different interpretations of this).",False,False

I've never cried in therapy, I need to start, lol.  Most of the issue is not wanting to recover, that's hard to understand from a neurotypical standpoint I think. But I like the bulking idea. Even if I don't see the light at the end of the tunnel it's good to imply that there is one.",False,True

Not all of it, of course, as I'm sure your boyfriend still wants to know and be in the loop, but just enough so he's not overwhelmed by the negativity. Start bulking up a lot of your food talks with him about things you're hopeful for- recovery goals, things you're proud of that you did that day, things you're excited to eat!",False,False

If you're able to share it in a calm and more.. objective way, as opposed to just venting your self hatred, it seems to be easier to digest and handle for him. It's probably important for you to be able to talk to and rely somewhat on him for a little support, so don't feel like you have to shut up about stuff entirely!",False,False

I think it's mostly the self-hatred that upsets him, not so much the behaviors, so probably best to keep my mouth shut about that, lol.",False,True

Being open about the tough stuff creates intimacy and trust and brings you together, and totally closing him off from such a big part of your life will make you feel distant and alone. However, it can take its toll when he has to handle it all the time. Maybe if there's someone else you can talk to sometimes while also talking to him here and there about it?",False,False
