The cold stone sweet cream one is my addiction!!! The cinnabon one looks soooo good too!   I've had butter in my coffee and.... It's okay. I actually like the idea of putting garlic in my coffee because I love savory food more than sweets. I will definitely be trying that ! ,False,True

Last month they got some Chocolate Peppermint creamer (from the same brand) and it was pretty yummy, so they picked up some Cinnabon Cinnamon Roll creamer (same brand again) and omfg, its fucking heaven.      Im not sure Ive ever actually eaten anything from Cinnabon, but you know how good it smells when you walk past the store in the mall? It tastes exactly like that. I actually went on a coffee kick and was jittery and had super high anxiety for days cause I went from 0 cups a day to multiple cups a day all of a sudden cause of that creamer.         **BONUS WEIRD COFFEE TIME:**   Sometimes I like my coffee black, with a pinch of sugar, a tiny bit of butter (or margarine if thats sadly all we have at the time), and a little bit of garlic powder.      Most people get hung up on the butter part for some reason, even though its actually normal practice to put butter in your coffee in certain places in the world.      The garlic part though? Yes thats weird, but its also really good. It makes the coffee taste like more of a meal then a drink. That helps with cravings and hunger pains, especially if Im fasting, don‚Äôt have time to eat and can only have a coffee, cant handle solid food atm, already ate way to much but Im still hungry, etc.",False,False

I find artificial sweeteners sickly sweet. Which I don‚Äôt mind, because I avoid them anyways considering all the research I found on them causing (or at the very least being linked to) weight gain.
