Even at times when my ed doesnt affect my eating habits i dont really drink much water (coffee only) so my body should be used to it since i'm drinking much more when i restrict.  And i didnt really change anything or did less skincare (i guess?).,False,True

Therefore if you are restricting you should drink more water to conpensate.  Could it be from underhydration?  Also, when I restrict my self care is generally lacking. Perhaps your regular skincare routine has been upset and that is enough to throw things off? Not implying you are uncleanly AT ALL...just that sensitive skin reacts to like everything.",False,False
