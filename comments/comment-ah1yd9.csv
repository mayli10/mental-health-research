My dad taught me that old plumbing can be sensitive and it could also be other things like grease going down the drain or the type of dishsoap someone is using. I have really old plumbing so I purge in the trash.",False,False

I used to work for apartment complexes, people flush all sorts of shit down, so it's pretty common to have backups. It's recommended to pour drain cleaner and to snake out the sinks/showers every few months or so. Hair is the biggest bitch, it gets caught in the pipes and causes other stuff to stick on it. Also what you're purging is organic and will go down the same as any other waste (unless you're purging full chicken bones lol). If you're worried you could buy a snake in any home improvement store and some drain cleaner and try to clean out the shower and sink to see if there's a backup.  ",False,False
