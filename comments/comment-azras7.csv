I'm mainly stuck in this situation because;  * I'm incapable of getting a job, it seems.  * I spent my money on wants, not needs.   * I let other people eat my food.    You are a very kind-hearted person to check in and offer help though. I love how people in this community really seem to care about one another. I've never had that before. &lt;3",False,True

But the main reason I am commenting is because I realized it's only the 11th and you're talking about next month, and three weeks is kinda a long time to not get to make your own choices about it. If you don't have any help or resources where you are and you're legitimately in a bind PM me and I can try to help. This is a community, dangit",False,False

I've noticed a huge emotional difference in myself between when I'm voluntarily restricting, and involuntarily doing so. I find it hard to get that buzz I get from voluntarily restricting. I think a lot of the reasons we have EDs and restrict our food is from control, but what control do I have if I'm not eating and it's not my choice?  Hope you're doing okay OP, it'll get better.",False,False
