Like, in their mind, they think a serving of Doritos is AT LEAST half the bag, but that's because they only eat them at parties or for movie nights or some other special occasion, so they allow themselves to ""splurge"" a little. As opposed to people who snack on them regularly.",False,False

(i love videos about food/calories/meal planning/etc. but it's hard to watch those because it just feels like humblebragging)",False,False

I mean I definitely think that a lot of people don‘t really know what a serving size is and most people don‘t track their calories. But these videos also kind of annoy me? I just don‘t get it, like the one‘s I‘ve seen were all done by very  thin youtubers and they think all these portions are so tiny and they apparently eat soooo much  but I just don‘t know how you could eat so much and stay at that weight. God I‘m sorry I sound like a bitch",False,False

But in my experience, it really isn’t that normal for people to have a realistic sense of serving sizes and calorie needs. There are plenty of people who think they gained weight while not eating that much.  People often judge serving sizes by how much they fill a bowl or plate, not by actual recommendations or calories. And they frequently eat straight out of the container and lose all sense of proportion eating until ‘satisfied’.  If your parents (or school system) don’t teach you these things growing, it can be really hard to even know that you don’t know something, if that makes sense? For example, a lot of people grew up with a single parent, or both parents working and ate a lot of highly processed, convenience foods with little guidance on nutrition. These are known to be higher calorie and not as filling as more ‘whole food’ diets but people grow up thinking this is normal.  And then their kids grow up thinking this is normal. Etc.  I learned everything I know about nutrition in direct opposition to my families terrible eating habits. If I take an actual serving size of ice cream, they laugh and call it a kid’s size.   Have you seen secret eaters? It’s full of examples of people who seem to legitimately think they’re making healthy choices, without realizing they add 2,000 calories of heavy cream to their multigrain cereal.  People eat for convenience, not nutrition. And there’s so much conflicting information about nutrition that many people just give up trying to understand and follow bits and pieces arbitrarily that leads them to think they’re making healthy choices when they aren’t.",False,False
