The problem is I have no idea what a realistic range of calories for me is. TDEE calculators seem to estimate too low for me but people doing Minnie Maud claiming you can eat 2500+ cals without exercise indefinitely I think I would gain shit tons of weight on. So of course I try dieticians and they all do the shitty exchange system that I mentally cannot handle with the ambiguity....Don’t mind my rambling lol I just wish I knew the answer,False,False

So you have to eat a certain amount every day. Let's say for someone my height I would have to eat at least 1650 a day (I'm pretty active so that's a  slight deficit for me), but then I also couldn't eat over 2100 (which is a slight surplus at my current activity level). This way I'd have some days where I could be lax with eating and binge a bit (I have to really make an effort to eat over 2000 cals and it usually only happens if a binge was triggered) but those days would be evened out with the days where I only eat 1650 and I'm in deficit.  Of course, this is all hypothetical and I'm saving this knowledge for when I attempt recovery, because rn I'm restricting like crazy and purging when I eat",False,False

This one girl eats more than 2000 calories and she has food challenges all the time and she's slim. Like honestly I feel like telling her to fuck off with her recovery lol. If I could maintain that physique while eating that much I would not need an eating disorder.  I was TOTALLY thinking of Stephanie while you wrote this.

I feel the same. I have to count calories, or I end up eating much more than my body needs and I gain weight.  People are bad at estimating how much they really eat, so some feel like they can eat anything they want and not gain weight - but the truth is that they have a small appetite and feel like they're eating a lot even though it's a little. My husband is an example of this. He's genuinely satisfied by just nibbling on everything, because he just wants to find out what something tastes like and then gets bored of it. I have a huge appetite, so if I ate everything I wanted, I'd definitely be overweight, and eventually, I'd be obese.  I think youtubers show only their most interesting meals. They eat less when they're not on camera. If they really always eat huge amounts of very calorific food, they'll eventually gain weight, even if it's not showing yet.",False,False

I know if I ever properly ""recover"" I'm very likely to end up overweight. I've been all over the weight spectrum in my life, from overweight to skinny to muscular to obese and now very underweight.   I've never been able to eat ""normally"" and be skinny as well. I wish it was possible but it doesn't seem to be for me. Any time in my life (I'm 24) where I haven't been fat I've been obsessed with counting calories and restriction. Even when I was muscular and going to the gym all the time my mind was just numbers, numbers, numbers. I was a somewhat chubby kid and got bullied for it, which is what started the whole thing, and I've never been able to eat normally since. When I was a chubby kid I didn't even binge eat, i just ate the food I was given. I never binge ate until I started restriction.   I only realised i had an eating disorder like a month ago. I would still rather just stay like this than ever put on any fat. I would love to be muscular again (I'm  a guy) but the process of getting there is overwhelming and I know that I'll have to gain fat which will cause me to spiral and get fat again. I'm currently gaining weight on a ""1000 calorie deficit"" according to TDEE calculators. My body is just totally fucked and I can't really be bothered trying to recover any more.   I'm sorry i can't actually give any advice, but don't let anyone invalidate your recovery journey if you choose to begin one, no one else knows what you've been through and your weight says literally nothing about your mental recovery which is the most important thing.",False,False
