BMR is like if you literally laid flat in bed all day and didn’t move whereas TDEE factors in the walking around/etc you do during the day. like i walk a fair amount to go to classes and i have physical therapy 2x a week, my BMR is something like 1300 but my TDEE is more like 1700 because of the activity i do on a daily basis. even if you’re mostly just sitting on the couch or whatever you’re at least doing a little exercise when you do get up so the amount of calories you expend every day is higher than your BMR unless, like i said, you literally spend 24 hours lying in bed motionless",False,False
