My kids are about to go to sleep I could always just crash out on the couch I guess. Thanks for the suggestions! The bath sounds nice too but I cant deal with my body enough for a bath lol.   I'm really proud of you too! That's a really long time and certainly an accomplishment. I guess dealing with the guilt of over-eating and wanting to purge kinda made me lose sight of the fact that it has been a really long time and I've made progress. Thanks for the perspective!,False,True

If you are able to, sleep off the bad feelings! You'll wake up feeling at least a little better.   If you smoke weed, smoke some weed! It helps me w physical discomfort for sure.   Sometimes when I feel really bad I will legitimately  take a bath in a big t shirt :))) which is pathetic but hey whatever works!   Good job btw!! I'm coming up on alllllmost a year without b/p soon (not necessarily purging wholesale tho, but im way better than I was!), and it's been so so worth it and my life is immeasurably better. Proud !! Of!!! U!!!!",False,False
