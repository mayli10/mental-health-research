I remember when I finally reached out for help, it was so overwhelming to me.

I've been in all stages of treatment for bulimia, and it can be a lot different for someone with bulimia than someone with anorexia in my opinion. I'm here for you! I don't know if it helps, but I personally set a goal that if I go x amount of time without purging, I'll let myself get my next piercing (nose).",False,False

I have to be treated in a clinique and have no idea, how much it will cost. So piercing is not happening for now and I am going to get my shit together first.

That said, I am ready to just take it out when I hear from my dentist about it seiously damaging my teeth, or if I feel something's wrong. I wouldn't have any problem just giving it up from one day to another. I just want the experience of having it.

Also I know I'll be scared as fuck to purge weeks after I get it, so I take it as a motivatiom",False,True

I want ho have a serious reason to stop. I want to do what I wanted for a long time and motivate myself to move more and be active again.

Despite using plastic balls and downsizing the barbell to try to limit the effects on my enamel, the backs of the bottom teeth are quite damaged. I think a contributing factor was the pressure of the jewelry just resting against my lower gums/teeth while I was sleeping. It's just in there ya know...  Also, placement is really important. The first time I had my toung done it was angled oddly and as a result it would kinda pull at times, which meant it healed weird and was sore sometimes. I ended up taking it out after about a year. The second time I talked to my peirce about it and had none of those issues. So if you do get it done, be sure you visit a good peircer who has a lot of practice (not a trainee who will do it real cheap).  Also purging is even less pleasant with anything extra in your mouth.  Those things said, I LOVED my tongue piercing while I had it. If I knew what would happen to my teeth though I wouldn't have done it. Dental care is a luxury in this US economy.",False,False

My teeth are already kind of worn out, but the thing is, I can always take it out. Yeah, it might be a waste of money, but what isn't these days? Especially with me being bulimic and wasting hundreds in a month just for the food I purge. I have 3 tattoos which cost me 140€, I have my septum pierced which cost me 35€ and spending another 35€ which are mine either way doesn't change much.

That is not good for your enamel. If you’re bulimic (or just purging infrequently) you’re wearing down your enamel. That is not a good combo.   I fully support all tattoos and body piercings and self expression, but please be mindful of how it could potentially damage your teeth further.

It's hard to clean in general because of the location and adding vomit into the equation definitely won't help. The healing time for a tongue piercing is 6-8 weeks I believe so if you're in a position where you could not purge for that period of time you should be alright, but that's obviously easier said than done. If you use mouthwash afterwards and make sure the area is thoroughly cleaned it should be fine, but it is risky",False,False
