Really, I misspoke, part of it was probably also food weight too because I had binged before. But yeah I was super bloated when I started. I had been eating a lot of carbs too which causes water retention.  There are definitely many better ways to debloat than to fast though, for the record. I would not recommend it. And also there's a good chance I was dehydrated after those 3 days. I don't remember where my weight went after that but I would have regained part of it in food/water weight immediately",False,False

Like we'd just randomly run into her friend and they'd start gushing about her weight loss. Or I'd visit her mom's apartment and her mom would start rambling about how [friend] had ""gotten so skinny!"" ""gotten so skinny!"" like over and over again  Like I'm just tryna die because noooooobooodddyyy has EVER commented on my weight loss before",False,False

My personal record is losing 10 lbs in 3 days. Nine of those pounds was water weight. Only ~ one pound was actual fat loss lol. So it could be a similar story.,False,False

And I hate myself for feeling so petty about her having more self control than me.  And, also, I'm secretly hoping it's a fluke and all that weight will come back. And then i'm back to feeling like an a-hole bc I don't know how to be happy for my friend's progress",False,False
