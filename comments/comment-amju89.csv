Thinking does go yea. Better to take 100mg at once or 50x2 as you did? I actually take in the morning because I find instead of making me tired, it makes my agitated and hyperactive. ",False,True

The side effects are terrible sure, and bad for my health, but I fear binge / purge would be much much worse for my health.",False,True

It's a terrible drug, do not recommend. It definitely causes brain fog as well as a host of other side effects.   It can help with physical appetite suppression, but it won't stop emotional binge urges, so if you're prone to giving in to your emotional eating (which, let's be real, we all are, this is a mental disorder.) than its effectiveness to stop binges will be minimal.   I take it at night to help with the side effects since I work dayshift, ideally prevent nighttime binges, and try to go to sleep soon after. ",False,False

I don't think it's ever helped control binges for me but when I was at a higher dose I couldn't think like....at all.,False,False

I’m on 100, it let me go a few days fasted but idk doesn’t seem to do that much. I think it may impact my studies and concentration so may let it go.",False,True

Since then, my I've maintained (read: yo-yoed around) a weight about 5lbs lower than before. No clue if it's related or not. I know it curbed both my binge urges and my food anxiety for the first month or so, but I don't notice those effects as much anymore. And the cognitive side effects wore off for me about 3 weeks after titrating up to my full dose.  I'm on 50mg/day, in case that matters.",False,False
