If you don't use oil and cut out some of the beans, you have a full cup of chilli for 200-ish calories. If you want it vegan, switch out the beef to Morning Star crumbles.   Felt the need to clarify since I received a rude PM (not saying who, don't ask, let's just move on) that I was ""trying to trigger people"" by posting this recipe. ",False,False
