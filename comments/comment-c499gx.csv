Any progress is still progress. If you think going down 100 calories per week every week is too fast, slow down, maybe postpone the decrease for another week or two. It's okay. The point here is for you to be happy. Right?",False,False

I'm not sure if this is helpful at all but I try to find a silver lining :P",False,False

Sheâ€™s actually in treatment, and I am not. So sheâ€™s a good one to try and emulate.   &gt;For now, lets just try to get a little better, and be kind to ourselves!  Isnâ€™t that the truth!

I like this subreddit because it just feels good to know youâ€™re not alone sometimes. I downloaded MyFitnessPal (which could end being good or bad) and Iâ€™m going to focus on keeping my calorie intake under 1500 then work down to 1000 over about a month, 100 calories less every week.   Iâ€™m just so tired. Itâ€™s just tiring. Itâ€™s so much easier to not eat at all and not have to think about it.",False,True

I'm so sorry you're feeling like this.  It's so hard.  I was in a huge binge phase for a while and it was god awful.  I gained a lot of weight, didn't recognise myself in the mirror, felt exactly how you do right now.  The reason it took me so long to get out of it was I would try to immediately switch back to extremely low restriction, be okay for maybe two days and then binge again.  I know it feels impossible right now, but for me, managing to get to around 1000 calories a day with light exercise and being consistent took the weight back off within a month and improved my relationship with food a lot.  Being so very deprived makes it impossible to control yourself once you snap.  Now, even when I overeat, I'm not like a rabid dog scarfing down everything possible.  I know how hard it is and I know it's not a permanent solution, but it is better.  I hope it gets easier for you.",False,False
