I think your conclusion that the people most represented in your study are simply more likely to seek help online is pretty accurate.

REALLY IMPORTANT. haha. I'm an INTP and I see my personality over represented in lots and lots of online surveys. I'm quite sure that it's because this personality type is likely to enjoy using the internet. probably significantly more likely to use an online support forum than go to therapy or a support group meeting too.
