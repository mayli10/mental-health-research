I'm really proud of you for taking the right steps to get help. I can't imagine the kind of hell you guys go through (on a much smaller scale I can sympathize from my OCD, but those impulses tend to be a lot less dangerous/self destructive than my sibling's manic depressive impulses), but if it's any consolation, it absolutely does get better. My sibling got help when I was in high school, and now she's completley mentally stable. She eventually finished up school at her dream college, and is now sucessfully job hunting in her preferred field :) it took a lot of hard work (and time to find the right medication balance) but she's back to being her old self üíñ  I really hope things go well for you",False,True

These are usually the early signs of hypothyroidism that are easily missed by some primary care physicians.   *If your curious as to why it's a sign, it's because TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) is a tropic hormone produced by the pituitary gland via instructions from a portion in the brain known as the hypothalamus. The pitutary gland releases TSH to signal the thyroid to produce t4. When someone has Hashimoto's, sometimes  the receptors that bind to the TSH are damaged by white blood cells that are mistakenly attacking the gland, resulting in lower levels of T4 hormones. The hypothalamus realizes that the thyroid isn't doing it's job, so to try and maintain homeostasis it keeps forcing the pituitary gland to pump out a shit load of TSH, but that doesn't do anything if the receptors are damaged :/ I'm not a doctor, but that's what I at least remember from anatomy and physiology and was reaffirmed on the details by my doctor today",False,True
