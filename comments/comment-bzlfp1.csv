(And maybe also that people are generally less aware of it, and how awful it can be? But mostly this.)  If your eating disorder makes you skinny, you can be attractive. If your eating disorder makes you obese, well... I think we know how the world treats the obese differently than the skinny, in so many areas of life.   ... And this is all just so fucking awful. :'( :'( :'(",False,False

They're sympathetic to them.,False,False

Fast forward to a month ago when I finally gained the courage to tell her that therapy a couple years ago made me spiral in to restrictive behaviours and I've been struggling since, only for her to pretty much dismiss it and just ask me to book a full physical. For context, my BMI was overweight when I told her about BED and it now falls in the mid-healthy range.",False,False

You should know more about whether or not you need therapy than they do because you are of course the one who's actually experiencing your own feelings.  I think people don't take BED as seriously partially because of language. Sometimes people use the word ""binge"" just to mean when they eat more than usual (""tee hee I messed up on my diet and binged :PPP"") even when they experience none of the emotional distress that comes with a whole disorder.  It's sort of like when people say they are depressed when they are sad vs people having depression and wanting therapy. If they (as in your parents) wouldn't tell someone who was depressed and wanted therapy that being sad was normal, then they shouldn't tell people who have BED that eating a lot of food isn't a big deal.",False,False
