Also, if you're purging or even just restricting your electrolytes can be off and that can cause heart issues. I don't live in the US, but usually you can find a basic electrolyte supplement in the pharmacy (or with the ongoing keto craze even at a grocery store). I know 1kg can feel like the end of the world, but it's really nothing. Your weight can fluctuate 2kg in a day bc of water retention, and if you're working out bc of muscle swelling. It's scientifically impossible to gain 1kg fat in 3 days. Hope you feel better soon &lt;3.",False,False

For me it was more the feeling like my heart wasn't moving... properly? Probably fluttering or some other abnormality, but it prompted me to check it out and since my rhr has been much higher in the past and dropped suddenly I got spooked.",False,True

My RHR (especially sleeping) would fall to the 30s back when I competed in cross country in college. My current RHR hovers around the 50s and drops to the low 40s when I’m sleeping. I’m still active—3 spin classes and 2 lagree classes a week—but I’m putting in nowhere near the endurance cardio I used to. I get physicals annually and my heart rate has never been flagged as unusual.   If you’re physically active and have a low RHR, I think it’s fine. It probably becomes a concern if it’s not from physical activity, however.",False,False

However, just as with weight, lower (than average) is better, but [too low becomes dangerous](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/235710.php#normal-resting-heart-rate) with much less of a deviation from the healthy range. It's akin to how you can be 50 lbs overweight and only face long-term risks, but being 50 lbs underweight is deadly.",False,False

I immediately went back to restricting but I'm worried about my heart rate falling again and what it could mean. I'm scared but my brain keeps telling me dead is better than fat and I'm not in a place where I can afford resources to recover. I know for sure my cardio has improved but I'm just as worried that my heart is just rotting and idk? Idk what I'm doing. Idk how to stop. Everywhere I turn is fear. I don't feel safe at all. How can I ever eat a normal amount and not gain? How can I not balk at the numbers going up when I'm still so fat?? The idea is incomprehensible to me.  I have a question, is a low RHR really that bad? I'm asking because mine is in the low 30s and I want to know if I should be concerned. The lowest I have seen it is 31. Today the lowest it reached was 33 and as I sit here typing it is 47. I just thought it was a sign of fitness? Although it is lower when I restrict more.",False,False

It's easy to tell ourselves subjective lies, and it's easy to shrug off the objective signs of danger as not a big deal -- you're seeing the danger and trying to honor your body's needs. That sort of thing is scary, having to choose between what your body needs (more nourishment) and what you need from your body (for it to be as small as possible).  Progress isn't linear any more than the descent sickness is. A false start is still a start, and you're trying. Keep listening to the uncomfortable dichotomy of your needs, and forgive yourself for struggling to make the choice your body needs.",False,False
