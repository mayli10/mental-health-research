""Normal"" is accepting that your body will process the food and it will be out of you eventually. It's absolutely not right of them to act like purging is okay even if ti's just once in a while. It's a slippery slope and it may eventually lead to being something you do every few days or even every single day. Also, what kind of therapist tells a person they're just being dramatic? That's like the opposite of doing their job.",False,False

Admitting that you’ve been purging is a huge step, and I hate that you didn’t receive that care and treatment that you deserve.  You aren’t being dramatic.   Find a new therapist, right now.

Also ""once in a while"" doesn't mean shit, like no one is gonna tell you that ""once in a while"" meth use is normal bc its fucking not. Purging can be just as addictive (been down that hole faaar too many times to count since my ""once in a while"" days) so be careful babe, it's a downwards spiral.",False,False

How is purging ever considered normal what was your moms rationale? Also the dramatic part is unfair to you. Personally, I don't think purging should ever be written off as just something minor.
