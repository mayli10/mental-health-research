There are lots of silly looking and feeling jaw exercises you can do and see if it helps your jaw feel better and not as tight. If it hurts too much when you do the exercises , stop, and please go see a Dr! Normal stretching feeling pain is ok but it could indicate a more serious issue or progressed TMJ  if it really, really hurts.   Take care ðŸ’•",False,False
