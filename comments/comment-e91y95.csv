Sure you can notice it from staring at me for too long but i dont enjoy telling people about it. im a very “move in silence” type of person. so for me i feel like if i dont NEED to share certain information i wont.  i applaud you in your POV though. I especially enjoyed the slightly poetic remark “my goals are outside the Realms of Reality”. (i will be using this in my day to day vocabulary)  and i should have clarified this but she is my cousin so its not all that bad. i can just brush her off without having to worry about the consequences because we are just that close. we have been “friends” since we were in our mothers wombs. Literally our mothers would touch bellys :)),False,True

I feel like we collectively think that if we dont talk about it, then we cant 'spread' it. But that is dumb. I tell people the truth - that I have disorderd eating thoughts and behavior patterns because my goals are outside the realms of reality. It makes me angry and depressed, and i hate it. Because lets face it, a person with an ED is not in any position to be giving healthy diet advice. And your friend deserves to know that. At the very least, you need to find a safe way to decline their invitation to talk about weightloss.. i can imagine that must be triggering for you.",False,False
