If he knows then he should be more way more sensitive when it comes to your weight. And the main reason he should ever want you to lose weight is for your mental and physical health....not for his sex life...Geez...sorry but he sounds uncaring...I would NEVER say that to a partner who has an ED. I would dedicate my time with them helping them recover and helping them love themselves before telling them their weight gain hurts my sex life... Please throw his words in the trash.,False,False
