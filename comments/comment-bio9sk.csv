You know _how many_ posts I've read about celery. This magical green stick you can eat with low calorie dip.  Eat until you're satisfied! Cheap, delicious and low in calories. Almost too good to be true. That's because IT IS :')  I bought celery and a hot dip I really like, and was going to town when i r e a l i z e d  Celery is basically satan's vegetable. He handcrafted that shit to be so fucking disgusting it's hard to keep down tears. I even bought a BIOLOGICAL more expensive version. Is it better or do I know anything about the difference? No. But that's not the point. I'm sorry I'm ranting so much but HOLY SHIT is celery fucking gross goddamn and I've eaten some _digusting_ shit after long fasts. But this. You couldn't fucking pay me to eat it fuck",False,False
