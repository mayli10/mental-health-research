Most of them aren't THAT blunt/crude yet some dudes absolutely do say things like ""But I'd do you!"" as a compliment thinking it solves the issue",False,False

It's a) ridiculous and b) definitely an attempt to pin a very complex and hard to answer question on something random but seemingly right enough to call it ""solved"".  If I legit wanted to send an issue into a blackhole and never have it resolved, I'd blame the media too. How the fuck does one challenge ""social media""?
