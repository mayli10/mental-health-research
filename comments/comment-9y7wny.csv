Canned tomato, which makes up the bulk of your sauce, is also very low in calories- my go-to brand has 90 kcal in a whole can of diced tomatoes. A tablespoon of lard has just over 100 kcal and I doubt the amount of bacon you used had even that much fat in it, and of course even less got into one small serving.  Even if you did underestimate, it's probably not by much at all. I make tomato-based stews/bakes very often because you get a lot of volume for fewer calories.",False,False
