I’m 5’5 and 160.. my highest ever and I’ve had an actual child come out of my body. Wasn’t even my highest before. My lowest wasn’t that low (111lbs).. but despite the high weight I am in this horrible shitbag cycle. I want to exhibit healthy habits for my daughter and we eat together and I try to promote a healthy lifestyle.. but when I’m at work (or after she’s asleep).. the shitty habits take over. I fast at work, then drink at night then eat garbage.   Trying very hard to stick to a “normal” calorie plan.. but it’s either all or nothing. Can’t shake it.   And weekends are for purging. So fun.",False,False

I’m so glad you got into your first choice PhD program! That’s fantastic. Yeah, I’m hoping this new direction in my life keeps me on track. I’m definitely still using some behaviors but I can usually tolerate myself enough to keep them to a minimum. That’s an interesting perspective on maintaining weight- that it can be a source of control rather than the ultimate loss of control. I’m going to keep rattling that around in my brain. ",False,True

I, too, am a former anorexic (now w/ a BN diagnosis) and I'm just now flirting with starting the grad school application process. But more than that, I'm at the highest weight I've ever been at and hate myself for it.   If you need someone to talk to who gets it, I'm here. :) I hope you can get past this and enjoy your studies though, and sooner rather than later. ",False,False

Sometimes I feel like my current lifestyle is toeing a downward spiral, but somehow I am still standing and not completely nutrient deprived.   I've been flirting with my UW BMI for the past year and a half leading and as delusional as this may sound, I think I am actually getting better. I'm by absolutely no means a good example since I still have binge-restrict tendencies, but the fact that this is the longest I have maintained an okayish weight since I was 15 makes me feel like I have some semblance of control over my life.  It can easily go both ways for me since, I've been high, I've been low. I just want to let you know that sometimes it really does get better when you find something to put your mind to outside of your ED. My studies really helped me and I hope you also find a happy medium where you can be comfortable with yourself and hopefully free enough from this terrible illness to pursue your ambitions :) ",False,False
