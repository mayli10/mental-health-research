Its so hard because I had three kids and have gained 60lbs total over the past 7 yrs. I hate it. All I think about all day is food. Like ""you shouldnt eat that, you're already fat enough!"" And then I sit on the couch after the kids are in bed and snack. I can't exercise because everyone runs in and crawls all over me and make me want to rip my hair out, like come on I spend 24/7 dedicated to you guys I just want 10-15 minutes to get a workout in. I want sweets and carbs all the time, then get heartburn afterwards. Hubby lost 30 lbs in 3 weeks on keto and he just went on his first jog this morning when he got home from work. I'm nursing the baby and hes our last so I want to get everyrhung right for him but I'm just so done feeling like a freaking beached whale. I got a couple new tanks and some shorts and they're all tight on me already. I have no idea how to stop the cravings and just start IF without feeling like I'm going to starve to death",False,False

I know logically that I am more than capable of losing this gained weight and more in a healthy way that doesn't mess me up, yet my brain has somehow convinced itself that it's a fantasy. And I'm like, ""WTH?? I've lost this weight before. I know I can get to my lowest weight. Why am I thinking that it's almost impossible?"" I have these thoughts thinking that my body won't actually change if I eat a reasonable and healthy amount of calories on a deficit and also casually exercising, even though I've proved it to myself before that I can. But somehow I'm convinced that this time is different??? Like no.",False,True

Exercising and eating a healthy amount of food made me feel amazing!! But I’ve been eating like crazy lately and it’s made me too tired to even THINK about going to the gym.   It’s gotten so bad that my therapist thinks I have thyroid issues, so I guess we’ll see if that’s the case soon. Honestly though, I think I just need to get back on track. But it’s so HARD and I just don’t have the motivation. I don’t know how to GET the motivation.   Pretty much just here to say you are definitely not alone. First step is realizing there’s a problem, right? We can only go up from here!",False,False
