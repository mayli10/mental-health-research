I have a medication that makes me vomit if I don't eat before taking it and I definitely definitely think in the back of my mind think I won't eat. But I didn't tell them that.   I got diagnosed with other specified feeding and eating disorders because I'm fat but don't eat and meet criteria for anorexia and binge eating because I don't do it often anymore but definitely have done it a lot in the past and kinda go through phases of it.    Thanks for the reassurance. I sometimes feel like I don't belong. I saw a dietitian and they recommended two support groups. One was all people with restricted eating and super small and it was just super triggering so I didn't go bc I thought I would just get ideas.,False,True

You definitely fit into the ed community, no matter your behaviors/situation. Definitely nothing but acceptance and inclusivity here xx",False,False
