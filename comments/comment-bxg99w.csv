That sounds like obsession and anxiety around food. If you just need to lose weight, it's just calorie counting. But you want to get help to tackle your emotional and mental barriers to have a better life",False,False

About 2 or so years ago I got to my highest weight (434 lbs) by just constantly eating and drinking soda. I was just constantly hungry despite eating and being stuffed most of the time. My diet was mostly carbs, soda, pasta, bread and frozen burritos.  I was tired of the constant hunger and being so overweight so I turned to keto (high fat, low carb). With keto I lost the weight and I also got my hunger under control. Granted I went the other way and now I'm too ok with barely eating and I'm working on getting to underweight. I'm not saying to go keto but maybe take a look and what your eating. Like if your diet focusing on only carbs then your body may be trying to compensate for the lack of the other 2 macos. Like for me I'm still doing keto and the hunger is way less but because I cut out carbs I'm always thinking about carby food, my current thing is PBJ sandwiches. I haven't been able to do it yet but intuitive eating is where you listen to what you body is asking for and giving it to it. Like you crave chicken so eat chicken since maybe your low on protein or fat. Eventually by eating what your body asks for it'll stop the binges and over eating. Intuitive eating should be everyone's end goal but it takes a lot of work to get there.  This video is also helpful in explaining why we overeat. https://youtu.be/KHaCKudtVi0",False,False

I also live in Miami, and it’s almost impossible to find treatment here. I really don’t understand how it’s a major city and has almost no ED specialists. Also, just a heads up, if you do find ED specialists, most of them don’t accept insurance.   Try Gatewell Therapy Center; they have both ED therapists and an ED dietician. Also try looking on Psychology Today’s website and search for therapists specialized in eating disorders (you can also filter for those who do sliding scale, meaning they provide lower fees to lower income individuals).  The Coral Gables Counseling Center also has some therapists that treat ED’s. I’m sure that, if you find an ED therapist, they can refer you to an ED dietician.   I haven’t personally received treatment at these places, but I found them after much searching.",False,False

A dietician can be helpful if you're having nutrition issues, but if your issue is simply eating too much or too little, a therapist is the better way to go I'm.",False,False
