A normal serving size feels like a huge binge. I try to stay between 500-800 cals a day otherwise my anxiety is thru the roof. I try to have a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù day about once every 7-10 days but it‚Äôs hard and stresses me out. ,False,False

I cook and bake a lot so I taste as I go- like tiny dips with a teaspoon here and there. Afterwards I always feel gross and bloated and too full even though I've eaten like pretty much nothing.  Today I made those banana brownies from r/1200isplenty. Had like half of a freaking 135 kcal brownie then flipped out. Only other thing I ate today was my 500ish kcal OMAD. Pls.,False,False

Just had some noodles with soy sauce and some biscuits. In total like, 500 calories. Purged it because I felt like that was the only thing I could do.",False,False

Its like there are these weird cal zones that shouldn't exist. ""0-500"" are ""i am doing good today but shouldn't really eat any more. ""501-800"" are ""jesus. What am i doing? I am screwig up all of the hard work!"". ""801-1200"" are ""holy fuck. Why have you done this?"". And ""&lt;1200"" is ""i hate myself, but it is nice to eat this much too üòÖ"" ",False,False

But I sure do feel like shit when I eat 4-5 handfuls of raisins. That's only like 250 calories and I still purge it because it causes a panic attack if I eat something I didn't plan for. It doesn't make sense because I plan for 1500 a day and I'm still losing weight. 250 doesn't even make a dent in that.,False,False

I‚Äôll have a 130-170 calorie can of soup and then keep eating til around 350-500 calories and feel like ‚Äúomg I just binged so bad..‚Äù even after skipping breakfast ,False,False
