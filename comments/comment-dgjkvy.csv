I replace 2 tbsp of cocoa powder with 1/4th cup of pumpkin and a dash of cinnamon to make a fall version.  I typically crumble them in halo top or a whey smoothie.",False,False

It made me extremely bloated for the first few weeks of using it daily, but now my body is used to it. I stuck with it because it's zero calories. But so. Much. Fiber.",False,False

If you eat a lot of vegetables you’ll mostly be getting insoluble fiber. For me adding soluble fiber makes me feel fuller longer and also helps with the poops. If you can spare the calories (100 per packet) [these fiber crisps](https://www.metamucil.com/en-us/products/metamucil-fiber-supplement/fiber-thins-cinnamon-spice) are good. I’ve also made a “brownie sundae” out of a Fiber One snack brownie and Halo Top ice cream.,False,False

I’ve definitely had moments where I felt like I almost had to do that. I’m so glad you have a sense of humor about it and that the fiber gummies are helping you!  Btw as a tip for anyone reading this who wants to try fiber, the gummies are great but they can get expensive if you take a lot. I get psyllium husk in bulk online for really cheap, take 2-3 spoonfuls mixed in water a day and I poop like a damn champion. It’s the same thing that’s in a lot of the supps you’d find, so it doesn’t taste as pleasant going down but it still works really well",False,False

The highest fiber content ones i find are only like 20% dv and that seems like nothing. Also do they make you gassy because I will die before I encourage more farts from my butt. Like my BMs aren’t *terrible* but they’re not as frequent as I’d like so I get bloated and sometimes a lil crampy. ):   And TMI but pro tip: you can push poop out through your vagina. It’ll help you from having to dig in directly.,False,False
