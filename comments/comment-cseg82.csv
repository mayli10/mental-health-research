I know it sucks and you are embarrassed now, but it‚Äôs not forever, and now it‚Äôs one of our favorite funny ‚Äúcouple‚Äù stories.",False,False

It was humiliating and miserable at the time, but now I can laugh about it. All it takes is a little time, and maybe a ""shitty"" sense of humor.",False,False

So he took me to my best friends house who I have a crush on!!!!! Where myself and the other blacked out dude crashed, but when I woke up my pants were in the dryer? Like apparently the dude just carried them around with us all night and he couldn‚Äôt have at any point been like ‚Äúhey here are your pants maybe put them on?!‚Äù Then like a week later I saw the friend who is a cop and I just had to laugh and play it off like I wasn‚Äôt dead inside and be like ‚Äúhey thanks for saving the day! LOLZ!‚Äù   Forgot to mention I almost never wear undies so I was bare ass naked from the waist down this whole time.   Anyway just thought it might make you feel better to know we all do fucked up things and embarrass ourselves, that was just the worst of many dumb things I‚Äôve done that regularly makes me question why I even exist. You will definitely be okay! Try not to ruminate on it too much. I am being a total hypocrite by saying that but, ehh.",False,False

I know about 10 people who have a 'I drunk shit myself' story and it's hilarious every tine they tell it...but it wasn't that way in the beginning. You will move past this and move on one day, right now it's just a little shitty (no pun intended).  If it helps, one time I got so drunk on an empty stomach that when I went to sit down in my bar chair I fell straight back onto the floor and there was a loud crash. A bouncer that I kept calling Tito (His real name was Frank) picked me up and carried me out of the bar while everyone stared. Then I sobbed into a Big Mac and fries...",False,False

I haven‚Äôt shit myself before but I did engage in all kinds of alcoholic messiness in college while having an ED and you will move on!  I agree with the other posters about reframing it as a funny experience. Maybe even try, as you go over the memory in your head, reimagining it as being funny.  You hit it off with the nice girl in the bathroom, you made all kinds of drunk jokes about yourself, the hosts were understanding on your way out, etc.   Good luck, OP. These things happen.

So like when you're sitting there thinking about when you were super drunk, I try to go ""this sucks, I'm not going to think about this anymore"" and then you have to pick a new thing to think about (eg; the show you're watching, focus on what you're doing, or think about something happy) and you have to consciously choose not to think about being drunk.   It took me a long time to be able to direct my thoughts but it is so worth it. I do this when I'm talking mean to myself too. I hear my brain go ""why did I say that??"" And then I think ""ok, we're not talking to ourselves like this anymore. Let's try... 'next time I'll say x, y, z.'"" this article is super long but it gave me a bunch of stuff to look out for in the way I talk to myself: https://www.clinical-depression.co.uk/dlp/understanding-depression/understanding-depression/  The problem is, there's nothing to do about it really. It already happened, you can't fix it, and you're kind of just torturing yourself about this. I mean it happens is the other thing?? I've puked all over myself in the car with people because I was fucked up. It happens, and if that guys judges you, then fuck him because who the hell does he think he is??",False,False

As far as moving past it I don‚Äôt really know. I can tell you that I‚Äôve seen someone shit themselves before and they were super embarrassed, all I could do was tell them it‚Äôs ok, accidents happen, and then afterwards try to make it seem a little funnier so they weren‚Äôt so uncomfortable and embarrassed.
