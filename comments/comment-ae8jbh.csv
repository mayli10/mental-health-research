I'm a binge/starve cycler so looking at thinspo in a binge cycle does almost nothing for me. makes me sad I don't look like that. rarely stops me from binging though lol,False,False

Thinspo pics don't work for me either, but I wanted to lose weight for a trip, so I set a deadline and tried to lose 1lb/week. Let's just say it worked...",False,False

Iâ€™ve never lost or gained weight or binged because I canâ€™t deal with my body.   For me, itâ€™s compulsive and feels almost like a weird form of OCD if you will. It feels like a mood stabilizer, energy inducing, anxiety reducing euphoric package, all rolled into one or two simple actions. It makes me sad to think about the fact that people with EDs are so influenced by other peopleâ€™s bodies - but I guess itâ€™s just a different manifestation of the same anxiety and instability/trauma.

The only thinspo that affects me is if it's also another AA woman. Other races put me at a mental distance since we look nothing alike. It sounds weird putting it like that ,False,False

I scroll through it wishing I could look like that, but then ultimately realize the people I want to look like don't have my body shape or height and are also at a lower weight than I want to reach. If anything I end up battling myself to just stay at my sucky but normal weight body and eating maintenance. Then at the end of the day I acknowledge I hate my body want to change it, then start again the next day and over and over it goes.",False,False
