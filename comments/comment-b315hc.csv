It pisses me off that even though they have a lot of the same issues as me, they're not mentally plagued by it like I am because they don't see it as a problem. It's just normal, it's what you do!

I have a friend whos naturally tiny. He eats like once a day, if that. He puts his utensils/food down between each bite, and often takes sips of his drink between bites. He also eats quite a bit of junk sometimes, and he drinks *a lot* of Coke. Ive honestly suspected a few times that he might have an eating disorder, and Ive even brought it up, but he denies it. I wish I was able to eat like him more.",False,False
