Adding nuts, seeds, and nut butter really helps add up calories when you need to without adding too much volume. I also like avocados because they really help me stay full until the next meal, and they're super nutritious. Protein shakes are a great idea, too! Basically if you're looking to meet calorie requirements without overfilling your stomach, calorie-dense foods work wonders. I want to lose weight without starving myself but have an overwhelming urge to binge, and I always try to fast to compensate, so OMAD really helps me avoid more dangerous ED behaviors.",False,False
