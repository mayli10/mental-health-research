Like it's ok if a thin person does it, but not someone fat or slightly overweight.   Walk out in public holding hands with my boyfriend:  *thin me and my projection of others' thoughts* ""What a cute/badass power couple!!"" *fat me doing exactly the same*: ""Ew, what's wrong with that guy? He must be cheating on her. I bet she's a pain in his ass. He really must have settled, but he's so attractive, so it must just be that he's too nice and can't bring himself to dump her. Or maybe he just has a fetish for fat girls.""  Getting tattoos: *thin me*: ""Wow, those tattoos look so good, they really highlight her body, she looks so edgy and cool, yet approachable and down to earth."" *fat me*: ""Yikes, those tats are obnoxious. Trashy.""  This list could go on forever, basically for anything that makes me happy or that I want to do. I think what scares me the most is that in reality, I know this is a reflection of the cruel feelings I have toward fatness in general, including in others. I wouldn't say I'm a judgmental person once I've have a second to empathize and think things through, but my initial, brief snap judgments of peoples' appearance are often very harsh and cruel, and I am no better toward myself.   As cliche as it sounds though, I do think the missing ingredient is confidence. This has been proven to me by many people, of many different weights, who successfully project an energy (which you can tell is likely genuine) that they just do not give a fuck what anyone else thinks of them. I admire those people deeply; I just have so much doubt in my ability to ever reach that point, and I honestly struggle with whether I WANT to reach that point too. Unfortunately we live in a cruel world; looking a certain way does have real, tangible benefits which ARE related to the way that strangers silently judge you. In a weird way, it does often feel easier to just give in to the pressure of that and let yourself be molded to the way society prefers you, so you can reap the benefits.",False,False
