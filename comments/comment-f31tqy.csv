You need the food for your body to function which can help your emotions regulate!! Clothing sizes are clownery and even if that is the size you wear, our bodies fluctuate and I'm sure you'll fit into them again!! If you don't though that is completely fine. Bodies shouldn't stay the same forever!  Eating some food is a good time to calm your emotions, which will make you feel better, maybe not now but later. Meeting your plan is great and it's a big step that you've been making plans to help you.  Unfortunately recovery can be difficult, especially since its a choice that we have to make again and again, but I assure you that making the choice of eating tonight is the right choice 100%, and each time you make that choice it will slowly but surely become easier :)  We all love you here!! You deserve to eat and feel proud of your accomplishments of eating yesterday and today. The nutrients are great and necessary for your health. I hope you feel better soon as well. Now go finish this day off like a champ!! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3",False,False
