My journey began in binge eating as a child and anorexia in my teens and pushed my arc into bulimia as an adult.    Itâ€™s the only constant in my life and its appeasement is my goal. I am 36 on Thursday, materially I reached all my goals but spiritually and emotionally my ED has left me morally bankrupt. So many dreams unfulfilled but I am alive.   A machine preprogramed to exercise, restrict, binge, purge &amp; fast as its operating system. I have yet to break my programming.   I hate food it provides no pleasure, no sustenance, no joy. I am as ambivalent to food and my ED such as flame to a candle which it ultimately fuels and destroys ever so slowly.",False,False
