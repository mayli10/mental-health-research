And that sounds very manageable (holy heck 55k steps? Your feet must have killed!) Yes I’m hoping the health app on my phone can be a crude estimate of how much I’ve walked :),False,True

I meant jap just as an abbreviation just like i say aus when i say i’m an australian. Thank you for the reassurance &lt;3,False,True

I was in Japan not too long ago, it’s pretty easy to keep maintenance if you walk everywhere and the food usually isn’t very high calorie. When you come back I’m 100% sure your weight won’t really change at all.",False,False

I eat. EVERYTHING. Because i cant get it back home. “Its unique”. I eat like a foie gras duck i swear. No empty periods. Just a continuous stream of food. My organs would probably be a delicacy too at the end of it.   Gonna try to NOT do that this time. But we will see xD,False,False

When Im travelling i didn't purge as much just because i was walking around so much that i was basically burning off most of the excess binge calories. (One time in Shanghai I did like 55k steps! That's like 2000kcal+ burn!) Maybe carry a step counter so you can kinda have a peace of mind?,False,False
