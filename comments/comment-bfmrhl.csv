Whenever I don’t know what do to with my hands, I hold my wrists/collarbones to see if they’ve gotten any smaller/more prominent.  I bring homemade lunches to school, but I never eat there—I always bring my lunch back home and c/s the whole thing.  I weigh myself once with clothes, and once without clothes (all after going to the bathroom ofc) every morning to see the difference.  When I do eat a proper meal, I eat my food in the order of least calories for the most volume to most calories for the least volume. That way, I get full before I get to the higher cal foods &amp; I don’t have to eat them.",False,False

If I'm too lazy to do that then I'll just stand up while watching Youtube and dance and do side lunges and stuff. I can't wear like half of my closet cause I don't think my clothes look good enough on my body yet, I wanna save them for when I look good. I always buy the smallest size too so some of my clothes are too small but I know they fit or would've fit me at my pre-recovery state so I'm saving them. I also struggle with what to wear every day cause I don't wanna wear anything too tight or revealing cuz I'm a chubby lump of fat but I feel guilty about oversize clothes not looking oversize enough on me and I'm scared they'll make me look even bigger than I am...",False,False
