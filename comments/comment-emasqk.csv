He works in a restaurant so he will bring me home simple safe stuff like soup and knows I’m terrified of oil so he will tell me exactly how he made it.  And if I wanna have a fun night and binge or go out to dinner there’s no questions or comments. He’s also at a healthy weight but loves all the same junk food as me so that make it way easier to go all in when we get stoned lol.,False,False

It's like the voices in my head just settle down when I'm with him. Although, after he's gone, I sometimes start to freak out about what we ate. It's crazy how one person can help so much though.",False,False
