This was me for a while but I finally said fuck it and cut off 14 inches. Like you Iâ€™d been wearing it up most of the time and the ends were pretty damaged. When I finally cut it, I could let it frame my face nicer and it actually boosted my confidence so much. I felt I had some kind of ~style~ again lol. Itâ€™s scary tho, for sure. I was terrified Iâ€™d get another bad cut since my hair is kind of curly and unruly, but after many hours of research I found an amazing hairstylist person and am so grateful haha. Wishing you luck whatever you do ðŸ’–",False,False

My face is much slimmer and i feel like i could pull off short hair now. My hair is super damaged from years of bleaching but it was always my safety blanket. I now wear it up a lot and i think it'd look just as cute if i just cut it nd would be so much easier to maintain but I'm so scared I'll suddenly feel too fat for it once i cut it because maybe it's my dysmorphia lying to me that i look slim enough. ,False,False
