Brain fog is REAL and the insomnia I generally have from restricting is unacceptable leading into a big due date/test. I study early and often. Cramming is not an option when my brain is not firing all its neurons.   I focus on repetition so I do a lot of copywork and I make notecards. This is especially great for studying between lectures because you can just stick them in your pocket and go. I find this allows me to absorb terms, dates, and names without draining too much time or stressing myself out fighting procrastination.   I lean on safe foods and smoke a LOT of weed. Not the best strategy but the benefit of putting calories in with less stress outweighs the repercussions of  restriction. If that is an option for you, I recommend.  I plan ahead to be sure I have food I'm comfortable eating on hand before I start hitting crunch time. That way I dont spend a day wandering the grocery store like a zombie or buying impulse crap.  If the going is real tough I find beverages easier than meals. Smoothies and vegetable broth are staples.  Good luck on your exams!",False,False

And after exam week i can do whatever the fuck i want to my body. Maybe not the best idea but for right now it's the best i have. It's made it a lot easier to a) avoid foods that trigger binges because i tell myself i can b/p as much as i want when exams are over b) eat MORE, but healthy stuff, because i need to fuel my exam-taking brain  I hope you can find a better way than this, but if it's all that may work for you, go for it, but then when exam week is over try to find another way to cope with how you feel about how eating during exam week went.   Good luck!",False,False

If I feel like this is too much sometimes I'll just let myself eat as much fruit as I want (esp blueberries because they help with brain function) and the daily recommended amount of protein and healthy fats, which helps a lot.  Please try to eat a bit more, you're feeding your brain right now and it does need it. Good luck and take care of yourself babe!",False,False
