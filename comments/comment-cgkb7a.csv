I truly understand what you’re feeling. I’m not sure how far along with the transition process you’re in, but I’ve previously been denied HRT for saying I had some eating problems (and I’m about to get found out again by my new doctor whom I lied to yay). I really don’t condone lying to your doctor if you’re seeing one or plan on seeing one. I would suggest if you’re new to EDs that you don’t continue any further and try to recover. But with no details I’m not sure what advice to give you other than recover recover and recover. If you wanna chat with me any more I’m open to a PM any time. Stay safe out there.",False,False

Hormones will change fat deposits but you can't change bones and for one of my trans anorexic friends, she absolutely used to pass and she absolutely by her own admission does not anymore but she can't help it and my heart breaks for her.",False,False

At least if you take care of it you can get hormones, body changes, surgery, etc. it may hurt and take time, money and effort, but at least you can make more productive changes.",False,False
