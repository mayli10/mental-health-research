Sugar-free syrups and the scale could possibly encourage restrictive/orthorexic behaviour. Even the milk frother is iffy... I'm pretty neurotic but if she was my friend I would worry that she could feel guilty for not wanting to use it/own it if she avoids cream/milk/non-dairy stuff in her coffee/tea etc.  A milk frother is a cute idea for a gift though. I might steal that idea myself lol. Anyway yea I suggest something else she has mentioned liking. ,False,False
