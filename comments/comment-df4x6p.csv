Math and gym teachers not so much in my experience. Science is a toss-up, the more work they do with plants the cooler they usually are, the more chem and psychics folks can be tough. Foreign language— Spanish teachers not really chill with mental illness; German, French, Latin, Chinese, Arabic— probably cool as shit. Any career or technology teachers are gonna SEEM like they don’t get mental illness or teenage angst but no, they definitely do and will probably be delighted to talk to you about their lives. Career teachers (ex. auto shop, welding, wood shop, culinary, cosmetology, CNA) are also super super understanding about learning disabilities and all pretty much all struggled to focus in “traditional,” classes.    This got really off topic, sorry, and it might be wrong but now I’m wondering if others think it’s accurate.",False,False

Me and one other girl (we were both thin) put our real weights and all the other girls banded together and agreed to put 140 so no one would feel called out. Class of about 15 I think.,False,False

I’ve told this story here before but I had a class that wanted to “anonymously” put out weights on a chart and display it in front of the class. I went to the dean and told him about my disorder and explained that in a class of 10 people, it’s pretty easy to guess who’s weight is who’s.  He was furious that he didn’t know this exercise was going on, declared it an invasion of privacy and had it taken out of the class curriculum for forever.",False,False
