It was so fucking hard for the first month. Some nights, I'd roll around in the snow in my underwear, hoping the sensation would overpower the sensation of withdrawal. I have several friends who beat cocaine habits, and they say that they think what I did was harder. (I can't comment). But after that part was over, I felt no loss... I just felt fucking free.  I was compelled to try re-introducing it when Halo Top came to Canada, lmao. After cautiously eating a pint and finding that I didn't go fucking insane like I used to, I slowly tried other things again over the next year up until now. And like I said, I don't actually desire much of it anymore, and don't crave it more than I crave other stuff. But I am more cautious about treating myself to it than salty/fatty treats. It's still an addictive substance, even if I'm not addicted anymore.  The reason I still cook with stevia is that I can eat more for the calories. ",False,True

For almost a year, I went cold turkey on it. Just under a year ago, i started introducing it again- I broke the addiction; now when I have a small serving of it, it feels like enough for the day.  (But I mostly bake/cook with stevia instead of sugar, so that aspect wasn't a concern with the baking)",False,True

I'm so proud of you!  &amp;#x200B;  Did the looming feeling of uneaten sweets dissipate after a while?
