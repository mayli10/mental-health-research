A lot of it is blind faith and practice. Know that it won't stop instantly, but it's like working a muscle. The more you resist, the easier it will become.  Also, the further you get in recovery, the less you will binge. The less guilt you'll feel for eating. The less preoccupied you'll become with food. It all goes hand in hand.  I need to constantly remind myself, ""counting calories has never done anything good for me. My body knows what it needs.""",False,False

I deleted all my apps for a start (I know that doesn't stop you from mentally logging tho). I always tell myself I don't have much of an appetite even when I do because I'm inclined to eat less so feel less guilty so don't feel the need to mentally log? Also a change of surrounding always helps for me personally. No clue why.,False,False
