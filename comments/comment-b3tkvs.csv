Just a little- definitely not a lot. Electrolyte issues can having lasting body damage.   Put 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of No Salt [find it in a spice aisle near you] into a 2 liter bottle of water. That’ll give you some sodium and potassium. Don’t over do it or it could be equally dangerous.   Good luck ,False,False

I don’t know if it explains your symptoms but vitamin B12 is one of the only vitamins that’s really hard to get as a vegetarian.,False,False

I'm a vegetarian and eat poorly, so it might be. I also just realized I might be having a really long panic attack. I don't know if it is or not, but I knew I felt this somewhere before and googled it. Explained exactly how I feel. Also restarting some meds, I was (am) pretty convinced I was dying so I'm hoping it's just a panic attack for no reason. ",False,True
