The majority/minority designations in that logic are pretty flipped.   It infuriates me when people act like that. Fatphobia and thin privilege are real problems, and kids crying wolf at the existence of someone thin really just does more harm.",False,False

I'm sorry that happened to you :/  I hate the myth that thin people can't have body image issues and must automatically have nothing wrong in their lives.. I see it perpetuated in toxic FA/HAES spaces, and it makes me really sad. I remember being ~13 and believing that wholeheartedly. I don't know where I picked it up, but it became a huge factor in the development of my ED. Imagine my disappointment when I realized I was finally ""thin"" but more miserable and full of self-loathing than ever ðŸ™ƒ  There is no reason to EVER invalidate someone's body image issues, especially as a first response. And especially if you struggle with body image yourself! I'm sorry your ""friend"" had no empathy for your experiences. ",False,False
