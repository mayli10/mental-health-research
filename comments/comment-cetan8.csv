I would tell him that straight up: ""Listen, I find it unprofessional that you're commenting on my physical condition. You're not my physician team, and your comments are neither relevant nor helpful. I really like working with you [if this is actually true haha], but I'm going to have to seek alternate care [this doesn't have to be true, just makes clear you're unhappy] if you don't stop making comments about my body.""  I just have zero tolerance for this bullshit after too many years of crappy psychiatrists...no one should have to deal with psychiatrists who can't keep irrelevant medical comments to themselves. This is the last thing you should be worrying about when you're in such rough physical condition.  I'm sorry you're having such a tough time.",False,False
