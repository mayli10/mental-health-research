After an eating disorder, having ethics-based thoughts about food can make it easier to re-enter the eating disorder. If you can't stave off the moralisation, are there any animal products you can justify? Even if it's just two eggs, or a tin of sardines, animal protein is way more bioavailable than plant protein, and you need less of it to get on the front side of the protein curve.",False,False

I have always struggled to get enough, and after recently switching to a vegan diet I am only getting around 30 grams of protein a day. I did juat oder a vegan protein powder yesterday though, hopefully that will help.",False,True

It definitely doesn't tip most people, and some people will binge if they don't have carbs. But if carbs send you into bingeing, fats may be a viable alternative.",False,False

Bing is Microsoft crud anyway and you're right not to want to use it.  More seriously, do you feel like you are eating enough protein? Not eating enough protein can mess with your satiety levels (either paradoxically increase them or reduce them). Once you are running on the right side of the protein scale though, you might just be fat deficient, and could do well to eat more fat. And then there are people for whom minimally processed carbs (think: rice prepared in the pilaf style... toast the rice in butter or tallow and then cook it in beef broth. I still have 2/3 of a serving of pilaf and eggs in the freezer from many months ago, when I had a craving and just 1/3 of a small serving satisfied me completely) can stop a binge and you might be one of them. But at the end of the day, you admit to the reason you are bingeing in the OP. You're running a couple hundred calories energy deficient. Escalate by one hundred calories and see where you get with that.",False,False

But actually tho- just a little more carb will keep you full for longer. You don’t have to go nuts with it. A bit of dry toast can help!

A good way to stop it from happening is to eat regular meals and carbs.   Just remember- we wouldn’t binge if we didn’t need to!,False,False
