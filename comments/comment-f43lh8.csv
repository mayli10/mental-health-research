My experience and most of what I see in media has been that offices are an obesogenic environment. Wake up, sit in your car for an hour, sit at your desk for 8+ hours, go out for lunch, eat snacks throughout the day, drive back for an hour, by the time you get home you're too exhausted to exercise or cook something healthy. People always bring food as a way to show they are a ""team player"" or just for fun and most people do take it. You're in uncomfortable clothes all day, esp if you're a woman and have to wear high heels so it's tough to even take a 10 minute walk. 10, 20, 30, 40 years of that and no wonder 95% of the old office workers are obese.",False,False

Its crazy how it just goes hand in hand with office work culture.,False,False

There would be walkable paths to every building and all restaurants carry sugar free desserts and low cal options and every menu has all of the calories. Lol. I feel though!

And I think your comment is actually really thought-provoking. (As an add-on to my total shitpost!)  I think a lot of it depends on the field in which you work, but generally, if you're in a big, fast-paced city, working for a big company, your wellbeing isn't a priority to anyone. I think people *care*, in a personal, 'Jeanne at the desk next to mine knows me and wants me to be healthy' way, but they also just don't know much about EDs so they don't have the capacity. Unfortunately.",False,True

Does that make you less employable, or do you have to adapt so whatever you learn/relearn in recovery helps your performance at work too? Can it?   I think there is a lot of pressure on people in jobs to remain thin, or lose weight- and there's no time to do any exercise if it's a sit down job. The traits you listed are from sensory perceptions becoming more acute which is a psychological/physical effect of an ED on the brain I think  I'm not sure how employers view eating disorders- people think they are a myth/non existent/rare in some circles, and you're just reading too many textbooks :/ I think we've been fooled and there is a lot of misinformation going around",False,False
