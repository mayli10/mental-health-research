Reading all that gave me second-hand anxiety. The person I knew was similar but not quite as bad,   Don’t apologize, it’s a bad feeling and you need to vent it out. I think it’s a blessing she cut you off, and you should probably block her. I know it’s hard, usually toxic people are the hardest to detach from... but I hope you find true friend that don’t actively sabotage you.",False,False

Like I said, we always bonded over our body image issues. But then it morphed into her feeling competitive. She would guilt me into getting food by saying she won’t eat unless I eat. I was worried about her and wanted her to eat, so we would order food and then she wouldn’t eat it and would make me feel fat for eating. It was bizarre. I remember one day she had a meltdown at a Starbucks because I only ordered a water, so I had to order something, and then she didn’t even drink her drink. I stressed over drinking some sugary drink, all for her to just be tricking me.   If I knew me talking about my calorie counting upset her, I would have avoided talking about it with her entirely. Instead she made herself seem like safe space and then threw my problems in my face and said she doesn’t like me for it.   She would even trick me into “bumming it” when we would hangout and then would show up all dressed up so that I’d look less attractive. She wouldn’t let me meet any of her boyfriends or the guys she was dating at the time.   I’m sorry to vent even more! She was always “thinner” than me and it never made me feel jealous or competitive. My best friend would never be my competition- I’ve always felt happy to see people I care about thriving.   I just don’t think she ever cared about me or valued me because she would always try to tear my down whenever I was doing good.",False,True

I understand she has an ED, but that doesn’t excuse her behavior. At. All. She could have been open with you, or at least said it nicely. “I’m really sorry, I need time on my own” or something.   Idk.  I HATE the way “friends” can be this way once weight loss comes into the picture. Trying to force feed you and shit. I’ve had this before. A friend got really competitive and it made me a different person. Usually even if I’m a lil’ jealous, I try to support others, otherwise it seems obvious where it stems from you know?  I’ve done “worse” at things in the past to appease others because I can read people easily and don’t want to make others uncomfortable. And you know what? Fffuuccckk that shit. No more.  Well whatever. You have your answer, at least. Sorry you had to deal with that.",False,False
