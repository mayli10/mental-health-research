I usually use a belt because my mum refuses to buy me my actual size (which just makes things worse but I know she’s just trying to help).

Idk if you’re m or f, but if you have to wear a skirt, the best way to make it look good is rolling the top of the skirt and then putting a looser uniform top (at my school it was a polo shirt) on over it!",False,False
