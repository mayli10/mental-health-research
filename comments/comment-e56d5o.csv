Gotta make sure you wait about half an hour before brushing to keep your teeth half way decent, just rinse with water or mouthwash before then but it won't affect the braces.",False,False

I have no idea but I imagine it would really hurt your jaw if your knuckles grate against it while purging. Also braces don’t rust easy, but I don’t know if they can take the acid. The parts that are covered by the braces might not get as yellow as the rest of your teeth too which will look weird once you get them out.",False,False
