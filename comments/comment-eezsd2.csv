You’re a work in progress, OP. As we all are. You will find balance and you will heal. I’m 3 years into recovery and I’ve had the hardest time with clothes that don’t fit anymore. I got rid of all of them. It’s really therapeutic, and helps a lot. This Christmas I’m lucky enough to not worry about clothes and dressing up because of a pretty big 9 months baby bump, but I will do my best next year to just wear something that makes me feel like “me”. And possibly eat what everyone else’s eating and not a salad :) I really hope you’ll enjoy your Christmas regardless, and always remember that you don’t HAVE TO binge if you really don’t want to and it’s only your brain telling you to do so :)))",False,False
