It's amazing how many providers at treatment centers can work with ED populations for 8 hours a day 5 days a week for years and still genuinely not understand common ED psychology at all. Like I feel like you don't need to be a trained, seasoned professional to be able to suspect that as described in your case, implying that your real issue is binging when you've identified purging as a problem behavior as well would fuel the ED logic that makes you want to purge while also conveniently letting you dismiss purging as a problematic issue because it's apparently not bad enough to count. The main distinction between BED and BN is whether or not the person tries to compensate for binging with any kind of purging behavior, and the fact that they completely neglected such a simple baseline difference that a Google search could inform them of is a totally valid reason to doubt their expertise. I hope you can at least find outpatient support, and I'm sorry you're in such a sucky situation.",False,False
