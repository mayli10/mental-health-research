You could even prepare some (healthy) snacks but it doesnt really matter if you dont eat them, its not raising that much suspicion. Or visiting a museum? :)",False,False

You could also suggest something that youâ€˜d like to do. I know it can be really hard to socialize with an ed but there are lots of things you can do that donâ€™t involve food. good luck ðŸ’•,False,False

I definitely donâ€™t want to lose this friend either! I just donâ€™t know what we could do to spend time together otherwise. Food and active stuff are all that she spends her time doing...,False,True

Itâ€™s just hard because she only ever does active things or eats, so it seems. We donâ€™t have a lot of common interests but sheâ€™s a cool person so I want to have her in my life. I (blessedly) donâ€™t have a period so I might not use that excuse with her, but itâ€™s a good one to remember! I donâ€™t want my ed to ruin my friendship at all, but I just donâ€™t know how to socialize anymore (with anyone honestly) as it seems like itâ€™s always about food.",False,True

There was a time where my best friend and I both went through an ED. We knew we both had a problem but never talked about it. And that definitely ruined our precious friendship.,False,False

Donâ€™t let your ed ruin your friendship.,False,False
