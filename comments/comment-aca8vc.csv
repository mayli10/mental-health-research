With some meds there could be serious consequences. Even if nothing bad happens, now youâ€™re short on meds and skipping days to compensate can significantly worsen symptoms.  Believe me Iâ€™m no stranger to ODing on psych meds. So thereâ€™s no holier-than-thou here. Just a lot of concern.  I would urge you to tell your med provider that this happened.",False,False
