You’d think they would have a little understanding. I relapsed and my doctor said “oh I see you lost a bunch of weight!” And then he read the weight that they put down, which was wrong. And he said “yea I didn’t think you lost 50 pounds.” And then proceeded to tell me that I needed to lose weight and that I needed to exercise more. I mean, he knew nothing of my ED. Not exactly his fault but Jesus. Think about what you’re saying. That’s so triggering.  And people wonder why we aim to get sick enough for hospitalization because we don’t feel like our ED is valid.",False,False

It had been a year and a half since I saw him and within that time I went from anorexia to binge eating to being happy with myself (read as not obsessive for once so hey I'll take it!) so I dont necessarily want to think about it. I guess that could justify what he saw a concern in, I was just upset about the way he went about it",False,True

Unless the specialize in it, they are taught almost nothing. My family doctor who is doing her best to help with my ED (but I do see specialists) prescribed me weight loss pills.
