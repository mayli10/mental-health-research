I did ask my doctor if that was included in my initial diagnosis but he said something about how it was a singular fixation of a part of my body rather than just a general weight dysmorphia that it was separate (?) or something like that. I’ll definitely check it out!,False,True

Of course, not everyone single one agrees, but technically, according to the DSM, this is the rule. (I think it only referred to AN and BN though, I'm not sure about BED, EDNOS, etc)",False,False

My general doctor knew nothing about eating disorders with me bc I maintained a decent weight. But I’ve seen my psychiatrist for anxiety/depression for a few years and literally the day I opened up about my body thoughts he diagnosed me.,False,True
