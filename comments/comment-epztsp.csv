She's doing everything she can to make you dependent on her which she wouldnt do if she really loved you or cared about you. I know it's hard trying to get independent but I believe in you and your ability to become free of her in time &lt;3 I was in the same situation years ago, moving out with no job, money, or friends - but I did it and my life has really gotten better since then. I live with my gf and our cats, in a flat we rent, have a job I mostly tolerate lol, have hobbies I enjoy, and I've slowly recovered from the trauma my parents inflicted on me.  Sorry for the wall of text this just really struck a chord. Feel free to DM me if you wanna chat, vent or ask about anything ðŸ’ž",False,False
