The thc is in the oil/butter and the calories don’t change :) you use a regular brownie recipe to make it and just use the pot butter instead of regular! ,False,False

I highly doubt THC has any calories. I had a pot cookie recently and I just logged it on MFP as a Tollhouse cookie because it had the same look and size as one,False,False
