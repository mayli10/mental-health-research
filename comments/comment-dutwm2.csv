I run my own team.  Worked on some big sprawling urban projects &amp; manage them to completion.   I live with my parents at home due to the financial economic pressures in Ireland around rent and the impossibility of getting a mortgage.   Last weekend they were going to stay with my sister. While leaving both reminded me to eat something. Two hours later they rang and asked had a eaten anything. When they returned they remarked how much food was left in the fridge and that’s right asked me if I had eaten anything yesterday or today.   I feel your pain. Parents are tough, they won’t change. Its coming from a place of love though.",False,False
