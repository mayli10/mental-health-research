Sticking with the grass metaphor, if your yard has really terrible soil or something, the grass isn't going to look as great. It's just not. You should definitely care about things you can change (mow the grass, water it, whatever; this metaphor is stupid), but the gist of it is that some things are just beyond our control. Some people are lucky enough to naturally be more attractive than others. And sure, we could brood over that for our whole lives if we want, but if we can't change it then what's the point? It just becomes misery for misery's sake (I'm as big a fan of this anyone but it isn't very productive).   &amp;#x200B;  Anyways, there are things you can change about yourself and things you can't. The things we can't change we have to learn to accept, or at least live with (minus the misery).   &amp;#x200B;  This one kind of got away from me, hope you feel better.",False,False
