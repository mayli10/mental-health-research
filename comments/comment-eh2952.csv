I thought sheâ€™d think I was faking it because I had the knowledge, or think itâ€™s strange I am having so many issues despite my degrees. Like, I shouldnâ€™t be there and I should be functional.   Then it came up again and I admitted to the degree but said I just forgot to mention it. There is no way she believed me.   Lmao Iâ€™m so embarrassed thinking back. Iâ€™m such an idiot. I think it was my anxiety convincing me to withhold it. Iâ€™ve been thinking about addressing it.",False,False

I'm convinced everyone else will be thin perfectionists who never eat and I'm a chonky mess over here. It's like how a lot of comedians have depression. We're all hypocrites,False,False

I also currently teach anatomy to healthcare students. I feel like itâ€™s wrong for me to be involved in any of this. Like having anything to do with it is hypocritical and I just have no right. Why should I be allowed to take care of people, try to help them, when I canâ€™t even look after my own health? Why should people listen to me? (Why should I be allowed to even teach students about the body when I am harming my own?? Another thought I get).   Also, I promise the rest of your cohort is not entirely functional.",False,False
