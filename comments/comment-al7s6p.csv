So I was going to say spaghetti.   But all jokes aside, a meal is so many different things to so many different people. Here in Australia a standard meal to many Aussies might be meat and 3 veg, so a lamb chop or two with peas, corn and carrots, all boiled as they are usually cooked from a frozen packet.   But if you look at what an Asian country eats, say Korea, it’s a table full of food. Their breakfast is also stuff like rice and soup, vegetables etc.   Eat at the dinner table? In the couch in from of the tv? In the car on the way home? At a cafe or restaurant? There isn’t a standard.   So, in a round about way I suppose i was trying to say a meal is whatever works for you.

It’s 100 cals   For lunch I make something like fried cauliflower rice and Trader Joe’s potstickers. For a large volume of food it’s 280 cals.   I was feeling snacks today so I microwaved a hunk of squash and ate it. About 150 grams for 50ish cals.   For dinner today I made soup with squash, chicken broth, mushrooms and veggies. It was delicious and extremely filling and 150 calories for two cups.   I might pretend to split a beer with my boyfriend (100 cals potentially)   I consider my diet to be really healthy and this is just a slice of what I eat for a typical day. Usually my dinners will be a little higher cal, but it’s always mostly made from veggies and squash. I spent a lot of time being terrified of eating and frying a singe egg white for breakfast, eating an apple for lunch, and hiding the food I pretended to eat for dinner. I’m much happier now and I still feel in control even though I eat more. ",False,False
