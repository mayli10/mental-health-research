At that height and weight, you’re definitely not “fat”. So it’s neither a calorie problem or a metabolism problem, but rather a self-image problem.  There are a few routes you could go down. Counselling, if it’s available to you, is a very viable option. You don’t have to tell them a single thing about your eating habits if that scares you (though in its own way maybe that’s a sign you should) and concentrate instead on viewing yourself objectively. I say this because it sounds like you may have symptoms of body dysmorphia. There are also plenty on online resources and free books in your local library to help.   It is possible to lose weight and still be flabby (though you’re not fat! can’t stress that enough!). Lowering your calories more won’t help with this, I promise (been there done that). It’s more an exercise thing. Try going to a fitness subreddit and ask for advice on recomposition, they know what they’re talking about. Part of it will be upping your calories to support the energy expenditure from exercise, there’s no getting around that.   Again, if that causes you anxiety, maybe reach out. It’s a sign that you issues with eating are getting much deeper, as you’d be forgoing the body you say you want in order to keep a food-avoidant lifestyle. I know you said you don’t have ana but at the very least you’ve been practicing her behaviours for quite some time. I’m not saying you have to get help, but it’s important you understand and be honest with yourself about your situation before deciding not to, if that makes sense.  Best of luck to you, take good care of yourself.",False,False
