It’s slow and a lot of it isn’t measurable in % of meal plan compliance but in good variety and quality of life. Res still seems like it would remove me from all of my motivations to recover.   We’ll see. I’m “on contract” and have been complying since I signed but today’s menu is really challenging and I’ve spazzed our at it before so I’m a little nervous about today.,False,True
euoj9wb,t3_cgirm4,t1_eunlfco,etherealaqua,1,2019-07-23 23:27:41,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/cgirm4/so_whats_residential_like/euoj9wb/,It’s really common to think “I’m not that sick” when in reality that’s basically just your ED trying to minimize itself and justify the behaviors and level of sickness! And treatment is never a waste of time if you’re actually putting yourself into it. Think about whether it would be more of a waste of time to stick it out in php not getting the support you need and not making that much progress versus going to res and getting what you need and really benefitting from it! Hope everything goes well for you :),False,False

Refeeding has been so horrible and is probably my biggest barrier to meal plan compliance. But I’ve already missed work for PHP. It feels like wasted time if I have to start over again in res. We’ll see. I did “well” (baseline compliance) yesterday and today but tomorrow’s menu is a shit show and next week’s menu is worse. Idk how I’m going to do. Still trying but I guess res might actually be the right level of support even if I’m not that sick imo",False,True

At our table we always had about two staff too. At res they were much better about being conscious about the refeeding process and getting your stomach readjusted to that amount of food; the dietitian worked with people who struggled with that to condense the foods we got to choose (breakfast and snack) so that it wasn’t as uncomfortable.,False,False
eumtrez,t3_cgirm4,t1_eumg0hs,isthised,1,2019-07-23 17:18:25,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/cgirm4/so_whats_residential_like/eumtrez/,Oh shit actually that sounds really helpful. In PHP we can only check in in hushed tones AT the table and it’s only two staff for the whole room and they’re big on compliance. They’re being lenient with me for extenuating circumstances but I can only supplement one meal a day :-/ none on weekends at home. My stomach does not fit that much food,False,True
eumg0hs,t3_cgirm4,t1_eum3fui,etherealaqua,1,2019-07-23 15:54:03,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/cgirm4/so_whats_residential_like/eumg0hs/,So at my res there were multiple staff members sitting at the table with you and if you were struggling you could discreetly signal to one of them and go out of the dining room to check in/talk with them for a few minutes! You were given a lot more leniency with supplementing if you couldn’t do the food (at least in the beginning of your stay)!,False,False

The biggest adjustment was just getting used to the schedule of groups and occupying the free time without electronics but you get used to that pretty quickly!  It’s hard to quantify how “bad” people are considering there are a variety of different eating disorders, behaviors, levels of physical health. But if you’re getting recommended for residential by a team, your ED is definitely severe enough to warrant it. I had the same fear and talked to one of the therapists about it at one point—she said to me, “Do you think we keep people here for the fun of it?” If your insurance covers you going to residential treatment and your treatment team recommends it, then you’re definitely “bad” enough to warrant it. (But if your insurance doesn’t cover it, don’t allow this to make you think you’re not severe enough. I’ve been in treatment with MANY people who definitely need residential but their insurance wouldn’t cover it/we’re in res and needed to be there much longer but their insurance cut prematurely. Insurance can be ridiculous—their goal is basically to pay for the lowest level of care possible. Don’t allow them to invalidate you!!)  Meal support is definitely a lot more than day treatment. After all, that’s what residential is—they understand/expect that you need a lot more support around the food than you do in day treatment—otherwise, you’d BE in day treatment!   I hope this helps!",False,False

How “bad” are most people (aka I don’t think my Ed is severe enough for tea)? What is meal support like/is it any more than day treatment?  Thanks!,False,True

It honestly changed/saved my life. I had such a good therapist. Not every residential/treatment center is a great one, to be honest, but if you find a good one, it’s a life-saver. Let me know if you have any specific questions!",False,False
