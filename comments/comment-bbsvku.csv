I truly don't know how anyone doesn't feel this way all of the time, and they get frustrated by it instead of cutting us the slack we need to deal with the constant internal monologue. hope you can find a beat to rest up enough to keep fighting. &lt;3",False,False

I got a book for 2018 that went easy to hard so that helped a lot. It feels more like a lesson plan and took the effort out of trying to find a piece I wanted to play.   Hope this helps! Good luck!",False,False

It used to make me ridiculously happy. I have a viola too. I'd love to get back into both of those, so this is a really good idea. I'm so trying this soon. Thank you!!!",False,True

I’ve practically sold my soul to Grad School and 98% of the time people tell me to “relax” or “take a day off”. But as a workaholic/perfectionist, that’s something I can’t seem to do.    BUT 2. all of it is no bueno. And this is what helps me.   SO. I created something I could work on but is less stressful.   Get a hobby that you LIKE, involves learning and/or practice AND has a final result.   For me it’s the piano, I pick a couple of challenging pieces and work on them everyday. It’s not stressful but it keeps me occupied and feel like I’m productive.   I made the same recommendation to my anxiety ridden friend and they’ve picked up knitting and now make blankets with cool designs for people.   I think it like tricks your brain into thinking you’re being productive since you’re technically working towards something. But because there are no obligations attached it’s not as stressful.",False,False

I feel like it's gotten especially bad recently and I tend to ""punish myself with work"" (partner's phrasing lol). I feel guilty anytime I let myself take a second to breathe, and I get anxious because I feel like there's *something* productive I should be doing. If there's not, I'm anxious I'm forgetting about something, or that I'm just being lazy and need to find something productive today. Like I can't allow myself to be happy or relax. And it sucks so much.   &gt;You push and push and all you get is another day to keep on pushing.  For real though. It feels endless. Sisyphean. Major love to you.",False,True

I had to convince myself that shit like buying clothes isn’t wasteful because it’s contributing to my workplace presentation. But I get it. You push and push and all you get is another day to keep on pushing. Nothing is enough and when you get something you worked for then it’s just time to work harder. No advice just total understanding, unfortunately.",False,False
