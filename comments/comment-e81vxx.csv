You want to save the person as quickly as possible, right? Even if they've just fallen out of the window, you still want to grab them with all the speed and urgency that you'd grab someone who was about to hit the ground. You wouldn't go ""oh you can wait, there's still 100 meters left for you to fall."" You can recover now!",False,False

And I totally hear you on the ‚ÄúI said I would stop here‚Äù... I did that with both a GW and a clothing size. Like you, hard to find things that fit... but I kept going, and now my body is crapping out.
