I need to go hard. Not even to undo it, not even in a disordered way. Just like I need to take care of myself kind of way. And then yeah, I go overboard. I'm trying to love myself and I squeeze too hard gosh dammit!  This is 100% how I got here, too. Not that I'm trying to encourage a shift from one disorder to another, but I hope that you can find your way out of the maddening binge/restrict cycle. Sending good thoughts your way.",False,False

And I know since we work opposite shifts he doesn't see my meals so he assumes if I ate one big healthy meal then I probably ate two more! I guess the reason why (I've never really thought much about it) is when coming out of a binge phase I'm like oh shit! I need to go hard. Not even to undo it, not even in a disordered way.

I have a similar issue with my family and exercise (Mom's a personal trainer, Dad is a marathoner, sister does triathlons). It's a real mind-fuck to be praised for doing things like going out and running 13 miles to cope with ""feeling fat,"" since apparently exercise is a healthy coping mechanism for everything. I know my former treatment team would have a fit if they knew what I was doing... yet at the same time, it's not a black-and-white issue in my mind. In many ways, exercise really can be mental and physical self-care. It's so ambiguous and confusing.  The thing to remember, I guess, is that your husband is *not* an ED specialist with the training or knowledge to distinguish between healthy self-care or behaviors fueled by internal negativity. I'm sorry you're dealing with this and feeling like you're being lauded for all the wrong reasons.  I know you didn't ask for advice, but one thing I try to keep asking myself is *why* am I doing this? Am I approaching this (food, exercise) with a sense of compassion or punishment? Being conscious of my mindset and trying to act intentionally in self-care can sometimes turn everything around for me. Just my two cents. ",False,False

Because I’m pretty sure I’m just being super healthy! Doesn’t help that others encourage this behavior.

From about 2002 to 2012, my ED involved a lot of extreme binges and clearly fucked-up behaviors. There were many times I wanted to die, and some nights I thought I would (though ironically, my weight was normal). I ultimately spent two years in therapy and thought I'd recovered.  Fast-forward to today (long story), and it feels like some structure in my brain has been fundamentally altered. I am currently orthorexic/anorexic and apart from significant depression, anxiety, social isolation, and OCD behaviors my lifestyle is like a well-oiled, tightly-controlled machine.  On paper, my habits are healthy (clean diet, lots of running, no drinking, etc.) and I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with them. But I'm not okay mentally... or physically, either.  Despite eating a super nutrient-rich diet, I have severe osteopenia, zinc and iron deficiencies, skin and GI issues, and amenorrhea. But if a doctor is only looking at my low heart rate and blood pressure, it's easy to explain that I'm a runner...in which case, it's all good.  This makes it really hard to seek help... first, to determine what the problem is, if any. And then to be taken seriously, since I'm not really sure what even needs to change. And I don't want to change my behaviors, you know? No one looking at me would think, ""oh, she really needs to stop exercising,"" or ""she needs to swap out a salad for a burger.""   As someone existing in a state of chronic orthorexia (going on two years now), I'm well past that honeymoon period. But you're right, it certainly feels healthier than other forms of disordered eating. And, in a way, it's like a weird compromise with recovery since it's not totally clear what there is to recover from...",False,False

I also have a mindset that I *need* to lose weight for my health even though I'm already at a healthy weight, so eating 500 calories a day is healthy.... right?",False,False
