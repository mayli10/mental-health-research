I never really thought I would get to the weight I am now and at least thought if I did I would finally feel ‘successfully’ thin or at least like I’d lost enough weight at BMI 14 but at BMI 13 none of that applies and I’m still trying to lose more weight, to me I still look the fucking same. It’s all lies",False,False

But yeah same like. Fucked as it is I really don't think I'll even be able to consider recovery til I hit 99lb (would be waaaaay underweight for my height), and even then, unless I look like a dessicated skeleton being dragged out of a dried riverbed on the news, my brain will probably find some bullshit reason to keep restricting",False,False
