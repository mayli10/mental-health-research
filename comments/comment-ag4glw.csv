I remember in high school my friend telling me she had bulimia. I can't remember how I reacted but I definitely didn't 'get it' until the last couple of years. ,False,False

I have a pretty hard time being vulnerable with people, even with my closest friends, and that includes showing my feelings when something happens to them.   When my best friend (of 8 years) went through a miscarriage, the first thing I said was “that sucks”. I cared so much and I felt horrible for her and I just couldn’t show her how I felt with words.  Emotions are hard yo. ",False,False

Telling her about your ED isn't giving closure to a past relationship, it's just more doors that she is likely not equipped for.   Honestly, her response was fine considering you say you haven't been in contact for quite some time. ",False,False

I don’t know how old you guys are but at any age this is just too much pressure. She’s her own person with her own feelings and emotions and drama, not just an accessory in your life to make you feel better. It’s awesome she was there for you through some hard times but that does not mean she is capable of helping you through/with your ED, I mean it’s not even something you can deal with. You can’t expect her to accept the pressure and responsibility you’re asking her to take on, and at the end of the day you’re not her job. Ask your therapist for help with that. Closure should be something like “thank you for being a great friend” not a guilt trip into being friends again. ",False,False
