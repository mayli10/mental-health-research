My guess is that, because it's designed to be consumed in large volumes by active people, it's probably hard to overconsume.  I'd also recommend double checking the ingredients of your Mio -the main important things you're looking for are potassium and sodium. B vitamins are good, but won't work alone to prevent orthostatic hypotension.",False,False

Orthostatic (upright) hypotension (low blood pressure). Basically your blood has to travel against greater resistance (gravity) when you stand upright. Everyone experiences the basic mechanism, but people with lower than normal blood pressure are likely to have it fall too far, resulting in dizziness and fainting.  Staying well-hydrated, getting adequate sodium, and keeping balanced electrolytes in general should fix it. Chugging a Powerade zero should accomplish all of these things. I you're still having issues, chug another one:)",False,False

But I eat 1200 calories a day and I'm not underweight so that can't be it. It apparently happens when your blood pressure is a bit too low momentarily. Either too few electrolytes or being dehydrated, or a just a predisposition to having low blood pressure causes it, or so the internet says. I definitely don't drink enough water, so I'm trying to fix that. Could it be one of those things for you?",False,False
