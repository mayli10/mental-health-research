I mean I guess in a sense I may have unconsciously ""trained"" my body to only need possibly 1hr where i might eat a decent meal or supplemental shake. When I see people snaking or eating a ton often, I get a feeling of disgust. In no way do I judge or criticize people around me for eating freely, to each his/her own, but internally I picture myself eating that family size bag of cool ranch doritos in one sitting and my mind is telling me ""you dont need snacks, you might jump back over 150 and get a fat face""   And yeah playing with meds has been a major part of my life... Ive been through a bunch of them over the years, zoloft however was the only one that slapped on the weight. I think it ruined my self image, it aided in making me terrified of gaining any weight at all.",False,True

(Not sure if that’s exactly how it works but I know you can “train” your body to store once it eats vs use because it knows it will only get food once a day).  Also, please please keep your psych involved on ALL the things. I also have bipolar 2, and we LOVE to play with our meds when we start to dislike a certain thing about our life. Usually never turns out well. Wishing you the best!",False,False
