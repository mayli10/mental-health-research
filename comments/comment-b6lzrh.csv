I'm guilty of it too. You think you're fat so in your head everyone thinks you're fat and notices your weight gain.  But 6lbs is not enough for someone else to notice and be upset about. You saw the numbers on the scale and probably stare at your naked body in the mirror and see all the flaws. But other people don't. I bet your parents are just happy to see you and see you taking care of yourself.,False,False

I hope it gets less stressful soon ðŸ’ž. im a senior in high school and when my parents are home, itâ€™s hell. i overeat so much and my parents make concerned comments about me being too thin, I know this so well. no matter how my mental state is when I go to college this fall though, just the concept of being left the fuck alone is so comforting . Iâ€™m so tired of being watched over and criticized and made to feel guilty. Iâ€™m tired of hiding restriction and binge eating out of guilt. or hiding some aspects of my binge so they donâ€™t get too suspicious as to why or how I ate so much more than a non disordered person could. ",False,False
