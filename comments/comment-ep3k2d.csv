You should know that you deserve it, because no one deserves something as horrible as an ed.   If you choose to eat the burger king you would end up with a calorie count just below what a ‚Äùnormal/average‚Äù person needs. So no need to freak out after this meal. This day is a great step towards recovery or even just harm reduction. Know that this day doesn‚Äôt have to mean that you need to go in to recovery, eat x amount of calories per day, or gain lots of weight. It‚Äôs just a good opportunity for you to start recovery if you want to, and if you don‚Äôt, you could just see this as a ‚Äùharm reduction‚Äù or ‚Äùself care‚Äù day. You choose what to do from here. And i really hope you choose what‚Äôs best for you. Sending internet hugs üíö",False,False

You‚Äôre allowed to eat, whatever, whenever, no justifications needed.  I don‚Äôt say this as a way to be like ‚Äúbam ur cured lol‚Äù  I only say this because I know it‚Äôs what I need when I‚Äôm feeling this way.  It‚Äôs funny but sometimes getting ‚Äúpermission‚Äù is very helpful, I think.   You fuckin eat that Burger King and enjoy it! Be gentle with yourself. Sending support and recovery vibes",False,False
