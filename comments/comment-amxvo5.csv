It feels really compulsive and automatic. I believe it’s also isolated to binge “episodes”.  If it turns out what your talking about doesn’t fit the definition of a binge, it doesn’t mean you’re “pigging out”, that you’re gross, or that you don’t have self control. A common pattern of disordered behavior is compulsive overeating. So if you find yourself snacking a lot throughout the day, eating to deal with strong emotions, or eating a lot when you’re not hungry or full, that may be what’s happening. ",False,False

If you under eat or over exercise, the strong craving for food could just be your body trying to fuel your puberty.   Binging is uncontrollable. You look up and an hour has gone by of you shoving your face w food. You become obsessive and weird. ",False,False

Then go to sleep and wake up and do it again",False,False

Note, disordered eating and eating disorders are not the same thing. BED would be classified with more of an obsession with food. Do you feel compelled to steal food to eat it? Do you often sneak into the fridge late at night to binge leftovers or ice cream? It sounds like you start binging when you start eating and your urge to binge doesn’t lead you to start eating initially. I would talk to somebody though. BED or not it is detrimental to your health and can get much worse before you even realize it. Best of luck and I hope you get better ",False,False
