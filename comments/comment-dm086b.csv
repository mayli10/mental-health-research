Im thrown through a loop because this is phrased as if this being known is an issue with prevalence.  I don’t know how to say it in a more tactful polite way, so if that phrasing comes off as rude or insensitive so I apologize in advance if that’s the case  ***  There’s also a reason people who have primarily those triggers don’t typically get distressed as often that all/most of their main ED triggers are constantly ignored, never talked about, wrongly assumed, and under represented. (*in and out of recovery context*)    They fit a cliché —not sure it’s that’s the best word— that society, the media **and** former/current ED sufferers love to over focus on, sometimes romanticize, and even immediately m project on to other ED sufferers.   Even people on this subreddit are guilty of over-generalizing and making assumptions while using intentional words and phrases like “all”, “always”, “every Anorexic”, “thats just the nature of this ED!” even when they’re speaking about things like; individual personality traits, things that aren’t even listed as symptoms or recognized as common behaviors, or how much &amp; what kind of attention they personally like to have on them. I don’t even see people calling this out, not even people who have all the ‘cliché’ triggers but also have other major triggers that are unrelated being ignored.   This problem doesn’t just emotionally annoy me, nor does it just effect ‘regular’ people’s hard core beliefs about my personal disorder. Its gone as far to actually negatively impact my professional treatment in particular ways that I won’t go into because it’ll turn into a rant of its own.  ***  &gt; there’s a reason... &gt;  So what I guess im saying is: Well Yeah, I know. We know. Most people know.    &gt;there’s been so many posts  And I’d be shocked if someone claimed they somehow missed all these posts. That’s part of the reason most people are aware .     So it’s not like I’m in need friendly-reminders that people who...;   *fit the assumptions, aren’t having their major triggers medically misunderstood because of preconceived notions, aren’t often disbelieved or doubted when they speak up about their major triggers, and who’s triggers consume these kind of conversations*   ...should have their triggers recognized as existing. That clearly distracts from what my post is even venting about. That’s what so many people only recognize. It’s not as if the validity of them are somehow being threatened because I’m venting that ED catalysts+triggers are far more varied and individual than people are lead believe. And it’s definitely not like me pointing out what’s typically ignored is gonna shove conversations about skinny models/idols out of the spotlight, that’s for sure. The things you listed being recognized as common triggers is not a grand issue.    ***     . ***    . ***     **Note/Disclaimer** *because of the way your comment was worded I typed this entire post presuming you didn’t take “the cure” in the title literally like it was intended, (people actually believe this) and instead took it to be a hyperbole of “a treatment for.”*  *“Cure” was meant literally because I seriously doubt someone with a mental illness, even with just a couple media based triggers, would immediately have their ED smiled and positively complimented out of existence as if they just highly dramatic and like crash dieting. If someone mentally becomes ill it doesn’t just evaporate for them regardless.*",False,True

When we’re threatened and/or harmed the mind looks for every avenue to make sure its safe from future similar threats to protect itself. Survival 101.    Extreme stress+trauma that stems from things like; being forcibly ‘constrained’, stigmatization, victimization, or other threat/harm is likely to cause a disturbance in the mind/psychē. **Especially** if the threat involved one’s choices not mattering and not being able to use it’s fight-flight-freeze response (*or it being useless*.)  ***  Our mind knows to protect us but we live in the world where some amount of risk always exist regardless of conscientiousness. Which, in turn, makes us *consciously* realize to some extent that we can’t have full control over what happens; resultantly people who aren’t coping well feel even more helpless + powerless.  But  This doesn’t stop our sub/un- conscious mind from wanting to do/have *something*—*ANYTHING* that makes it feel assured it’s safe and protected from future threats. It doesn’t do well feeling helpless. It’ll either go to illogical shit if it has to either that or it stops functioning properly all together.   “*if I’m unattractive to predators, they won’t waste there time on me*”  “*if I’m __am__ attractive to the group, then maybe others will want to protect me*”  “*if I’m small, slight, and insignificant looking as possible threats won’t even notice me*”  “*if I’m smaller maybe threats won’t even __notice__ me that much to begin with because I’ll 1)blend in with everyone (or) 2)disappear into the background &amp; have no trouble hiding.*”  ***  For minds that are traumatized the illogical becomes logical out of necessity, and as said human minds are to intelligent &amp; evolved to survive to expect our psychē to just *accept* feeling like it’s powerless/helpless.   ***  Considering that once the onset has already happened where “used to” using weight loss &amp; restriction as our maladaptive coping mechanism to feel safe; it’s no wonder we get #triggered into a relapse when experience problems where our modulation doesn’t change the outcome at all.   **Ex) 1- someone gets terminally ill 2- you get fired / don’t get the promotion you were expecting 3- ~~you gain 5lb overnight and the world starts crumbling around you~~ 4- otherwise lose someone/lose something/miss out on something 5- can’t pay some important debt 6- can’t get away from some asshole you have to deal with on the daily etc etc etc etc**",False,True
