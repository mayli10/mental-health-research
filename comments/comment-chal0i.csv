Even though I know people simplify it to be such, describing it as your body ‚Äúlikes‚Äù to be at a certain weight is an oversimplification. It‚Äôs  a hormonal regulation process that is partially due to genetics. It doesn‚Äôt negate CICO to say that some people tend toward gaining/weight. There is variability in body size that is natural and healthy. I think the issue is that our environment promotes overeating and weight gain pretty much from infancy so a lot of people would not necessarily know what their natural set point would be.   Btw I know it sounds like I‚Äôm defending it but I actually don‚Äôt know what is correct and I‚Äôd be a lot happier if it was completely untrue. I have no idea what my set point would be bc my weight  has been all over the place but I‚Äôd love to stay at my current size indefinitely if I can do so without being batshit involved in my ED behaviors",False,False
