And there's a lot of celebs (for example, Dua Lipa) that we know is heavier but according to those websites have an underweight BMI. Then we think we need to lose more weight to be skinnier than them, when those stats are just wrong...",False,False

I don't really understand how they can weigh that and dance and practice all day, make comebacks every 3 months... It triggers me tbh. Because I weigh a little bit more like that and I feel like I'd die if I moved that much.  I'd love to look like an idol though. I love kpop so much.",False,False
