Not truly 109 bc some was water weight loss. Not truly 114 bc some of it is food weight and water. So.. based on my extensive scientific research your true weight is 111 lbs! :) ,False,False

I’ll keep trying to eat somewhat normally and see where I end up. ~~tbh I’m not a big snacker but yesterday I got high and ate so many veggie chips. My ultimate binge food/weakness~~   Thanks you for replying!!,False,True

Last month I also ate pretty shitty for three days and I swear I didn’t stop looking bloated for two weeks LOL.    Thanks for the input!,False,True

It’s also probably not 114 since you did more than likely lose some weight from your body’s natural energy expenditure. You’ll just have to find out after a few days of “normal” eating, which I know isn’t the answer you’re looking for but we retain water after fasting and it does take some time for it to go away.",False,False
