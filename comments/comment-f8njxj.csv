I ask mostly because I know a lot of doctors I work with have a somewhat skewed idea of what a normal range is (depending on their experience/background/own bias/etc) and actually shoot higher than one would expect.  the body is amazingly adaptive and can maintain normal fasting glucose levels for prolonged periods before starting to dip to levels that are considered genuinely low; that's not to say that if you want without food for multiple days in a row that you wouldn't be symptomatic (ie feel like shit) but provided you haven't any pre-existing pancreatic or liver issues, you shouldn't be hypoglycaemic out of nowhere -- and if you are, it should be investigated, not fobbed off as needing to consume more.",False,False

I've been there, and sometimes in a pinch you just need that quick boost without the mental battle of going for a full meal.  Absolutely NOT advocating doing this instead of eating, but if medically you're being told to watch your sugars dropping, it's better to have it as insurance.",False,False

You’re always “fine” until you aren’t, it’s the exact same being severely underweight as being severely obese, in that while you may be fine now because you’re young, the chronic disease has already begun. The only difference is you can still get better ! don’t be a reverse Amber Lynn, your body has already been through enough:)",False,False
