I eat eggs, cottage cheese, salmon, cheese sticks, salads, chicken, maybe a hamuger without a bun sometimes, canned sardines, tuna, and sandwiches with my net 7 carb wraps from Aldi.  It's really easy for me to feel full and stay under or at my goal this way.",False,False

Initially bloating was horrible and the sluggishness unbearable but I am stubborn so I pushed through it. The first versions where I mostly ate eggs, fish and some veggies made me quite lean - but nothing compared to a high carb vegan diet. The second time my skin freaked out, I felt bloated the whole time and it just wasn‚Äôt fun.   It might work for some if done right, but my body can‚Äôt process fats well. I am also terrified of oil, so it‚Äôs not ideal. My skin always reacts to it and my energy goes super low. My appetite doesn‚Äôt really go away, I just become all shaky.  What works best for me personally is a high carb/low fat diet with basically no grains, pulses etc. - fastest weight loss, great skin, good energy and constant energy through the day.   I also lost a lot of muscle tone on Keto both times and no matter how healthy I ate my legs started getting cellulite (I never have it otherwise).",False,False

I did keto before I went vegan and I ate like fish, eggs, and avocado. Lots of veggies are also low carb. It's even possible to do vegan keto, but I'm allergic to soy so that's not super feasible for me.",False,False

You can even use a little butter here! I usually use half a serving which is half a tbs and 50 calories. Keto is super healthy if you do it this way.

But I am finally able to eat things with fat and not get so anxious. I get anxious around carbs but not really fat. It's really helpful for me. But definitely not for everyone.   I'm doing okay in ED recovery (well I purged yesterday but, besides that, it had been a couple months) and veg keto has helped I think",False,False
