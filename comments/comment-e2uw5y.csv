I MUST have a bowl of snacks, even if it's just fruit or cucumber with mustard, or else I'll binge or won't sleep all night. For some reason a breakfast bar or something right before bed is a must while a big meal won't have a big effect. Recently I've been having a few plain biscuits at 35kcal each with warm almond milk sweetened with stevia and I sleep like a baby.",False,False

I cannot sleep while hungry and if I eat earlier, then I tend to binge at night. So I just try to not eat until the evening and I’m trying to do OMAD now.",False,False

Also I don't drink any caffeine, I even stay away from black tea. I think that helps me. But I'm not near UW, I'm at a \~21 bmi right now so I guess it just comes from restricting too hard a couple of days in a row.",False,True

Just curious, when did you notice the sleep problems start to creep in? I remember having problems with it years ago when I was severely underweight but now that I'm back losing weight I've noticed it when I'm only at the cusp of uw/normal and my restriction is still in the high numbers. I kinda fooled myself in playing it 'safe' but I miss my sleep so much, the bags under my eyes are huuuuge.",False,False
