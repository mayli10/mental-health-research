Feeling like I won't ever/dont know when I'll next have access to certain foods can make me panic and want to eat as much of it as possible in a short timeframe. Self-talk helps, but I think I've also noticed that just having more options on-hand also helps me remember that there is no food insecurity to worry about.  I think having a wide variety of options also stops me from fixating on just one or two types. If I have, say, one snack in my cupboard, then whenever I think about having ""a snack,"" I'm thinking about that one snack, and I keep thinking and thinking about it so it becomes an obsession that drives me to overeat or binge. Whereas if I have a cupboard full of different snacks, then when I think about having ""a snack,"" I don't fixate on any one of them in particular and so weirdly enough eventually forget about it.  So for me it's a combo of both not stressing or having anxiety about ""the next time I'll be able to eat this"" and also being dissuaded from fixating on just one type of food bc I have multiple available. I can definitely relate.",False,False

I got home and I didn't wanna eat it anymore. I didn't care, still, I spend money on it, so I had to eat at least some of it. I can't give it to someone because then they will know that I bought junk. I eat some of the food and the other threw out. I think it is our brains craving and then when we know we have it, we don't feel like we NEED it, and it is calming and the craving stops. But then you know you have it so you either throw it out, eat or give to someone.",False,False
