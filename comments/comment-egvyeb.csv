Managed to gain 25lbs in a few months when trying to ""recover"" I think my case is different tho because I  switched to dealing with my sadness by binge drinking (spoiler drinking 1000+ cals of alchol a night adds up)",False,False

I’ve been recovering for almost 4 years now and I still eat very healthily/on the restrictive side most of the times because I know IE doesn’t work for me, not yet. I’m at a healthy weight now (I don’t weight myself usually but had to recently for medical reasons) but I know my metabolism is so messed up after years of restricting that I would gain so much more weight if I reintroduced complex carbs such as pasta/bread and condiments in my everyday diet.  I’m sorry you had to go through that.",False,False

My therapist is like “we don’t know what will happen” I DO I’ve lived it a hundred times before. I eat a lot! If I didn’t, I wouldn’t be in this mess in the first place. I always feel suicidal when I’m heavier. I’m sorry OP. you’re not alone.",False,False
