Everyone keeps asking me what I'm doing that day and my answer is pretty much ""uhh, playing PlayStation and drinking a lot of energy drinks? Same thing I've done every other day?"" I do feel really bad for everyone who is obligated to celebrate it against their will, though. Even a lot of my non-disordered friends hate it for various reasons. Though to be fair, if I'd grown up in a traditional household where family members liked being around each other, I might feel differently.   Regardless, I hope everyone is doing okay and manages to get through the day without too much trouble.",False,False
