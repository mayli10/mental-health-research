If every single person around them is constantly talking about their recovery then it just feels like your taking up everyone's time, you feel guilty, you feel totally useless and incapable of anything and it's a very lonely place to be.  She's going to need a rock, a friend, someone she can talk to and joke with and sit next to and cry in IF she needs to who won't judge or criticize.   It takes super time but the more she values you for just being a supportive friend the more she'll have reason to recover.   Don't be the person saying ""you have to eat that"" or ""you have to stop doing that"". Be the person she can just be comfortable with at whatever stage she is at. BUT I would also say that if she is in the care of nurses or doctors then it is absolutely fine for you to have a confidential chat with them about things that you are concerned about - the more they know the better.  It may seem like you are going behind her back to do this but you're not at all. Here's an example; if I was in hospital with a self-harm wound and kept picking at it and making it bleed but not telling the doctors myself then I would fully expect someone else to tell them.   Wah, sorry, turns out I had more to say than I thought. This hit a nerve I think. Thank you for helping your friends.",False,False
