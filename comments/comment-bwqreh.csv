I'd just go NUTS and eat 800 calories of starchy pasta!!!!! way better to just binge and eat 2000 cal of smaller portions of other things instead I guess :|  Same with bread and potatoes, I guess I feel like it's either never ""worth it"" or I feel like I'll lose control and give myself a massive portion if I make those foods at home. But I can eat bread and potatoes and pasta when I eat out because I like to fool myself that the calorie listings are infallible üôÑ",False,False
