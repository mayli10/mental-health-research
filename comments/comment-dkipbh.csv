My personal opinion is that it’s our desire to feel heard in out suffering. They don’t talk about eating disorders in school, though it impacts so many. Hell, at my school, they didn’t talk about mental health at all, didn’t take the time to tell us it was important even though so many of us were suffering. We had two suicides in a year- and did that change anything? No.  So you’re not going insane. You just have a desire to hear that people around you know that it’s a problem (whether or not specifically with you, but just in general) and that the rest of the world isn’t so ignorant and shut off to suffering of this kind.  And unfortunately, most of the time, it is.",False,False
