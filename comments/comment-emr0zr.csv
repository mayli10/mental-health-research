Different therapists will have different ways of going about it, but I think the biggest thing to remember is that it’s not a real therapy session. Many people have spent so long waiting and thinking about getting help, so they really want to dive in and get to work, and it feels good to get that pent up emotion out. This can make the first session disorienting. You’ll probably have a lot of forms and questionnaires to go through. Your therapist is probably going to ask you a lot of questions. They want to get an overview of you as a person and your concerns. They most likely only have an hour with you, so they’ll probably keep the pace pretty fast. This isn’t because they don’t care about the intricacies of your problems - it’s because they want to gain a general understanding and make a game plan before they start helping you with the specifics. Hopefully they explain this from the get-go, but I’ve found a lot of therapists don’t always realize how confusing the whole process can be to laypeople.   Also, the therapist should go over their approach and background. Please ask questions! You’re paying for a service, and you deserve to be kept in the loop! Some things you’ll probably want to know - what is their theoretical orientation? What is the evidence basis for that method for your concerns? How will they conceptualize and treat your concerns? What’s their level of training/background? What’s their experience with treating EDs (+ other concerns you may have, like LGBTQ, trauma, POC, etc.)? What are their office policies (e.g. phone calls, rescheduling, no-show fees, etc.)? It’s okay if you forget to ask something - you can ALWAYS ask later.",False,False

My therapist spent a fair amount of time discussing her approach to therapy, laying out how future sessions would work.  I’d say the biggest advice I have to people who’re new to therapy is: be honest. If your therapist asks a question you don’t want to answer, tell them that. A good therapist will respect the boundary but it’ll let them know there is an issue there that might need to be addressed in the future. Whereas lying may hinder the whole experience.   Also, a good therapist should challenge you, but also validate you. If you feel dismissed or invalidated after talking to your therapist, discuss it with them. If it doesn’t resolve the issue, consider seeking a new therapist. It took me quite awhile to realize that I could change therapists when I had one that wasn’t working for me... I thought I was the problem. But that isn’t always the case.  Good luck! This is a great step you’re taking!",False,False
