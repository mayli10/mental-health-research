Normally they can be found in some grocery stores and all health-food stores. They‚Äôre normally just called digestive enzymes.   I would also recommend taking a probiotic. If you can afford it, another really good thing to do to help heal our digestion is to eat fermented, non-pasteurized foods (like kimchi, pickles, fermented veg). As it has to be unpasteurized to reap the digestive benefits, your best bet is to ferment vegetables at home in a jar or to buy fermented foods at health-food stores. Eat a small amount of it right before eating a meal, and that should really help.   Lastly, there‚Äôs an amino acid that is vital for the wall of your intestines. I forget the name of it, but if you want I can ask my doctor about it and let you know. I took it for some while to try to help with IBS and delayed gastric emptying or whatever it‚Äôs called. and it indeed did help! Most of the time I can‚Äôt even tell I was bulimic, digestion wise.",False,False

Anyone who complains about salads while dieting is eating some piss-poor salads. I used to be big on hummus as my salad dressing, but I binge on hummus way too much if it's in the house (sad but true) so now my go-to salad is a Vietnamese inspired dressing that's even lower-calorie.
