I always overestimate the calories in any Asian food (like even vegetarian curry and just rice and vegetables) because you never know what‚Äôs in there. That one makes legitimately no sense because I make that kind of food all the time and I know exactly what‚Äôs in it but Chinese buffets have traumatized me",False,False

I‚Äôm recovering and everyone knows it! But no, thats prolly been my only meal today and I carefully planned it out. I counted each calorie, thought about how to alter and use each ingredient so I can get the most volume for the least amount of calories, wrote everything down on a note pad as I‚Äôm looking up calories in a single mushroom, then entering everything in MFP, then probably using half the amount of the stuff because I‚Äôm freaking out that my math is wrong. So I made something that should of taken 30 min tops but since this disorder has completely fucked me up it took me an hour or more.    One of my favorites is I tell myself that at least I mostly eat healthy things like a lot of vegetables, salad with only balsamic vinegar, no meat, very little dairy, cook with no oil. So that‚Äôs better than most people who just eat junk food right???!! Yeah no..you only had 800 calories today you orthorexic pos. üôÉ  Another I can think of is if I‚Äôm measuring out a cup of something I‚Äôll take out a few pieces and think ‚Äúokay I‚Äôm saving 10 calories that will totally make a difference tomorrow when I weigh myself!!‚Äù",False,False

I know in practice if you weigh everything it can come in at a different number of calories and sometimes companies are allowed to round but I can‚Äôt be bothered to weigh everything so I tell myself it probably all evens out in the end.,False,False

I didn‚Äôt eat 45 kcal over weight maintenance today, I increased my weight maintenance ***by*** 45kcal.  I ate 13grams more protein than usual... don‚Äôt you know how thermogenic effect of food works, brain? So ATLEAST like 11 of those calories don‚Äôt count anymore.    Also I had an extra caffeine tablet today and that had to take at least 2 kcalories to digest and I downed it with the icy cold water. The shivering probably also had to of burned 2 kcalories.   And the extra caffeine made me fidget more for a quarter of an hour. Fidgeting and leg bouncing probably burns extra half a calories per minute, so that probably pretty much up the difference.   Also I ate 2 kcalories under my TDEE on Wednesday and a whole 6 kcalories under on Monday, so it shouldn‚Äôt matter anyway if I‚Äôm off a little.   ...So I didn‚Äôt eat over my TDEE today....",False,False
