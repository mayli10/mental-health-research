It goes down after a couple days and I make sure to drink enough water throughout the day when the water weight is sticking for a while. Weight fluctuations suck tbh and it's always hard to discern what's causing them but just try to stay calm for now and not get too stressed &lt;3,False,False

Like logically I know that there is no way I ate 17,500 extra calories without realizing it but it’s just that this has never happened before and I don’t know what’s going on and I feel so out of control and I’m so scared that it won’t go away and that it might happen again ",False,True

I was thinking it must be my period, but it’s way late and I haven’t got it yet, and I usually don’t get weight gain more than 4 days before my period in which case it should have come already!
