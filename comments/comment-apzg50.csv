EDO patients were made to eat absolutely 100% of our food, including microscopic crumbs and leftover syrup, dressing or condiments. there were strict af rules, including no long-sleeves, elbows above the table at all times, and of course no talking about food.  it was strict and brutal, but with the assistance of medications such as reglan and zofran it wasn't too unbearable. depending on your weight, the hospital can keep you for weeks or months.  it's not the most fun, but it can be necessary for recovery.",False,False

I didn't really like it because I don't want to recover but for me since I had comorbid diseases I had my vitals checked every 20 minutes I think (vitals were usually checked in the morning and before lights out, same as when medication was given unless you were a special case like me), we had group breakfast and nurses are present/watching, bathrooms are locked/a nurse has to go with you. Meals were flexible enough. I'm vegan and they didn't force me to eat non-vegan foods but RD's did try to give me the whole you aren't eating one from every food group bs but I didn't let it get to me. I did have to do meal replacement feeding two of those times which was a different hell. Honestly if you work with them, are honest, it's not that bad. A lot of popularity contests. Group therapy was mandatory where I went. I mainly hung out with another girl and read, and worked on art. I hung out with the nurses a lot too. We also had group outings and we were allowed to exercise in a monitored fashion only. ",False,False
