When you see a therapist, or if you keep engaged with the counsellor, maybe try to get some sessions with your mum there too.   My school counsellor was the one who told my mum about my ED, against my will. It went terribly, our relationship got really bad. I pushed her away, blocked her from all therapy sessions. Now there’s no way I ever let her in on anything in my life because I just can’t. Our relationship is pretty bad and it’s 11 years later.   You did the right thing imo and it was very brave of you.",False,False
