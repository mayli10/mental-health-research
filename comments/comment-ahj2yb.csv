I would report her to HR if  a conversation with her doesn't solve the problem. It's sad that she's projecting her own insecurities onto you.,False,False

We’re not close at all, but I’m trying not to take it to heart.. it’s hard though. I just feel put in a corner whenever she does it. ",False,True

Telling someone they are ""stuffing their face"" ""wasting away"" ""choosing to be anorexic"" and snarky comments about value judgements related to food choice COULD possibly be things friends say to each other in a safe way, but it sounds like she is actively insulting you and putting you down on purpose.  &amp;#x200B;   It's up to you how you want to combat this (HR support, your own ""comeback"" comments, ignoring her, killing her with kindness etc)  &amp;#x200B;  You mentioned that you are aware that she struggles, so its likely that her comments are jealousy motivated... She might be really struggling with the way her pregnancy is affecting her body/hormones etc. too.  &amp;#x200B;  Also.... I may be reading too much into this but it sounds like you and her have discussed weight loss together, so I think the trouble may have started a while ago when you both made talking about weight loss a topic of conversation at work as it seems you keep quite a close eye on her choices and weight as she does you",False,False

I'd tell her flat or that she's being hurtful and you'd like such comments to stop, either to her face or in an email, and if she doesn't, tell HR. She has no right to be treating you like this",False,False
