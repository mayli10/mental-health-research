WHAT IF WINTER COMES  Not the ""starvation mode"" myth because I don't think it actually changes how your body absorbs or stores calories or whatever, but I do think there is some evolutionary basis for binge freak-outs like this. I remember a thread a while back on a normie subreddit where someone was recounting a conversation they'd had with a homeless woman who said she would sometimes turn down free food because it would ""reset"" her hunger. I personally have noticed that the first 24 hours (or, the first day that I'm awake) of being hungry is almost unbearable, and then from the next day on it's almost like I don't even care. I'm aware that I ""need"" to eat but I could just as happily go without.  If I were right in that sweet spot, and I didn't know where my next meal was coming from, I might turn down a free snack, too.",False,False

It’s like as long as you are already hungry, why ruin it, but then if it’s already ruined like why not just eat? So crazy how I’m not even tempted to eat when I’m hungry. Writing it makes it sound worse actually...",False,False
