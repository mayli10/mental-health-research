I do *want* to feel good enough and safe and cared about, but it’s like those feelings drain out of me almost as soon as I acquire them. Without really realizing I was doing it, I’ve been trying to get people to tell me I had worth, that I deserved good things, that I should take care of myself. (Academic success was my drug of choice.) But ultimately it was never enough...nothing external could ever come fast enough or stay long enough to outweigh the fear-loathing-pain I was generating internally.   I’ve felt less than whole for so much of my life. Frustratingly, nobody else can make me feel whole...at least not for long. I think I have to learn how to *allow* the emptiness to be filled. The idea of expressing care for myself still makes me squirm (but at first it made me panicked/nauseous sooo, progress?)",False,False
