Turns out predatory men can sniff out Daddy Issues^TM regardless of weight.   I found my husband early on but it took me 2 years to work up the courage to feel like I deserved to be with someone who treated me well and inspired me to be the best I can. We’ve been married for 8 years now. ",False,False

My body didnt make people treat me badly (bad relationships happened at all my sizes), shitty people treated me badly cuz they were shitty.   I hated myself and so really didnt believe I deserved better. :hugs: you deserve respect, compassion, and love. ❤ ",False,False
