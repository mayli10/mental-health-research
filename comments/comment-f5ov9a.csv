My bf and I went out to eat huge portions of pasta for valentines day, the next days returning to restriction sucks. It's so hard to get back in the swing of things.",False,False

It's especially weird because I tend to get it the worst an hour or two after binging (especially if I hadn't done so for awhile before), so I know it isn't even always really hunger.
