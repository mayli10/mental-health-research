One is obese and it feels like a constant reminder of what will happen to me if I don't watch what i eat and stop exercising.  The other one has ALWAYS been skinnier than me. She's a year older than me, but even as kids she would wear smaller sizes than me (but with the long/tall pants). She is naturally a smaller frame despite being taller than me. I couldn't wear her hand-me-downs because she was skinnier than me. People have literally said to my face that she's the pretty sister (let's not even talk about how every other aspect of her life screams perfection, like graduating college early with a 4.0). From a young age this has always been a major source of self consciousness about myself and my weight.   Well, I *think* I'm finally lighter than her, but she still looks more beautiful and healthy than me. I freaking HATE my thicker frame and how my bones and veins stick out when I am at a similar weight as her. It's just so unfair how we have the same parents, but she got all the good genes.",False,False

Kind of sucks for me because I'm the ""fat"" one even though I'm technically a normal weight because they are 30 and 20 pounds less than me. Makes trying to eat the right amount for me really hard to do because I see them eating less and exercising more",False,False

I know this sounds like a humble brag add I'm not trying to belittle other people's problems but it honestly sucks. Just trying to add perspective. My sister and I have different dads so she is taller and has a larger frame, at the same time she doesn't understand CICO and I think she overeats without knowing it. I am closer to our mom's frame which is very petite and 120 soaking wet. I know she has always resented me for it and is super bitter. It is awful and I just want a sister, but we have never been able to really connect because she always says mean comments about my body or just has resentment all over her face and its so hard for me to ignore. I know I have an ED but my weird standards only apply to me and I think she is so beautiful. Anyways, sorry for the vent. It sucks though.",False,False

My sis and I live in the same city and our parents live across the country.  Parents came to visit last summer after I had lost some weight. Our mom noticed (yay?), asked if I was doing okay (eeekk), and said I was looking slimmer that my sis (omg really??). I‚Äôve thought about this comment literally every day since even though it‚Äôs been almost a year and my weight has unfortunately fluctuated both up and down since then!",False,False

My sisters just have such small builds, and I was cursed with very broad shoulders.   Anyway, I've lost 50 pounds overall, and of course, my sisters are my body goals, but I found out that one of them weighs only a single pound less than I do now. And guess what? I'm an inch taller. That literally means I have a lower BMI than her, and it sucks because I honestly don't believe it just because she looks so much better than I do.  My sisters still sometimes make backhanded remarks about me being the ugly one, but at least they stopped calling me the fat one since a few months ago because of my weight loss.",False,False
