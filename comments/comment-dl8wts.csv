I would recommended not eat more food necessary, but foods that are higher in protein and calories. This way, when the food is in front of you it doesn’t seem like so much. This helps trick the brain because you’re physically eating less food but they have a lot more nutrients.   For example: Half an avocado, one egg, or an ounce of cheese, nuts, tofu, or cooked beans.   These foods have so much protein and are healthy for you. This is going to help your muscles so much and give you much more energy. These foods will up your caloric intake to around 300-400, but they also pack the much needed nutrients.   Lastly, something my therapist told me was to work my way up to my caloric goals. So maybe start with 150 calories on day one and two, then 250 day three and four, then 350 day five and six, and so on until you reach a number you are comfortable with. This way it’s not so overwhelming at first.   Good luck. I’m proud of you for being aware you need more calories. It shows your trying to give your body what it needs. I know this is difficult but I believe you can make it happen. If you maybe don’t reach the “X” calories on a certain day, that’s totally okay. Just keep working towards it the next day. One day you won’t feel so anxious about eating, I promise you. It takes time but it will happen if you keep working towards it. You may even keep upping your calories because you’ll realize that it’ll help your body when you do get that fuel through food.",False,False
