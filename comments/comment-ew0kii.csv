I have been there too too many times. I have felt after one â€˜imperfectâ€™ meal, that my hands wouldnâ€™t fit over my legs, or my pants would just burst right open. But, bodies donâ€™t work that way. One bad day physically cannot make you balloon out, and gain 10 pounds. You will be okay. I remember when being under 100 lbs was the only thing that mattered to me. You canâ€™t live for just a number though. Give yourself some grace. Tomorrow will be better. You are worth giving a break sometimes. Put on some comfy clothes, your favorite show, and let the uncomfortable moment pass. Be brave and good luck. Xo",False,False
