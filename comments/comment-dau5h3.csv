Hard no.  So it'll either be, convince them to let me get top first/shortly after starting T (hard)... or just have visible boobs and be on T.",False,False

Realising how entwined the two are for me is a big part of the reason I no longer identify as trans and am detransitioning, because I know I just can't recover from one without also giving up the other.",False,False

I'm in Canada, so it's a little easier, and a lot cheaper if I'm willing to wait- but the head of the whole trans* medical program in my province just fucking resigned out of frustration of lack of funding, and the whole thing has tanked... so if this is the year I decide I'm ""trans enough"" to want to go for it, fml XD A few years back, I was on a wait list for 2 years before I got cold feet",False,False

My chest has got a little bigger, but that's partially due to pec gains. I'm still an a cup. All in all, very much worth the more streamlined torso.   If I never transition (which I'd say is probably 70% likely), I can still get my chest reduced. Fuck, if I'm willing to go overseas and pay all out of pocket, I could even get top surgery.

We had the same experience! I've just started recovery, so I'm working on getting these hips back hidden. They stick out right now and I'm like ""you know what? I don't need to be UW to make my chest smaller, I'm literally in the process of getting my insurance to approve top surgery. There's literally no point in making them smaller, so all I'm doing is triggering myself with my hips and making myself physically unhealthy, which will jeopardize my surgery.

Thing is, once I got below about 19 BMI, my hips started becoming prominent all over again, because they started sticking out again.  Now I'm at a fairly lean 20, I have the most androgynous frame that I ever have. (Post puberty, anyway) I can still wear boys' jeans, and my shoulders fill out a boys' large/mens small shirt.
