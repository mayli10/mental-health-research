Staff started to recognize us and it would seem like our cover was blown right? Wrong.   Between days certain people had off, the few days we didn’t come, staff not paying close attention, and using the self-checkout nobody ever seemed to think us strange. Once when we went to the actual cashier, she mentioned it was smart that we came in a few times a week, because planning ahead what she wanted for dinner often ended with her wanting something different, and it was smart we did it the “European” way.   It’s also less suspicious than you’d think, because just buying a little is more often seen as “picking up a few miscellaneous things” than “that’s all they’re eating for the week”. Likewise, buying a whole loaf of garlic bread, a box of donuts, and a bag of chips is often seen as something you’ll eat over time. I think only cashiers with an ED would notice strange behavior like that.",False,False

Or at least they did at the store where I used to be a regular. But I suppose it depends on how obvious you are and how observant they are.  I doubt they pay much attention to whether you’ve got a cart full of produce and lean proteins or one full of junk food as a general rule, but if you’re in there multiple times a week for over an hour at a time inspecting every single aisle but buying nothing but low cal stuff, and then pepper in some frenzied visits where you’re grabbing as much cake and pizza and ice cream as you can carry (because you’re too frenzied to even bother getting a cart) and checking out within five minutes as opposed to your usual hour+...yeah, they notice.",False,False

What was impacting my life was *my* feelings, *my* shame, *my* fear of being judged.   Given that the average population doesn’t have much awareness of the realities of eating disorders, It’s not hugely likely that they’re guessing at who has an ED. Plus they’re ringing out dozens and dozens of orders each shift - even if they *were* making up mental stories to go with various purchases, I doubt they especially notice the purchaser as a individual. (The possible exception being very small towns.) It’s like how I might judge another driver on the road, but I’m not really judging Ivan Ivanovich, 43, accountant, father of two.
