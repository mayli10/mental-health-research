For some reason, whenever I hit a plateau, if I eat ""normally"" for a day (not stuffing my face but just eating three meals until I feel satisfied), I'll see the scale start to move again and I'll even usually wake up thinner. I think it's just that your metabolism may need a little kick in the ass or maybe it's about getting the waste moving through your system again. I think today would be the perfect day for you to give it a try and enjoy yourself, then get back on your schedule :)",False,False
