EVERY TIME. I’d tell a therpaist that I’m struggling and scared I can’t control it and keep passing out and they’d weigh me and be like “you’re not even close to underweight I think this is just your anxiety”.   It’s why I hate the weight boundary for anorexia diagnosis it feels like you can only get help when it’s already killing you and that’s such a twisted screwed view of a disorder",False,False

And recently had a conversation with a health professional and was able to easily convince them I don’t have an eating disorder, I’m just “nauseous” a lot, because “Look at me, I’m really heavy! Of course I eat enough!” Anyway. They believed me.",False,False
