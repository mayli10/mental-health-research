I don't ever want to further someone's ED or seem like I'm all ""yeah restricting is the best! Yeah!!""   But if you're going on roller coasters, that is a pretty good excuse not to eat much, I think.   I actually always used to get grossed out when I saw people eating at amusement parks (even when my ednos was at the height of the binge eating side) because I just KNEW they would be ralphing on a rollercoaster later.   But anyway, I'm sorry you're going through all this anxiety. Family time should be a good thing and it is often stressful enough without having to be anxious about food and ED stuff. :( ",False,False

The weight you gain isnâ€™t permanent. You have the power to lose it later if you choose to do so. I know it sucks to be pressured, but Iâ€™m sure in your momâ€™s mind she is just looking out for you and making sure youâ€™re taking care of yourself. Try to enjoy your vacation :)",False,False
