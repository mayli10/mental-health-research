It's honestly surprising how narrow the range of 'acceptable bodies' within the gay male community can be. I'm someone who's ""normal"" weight, non-white, and non-binary (male-bodied and don't care about being seen as male), and I honestly feel like the gay male scenes I've briefly interacted with can be super hostile if you don't fit in. Like I'd go as far to say that I've experienced more racism in that community than outside, which is kind of hilarious (on the flip side, also more homophobia in my culture than in America).  In no way do I want to invalidate what you're feeling because I 100% feel that too and is definitely the reason why I have such a shit relationship with food and eating, but if it makes you feel better even though I personally feel like I have to keep losing weight and become this ideal that I see in media, I 100% do not feel that way about others or people I find myself attracted to. Most of the people I've crushed on were totally independent of their weight and had so much more to do with their personality and how much I liked being around them. I'm not going to pretend like physicality has zero impact (it does for me and I think it's important to at least acknowledge it's a factor), but when I think about the people I like it has so so so much more to do with non-physical factors.  Anyways this was kind of a long tangent but I really do hope this is at least a little bit helpful, just to have a perspective from another male-bodied person who's attracted to guys. One of my (not serious cuz he's straight RIP) crushes has actually gained weight since I first met him (he was the epitome of above-average height, twink body, and attractive in a nerdy way), and I still am just as (not seriously) attracted to him as I was before. Actually I'd say even more because I got to know him much better and really do love him for who he is, which does so much more for me than his body.",False,False
