That's at home - in the gym is usually ~100 less because I'm hella self-conscious too ðŸ˜…  Are there other genres of music? Or maybe a home program would be better to start with ðŸ˜‰ ,False,False

I also like dancing but i. casual settings (parties lol), so I can tell you more or less how it compares. First off, the wall is ALWAYS there so you're not limited to a class' limited schedule. You can also stay as long as you want and take as many breaks as you need in between paths. It doesn't require as much coordination as dancing or martial arts, but you will learn to understand and listen to your body as you find new ways to climb. Apparently it burns like 400-600 cals an hour provided you keep rest to a minimum. So I go to the climbing center for like 2 hours (time flies) and I log like... 20-30 mins. I'm there with a friend so putting on your harness, and while we chat etc, time flies.  Also swimming 8) I think swimming is an even more demanding workout that burns more calories! I haven't swam in a while but it's also a great activity.",False,False

OP I'm not sure whether you're asking for ""the most rewarding type of exercise"" or exercise that will help you ""burn most calories""? Agreeing with other commentors that you should do exercise you enjoy because you'll stick with it better and help build a better non/less-disordered relationship with exercise",False,False

And the dance moves are nice and easy for us spazzes. Pretty taxing though tbh. Swimming maybe?  Itâ€™s a trade off- more exhausting = more calories. Walking is not tiring but doesnâ€™t burn a lot - but when you are tired, a 20min walk is better than nothing!  ",False,False
