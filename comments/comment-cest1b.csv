It's an autobiographical manga by a japanese woman. The art style is vaguely tumblr-ish but in a good/cute &amp; unique way. It's short (1-2 hour read) and the eating disorder is only a background part of the manga that helps to get an understanding of the author's mental health",False,False

If you're into podcasts, I'd suggest [Food Psych](https://christyharrison.com/all-episodes), which often has guests with diverse experiences in relation to food/body image and many episodes talk about race, fat phobia, gender identity, disability, etc in the context of EDs, which not a lot of media does.",False,False
