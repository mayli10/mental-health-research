The general population of healthy eaters in the world does not ever track foods to this extent and is just fine. I would challenge those thoughts about nutrients and take a look at whether they are an extension of the eating disorder. Trying to do things “the right way” or “the best way” can be counterproductive to reframing the way I think about food in recovery.",False,False
