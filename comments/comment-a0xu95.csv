This time of year is always kind of awful for me. The holidays and the seasonal depression are awful. I feel fat af. I just want to eat everything :(   Iâ€™m going to try to fill up on flavorful yet low cal/no cal liquids to see if that helps me get out of the funk. ",False,False

I just need to stay active and focused on the goal.  I'm actually low key proud of myself, I've started at uni and had a whole bunch of other massive changes in my life and I've managed to keep the weight I've lost so far off!

And if you slip up again, donâ€™t discount the progress you have just made!  I always want to turn over a new leaf and be perfect but it never seems to happen.

Try to encourage yourself and be proud of yourself for any progress you can make. Like if you can stop at 4 bags of candy. Remember eating at maintenance or overeating a little is better than overeating a ton, so it's okay if that happens and you don't need to consider the day wasted.   Easier said than done, I know! I struggle too. But I try to tell myself this all the time. Like that 1800 calories is better than 2800 and there's no reason to throw in the towel for the day. It's hard in the moment, but once I have my sanity again I see how true it is.   You can get through this! ",False,False

I just gotta get back in touch with my body's rhythms.  I don't think my diet was too restrictive at all before, Like I never got under 1500kc a day despite aiming for 1200. I just can't stop eating.  And I don't think the vegan part is bad. It feels so good for my body and soul, it's just sometimes I can't handle feeling good.",False,True

Even if you fuck up and binge in between, you have to start laying the foundation for normal eating again. Also be honest about yourself about whether or not your diet was too restrictive before. Bingeing is sometimes just a physiological response that the body has to restriction so you might need to eat at maintenance for a while to stop the behavior.",False,False
