It also may not be. ED's are unique so this RDN may not be what OP wants or needs right now. However we can't dismiss that it might work for someone else, and we can't say that this RDN is not qualified etc, because we only know some information that OP has provided (thus has OP's bias even if OP doesn't intend to) * There are doctors with hypertension from poor chronic stress relief, optometrists with bad eyesight from being on the computer too much, psychiatrists with depression, dietician's who are overweight. Someone's job does not solely determine their health, even more so with lifestyle choices because there's a difference between knowing information and actually doing it. Let's stay open-minded.",True,False

My university wants to *pay* for me to go to this fancy clinic which is very much beach colors and coloring but so much of it really seems like it would help because they have an amazing set of specialists there. But then I met them a few times and it was all so oddly political?! They said outright that *anyone*, who at any point so much as thinks about their food intake, is *partaking in diet culture*, and I think also the patriarchy, oh goodness.   They also really didn’t like that I’ve done professionally ballet and theater since I was little. This was the strangest part to me. These things are apparently evil and reveal my unhappy childhood. (In general, what is it about ED treatment that makes it okay to be so condescending to patients?! It fascinates me.)  So I thanked them for their time and never followed up but the worst is that I genuinely would *love* to not manage this horrid thing all on my own. Help would be wonderful! I wish I wish we could all find some better middle ground.",False,False

I found a psychiatrist that was absolutely not like that, she helps me both with not starving myself and not bingeing and is very supportive when I tell her I've been able to not give in to binging urges and does not go all ""ohh nOO but your body asked for the food!!!"".   I asked for a meal plan after admitting that I have a hard time knowing what a portion looks like. I have to say, the portion are a lot bigger than I thought and I am still not comfortable with all the foods but it's all ""healthy"" things, well balanced carbs/fats/protein. It's not telling me to go eat a whole cake or anything and I'm still the one deciding how much I'm going to eat, if I don't want to finish my plate I'm not going to! Keep in mind I'm a normal weight so it might differ from when you're very UW but no one should be forced to recover by eating pints and pints of icecream, it's about learning to be ok eating different foods not about stuffing your face with sugar.

Like eating cookies will make me happy in the moment but crash later but eating a more balanced meal will make me feel better throughout the day but it won't be as enjoyable as the cookies.  Maybe don't focus on what foods your crave but what foods make you feel good throughout the day.  As for HAES, I think it's been twisted a bit by some people with non restrictive eating disorders. HAES can be great provided your not coping with food and overeating because of it. If your eating to fuel you body and you end up heavier then that's ok but just eating because it's enjoyable can lead to people become obese.",False,False

And I’m starting to think that if I continuously wait “until I’m ready for it,” I’m never going to get there. Because the UGW keeps going down, and my behaviors keep getting worse. I’m hoping diving into more intensive therapy will flip some sort of switch for me, so that I can avoid flipping it by waiting until “I’m sick enough,” or really hitting rock bottom and doing something that really fucks me up.
