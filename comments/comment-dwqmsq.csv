Why can‚Äôt people just mind their own damn business and not comment on other people‚Äôs food?",False,False

On occasion, as it doesn't happen often, I'll get a group of skinny girls who sit next to me and who will look at my food and then roll their eyes, or giggle together.

My town is small enough that I'm a ""regular"" anywhere that sells food, even if I'm trying to not go to one place too often.
