If you don’t mind sharing where you live, I can see about finding you some resources to help get seen by a doctor. If not, I can give you more general resources.   I know it’s hard when you don’t have insurance on top of everything else, but I want to stress how important it is for you to be seen, especially in light of your more recent posts. This isn’t something that your doctor won’t take seriously — and if for some reason you wind up with one that has their head that far up their ass, see someone else.",False,False

Once I laid off the exercise for 4-5 days, it all came off. If you're working out, maybe try stopping for a couple days and seeing if it helps?   &amp;#x200B;  But yeah, if it's really serious, please see a doctor. &lt;3",False,False

If this is the still the case, I would strongly urge you to see a doctor. There are a lot of things that could be causing this, and some of them are life threatening.",False,False
