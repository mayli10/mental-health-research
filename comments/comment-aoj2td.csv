He starved himself while seeking enlightenment, living on something like 6 sesame seeds a day (so the story goes). Of course he eventually learned that starvation was *not* the path to enlightenment, so there's a lesson there... :p",False,False

Does anyone know other historical figures who clearly had some kind of eating disorder?    Lord Byron had some sort of eating disorder for sure.  [From his Wikipedia page:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Byron#Physical_appearance)  &gt; At the time he entered Cambridge, he went on a strict diet to control his weight. He also exercised a great deal, and at that time wore a great number of clothes to cause himself to perspire. For most of his life he was a vegetarian, and often lived for days on dry biscuits and white wine. Occasionally he would eat large helpings of meat and desserts, after which he would purge himself.",False,False

Some women really did go to the extremes but a lot of the time they would be shopped. ""Re-touching"" has been happening since the dawn of photography.   It's achieved by literally colouring in where they wanted the waist to be and if you zoom in on a lot of those pictures you'll see how the black doesn't match up, or how the arms never look right. Just something to think about when looking at the old pictures, the victorians loved editing pictures. ",False,False

She wore much more brutal corsets and even then she would only wear them for a few weeks until they gave up.
