I also have OCD and the combination makes everything 1000x harder. I‚Äôm starting to treat myself, and it‚Äôs going better than it ever has. I think the lack of understanding of the origin of my eating disorder from doctors has been the most triggering for me. It‚Äôs not even about weight for me personally, just ‚Äúacceptable numbers‚Äù ... I set a higher ‚Äúacceptable number‚Äù and that has actually helped me a lot. Setting my goal BMI to 18.4 has helped (because I‚Äôd still be underweight but...not by much at all. By 0.1. I hope this helps, I know it can feel so hopeless sometimes. Just try to remember that you are very powerful, and have the capability to beat this even if your brain is screaming at you. Sending lots of love. üñ§",False,False

Theres a lot of people with ED‚Äôs on it actually (not sure if youve been there already but i find it can help) While i refuse to bring up weight with my therapists, i have been able to work with one to reduce general anxiety and decrease my phobia so that on a day-to-day basis I am not typically worried about vomiting.",False,False
