Those kiosks being amazing and 2. Mcdonalds having SO many more safe options than the US! I imagine the UK is similar! I'm trying to be better about ordering what I want instead of getting something else or picking apart my food after it comes but it's a process lol,False,True

They got so much bad press that they cleaned up their act, and make it quite easy to eat well there, if you're careful, but the reputation lingers.  If you want to know who the new McDonald's is...fuck Applebee's. Hidden cal counts! because almost the entire menu is a nightmare and they know it.  Had their oatmeal for the first time recently on a really shitty day + it was so simple and nice.",False,False
