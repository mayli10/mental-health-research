Or they're just awkward and don't know how to compliment someone and they make a joke out of it. I wouldn't take it personally at all.,False,False

He was absolutely joking and I took it as a joke, not hurtful at all! I'm more just surprised by the words he used to describe me because I still feel fat haha",False,True

They all know about my exercise routine and my boyfriend was more bragging about how much I run in a joking manner. His dad likes to pick on me and knows about all my issues and honestly seems a little concerned (he keeps telling my bf I'm getting too skinny) and so I just took it as a joke. I guess it could seem like a negative situation due to my post, but trust me that I was not mad at all and had no problem with it. It's more the fact that he called me a skeleton when I still think I'm fat and his daughter is so much skinnier than me. It honestly made me happy to hear that haha",False,True

One thing is to express concern and have a heart-to-heart discussion about your well-being, and another thing entirely is making fun of you, and making rude and humiliating comments. I'm furious!",False,False
