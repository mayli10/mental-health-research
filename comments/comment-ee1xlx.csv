Food has always been on my mind as well as fitness stuff and nutrition. Overthinking is a struggle with me, too. I was always worried about over exercising, over eating, i heard not allowing yourself certain food was bad and was all worried about that too and that I need help for all of this. Lately, I've been observing others to see that basically everyone I know has weird eating and exercise habits.  I feel like I've come to the not caring / ""fuck it"" mindset and do what I want to do. I decided to incorporate a diet of mostly whole foods and if I'm hungry, i'll eat and stop when I'm full. I get a variety of food in my diet now and focus a bit on vitamins and stuff since I've upped my exercise by a lot (I in general have a lot of energy and exercise brings me life). For a while, I was thinking that maybe I'm just obsessing about health and over exercising but idk. It doesn't feel like it and I'm happier. My impulses and and negative thoughts and feelings have diminished and haven't felt that, ""spiraling feeling""  What do you guys think?
