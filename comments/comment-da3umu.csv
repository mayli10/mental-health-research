Honestly, I've had two go arounds at recovery. Both were forced, because my parents told me they would cut me off if I didn't come live with them, so the minute I was back on my own, I relapsed, but I really wish I hadn't. I was a kinder, happier person in recovery.  Having done one all out recovery (3000+ per day) and one restrictive recovery (1500 per day), I whole heartedly recommend 3000 per day.  This past time, I tried to keep restricting and I ended up gaining more long term weight. I'm not entirely sure about the science of it, but I think I never entered repair-focused hypermetabolism on the lower amount, and my metabolism stayed too low.  I also found that eating more made my insane hunger eventually go away. As far as weight gain, initially, I put on 15 pounds in a week once i started refeeding. I was terrified. But the next week I just gained a little more (5 or so more pounds), then settled into a groove. I was still eating 3000 a day, but I wasn't really gaining. I would go up and down about 7 pounds (anywhere from 15-25 pounds) depending on hydration, how full my stomach was, etc. It was about the same for 1500 per day. Immediately up about 15 pounds, swollen, painful, but then I kept gaining about a pound a week, ended up at about 28 pounds higher than I started.   The biggest difference, though, came when I started life again, moving around campus, classes, meals, dance. When I ate all I needed, I almost immediately dropped 10 pounds as my fluid retention went away. When I was doing 1500, my weight REFUSED to budge. It's been months of a relapse and I've lost pretty much no weight and I still feel like garbage.   So eat to the extent of your appetite! Your body knows what it needs to help repair the damage to your organs, hair, etc, and to repair your metabolism it needs to feel confident that the food isn't going to disappear again.  Best of luck, and I'm happy to answer more questions!",False,False
