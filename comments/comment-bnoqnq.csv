My sister is 6 inches taller than me but weighs 15 pounds less than me, and any fat she has literally goes straight to her boobs \*upside down smiley face\* I have come to terms with the fact that my size is for the most part a result of my actions. Like yes, it sucks that I'm short and seem to have inherited the tendency to binge from my father, while my sister is regularly told by strangers to model and is naturally not interested in food at all, but to some extent I am *choosing* to be this size. Because CICO (and mental health, and my PCOS, and a heap load of other factors, but that's besides the point lmao). When I need a dose of reality, I remind myself that the only thing stopping me from my dream body is CICO. And I see that in my sister. It just doesn't require the mental anguish like it does for me. I don't know if this will bring you any peace/change your perspective, but just know you aren't alone in your feelings.",False,False

I have a different style from her and I met someone who really liked me and never compared us. You will too :)   but to address your post better that sucks and I am sorry it wasnâ€™t a very good shopping experience :c I love H&amp;M still but I find myself drifting away from them too because lately their style is a bit more revealing than I typically wear.",False,False

I ended up taking my meds for my anxiety and aggressiveness. It really drained me., i'm avoiding hearing my sister's voice right now. I hate how she wears skimoy clothes and proud the guys fall for her. It's weird as the older uglier sister.",False,True
