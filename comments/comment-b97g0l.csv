Recently I’ve said to one friend who knows about a past suicide attempt “I’m doing worse than ever. I’ve never felt this bad” and he just replied sorry and never checked up on me again. I told another friend “it’s hard for me to be alone all the time. I want to die and It’s hard to sit at home all day everyday thinking about how much I want to die, I just want people to hang out with me to distract me from that occasionally”. I know it’s a lot for people to process but even if you’re incredibly clear about what you’re struggling with and what you need from them, there’s a chance you’re not going to get it.   Idk maybe it’s just me who can’t get anyone to care about me.",False,False

If you really want help you have to build up the courage and confide in someone you trust. And you might have to be very forthright about it to really explain the extent of your suffering. I have never been brave enough to do this, I am just not strong enough.   In the meantime, know that we are all here and understand your suffering. Peace be with you",False,False

This was what i was known for.  ever since this whole shit started people actually CONGRATULATE me for (unwillingly) losing weight, for making food my least priority. this just encourages me to go further and further... i just want ONE person to say „girl.... i don‘t recognize you anymore... this is not who you are“ everyone thinks i am on a fun and happy weight loss journey when in reality every piece of food scares me out of my goddamn mind and i am depressed because i lost all joy in what was once my hobby.
