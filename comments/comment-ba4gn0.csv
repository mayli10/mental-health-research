As I was getting down to my LW, along the way, I was LOVING it.  I never had a goal weight or a goal of losing weight even (i was ortho) but I sure did LOVE losing.  It's definitely addictive.    But as I gained weight I hated every step of it.  Every pound of it.  I never thought I was fat until I lost a ton of weight and got really underweight, then suddenly at a slightly higher, but still very VERY low, weight, I felt fat.  Now, looking back at my 20 pounds lighter self (that was 20 pounds heavier than my LW) I would KILL to be that size again.  And I definitely thought I had fat to lose back then.    Silly skinny, past me.  ",False,False

When you are so malnourished and weak from overexcercising and not eating enough, you're just too content with being alive at that point and in most cases even being able to walk around and stand. Your cold body, failing circulation and organs begging you to eat make you numb to the world and all your foggy brain can focus on is how much you weigh and that you're at your lowest weight. I know you feel miserable, but that's because your body is not slowly shutting down and you can focus again. Sadly, it leads you to think about how fat and ugly and worthless you are (that's what I actually feel like rn because I am not starving rn either), but I promise it will get better. I promise you are not fat, ugly or worthless, you are taking care of your body even if your head does not appriciate that and that makes you a good, caring person",False,False

But I took advantage of it.  I was heroin-chic.  I had a ‚Äúreal‚Äù post college job making stacks.  I lived in some cheap neighborhood so I had money to buy nice expensive clothing.  Who cares if I get mugged walking to my car when I can buy Steve Madden boots and full price urban outfitters without blinking lol.  On weekends me and my friends would go out and we were all shiny and beautiful.  Yes very much like the plastics just think early 2010s hipster style.  I was tragically beautiful and hung out mostly in dive bars especially this one punk bar that‚Äôs sortof infamous in my old city.  I could have any guy I wanted.  I got free drinks all the time.    But I lived off of Red Bull beer and Gatorade.  Occasionally I‚Äôd eat macaroni and cheese or a turkey sausage English muffin breakfast sandwich and coffee.  I was eating about every 2-3 days at this point.  Did I mention I was also abusing prescription drugs?  Yeah.  Anyways I got raped.  It flipped my whole world upside down.  Then I got raped again (same person).  This time instead of flipping shit upside down and drinking myself into oblivion every night I heard my own internal voice screaming at me to fucking eat.  I gained about 20 pounds really quickly.  I did the whole 3000-5000 calories a day thing.  I felt physically a lot better.  My rapist was leaving me alone.  I was more emotionally stable.  I ended up gaining a little more weight til I leveled out for a long time.  I started smiling for real again.  When I look back at her (me) it actually is literally fucking painful.  Because while she was smiling and laughing and surrounded friends and having fun in all those pictures...  I know what was going on behind the shell.  I remember the journal entries.  I remember the drug use.  I remember the risky unprotected sex.  You don‚Äôt see that though.  She was beautiful.  Now I‚Äôm on my way to being a frail weakling again.  I‚Äôm BMI 20 which isn‚Äôt that low but I have 8 pounds before I‚Äôm underweight.  Which I could hit by graduation.  And then I‚Äôll have to go to day treatment.  I‚Äôm throwing my life away.  This time though I just...  can‚Äôt eat.  I don‚Äôt know...  I‚Äôve romanticized anorexia.  The bones the bruises the frayed hair the brittle nails the cold the cystic acne...  I fell in love with someone at this low point and he saw me underneath the fucked up shell.  I feel like the only time I‚Äôll find love is if I‚Äôm dying.,False,False
