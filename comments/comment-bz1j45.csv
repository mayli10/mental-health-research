I know it's hard, but you deserve to eat. Try to tell yourself that every bite you take gives you a little bit more energy so you can travel. Plan where you want to go now. Print out a picture of that place or activity you want to do and keep it in a place you regularly see it. Look at it when it is difficult to eat to remind yourself why you are making this push, so the reward will be worth the effort. Obviously it will take time, and forgive yourself now for any setbacks. Just try to keep having something to work towards and look forward to. That really helped me when I ran in college and struggled to eat. It was hard, but I shifted my view as food giving me fuel so I could run faster and not be injured all the time. Good luck!!!",False,False

Don‚Äôt worry if you‚Äôre not meeting maintenance yet, as long as each day you do a little better than you did before, you‚Äôll get there. Be patient! It gets easier :)  When you‚Äôre struggling try to think of food as medicine, it‚Äôs helped me to be quite robotic in application, set out ‚Äúdoses‚Äù and methodically bite, chew, swallow, repeat until the necessary is done. For the emotional challenges, try to think of yourself like you would a beloved pet that you‚Äôre nursing back to good health. Really helps a lot.  Good luck üíö",False,False
