What I do to keep a consistent 1200 cals is I plan my meals the night before, so that I can plan filling food that’ll keep me full instead of binging on calorie dense snacks. I also have drinks like tea and hot chocolate that give me something to drink so I don’t get bored and snack   I also get hungrier in the night so I don’t eat much in the morning and plan for like a 700 calorie dinner. That way I don’t use up my calories until 9pm.   A stable 1,200 is still low but if you fill it with healthy foods it’s not too bad",False,True

I've been trying to focus on feeling disciplined and confident by eating healthy and well balanced things instead of feeling disciplined by just not eating. I also feel confident when I run so that helps. Also I like to color but any kind of hobby can hell you feel better about yourself. Having hobby's has helped me out quite a bit on the self confidence thing.,False,False

But then my stupid brain goes in to over-drive and tells me if I eat even less I will be even happier so I stop eating, then it goes in to reverse and sends me shopping for binge foods then suddenly I'm feeling miserable again and craving that 1200 cal stable life back.   Just gotta keep on keeping on.",False,False
