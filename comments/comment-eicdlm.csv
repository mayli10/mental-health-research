The only thing that helps me is eating a big (even if that means I fast all day then do OMAD) meal before I go out drinking so I'll be too full to think about it, or make sure I've got my pj's etc out ready to get into bed straight away when I get in (if I can push past the hunger I get extremely tired when I'm pissed). If I've really got a craving for takeaway or something I know I won't be able to ignore when I'm pissed I'll allow a small portion of it into my intake as something to look forward to after drinking.  I know many would think you're exaggerating but when I'd be drinking whilst restricting down to less than 500 or fasting my binges would be close to that too. Forgive yourself for one day, have some peppermint tea for bloating and distract yourself with an activity :)",False,False
