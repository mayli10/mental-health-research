I would consider blending veggies to get a smooth consistency or else starting to juice fruits and veg together to get the vitamins, at least. Oh! I had a cookbook for parents of picky kids and it was about recipes that hid veggies in food... Hold on...  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007FJJMEY/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_apa_i_pFEqEb7NX7Q04",False,False

I like adding purées to things for extra vitamins (carrots and peas go great in things) and eventually you can start working on the textures when the flavors become part of your taste profile. You’ll still need to get your fiber from something else but i have times where I only want soft things too!",False,False

Maybe you could try doing smoothies? Then you can add really vitamin rich stuff like spinach and blend it until there's no strange texture.",False,False
