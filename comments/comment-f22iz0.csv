I especially liked what she had to say along the lines of ""what did people expect me to say/accomplish by making this video?"" and how saying ""please eat more"" to really sick YouTubers like Eugenia and Dr. Dray isn't going to make them change (just like if someone were to say that to any of us). I also liked that she called bullshit on weird ED shit like putting squash in oatmeal",False,False

Iâ€™ve been watching her channel for almost two years and she is one of the most levelheaded vegan youtubers out there.,False,False
