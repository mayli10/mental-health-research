Since itâ€™s not a stimulant laxative and is very hard to abuse, we could have one dose a day mixed in with water. They advised us that, based on previous laxative use, weâ€™d most likely be on miralax for the first few years of recovery. In my experience, miralax use feels nothing like laxative use and hasnâ€™t triggered any urges to use laxatives. Maybe itâ€™s something for you to look into? Good luck â€” stay safe ðŸ’œ",False,False
