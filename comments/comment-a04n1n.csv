But I've never had the balls to actually ask specifically for what I need, so I dunno. :(  Hope things start to look up soon, and if nothing else, we here for you gigi &lt;3 I know your posts always make me feel better, so hopefully we can return the favor ha",False,False

I'm sorry this happened to you.  When my husband passed away 9 years ago, I lost all my friends. People don't like to touch trauma and grief with a 10ft pole. I kept so much inside for so long and turned to food or the lack of it to cope.   Now that I'm a bit older, I find that people my age are a bit more emotionally mature and will support heavy things like grief and trauma. I think as we age we collect more and more baggage so we tend to be more compassionate and supportive of others. This was the first year I ever started to admit I was a widow, and at 34, it's the first time people haven't turned away from me for it.  It will get better, I promise. ",False,False

I know it’s cliche to say, but It does get better. You will eventually meet someone who cares. I have found the best way is to be a person who listens for a long time and then only give hints about my past. People love a mystery and it gives me a way to feel known and heard without giving it all away. If they care, they’ll ask. But people aren’t perfect and have their own shit to deal with, which is probably why I’ll never tell all my secrets. And probably why I like my ed so much. It’s my own huge secret. But don’t give up on us all. There are still some good ones out here. Some of us do actually care. ",False,False

I can understand that feeling of people leaving or becoming frustrated when they have had enough of our issues. I get that they are negative and bring people down. However I do understand that whatever they have felt, you feel tenfold. People sometimes just want to get away from it, but don’t understand what we live through everyday.   If there is anything you want to talk about I am here! You are not alone, honestly!",False,False
