I'm sure he is suffering from some fatigue of your mental illness but you do not deserve his treatment of you. Do you have other support systems? Aside from professional help, a close personal support network really helps.   You are strong and if nothing else, this sub is here to support you unconditionally :) ~ sending my love",False,False

How fucking exhausting that sounds. You aren‚Äôt his customer service representative, or his escort. You‚Äôre a human being. Look, forget about what you need to do for him. Do what is best for YOU. You know what will *really* ruin your marriage? Getting *really* physically sick... Dying.    So take care of yourself. Have the courage and the audacity to believe in your ability to recover, in this center‚Äôs potential to help you. Your husband is, right now, the voice of a hater. Don‚Äôt let him bring you down. He's spewing ignorant crap about things he knows nothing of. Is he a doctor? Is his degree in psychology? If not, he can STFU and get out of the way of the professionals trying to help you. God!    You don‚Äôt need to leave your husband. You do need to take your life in your hands and make it something worth living. And when you‚Äôre stronger, have those hard conversations with him. Right now? Ignore him. If you guys need to sell the house, sell the house. People downsize or move neighborhoods all the time; it‚Äôs not the end of the world. Controlling expenses is often easier than increasing or replacing income. He‚Äôs overreacting. Maybe in a year or several, he will see things differently. Maybe you‚Äôll even get the apology you deserve. Or maybe the marriage will end because he‚Äôs a fucking man-baby who might not have been ready for marriage and all it entails. Either way, you‚Äôll be healthy and in control of your own life and BETTER OFF. I hope you have the strength to ignore him long enough to take care of yourself. ",False,False

But he is not what determines your recovery. You are what determines your recovery, along with your treatment team. Once you get more re-nourished (you can absolutely be extremely malnourished at 120 lbs!) and get a little mental perspective, you can decide whether it makes sense to give your husband grace for his behavior in this moment, or whether as other posters have suggested he is being manipulative in a way that would need to change for you to stay together.  But right now, your task at hand is to get into recovery. His support would be nice, but you don't actually need his support to start recovery. You only need your own willing spirit and a treatment team, and it sounds like you have both.  Good luck. Recovery is hard, and it would be nice if others came through for us the way we need them to all the time, but they don't always.

My partner used to be supportive of my mental health issues, but after moving in together, he really doesn't seem to care or believe I am doing enough to help myself.

""He ended the conversation by saying we needed to stop talking about it otherwise he would get meaner"" this is never okay.  You came to him with an issue and all he did was get mad, mean and blame you?  That is abusive.  That is not a healthy relationship.  Honestly, I would dump his ass, but I know that's easier said than done.    &amp;#x200B;  I am in a situation rn where I want to break up with my partner, but logistically, and to confirm it's not just my mental health acting up, I have to wait until summer.

It‚Äôs hard to have ups and downs of treatment and recovery.

Would definitely support you following the docs recommendations. It would be ridiculous to think someone is treated for an illness once and it just goes away.  In terms of your emotions and communication with your husband, have you ever heard of DBT? Dialectical behavior therapy. It‚Äôs very skill-based to help with your distress tolerance for those tough moments, mindfulness and communicating/advocating with others.
