The way individual bodies are proportioned has a HUGE effect on what a healthy weight is for them.   I am pretty thin at my height, but there are people that 'look' to be about the same weight as me(at the same height) that actually weigh 5kg+ less than me, because I am very busty and have wide hips too, etc. I don't think I could ever be their weight unless I was very sick, but for them it's ok to be that weight. I also have friends that are only like 1 inch taller than me but weigh an extra 10kg and they look thin/average and not heavy at all, it's just the way they're proportioned. ",False,False
