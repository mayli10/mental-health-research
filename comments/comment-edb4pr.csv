I didn't even want to lose weight. I was happy with how I looked before. But of course trying to manage my symptoms taught me that less food = healthier and then another doctor kind of gave me some motivation to lose more weight which lead to actually wanting to lose weight again for a while, but now I'm kind of stuck in the middle and want to lose more but also don't. It's very frustrating to fall back into these habits when you actually wanted to be better and when you were actually doing well.",False,False
