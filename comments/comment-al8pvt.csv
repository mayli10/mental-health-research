All of my mom’s food and our cultural food is so heavy and high-calorie. I love/hate eating at home because ofc it tastes delicious but I can feel myself getting fatter by the second while I eat and I get questioned hard for trying to take smaller portions or skip things altogether. ,False,False

Being from the Caribbean, it feels like every dish either has to be loads of red meat, or if it's not that, everything is deep fried and greasy. Think soul food that's popular in the southern US.

efd01st,t3_al8pvt,t3_al8pvt,ShoopDaWhoopBurrito,1,2019-01-30 08:45:58,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/al8pvt/cultural_comfort_food/efd01st/,I’m Vietnamese too and the same thing happens to me. It’s just so comforting and there’s just something about a giant bowl of rice or pho that just hits the spot.   I haven’t eaten my mom’s cooking in awhile because of it and because it’s difficult to calculate the calories. Good luck on CNY BTW; that’s what I’m stressed out about for this week. ,False,False

It’s hard to say no to my Mom’s cooking or avoid viet food when going out or to parties, but even when I end up having some I don’t feel too bad about it since they’re the classic dishes I grew up eating and what my family wants me to enjoy. I appreciate how much good food is part of viet culture but it also gets frustrating since weight/appearances are also focused on a lot too.",False,False

Not specifically when it's Korean food (because I got really stressed when I ate bibimbap and tteokboki/tteok in general) but when it's made by her it's usually..easier to grapple with the idea of eating more than my original restricted plan,False,False

I always end up eating more at my moms house and it feels like a binge even though usually it wasnt. I'm american so there arent as many like specifically cultural foods, but moms cooking usually feels almost safe. Even though she uses oil and butter which I would NEVER do",False,False
