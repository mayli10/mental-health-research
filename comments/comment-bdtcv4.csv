Sometimes, after a few days (especially because it's so hard to get myself to shower while in a binge cycle), it almost feels as though I am sweating out that gunk. It's a horrible feeling.",False,False

I’ve been binging like crazy all week. Last night I was in full on binge mode that somehow made me overcome social anxiety so I found myself standing in McDonalds ordering a disgusting amount of calories for myself. But it’s a new day and I’ll work harder today to restrict and not binge. I feel like I get possessed when I’m in binge mode and I lose all control of myself. I feel like a disgusting fat lard.,False,False
