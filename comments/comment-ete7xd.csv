Posts like this play into every voice in my head telling me what a disgusting pig I am for eating this way.  Personally, I ate until I was satisfied every day and had no guidelines whatsoever, just happened to hit those numbers. So I can’t relate when day the guidelines are “too strict.”  There is nothing wrong with eating the amount of food your body needs.  Stop trying to make people feel bad for it.",False,False

Just because it saved your life (and I'm so happy for you!) doesn't mean it hasn't ruined others. You're right, it wasn't needed for me. Wish their instructions and guidelines weren't so generalized and rigid. Some days I could be hungry for 3000, others I cant eat 2000 and it should be fine and they shouldn't make it sound like I'm stalling recovery and half-assing it.",False,True

For situations like that, averaging ~2500ish per day sounds reasonable. But holding that as a rigid minimum for everyone is a bunch of bullshit.",False,False

Not only that, but your caloric needs will change from day to day depending on what you do and how you feel.    god I wish I took time to think about it instead of jumping write in. It's just .. the transformation of the people I watched on YT seemed magical. Like it was a hero's journey. They struggled for a year or so and then not only were they fully recovered but they cured ALL the side effects (digestion, food allergies .. etc.)",False,True

Learning to let go of that do-it-perfectly-or-it’s-ruined mindset feels key to me finding mental peace not just around nutrition/eating/weight, but in my overall life. I want to learn how to be disciplined *and* gentle with myself, how to to meet myself where I’m at, how to celebrate all beginnings and all steps with no caveats about their size or impressiveness. Holding paramount a particular number doesn’t sound so helpful for those ends. I can absolutely believe it’s a protocol that’s helpful for some people or certain situations, but if it’s not feeling helpful or healing for you, it seems reasonable to try another approach. Statistics are for populations rather than individuals after all. When N=1 I don’t know that there’s any One True Way.",False,False

What has proven to work for weight gain (while being underweight) is intuitive eating. Now for some people that means eating 5000 cal a day for awhile, like documented in the Minnesota starvation study. But for others that might mean 2000 calories. Many factors play into it such as hormones, exercise level, current bmi, your bodies set point, whether your taking any other meds etc.",False,False
