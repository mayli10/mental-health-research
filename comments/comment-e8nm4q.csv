I don’t know how the exam went, get my results tomorrow but I can update you. I’m pretty sure I did mediocre... as in slightly failing and I needed an 80 so yea. Sorry to ramble. My head if feeling better though. Did you finish your paper? When is it due??",False,True

At this point sleep will probably help more than cramming. Putting it in your brain doesnt do much if you're too tired to get it back out again.  I'd reccomend at least 6 hours. Look over your notes in the morning before you sit for the test.  Of course it is finals week and I'm still up too so what do I know?  Good luck. No matter what it will be over soon.,False,False
