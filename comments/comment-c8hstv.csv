Wasn’t a complete lie since I hadn’t eaten due to nerves, essentially, but yeah it was a big fat lie. She knew it, I knew it. It frustrates her, it frustrates me.  I’m 80% honest 80% of the time. I find it much easier to talk to my therapist about grief and anger and basically any issue I have apart from my eating habits. It’s something we butt heads over but like here, online, is the only place, currently, I can put aside my shame and be honest about my ED.",False,False

I suppose the last lie I told her was that all is well, while neglecting to mention the fact that I’m relapsing.   When I was actually in treatment, I never lied. I didn’t see much point in spending time/money/energy on therapy if you’re not going to be honest about what’s going on. (Only exception is I used to waterload before my dietician appointments. I never lied about my intake, purging, etc, but I was scared she would drop me if I wasn’t making progress, and I really liked/needed her. In retrospect, I’m sure she knew I was waterloading since my weight “gain” definitely didn’t correspond with my caloric intake. Not sure why I bothered trying to fool her.)",False,False

I was in treatment for seven years for my ED and was quite severely ill during that time, but the only time I was ever threatened with involuntary commitment was when my BMI was extremely low, dropping rapidly, and I was purging excessively and not really eating outside of b/p. Other than that, though my treatment team had serious concerns about my health and my condition was classed as severe, they didn’t have grounds to have me committed.  (Sorry if this comment is coming across bitchy, not trying to be nasty. Just curious since in my experience being committed isn’t really a thing that is done.)",False,False

I’m fat af so he magically stopped loving me physically since I gained 30 lbs. so I mainly go to her about anxiety and marital issues. She doesn’t know I’ve had an ED for 14 years. I was down to 87 lbs at my lowest and 129.8 (now) at my highest.  I’ve never considered therapy for my ED ever since the forms stated I could be committed. No one normal throws up even vegetables and cries when they have to eat a sandwich and takes laxative tea a few times a week until they reached less than 90 lbs. I’m scared of recovery and I’ve never wanted it. I’ve been here since Proana when this sub was worth something.  May I ask how you dodged the bullet? I’m scared how to dodge it if I let it slip somehow.",False,False

I had a verrrrrry close call where I dodged an involuntary hospitalization about two months ago.   Do you feel like you'll get much out of the sessions without talking about your ED? I've been thinking about breaking up with my therapist bc there's so much I'm not willing to share. It's starting to feel pointless.,False,True
