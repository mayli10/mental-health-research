But the soy milk they have there is also super sweetened and has more calories than most. The syrups are roughly 25 calories per pump and a 16 oz gets four pumps. So, 100 calories for the syrup and 100 for the milk sounds right to me, but depending on what kind of soy milk the cafe uses it’s likely even less.",False,False

I usually go for the the sugar free vanilla so no calories from the sweetner or just splenda. The soy milk has a good amount of sugar in it as is so I think its p sweet,False,False
