I found it in my local library and found it invaluable to helping support my BFF with AN. The biggest takeaway from it is that it’s her health and her responsibility to take care of herself. I found that a huge burden lifted from my shoulders. I would not engage with any of her ED behaviors. The book I recommended tells you how to redirect and behave in a supportive way without trying to control your loved one. Good luck. Take care of yourself.

But I agree with the other comment- you should absolutely be her partner and not her therapist, and you should be focusing your efforts on getting her into therapy.  She has to decide she wants to get better. It’s sucks, but it’s all up to her.  I’d consider getting therapy yourself if you’re not in t already, this sounds incredibly stressful.",False,False

Ultimately she needs to be the one to decide that she wants something different than the life of an eating disorder. Your goal in supporting her should really be to get her into therapy.  The thing that motivates me is life outside of food and weight. So by doing other things, my motivation for life increases. Do your best to remember that she's a person outside of the eating disorder and maybe try not to engage in eating disorder discussions with her.",False,False
