I stumbled across this post and could relate to what you’ve said. It is a difficult decision on whether or not you should still continue being on these reddit communities and other online forums alike. I respect anyone else’s viewpoint but mine personally is that these places on the internet can both be helpful and unhelpful depending on your current mindset. If you find a certain post or topic triggering you aren’t able to unread it and that’s really unfortunate.   It’s comforting to have people you can relate to especially because eating disorders specifically can be so isolating and misunderstood. At the same time though, the subject of a persons struggles can really shift your thoughts and take away your focus on recovery (at least this has been my experience). What you are feeling right now is probably very conflicting for you and the fact that you brought the concern up that you are “worried about staying being a bad thing for your recovery” speaks volumes. From the sounds of it, you have a history with this community and have shared many times with the people here.   Like anything else in life it is hard to let go of something that played such a major part in your past. Sometimes letting go is the best thing you can do for yourself and I know that isn’t the feel good answer you probably hope to hear. No matter what anyone says on this post please do whatever you believe is the best for yourself and your recovery. I truly wish you the best with your journey of recovery!",False,False

I think you just need to be honest with yourself on where your at in recovery.  Try journaling about how reading subs makes you feel. Maybe using it as a jumping off point to reflect on why certain triggering thoughts arise or what fear of loss means. Dig deeper into that. Maybe disconnecting from the actual behaviors but seeing them from the ops emotions and how you connect to that can help you in a different way.  Some people can compartmentalize in that way others can't. In eda they don't let you mention behaviors weights ect for good reason but sometimes i know i personally need to see the dysfunction and pain in the nitty gritty sense so im reminded how dark shit gets and how fast it gets that way,False,False
