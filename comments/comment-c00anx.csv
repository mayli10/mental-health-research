All my worst relapses were when I went away to college. It’s just very tempting to fall back into these types of behaviors when you know no one is watching you. It’s also the sense that you can create a sort of new self in your new environment.,False,False

The first time I moved to the city, far away from family, to an apartment where nobody would be able to regularly see me, I knew that I'd most likely relapse. The funny thing is that I would have killed to be totally alone like that with only my ED just a year or two prior to that time in my life. I did end up restricting again literally on my first day there and kept telling myself that I'd eat normal on the next meal. Yikes, my mum ended up noticing my ED behaviours were goings nuts during a visit with me a few weeks later",False,False
