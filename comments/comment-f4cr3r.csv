I'm aware it doesn't help. I took them this morning but then had to be dumb and b/p which I really hadn't been meaning to do. I had a monster ultra but that was about 16 hours ago now and I have a very high caffeine tolerance. Only mint tea, no chocolate. I'll try vegetables, is spinach ok?",False,True

Just saying laxatives might be unnecessary.. also, have you had any caffiene? Tea? Chocolate?   Something great to restore electrolytes is vegetables, they are full of water and nutrients, and low in calories. Will be good for your heart.",False,False
