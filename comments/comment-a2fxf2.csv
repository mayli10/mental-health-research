I ate half a pint of Ben and Jerryâ€™s chocolate therapy a bit ago and tasting it on the way back up was fuxking gross. The cherry garcia flavor was actually pretty enjoyable coming back up, so I think itâ€™s mostly the chocolate mixed with stomach acid etc   Itâ€™s really a shame. ",False,False

It probably melts down there then gets all sticky and it doesn't really mingle with fluids the way that other foods do; ever notice how difficult it is to get molten chocolate off your fingers with just water and without soap? Yeah. It's like glue in your stomach. That's my best guess anyhow. ,False,True

Why is that?  I thought it'd just melt on the way down but I guess it's heavy gloop?        brebek15  uploaded a video about the subject, but the craving must be strong because she b/p a hell of a lot of chocolate.  Sorry for no real contribution, but the chocolate thing always made me wonder why it's so difficult.  ",False,False

For some reason it doesn't stick to your stomach in the same way that chocolate does. Perhaps something about the natural fats of nuts. But then I personally find pure nuts easy as well. Don't even have to drink a lot with them. Maybe the PB mixes with the chocolate. I find that chocolate purges definitely have to have something that the chocolate can mix with and stick to, otherwise it'll just stick to your insides. ",False,True

Happily I hate Chinese food so I've never tried it. And yeah, you have to add the chocolate to something to make it easier.

Chocolate *flavoured* stuff. But chocolate by itself or stuff with chocolate chunks in it is the worst. It seems like the chocolate just gets separated from the yoghurt/ice cream/whatever in your stomach. The yoghurt/ice cream/whatever will come out easily but the chocolate will just melt in your stomach and stick to your insides. Blech. ",False,True

If it's thick like the Boston kind, it's much easier. The thinner, and especially the crispier it is, the more difficult the purge will be.  Taste of pizza coming up is mostly dependant on the toppings. I like pizza with stuff like feta, spinach and aubergine, vegetable toppings too, and they don't taste too bad. The worst thing is the tomato sauce. Really most kinds of sauces taste awful coming up, especially when they're made with either tomato or garlic. Holy crap, purging garlic sauce makes you wish that you'd never been born... ðŸ˜–",False,True
