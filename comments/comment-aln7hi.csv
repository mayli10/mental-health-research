Although eating disorders do have their own special category and can develop in a large variety of ways, they are obsessive and compulsive behavioral patterns, so you could classify it as OCD, if you wanted to be very non-specific.

I'm not diagnosed with either but the one time I opened up about OCD behaviors to my psychiatrist, he started referring to ""my OCD"" (unofficial diagnosis I guess?  I have weird food habits. its always gotta be about eating a certain number, or ""finishing"" something when ur ED is like ""hey, don't eat any of that"" and then your OCD is like ""hey, eat EXACTLY 4 of that"" OCD wins a lot because it knows I'm a fat bitch who likes food and will listen. and also because, mentally, I get to go to hell whenever I deny compulsions.",False,False
