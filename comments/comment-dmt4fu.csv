Honestly, I'm pretty crazy, too. (That's why I try to be more understanding of the stupid things SO's say.)  He was telling me about a girl we both knew. She was tall, but always very chubby. Well, apparently, my boyfriend saw her years after we had known her. She apparently went through some traumatic event and lost A LOT of weight by his account. He described her as looking like a freaking model. That's all I could think about all day. He has never once called me a model or anything close.  She's also half-white/half-Japanese, and I know he's obsessed with Japanese things and mixed race people. Anyway, I'm getting too far into my own insecurities.",False,False

A lot. thats never in question. He loves me for me and not my size or whatever but I just freak out so quickly. I take everything so personally.  Also the other night he just got done telling me a bar-story and he kept mentioning this ""Super skinny blue haired girl"" that everyone at the bar wouldn't leave alone and how he hoped she was okay and that put me on high alert. Maybe even jealousy. I dunno. I need to stop being so crazy. or commit to a fucking fast for once.",False,True

I don't think it's fair that you lashed out at him.  I'm terribly sorry about the dress not fitting, though. There's nothing that makes my dysmorphia worse than trying out clothes.",False,False
