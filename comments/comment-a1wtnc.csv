I thought, ‚ÄúOmg I don‚Äôt know why it took this moment for me to finally understand calories are ‚Äúfood‚Äôs potential energy.‚Äù When I‚Äôm healthy I can think things like, ‚ÄúShould I eat this? Do I need the energy it would provide?‚Äù Although for me right now I am not healthy and it‚Äôs not about calories. It‚Äôs about the fact that I have literally no control over anything in my life and I need this right now. ",False,False

From what I remember she has a chronic illness and her meds make her gain/lose weight very easily (or something along those lines). She's super body positive, especially on her Instagram, and gets very aggressively angry when anyone tries to tell her how good she looks when she lost weight bc it's only a byproduct of her illness.",False,False

She actually went into this a lot more in-depth on her Insta too. Her changes in weight were caused/exacerbated by changes in the medication she has to take for her chronic illness and pain, and she explained this was why she hated thinking of weight loss as inherently positive and hated people complimenting her on it like she'd done something worthy of praise when it was literally a complication of her lifelong illness.  Her language about fitting into clothes also struck me even though it was just a throwaway line for her and stuck with me. She's so wonderful at presenting the issues that are important to her in a concise, empathetic, strong way without sounding defensive or combatative.",False,False

It's amazing. I've always, even as a little kid, talked about things like ""well I weigh more now because I grew three inches"" or ""I lost some weight because my cross country season is over so I'm eating less"". It's crazy when you realize that some people just.....didn't experience their lives through the filter of a disorder. Their size or weight is just an incidental physical thing, like allergies or hair color.",False,False
