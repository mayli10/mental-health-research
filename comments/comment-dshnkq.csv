I know that what they’re doing is triggering to you and that’s awful but maybe try having a talk with them about it? Let them know how what they say effects you but also let them know you care about them as well. If I were you I’d definitely unfollow their private account and explain that it’s nothing against them, you just can’t see their posts without it triggering you. I know for me when I’m really debating asking for help from a doctor or something I get much more open with other people about my bad habits  just to see how they react and if they’re as concerned as I am about it and that’s what this sounds like to me.  So yeah, you should unfollow the account and just let them know you’re worried and you care. If they continue to trigger you then maybe start cutting them out of your life for your own sake.",False,False

I don't mean to trigger others and I wish my brain didn't make me say all this stuff but for some reason I can't help it, I think it is because my life has become so consumed by my ED, as well as perhaps the self satisfaction my ED gives me (I am 'proud' of having an ED if that makes sense for some sick reason). My mind is obviously ill as is anyone's with an ED and that is probably the same with your friend, I doubt they want to upset people, it could just be their ED and the way it effects them that could be causing them to do and say these things.",False,False

I agree that it's not a healthy way to go about it, considering how this content can be affecting others, but it also kind of sounds like a cry for help. I'm sorry it's affected you in this way. Is she aware at all how this triggers you?",False,False
