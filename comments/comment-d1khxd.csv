I restricted so well for like. 6 months last year. Like 24+ hour fasts every other day and on my eating days it would still be omad.

Making a menu and knowing days ahead of time what I will be eating. I pepper in some fun foods so I know they are comeing and can get enjoyment out of looking forward to eating them.   If I have to make a decision about what to eat right now I always make a poor choice and go with a craving and not what my body really needs.,False,False
