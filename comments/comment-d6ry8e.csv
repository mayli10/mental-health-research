Some days better than others, some days worse than others. Mostly I shift between progressing and regressing. Strengthened by my victories and weakened by my defeats. Recently it has been a sixth moment period of growth. Physically and mentally.   As you mentioned in your post above. I also have a personal trainer and at first I hated any exercise that wasn’t high intensity interval training. I hated the idea of eating. I hated the idea of failing a bench press or a squat because I had restricted. I hated being weight and measured. I hated the loss of control and I mourned my first and only love cardio. I fought weight gain. Even though most times it was lean muscle gain. I felt fat and worthless. I worked with my personal trainer and I grew slowly.   Four years ago. I stopped attending my P/T. I binged and purged, restricted and did heavy cardio. I had glanced my image in the mirror and thought I had become overweight. I couldn’t see muscle growth only big blobs. I was terrified. I couldn’t control my weight, I couldn’t run or do cardio. All the work I had done. All my discipline over the years. All the pain and suffering for nothing. I was distraught.   Deep down inside to this day I would be probably dead only my P/T sought me out. We talked and I explained I hated the fucking scales and I was afraid of becoming fat again (when I was in my early teens I was 20 stone.) We talked and we agreed I would eat push for gains and progress my strength. If the ratio of fat and muscle came unbalanced. I could do some cardio. I pushed through &amp; upped my numbers and I am stronger now. I always get the comments in the gym “good strength for your size” “should be bigger the weights your pushing.” “I just reply over active thyroid. It’s a bitch.” It’s not my thyroid. I am still no comfortable with eating.    Sorry for droning on. Its scary, frustrating and feels like a betrayal of everything you have achieved and suffered for weight lifting.   Cardio provides comfort. Restricting provides safety. The contentment of knowing you’re not putting on weight but lifting weights for an ED suffer can be the next stage of your recovery or ED. You are eating low kcal high protein foods. You are becoming leaner. Stronger and Healthier. You are becoming heaver but its lean muscle. Not fat.  Unfortunately moving from an ED to recovery won’t give you a beautiful body. EDs take away trust and sow confusing. It takes time and weight lifting can be frustrating because to build strong lean muscle the muscle has to fail. People with an ED hate to fail. We want the comfort of numbers, targets and restricting.   I know it’s scary and frustrating. It feels like you moved to a new town and from a major city. Everything feels different &amp; out of place. The way things are done there are different to where you grew up. Give yourself time to settle in.   Posting helps. Keeping a journal helps. Don’t let it get tangled up in your mind. Cause there’s no formula for how your body should look.  Hope this post helped.",False,False
