There are really only two body types for models, straight size (US 2-4) or plus size (12-14) and only the former has any realistic chance of getting consistently booked for runway/editorial work. The argument for only booking straight size girls for runway work is that designers are only making sample sizes but... I‚Äôve never seen anyone defend sample sizes being a US 2 instead of a US 6. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èI‚Äôm not sure there really are any good reasons beyond the designers preferences, which is why is so important for consumers to tell fashion houses that they don‚Äôt want to see such skinny models on the runway, in editorials, or in advertisements.",False,False

On super skinny models it just...hangs.  I do think it's easier to photograph really skinny models as it mitigates the possibility of bad angles.

I have a 24 inch waist at a normal BMI at my height, but a tall woman basically has to be underweight to fit a sample size.   But that‚Äôs not really a good reason IMO. If we could just make the change to 36-26-36 being standard, over time it would be easier as the designers got used to it and then the models could be both healthy weight and fit sample sizes.  This is my best guess for why the fashion industry defends underweight. Not sure why anyone else would.",False,False
