It‚Äôs so easy to go from what culture sees as typical dieting into disorder eating into a full-blown eating disorder, and I wouldn‚Äôt want any of them to deal with what I go through. It‚Äôs scary shit, but I still feel so awful trying to be this ~*~love yourself~*~ body positivity spokesperson when I know the ugly truth. Blegh. At the very least, at least us and OP are doing good by discouraging others and encouraging them to be healthy!",False,False

Like, I wish that I had stopped before it was too late and I was too far in the ant lion‚Äôs trap that is an ED to escape it. I get this urgent sense of panic when anyone else is doing something at all disordered because I wouldn‚Äôt wish this hell on anyone and I know how easy it is to push it just a little bit more, to slip just a little bit more.

My best friend group is ALWAYS texting in our group chat about weight loss goals and diet foods pictures and pictures of their weigh-ins, and I texted them the other day to please not take the number on the scale too seriously and to not obsess so much about food because those are super unhealthy ways of looking at our bodies and food and we need to love ourselves.  And I meant all of it genuinely because I want the best for them and want them to be healthy. But I do the same shit I tell them not to because I don‚Äôt give a fuck if I‚Äôm destroying myself, so long as I can have the little bit of control this disorder gives me. It‚Äôs so fucked, lol",False,False

Someone recently told me that they were only getting about 600-700 calories a day here (we are abroad and he doesn‚Äôt like the food) and had already lost six pounds in a month and I started telling him how it was unhealthy for someone as active as him and blah blah blah, and the entire time I felt like the biggest hypocrite. I was in the middle of a fast, and hadn‚Äôt eaten in days, have lost twice as much as him but ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",False,False
