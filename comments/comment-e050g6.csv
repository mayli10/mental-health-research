Caffeine is a natural hunger suppressant, whether you get it through tea, coffee, soda, or an energy drink. However- if you're ever stressed about a soda not being diet (that is not in a sealed bottle, because obviously soda in a sealed bottle will be what's on the label) you can test it by putting some on your fingertips and tapping them together till it dries. If it's non-diet, it'll get very sticky, if it's diet- it'll get hardly sticky at all. Don't stress it too much- you'll be ok &lt;3",False,False
