Everyone wants you to take a side. I don't think it's a good idea to antagonise people about their weight/eating habits  I had issues with strangers from their erroneous perceptions of themselves and each other, and from the rise of ED's in the public  I thought strangers looked at me in 2013 and conspired it would be a lot of fun to shrink me to x kg. I think I'd freak out and eat more out of self-defence  When I needed help- I was weak from my ED and malnourished a few years later, and couldn't push it any further- I had people looking at me who thought I was ""perfectly healthy"" and I could stand to lose some weight, and that I was ""fine"" ""great"" etc-  It's not a recovery-friendly society :/ you can't get license to binge/re-feed/gain anywhere- they don't support it imo?  Even if/when you do get it- by then you're so confused and deluded by your ED latching onto every negative example/anecdote from a deluded public, you'd have to completely re-train your brain  You'll have internalised too much brainwashing and your insecurities/fears are manifold.. it doesn't matter if there is any proof anymore  So many people read into strangers and create problems with them, think they're out to get each other etc. They're not schizophrenic. They make me feel like I wasn't that bad on that spectrum either  It's weird. What if they invalidated overweight/obese people the way they invalidated people at the opposite end of the spectrum? ""No one is fat"" and they're vain/attention seeking for wanting to be called fat- they are Not Real‚Ñ¢  And they just left them in the waiting rooms and therapists/Dr's told them ""food is good"" ""enjoy food"" if they said they had ED's on the BED spectrum, and scales told people they were 1kg",False,False
