I can't find the exact article anymore, but I think it was conducted by the university of boston maybe ?????   Anyway, it showed really effective in the beginning regarding weight loss but it was only in the short term - the participants basically gained a lot more back. Additionally, there were a lot of side effects like depressive episodes, muscle pains, heart problem etc etc.  So I def wouldn't recommend taking to much L-thyroxine :D",False,False
