I think disordered eating numbs most of our feelings because just getting through every day is so hard.  It’s hard to have a spiritual connection or connect with God when food and hunger and pounds are all that’s on our minds.  Suffering is a really complicated subject; there’s many different views on it from a faith perspective.  I’m of the opinion that the world is disordered and broken because of original sin, including our bodies.  It’s not if suffering was God’s original intention, but a consequence of free will.    Lamentations 3:33 33 For he does not enjoy hurting people     or causing them sorrow.",False,False

Recently, I committed to recovery and somehow this brought me 100 times closer to Him. I find it helpful tbh because whenever I'm struggling to avoid using my behaviours, I pray and most times, I don't give in.   I'm praying for you and hope things get better for you.",False,False
