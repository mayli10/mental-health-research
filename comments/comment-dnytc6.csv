It is not lesser in any way. Walk the path that is right for you and for your marriage. You and your spouse are wholly a family &lt;3 (I can imagine it does get complex when a child is wanted and there are difficulties with conceiving/adopting, or if there's a mismatch between what partners/spouses desire. I don't know if that's a factor for you.)  (A ramble about my experience fwiw) For awhile, people kept telling me ""you'll want kids someday"". Or crazy stuff about how kids would be life changing. (Sort of implying that having kids would be some panacea for mental illness? Now \*that's\* insane.) But I've met women who genuinely \*wanted\* kids. And the fact that their wholehearted desire for children was totally alien to me really solidified my choice. I'm just not endowed with the mental or emotional faculties to even bring a child into the world, much less raise that child in love and security and stability. I don't feel my life is lesser for that, because everyone's path is their own. Someone else's path might be fulfilled by a child. It's just not \*my\* path.",False,False
