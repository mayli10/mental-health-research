My throat hurt so bad I wasn't able to talk all day before the purge..and while I was purging, I got so sad and felt so pathetic. I basically went limp and numb and just let my fingers do the work while the rest of me went lifeless.  I wear baggy clothes to hide myself of course, and when I lifted up my shirt this morning to assess the damage, I was low key shocked.  I binge because I'm fat. Yes it makes no sense, but I'm sure other people can relate on here. Anyway, I've lost 25 pounds recently, and when I lifted up my shirt, for a split second, I was shocked. I think it takes some time for the dysmorphia to kick in, because when I looked in the mirror, I expected the same old fat stomach to be revealed when I pulled up my shirt, with pudgy sides and overall fat everywhere. And while I'm not close to underweight yet, I was shocked to see an actual, average-looking stomach. Like, my stomach is almost flat now.  Because I've binged the past 2/3 days, it's really hard for me to remember the progress that I've had since November. I mean, I've lost 25 pounds, and ffs, my BED diagnose got brought down from moderate to mild (this alone is huge for me). I have a waist now. My double chin is gone. My chipmunk cheeks have gone way down. It's so easy to wrap all my fingers around my wrist now. I guess I look a lot less grotesque and monstrous now.  I fucked up these past couple days really bad;I have to admit that. But I have to move on from them. I can't let these binges hold me back from my progress. Two days of bingeing is not going to make me give up recovery. I can't let that happen. I don't *want* that to happen.  It would be so easy to turn back now, cancel my breast reduction surgery, and binge my way all the way up to obesity, or at least overweight. But I guess great feats are never easy, as otherwise, everyone would do them.  I feel so pathetic for having an invisible battle with myself instead of fighting the dragons of the outside world..but I guess, considering BED has been my whole world since I was 12, this is great, for me. And if I have overcome this, my greatest vice, I can overcome any obstacle given to me.",False,False
