I felt like i was a ""fake"" but realistically, looking back especially, I see how much I was struggling and that there was absolutely nothing fake or healthy or normal about my mindset/behaviors - my physical ""health"" was irrelevant. I try really hard to feel grateful now, though. I'm sorry you are struggling with this. Just try to remind myself that anorexia is primarily a mental illness and how your body reacts does not determine how sick you are or how much you struggle.",False,False

I have a hard time both loosing and gaining weight, and I have no much complications. I even went to the dentist yesterday, I expected a ""well 5345345 cavities""  but I got 0, and a ""you have good teeth"" I can't believe it. My psychiatrist also made lab tests on me and he was also surprise how well everything is.... I am glad but also very annoyed and feel I exaggerate and I am not really sick and deserve no help. I just want to feel lucky that I am healthy after trying so badly to hurt myself.",False,False
