Yet to find anyone my height as thinspo, most are too thin for me or don't have the same curves as I do. I have a large chest and hide hips that don't go away with weight loss. I usually go off chest/waist/hip ratios for my thinspo. ",False,False

Not sure how accurate those reports are but I’m going off them anyway ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ",False,False
