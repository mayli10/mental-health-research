Thank you.  Also called- have gained around.. 5-10~ ish pounds during summer.

A size one is too big but I‚Äôm terrified of trying a zero because if that‚Äôs too small I‚Äôm gonna feel huge. I know I‚Äôm skinny but I still see myself the exact same way as I was before and tbh it‚Äôs fucking terrifying. Like I‚Äôll take body pics and Ill look at them after and see myself as fat but then I‚Äôll go back to look at it a couple hours later and I‚Äôm literally skin and bones. This is fucking with me so much I want to be better but the thought of gaining weight terrifies me. I‚Äôm a mess lmao,False,False

Plz take care of yourself today. One of my fav things to do when I‚Äôm feeling reckless like this is to go on a biiig shopping spree to some place that I know will take returns (like Nordstrom or Sephora or Mac or athleta) and then a week or so later once I‚Äôve calmed down, I go in and return what I don‚Äôt actually want.

When it‚Äôs Coke Zero/diet Dr Pepper it tastes too similar to the real thing and I have mild panic attacks for /hours/ after thinking I‚Äôve unintentionally gone over my cal for the day. üôÉüôÉüôÉ why üëèüèªam üëèüèªI üëèüèªlikeüëèüèªthis.",False,False

I work in a school and last year I lost weight over the summer. This year? I've gained 10 lbs. since school ended in June and I'm so embarrassed to go back. My brain is screaming at me to fast and restrict but I just can't stop the binge cycle right now. All of my clothes are tight and I'm miserable.  This is a suoer busy week for me so I didn't schedule a therapy appointment but I am finally seeing a dietitian on Thursday so maybe that will help? I don't know. I just want to feel like a normal person...,False,False

It wasn't even close to binges I've had in the past, it's actually less than what I've had on ""normal"" eating days. I guess my stomach has gotten used to being empty.

Sir, that is my emotionally support cleavage, I need my boobs to stick out as far as they can to distract from my stomach sticking out as far as it can.

He didn't believe me in high school about my ED and now I have a formal diagnosis and am going into treatment and I want to tell him about it...but I don't think he'll believe me unless I'm thinner.
