When I was younger things like not hugging unless for show in public like to make things look good for extended family or a family portrait. Also lots of arguing that stated a few years later and comments about my mother’s body and how she stopped bothering to take care of it or try to lose the weight. At first she went to a gym with a friend regularly and then got busy with moving when we moved then started jogging and got plantar faciatis. She developed unhealthy eating habits and seemed to give up and went around to all sorts of doctor’s and blamed her weight issue on different medical stuff. Now she had a handful of other stuff wrong too and that was why she couldn’t lose weight. Really exercise isn’t the main thing that causes weight loss it’s 80% healthy eating and portion control, which is why she couldn’t because she got frustrated and had the foot injury and thought she couldn’t because she couldn’t jog but overeating and jogging would still lead to not being able to lose the weight. It was the eating habits. It drove my dad away that she blamed everyone around her, other health problems that she might not have really had, and would doctor shop to answers she wanted and not have to address her real issues (undiagnosed severe mental illness and probably binge eating disorder).",False,False

Around about this time I would silently tell my self ""I'm not turning into an anorexic, I eat eveyday""   hhhmmmm....can you say denial?  After a few months of that I was having strong urges to cut and bleed and self-harm. I found that starvation was a great outlet for this urge because it's invisible. No new scars! is my mantra.   And it was invisible- until it wasn't.  My weight loss had become the elephant in the room.    I have since left that group of people and my daily life has changed considerably.  Lately I am very fearful of developing a binge problem and the realization that many people suffer the whole spectrum of EDs has got me terrified of going bulimic.   I've also come to realize that a great deal of my self worth is tied into being thin. It's as though it is my only accomplishment in life. I have no degree, career, I have accomplished very little in my life. Being thin is not an accomplishment!!!!  But so often when I feel like a worthless human being I can always tell myself ""well, at least I'm still thin""  After I fast for a significant amount of I time I feel a strange sense of pride.

I had access to free bone density screenings through work and even at my lowest weights, my bone density was great. I was getting at least 1200 calories a day then, though. That was my thing back then, no more no less.   Now when I quit the pill, my period was sporadic to put it mildly. I could go 55+ days without one, even though at that time I was 5'6"" and 111 lbs so technically not THAT underweight (I gained weight after quitting the pill with no diet or exercise changes, go figure. Also lost hair and got really bad acne). It took about 8 months for it to get into a cycle and then I was getting it every 45 days on the dot.

Maybe even print out something you've taken the time to write on Reddit? I find talking out loud about my ED and anxiety exhausting, especially if it's a thought I already expressed in writing.

I quit the klonopin cold turkey a few years ago when I started seeing a new Dr who is a university professor and still actively involved in research especially on memory. He told me I should never have been on it that long and it was probably fueling my brain fog. I quit and it wasn't hard and lo and behold I actually started sleeping better. Other than that I still felt like my angry and anxious old self ... HOWEVER, 3 years after quitting I got the bright idea to try it again bc, you know, anxiety. HOLY CRAP I've never felt worse in my life. Like I didn't want to go on, couldn't be bothered to do anything, anxiety through the roof. I will never touch that shit again.

My father and mother didn’t seem attracted to other. My mother got pregnant with my sister. I was so young I couldn’t verbalize any of this and it was all subconscious.

Effexor (which by itself does nothing), abilify, adderall, and klonopin. I was paying my friends bf to help clean  while he was unemployed. I have cleared out tomorrow to deep clean and invited a friend over Monday to keep me honest. I need to clean before maintenance comes to install my ac for the summer.   I'm not sure how much of my attitude is because I really feel like I'm being honest with myself about how I look and what I have to offer or if its depression still. When I think too hard about my life I usually end up crying. However, I was at one point recently (like 2 years ago now) so hardcore depressed I had to take breaks at work to cry, would cry to and from work every day, planning my suicide, unable to go grocery shopping, drinking too much so I could throw up (it's how I became bulimic), and actively destroying new friendships. I'm not at all like that now and I can actually enjoy things. So it's better but I often wonder if I have a med issue or a ""me"" issue. Does that make sense? Like, is this as good as it gets? Am I still depressed or do I just need a good breakthrough in therapy?  But the last few weeks despite generally being in a better mood bc of the sunshine I keep finding myself sobbing into reddit and writing out my worst fears. Part of it is cathartic and the other part is desperately reaching out for someone to say that one thing to me that will help me and make me change my mind about myself.   I also am kinda going to overeaters anonymous (I havent been going to meetings consistently or calling my sponsor daily) and while the people are very supportive, I'm not really behind the efficacy of the steps. I'm a pretty staunch atheist and believing in divine intervention is the antithesis of my core beliefs and values. I feel like having something other than God as a higher power is just mental gymnastics. I was working on steps 4 and 5 and just felt worse so I've been putting off finishing for months now (step 4 is about making a moral inventory of yourself-- your mistakes, people you have hurt, people who have hurt you and things you resent and step 5 is sharing it with an understanding trustworthy person like a therapist or your sponsor).   I do have a therapist I see weekly but sometimes I feel like I gloss over shit.

I'm really into skincare now that I'm older and I pay a lot of attention to my looks, so here's my take on it.  I can tell you that from a skin quality perspective, no it has not aged my skin, in fact I've got good skin thanks to my mother (and getting smart enough to wearing spf and hats around age 30, ugh I was terrible to my skin prior to that, never wore SPF and did a lot of tanning). I have zero static wrinkles, only when I smile or lift my brows does the skin crinkle but it immediately snaps back into place. Keep in mind a lot of this is genetic bc from all the nutrients I've deprived myself of combined with the fact I've had acne that I pick at since I was 9 (I'm serious, I could write a book about my life with acne!!), I should look like an old hag. I'm giving all the credit to my mother for this one.   From a not having much fat in my face perspective, yes absolutely that will make you look older. When I was pregnant and gained 44 lbs, I sure looked a lot younger in the face from the fat. When I see older women that I know are anorexic, they look so much older than their healthy peers. Sometimes I read comments on this sub of people bemoaning having a fat face no matter how thin they are ... Makes me laugh, they are lucky!  As for my hair, I've always had TONS of really long fine hair. I shed so much of it when I quit the pill to get pregnant but it all grew back. Sadly, my acne got so bad after pregnancy I ended up on accutane. Now, I can't say for certain what it was, but it was either the end of my accutane course or the fact that I started doing OMAD fasting that I lost about a third of the hair I had grown back and it has not grown back since. This was exactly one year ago when it fell out, which coincided with my last month of accutane and the end of my first month of fasting. I'm still doing 12-20 hr fasts most days a week and I drink a lot of prosecco so maybe that contributes to it not growing back. Having less hair ages me a lot, in my opinion. I think I'd shave three or more years off my looks if I had all my hair back. I really miss my hair 😭  As for the rest of me, I'm like a spring chicken. The skin on the rest of my body is in great shape, I don't even use body lotions, never have. My teeth are perfectly fine despite ten years of daily purging. I've got really defined leg and ab muscles and I'm fit from years of cardio, even though I only walk these days. I have no chronic aches or pains.   My soul is old though LOL. But seriously, this disorder will rob you of a lot of joy and it's a shame when you look back on it.",False,True
