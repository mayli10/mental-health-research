It just goes to show how far gone general society is in being blinded by vanity. When I look back at pictures when people said I was glowing, I really did look like I was dying, and I wasn’t even technically underweight. I wasn’t me, and my face was sunken in. Sometimes I want it back, but I realize now that I am actually glowing because I am healing. Wishing you the best ❤️",False,False

Last week when my bradycardia was acting up and I hadn’t eaten in days, like 3 of my co-workers decided to tell me how “good and healthy” I seemed all the time. I don’t understand normies at all??",False,False
