Could describe it as on/off or as periods of remission/relapse but honestly about half those years I’ve been UW and even during remission phases I’ve been at low end of NW and still with ED thoughts.   Recovery is super hard. I’m doing it again now, and like you my recent relapse was triggered by accidental weight loss after a really bad bout of flu followed by traveling off grid and losing even more weight. It was easy to convince even myself that it was all due to circumstances and not a relapse but it did get pretty bad and it was scary.  I’ve been with my SO for 18 years, and it’s only really this year I’ve started to be able to talk about my ED frankly with them. Even though they’re super understanding (as much as a non-ED can understand ED anyway) and supportive, but it’s something I find it incredibly hard to talk about even so. Idk it’s embarrassing, deeply unsettling to open up about the most vulnerable and buried inner workings of ED brain, even with someone I share a deep and intimate relationship with. I’m getting better at it though and I’ve found it very rewarding and liberating. It’s a real leap outside my comfort zone but as I remind myself that’s where the magic happens. This recovery period I’m in now has been the most successful so far by a long way, psychologically; and I think the full disclosure talking has been a key aspect to that success.  Good luck with your recovery. Here to listen if you need to rant :)",False,False
