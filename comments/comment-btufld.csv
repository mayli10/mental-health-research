And my therapist keeps on telling me to eat nuts as snacks. Like I even told her I eat other healthy snacks (fruits, tuna cans with rice cakes, roasted chickpeas and etc) but she keeps on telling me to eat it cuz I probably wont purge it. I literally told her how much a single almond's calorie is but she won't shut up.
