Everyone deserves to be able to find cute clothing they feel good in tbh. I don‚Äôt have that problem yet, but going from a US 6 to a US 2 in a few months is dramatic enough for me to be very shocked at my appearance changing.",False,True

I‚Äôve been dealing with this for about 7 years and at this point I dunno how realistic recovery is. But this is the smallest I‚Äôve been and I‚Äôm weirdly worried for once? I‚Äôm just looking at gaining 3kg for now so I can function better. 19.5 bmi just isn‚Äôt working for me so I‚Äôm hoping 20.5 works better.   I‚Äôm hoping I won‚Äôt give up before I get there because otherwise I‚Äôm gonna have to drop out of uni and get pushed into a treatment centre that my family cannot afford.,False,True

About 5 lbs above underweight. I almost passed out at work yesterday (had to lower to the floor but didn't straight go black). People around me are kinda concerned. None of my clothes fit either and I bought a new pair of 00s that were too big.   I made a sample meal plan of what I would have to eat to maintain and not lose and it was so goddamn much food that I just gave up.  &amp;#x200B;  Good luck on your recovery!,False,False
