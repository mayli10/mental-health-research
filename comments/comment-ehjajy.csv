No one has ever been remotely worried about me except to say my BMI is too high. Almost no one knows I deal with eating disorder stuff and the ones that do I had to tell. And I doubt they took it seriously at all since I don't look like it. I told my doctor on a lark and she kinda brushed it off and congratulated me on my 20 lb weight loss (dropped from my highest weight after baaaaad relapse). Gotta love it.,False,False

I really wish I could do away with the binging aspect of my disorder, especially since binging and overeating cycles tend to last longer than my restriction cycles. As a result, I'm a person who engages in anorexic behavior but still has an obese BMI. It makes me feel like I'm just a fatty and not actually disordered because every time I restrict and lose it all comes back when the binge monster appears.",False,False

Whatever you do, do NOT start purging. It fucked up my teeth so bad to the point I’m afraid of going to the dentist and I can’t have anything too sweet, cold, or hot.

After going through a bout of binge-purging (lasted maybe a couple years?) I’ve downward-spiralled with restriction. The shame that came with binge eating was indescribable. 99% of the reason for my restriction being as bad as it is, is due to the fear of yo-yo-ing back to the other extreme again. I can never go back there. I can’t.",False,False
