While searching what lipedema is I found an example suggesting a person with lipedema may be a size 8 in their upper body and a size 16 in their legs. Do you experience any pain  in your legs or do they bruise easily? If you're concerned you should speak to a doctor about this.,False,False

I’m not really freaking out anymore considering all the “fatty” areas on my body feels the same and like, if I’m becoming skinny in those areas then the fat tissue on my legs shouldn’t be any different. But idk honestly cuz I ain’t a doctor 🤡🤡. I’m pretty sure this is just like a classic case of searching up some mild health concern and ending up diagnosing yourself with cancer. Sorry if I made you worry about it that wasn’t my intention 🥺",False,True
