I don’t want to armchair diagnose but you might want to look into it and see if it feels right to you. The acronym is ARFID but you can look up food avoidant disorder as well. It doesn’t sound like this is regular “pickiness”. Stay safe and good luck I hope you find some answers.",False,False

One thing this reminds me of is my own food aversions that arose due to birth control - are you taking that? Or any medication with hormones?",False,False

Your body is physically rejecting certain food — that’s an active psychosomatic reaction and absolutely not just you being “picky”.  I’ve felt something similar! Personally I have a need to plan out “safe” meals the day before. If for any reason I can’t eat the thing I was planning on eating, my brain completely short circuits, my throat closes, my fight or flight response kicks in for some reason (what am I going to fight?? the soup???) It’s not exactly what you’re describing, but I understand where you’re coming from. You definitely aren’t alone.",False,False
