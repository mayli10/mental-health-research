Like. Beyond creepy. And of course the whole site is a cesspool.  That said, I live for drama and staring at the moral wreckage of bitchy people's souls, so I'd totally read it anyway if it were open to the public, but yeah. No.",False,False

A couple sentences about why you will be a good addition to our community. 2.  Your height &amp; exact weight. You must be smaller than BMI 18.5. 3.  Selfie holding ""SkinnyGossip‚Äù sign. It's OK to blur out your face. 4.  A full-body pic to prove your stats, ideally holding sign from #3.  Everything will be absolutely private and never shared with anyone. Once you've sent them, DO NOT bug me or ""follow up"". If you're accepted, I'll send an invitation. If you don't hear within a week or so, you're likely rejected. It is OK to try The Bullcock (@thebullcock / thebullcock@gmail.com). He pays for everything so he's allowed to invite/approve. But that'll only work if you're hot.    Wild :\\",False,False

They claim to be pro-""healthy skinny"", but require you to prove you're underweight in order to join. That makes no sense...? Plus they're really channelling FPH. I can't imagine this community is good for anyone, especially underweight people who claim to not be disordered.",False,False
