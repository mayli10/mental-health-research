I have a ton of self-hatred, anxiety, depression, and shit thanks to my ED past. I just want to kill myself at this point, because I feel so tainted.   I brush my teeth at least five times a day, and if I don’t I have a breakdown essentially. I neurotically clean my toilet. Any food mess must be cleaned up immediately (I used to live surrounded by wrappers and binge/purge mess). When I b/p now, I tend to forget where I am and what year it is; I just automatically think it’s a few years ago and I’m in my shitty apartment that was literally coated with purge and binge food shit. I legit feel startled when I come back to reality after purging and realize I’m not in my old apartment. I also have AN now, fuelled by how disgusted  I am with my bulimic past.",False,False
