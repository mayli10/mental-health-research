If your manager feels that you cannot safely do your job, and HR backs them up, they can force you out on medical leave -- it would be considered medical leave in this situation. And it would be within their legal rights to not allow you back until a medical provider notes that you are safe to work.",False,False

My ed is not a secret at work and no one has ever asked me to seek treatment or take time off.  In fact it seems they like it, because anytime there's heavy boxes to be lifted (etc) they come straight to me. They know I'm happy to help if it's going to involve physical activity.",False,False

I'm in a US state where my employment agreements have been ""at will"", so either me or my employer could terminate the employment at any time, without any particular reason. With the convoluted **however** of my mental health diagnosis putting me in a protected class under ADA so they technically can't fire me *because* of my illness, so long as I can do the job with reasonable accommodation. Which sounds like it may not be the case for you in the near future? Ultimately, you're probably going to have to check with HR or an employment law person.  I never had to get into the finer legal points though, because my depression got so bad that I had to use FMLA and then transitioned straight into short term, long term, and federal disability. Oh joy. Still trying to get my life on track after 4 years. Which horrifies me.  Before you're faced with the downward spiral of losing income and health insurance, and the overall benefits of having a daily schedule and purpose, maybe looking into forms of help is something to consider? Sometimes if we wait until we feel 'ready'...that takes us all the way to a serious crisis before being pushed into accessing help, which is a super hard path out of the darkness for a number of reasons. (Not that any path is a stroll in the park of course.) Hoping you'll find what you need &lt;3 Best wishes.",False,False
