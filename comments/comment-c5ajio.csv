Would like to go harder but I’m visiting my mom and grandparents so I have to eat or it’s considered rude (we’re Asian and food is very much a part of our culture, it’s an insult not to eat food offered to you). Plus I love my grandmother’s food so much, I’m just eating it in moderation now.   Absolutely no chocolate or peanuts — not only are they usually my favorites, but they give me hella acne, so I haven’t had them in a hot minute.  Very very limited dairy as I’m lactose intolerant.  And — this one is really hard — no coffee because I developed a caffeine dependency :/",False,False
