I know it seems hypocritical of me but believe me, once upon a time I would have balked and cried my eyes out too.  Hell I still feel attacked by the idea of what's going on with the ED twt, that's what having an ED does to you.    But your feelings are completely valid.  They aren't attacking you but you're allowed to feel upset.   We're all ill.  Your feelings are valid as hell.   I hope you feel better soon and that if you do lose weight one day, it's for healthy reasons and you can maintain it and feel happy and see that you've always been beautiful, bmi aside.",False,False
