HOWEVER, what i DO enjoy is stuff like those buzzfeed videos where people just try a bunch of foods. that‚Äôs much better for me personally. i like watching people eat more realistic amounts because i‚Äôll live through those people. it‚Äôs the only way i can feel like i get to eat stuff like japanese kit kat bars.",False,False

They're the more chatty mukbangs and less ASMR. Then there's j._author on Instagram who has a [mukbang YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPC1-MIWNEZ1nZKuOBeGarg), which is the more ASMR type and is in Korean.

So I've spent my time imagining the food I want to eat but I also get a tinge of the shitty binge aftermath feeling that keeps me from wanting to actually binge.,False,False

But I watch the videos for the same reasons I follow food porn accounts on Insta and such - I like food, I like cooking, and I feel like I get a secondhand enjoyment out of seeing and imagining the textures and tastes of really good food.  Also, I watch mostly vegan mukbangs, and it introduces me to new foods that can be/already are veganised, so it gets me thinking about planning future meals. I also like the idea that non-vegans who watch the videos may be surprised by the variety and deliciousness of vegan food if they have any preconceptions.  Also, I guess it makes me feel good to see other people eating when I'm not? Even if it's a pre-recorded video. Not in a superiority way, more in a reassuring, binge-control way.",False,False

Also the food she makes is really pretty and interesting.  Also by the end of the videos I strangely feel full and satisfied, as if I was the one who just ate all of that. Sometimes I catch myself unconsciously making chewing motions alongside her. I definitely watch those videos to help me restrict. I know lots of other ppl with ed who find it weird bc they say that those videos only make them hungrier but idk for me its soothing in a weird way. But I also watch them for the visual and audio stimulation, so I guess they both serve me a purpose and bring me simple entertainment at the same time",False,False
