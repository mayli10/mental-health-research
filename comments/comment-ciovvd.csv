Hello acne, flaky skin, fatigue, and all that shit.   • It messes up your toilet! Do you want black mold growing in the water chamber of your toilet? Cause that’s how you get black mold there.   • On that ^ note, it can damage your sewage system thing and you’ll need to get a plumber to un-fuck it (depending on the problem, they may have to pump out all your sewage, and believe me they will notice all the vomit). Talk about a waste of money!   • I swear purging just makes me hungrier the next day and I end up eating more, on top of it increasing the likelihood I’ll binge eat.   • When I purge, since my body is so damaged from years of purging, I go in and out of losing feeling in my hands and legs for a few days afterwards. I can’t do things like cross my legs or leave my hand in one position for longer than a few minutes, or else I’ll lose feeling in it.   • Microscopic vomit (or not so microscopic vomit) will end up on your face and probably give you acne. At the very least it’s super gross.   • When you flush your toilet, microscopic particles of whatever it is you’re flushing (be it shit, pee, or puke) are projected into the air. You’re effectively coating your bathroom with micro-puke every time you flush purge.   • Y’all could get esophageal cancer. Yikes.   • Your digestion can get messed up and you’ll be bloated the next day if you eat anything.   • IBS time! Yay excruciating pain.   • For me, the mental effects of purging are terrible. I feel like I’m not longer myself, like I lost a part of myself when I purged. And any weight loss that results from purging just feels like a sham.",False,False
