They can increase appetite, which can cause weight gain, but you could drink two gallons of diet coke per day (which I've done), and unless you're in a caloric surplus, you're not going to gain weight.",False,False

(I don't study artificial sweeteners lol but I've done my fair share of looking through research on them). Basically sugar provides energy to your body because your cells will take it up, some chemical reactions will occur that produce energy available to the body as a result. Some artificial sweeteners cannot be broken down in the so your body is unable to use them to produce energy. Other ones provide a smilier amount of energy gram for gram, but are significantly sweeter than sugar (like 100-500x) so you need nowhere near as much. Check out this [chart](https://www.deardoctor.com/articles/artificial-sweeteners/page3.php).  Theres still lots of research to be done but current research suggests they are safe, or at least as safe as sugar. There are some findings that they may impact the types of presence of bacteria normally found in your gut (which are important for digestion, hormone production and appetite regulation). So they could mess with your hunger cues and that. But directly they do not cause weight gain due to calories!",False,False

Stick to the ones with a low glycemic index. Sucralose is common one. Aspartame is great ignore the lies about it.  Maltodextrin is The worst in my opinion, it’s glycemic index is greater than sugar!",False,False

There’s very little evidence that I’m aware of that show’s artificial sweeteners affecting weight.   Most people assumed they’re making people gain weight because most people who use them are overweight. *That’s why artificial sweeteners are “associated” with higher BMIs,False,False

I’m on keto and personally if I have any artificial sweeteners it makes me more likely to break.  Other than that I don’t think there’s enough scientific research yet to really know.,False,False
