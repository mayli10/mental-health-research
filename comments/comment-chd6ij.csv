It’s just that I fluctuate between wanting to look lean &amp; “fit” vs. being really underweight so I’m scared to potentially bulk up by lifting more often.",False,True

It’s hard to come to terms with, that I could be running too much for my intake.",False,True

Please don't do that. It's how I spent 6 months injured because of muscle wastage. Not to mention i was slow af with no energy and making no fitness gains :/,False,False

I took up running recently but have had to put it on the back burner for now, since my ED is adamant it gets the attention and won't allow me to eat throughout the week. I only decided to stop when I went running after not eating for 4 days and felt like my heart was going to give out. Not only was that scary, but my performance suffered greatly.  Even now I'm noticing that it's impacting my ability to walk and do my job; my chest hurts if I walk too long and I have no strength to move stuff at work.  You need the energy to fuel your runs, otherwise you're going to suffer injuries which will take longer to heal if you're not nourishing your body. What you're eating is low for the amount of running you're doing. Whilst it might seem like a high number, you need to look at it relative to your activity. I wouldn't suggest you go any lower if you want to keep your performance up.",False,False

I just started running 2 months ago, so my endurance is pretty low still. If I restrict to 1000 or lower for a few days I definitely feel it affecting my performance. You may not notice this as much since you run so much and enjoy it. But I’d recommend you at least stick to 1200 and listen to your body. You don’t want an injury that will affect you the rest of your life. It may not seem that serious now/if something happens soon, but your feet/legs have to keep you going your entire life. Basically be careful about injuries and up your intake and take rest days when you need to",False,False
