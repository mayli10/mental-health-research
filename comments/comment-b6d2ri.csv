The thing that most terrifies me though, is transferring next year. Not because I'm afraid of the workload, but because I'm entering a program in dietetics and I know I'm going to feel like a fraud if I'm in school for that while also having an ED in the back of my head at all times. It hasn't been a problem at my current school because basic classes like chem and microbio are just gen ed, but actual dietetics courses? Especially when all of our professors are going to know us and I know I'm going to freak out during experimental food science courses where we have to cook and eat foods. I *want* to have an emphasis in study of ED's, but I'm afraid if I reveal that, people won't believe me when I say I can't taste taste the drinks we made in class because I have IBS, and no I can't have even one little sip. (No I don't actually have IBS but I'm totally going to make that up to get out of things at my new school B).",False,False

Like I did well enough in undergrad, but also I feel like I'll do better if I'm low key restricting instead of binging like I was then? Except that's not how any of this works and I'm so scared to fuck it up.  Because you're so stressed and in college, they do have counseling on campus most places. You could go for the stress and just have an outlet to talk without having to leave for recovery. If you're not ready to talk about your ED, you could just talk about school, because college is fucking stressful as anything. You deserve to be happy and not feel like you're walking on eggshells constantly &lt;3",False,False

It‚Äôs my first year of college and I can relate to almost everything you‚Äôre going through, from trekking across campus to the ONLY single occupancy bathroom in the art building, while trying to maintain my grades while simultaneously eating and throwing up everything in sight (or just starving).

I‚Äôm pretty sure people know I have a problem and I‚Äôm kind of alienated at my school as a result...but oh well. That‚Äôs what my ED wants anyway.   I wish I could provide you some sort of reassurance, but I just wanted to comment to let you know you‚Äôre not alone.
