Everytime I ate, I felt like the most disgusting, worthless piece of trash on the planet, and I wanted to die. But it got better. Not from following cliche advice about loving yourself, or anything like that - for me, at least, I couldn't even hear that sort of thing from down in the deep hole I was living in. What made things start to get better for me was deciding that I wanted to live. Just out of curiosity, to see what might happen. Little by little, everything else followed. I hope things get better for you, too. No one deserves to suffer such torment and self hatred each time they perform a life-sustaining action like eating.",False,False
