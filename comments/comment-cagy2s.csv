The reason I recommend going no lower than 1,300 calories per day is because it's pretty rare for people to have a BMR lower than 1,300. It's also very difficult to get enough nutrients with any intake even close to that low. I think if you want to lose weight in a healthy way that you should aim for 4-5lbs per month.",False,False

I'm currently at the cusp of being a healthy weight but more on the overweight side, which is more or less triggering my eating disorder in the first place, so what originally sparked a desire for everyone's experiences is just a genuine outlook on what to expect. I think that out of everyone that replied, so far, that I can agree with them and you that ~8 pounds a month is the healthiest way to lose weight without seriously compromising your health. Currently I'm at a TDEE or 1900 when I'm sedentary and have been attempting a 500 calorie intake, but like you said, it makes people very sick. I know this from experience that it's not fun or healthy to do this to yourself, so hearing more about the ways in which weight loss differs for different people is helpful! I think, also, with the way I'm going at it, I'm more likely to hurt my body earlier than I am to get to my goal weight. Thank you again!",False,True

I don't remember all of the numbers, but based on a very quick calculation (*which I may have done wrong, I didn't put much thought into it*) I believe that an average person could lose as much as 17.6 lbs in four weeks. This would require complete starvation though. As in literally 0 calories consumed. Let's say that average person simply cut 1,000 calories from their diet instead. That's a lot more than any person trying to lose weight in a healthy way would cut. That person, according to my math, could lose a maximum of 8 lbs in a month.  For the purpose better understanding this post I used numbers I commonly see referenced in restaurants stating that the average person requires 2,000 to 2,400 calories per day. Assuming this refers to calories needed to maintain their weight and averaging the two numbers I went with 2,200 calories as what the average person burns in a day. One pound is 3,500 calories, so by calculating the amount of calories which would be burned in a 28 day period and comparing that to the number of calories per pound I got the two numbers I listed above, 17.6 lbs and 8 lbs lost per month. The way I would interpret this data is that it is theoretically possible to lose 17.6 lbs in a month, but that under no circumstances should you ever try to lose more than 8 lbs in a month. I would also like to add on to this that if the amount of calories you need to maintain your weight is less than 2,200 calories per day that the 8 lbs figure may be unreasonable for you. Considering that your flair states you're 5'7"" and overweight it might be possible for you to burn enough calories to lose 8 lbs in a month, but it will likely be very difficult as it requires a serious cut to caloric intake. As well, for anybody reading this who might be underweight or close to underweight, I don't believe that it would be possible to lose 8 lbs in a month for you. To use myself as an example since I've been teetering between underweight and a healthy weight lately, my TDEE is around 1,600 calories. Under no circumstances would I be able to cut 1,000 calories from my daily intake and be able to remain healthy. It would make me very sick. For this example I'll cut only 400 calories. This would put my below my BMR which means I would still likely get sick from this. Considering a net loss of 400 calories per day I would be able to lose 3.2 lbs in a month. That being said, I'm currently just under a healthy weight for someone of my height and losing that weight would be bad for me. I would recommend that you do not try to lose weight if you're already below an average weight. At that point if you would like to be thinner it would be best to focus on toning your muscles while remaining at your current weight. Be careful not to become too lean however because your body does need a certain amount of fat to stay healthy.",False,False
