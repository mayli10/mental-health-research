I have no idea why scales do this it’s ridiculous and triggering but it happens to me all the time. Given you weighed yourself pre-weight loss and post weight loss in the same spot you’ve most probably lost weight and your weight is the one before you moved the scale. Try not to move it again it’s not worth getting yourself sad over :),False,False
