Turns out that a bunch of water plus a moderate amount a food plus a stomach used to even a reasonable yet less than maintenance amount of food = acid reflux, which can cause that extended fullness and pain. I'm trying to limit it to 1-2 cups of fluid (tea water coffee) during meals",False,False

Part of my fears were what I perceived to be ‚Äúunhealthy foods‚Äù, so a bit of orthorexia. So at first trying to eat junk freaked me out but my normal salads and fruits weren‚Äôt getting me to my goal.   I think I could definitely do more avocado and maybe peanut butter .  And yes maybe I just need more time. Thank you for the advice and encouragement ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,True
