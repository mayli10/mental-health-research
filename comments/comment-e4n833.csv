It probably says in the participation rules that if you have a ""real"" diagnosed ED you can't join because the show is not meant for gawking at the mentally ill, but rather bringing awareness to how food impacts weight for the clueless people who are ""naturally"" thin or fat.   They have a narrative and participants are just actors selected for their body type who are made to pose for certain scenes and read from a script.   As someone from the UK - this is exactly what's wrong with both public perception and even most doctors. BED is barely acknowledged at all, it's just ""lol fatty too stupid to eat less, let's give them a food pyramid leaflet"". And while anorexia and bulimia are acknowledged, proper treatment is only available when you are underage or on the brink of death. Everyone else gets into a months to years long queue for 6 sessions of therapy where they just tell you to eat a cheeseburger and not stress about it so much.   And this show further propagates the idea that food issues are just quirky habits. All you have to do is show them how a hotdog is made and they'll go ""eww, I'm gonna eat healthy now"". Or shove food down their throats and they'd be like ""oh that actually tastes good, I've been missing out, thanks doc"".",False,False

It's not interesting to me, the premise is bizarre, and it feels like the main appeal is to judge the people on it - whether for being too fat or too thin, or for being ""crazy""/""delusional"" - and I'm not... into that, so I just kind of sit there going... okay... now what...  The part I liked was seeing a representation of the food they eat put down those Teletubby-lookin tubes. It's really fascinating to see the kinds of foods and amounts I would definitely have been able to eat on a binge, if not now then at some point, all summed up together. It's also fascinating to see what high restriction looks like in total and especially when compared to each other. But everything else is just like... dead air to me.  I guess I like Secret Eaters bc even tho it's also absurd at some times and has needless theatrics (like tricking them into the wrong place at the end??) and there's also a sense of ""laugh at how delusional these poor uninformed people are"" I still feel like the people on the show and the people watching can take something USEFUL from it and actually get help... but I don't get any sense of that watching SSvSS. Also someone else here said that you can tell the super skinnies only go on there to get validation for their EDs and the whole ""I don't know why I don't gain more..."" stuff is just for show and tbh I can't unsee it now, they light up whenever they get called thin, ill, etc. It just seems like major triggering/validation for people with disordered eating, both on the show and in the audience.  Also I'm sorry but the people in this thread think Dr Jessen is hot??? Like he's certainly not ugly but he looks so much like the guy from Little Britain to me that I could not find him attractive..... shook",False,False
