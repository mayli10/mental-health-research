By the time i have checked everything I decide to can it anyway and have some water instead.,False,False

After every cheer practice I emerge from the gym covered in sweat and dead set on getting a diet soda. I’ve spent so much time in the gas station across the street trying to be inconspicuous as I spin all the bottles in the fridge so I can see the nutritional facts. One time I got so stressed deciding between Diet Pepsi and Monster that I started tearing up and left without getting anything.,False,False

I used to hate this so much I would check the brand/cals that my grocery store stocked online so I knew EXACTLY which one to buy without the judgment from other shoppers,False,False
