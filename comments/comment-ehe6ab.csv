So a lot of my coworkers are therapists and others are also probably trained in ed shit and what not. A lot of them are in the know. It's not so hard to understand what's going on when someone loses a lot of weight and gets thinner past healthy. There are only a few reasons why and one of them is ED.  I have to eat twice a day there. Breakfast and lunch as part of a training for the special needs people. You don't have to eat but coworkers encourage to eat because otherwise you're being a bad role model for the people you're trying to show normal human behavior. And because they know about my shit and are worried.  Still I didn't eat a lot and nobody could do shit about it, just telling me to be careful and that it's not healthy what I'm doing. Thankfully I'm in recovery.",False,False

None of my coworkers know about my eating disorder.  Itâ€™s really hard not to just snack all day, especially when itâ€™s just there and everyone else is doing it. I care a lot about this job so I find that helps me eat pretty normally at work. Then Iâ€™ll go home and be bulimic af ðŸ¥´",False,False

I went on medical leave back in April because I needed to go to treatment, and I had used up a whole bunch of sick time because I kept passing out at work. Went back in August, relapsed, had to leave on medical leave again in October. My work's short term disability ran out yesterday, so I am now unemployed. People were very, uncomfortably aware with what I was dealing with",False,False

Needless to say, I binge lots and then I hate myself lots. Especially since Iâ€™m eating and sitting which is the worst combination. Every now and then Iâ€™ll be good for an entire week and just refuse to go to the break room to avoid temptation. Itâ€™s a great perk, but I wish theyâ€™d get rid of it.",False,False
