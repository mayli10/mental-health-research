Great actors, great plot. Definitely recommend that one. I might argue that this is the best ED movie out there.  Also I recently watched 'Feed'. The reason why the protagonist develops an eating disorder might not be really relatable for most of us but it was a great watch. It squeezed a few years out of me. It's an unique addition to the list of ED movies.  Also, 'to the bone' might be recommendable but it didn't give me anything new and interesting. Still, it was a good time spent.",False,False
