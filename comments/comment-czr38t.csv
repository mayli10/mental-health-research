That's what happen. This is a huge achievement and just SEEING that ""99"" after years of it being a ""1..."" feels amazing. At my highest, I was 183kg but I got a gastric bypass in 2015. The day I saw the ""9"" as the first number... It was like my birthday and Christmas combined, and someone gave me a million dollars for both occasions.  Good for you, man. Seriously. So glad you got out of that hell. You don't realise how shitty it is until you're out, and I think that goes for all EDs, no matter what side of the spectrum they're on.",False,False
