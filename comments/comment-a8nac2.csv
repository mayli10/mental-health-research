Used to measure it but if I feel like it’s getting smaller I FREAK.   Also upper arms. Idk why I feel like it’s the first place I gain. I want to be able to wrap my thumb and middle finger around.

I could do it on my thighs with two hands. Atm I can feel the valley between my collarbone and the top of my shoulder blade, I touch it to remind myself that I am actually still thin. I think I have body dysmorphia because I don’t think I look uw (I’m still very uw).

Maybe because when i was bigger my fingers were also super chubby and were an odd insecurity. So if the gaps get smaller I tell myself i gained weight when really its nothing.   I also stand with my legs together and see how far apart my ankles are. Again I had cankles when i was bigger so this makes me feel better when I do random checks. I also sometimes try to see if my calves have a big gap but i just have to accept i have huge calf muscles ,False,False
