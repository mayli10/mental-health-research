I just try to ignore it because I figure that I‚Äôm burning more calories by being freezing. That being said, scarves!!!! A huge help!!!! Also some thicker polyester jumpers with a thin windbreaker on top, as long as you‚Äôre wearing tight pants. May get sweaty eventually because it‚Äôs polyester, but damn is it warm.",False,False

You can pick up thin under shirts and leggings that you can ether double up on leggings with (if that's your thing) wear under slacks or jeans or whatever.  On slightly less cold days I usually just wear a super thin black long sleeve under my tee shirts: button ups. When it's colder I switch to waffle knits or thermals.   Wool socks 'ale a huge difference.   Wearing a hat (even just a cap) makes a huge difference. There are also really cute head band type things out there that a lot of my friends wear if you still want to have your hair done up.,False,False

(un)fortunately, you're going to have to dress to remain warm. And there's nothing wrong with that -- we all look a little bigger with extra layers of clothes",False,False
