Mental illness is still illness. From what I've heard, mental state is the last thing to recover in an eating disorder.  It may be difficult but I think it would be a good idea to explain how you feel to everyone in this post that you mentioned. Just ask them maybe not to mention it or not to mention anything about your body (unless it looks like you are fully relapsing)  I hope you can feel okay enough to sit with this discomfort until your mental recovery progresses",False,False
