I forgot to mention that they are trying to keep me from purging, but i've found other ways to do it instead of the toilet. But your comment made me feel a lot more relaxed. Have a nice weekend",False,True

They would put you on a normal plan to see if you can eat normally. I'd be careful about purgeing, nurses are usually told to monitor your bathroom activity. Don't worry about any weight gain, if you are eating normally, most of it will be bloating/water weight, very little should be actual weight.",False,False

Sorry that I can't help, but: I'm also a Nordic Citizen, and I would be megainterested in talking to you about your experience! Like, how old are you and does your insurence/parents'/? cover the costs and stuff like that! Would that be okay? Och om du vill ta det på chat, förstår du svenska? :3",False,False
