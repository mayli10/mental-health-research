I highly highly recommend discussing it with your doctor, and eating at maintenance. Upping your fat macro could be helpful as well. Eating more sucks, but amenorrhea can lead to some really serious health problems long-term, like osteoporosis, so you don’t want to mess around with it. Good luck ❤️",False,False

Anyways, I went to my OB/GYN and since I am a marathon runner, I played the over-exercise card. She is super cool and prescribed a BC pill to kick my hormones up a notch so that my body basically forces itself to have a period despite my situation. I would check with your doc to see if this works for you! ",False,False
