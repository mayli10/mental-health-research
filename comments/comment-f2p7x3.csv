For the most part what our headaches are telling us is that we are lacking sodium, potassium and magnesium. (Apart from being fucking hungry.) but more often than not, itâ€™s those 3 deficiencies. If you want to go all out and make this drink, itâ€™s saved me a million times over.   1 8oz glass of water with: - healthy pinch of pink sea salt (sodium) - healthy pinch of lite salt or NoSalt (potassium) - Lemon  It might sound gross but it really isnâ€™t salty, especially with the lemon. It just tastes tart and REALLY refreshing if your body is low on these 3 electrolytes.   If the saltiness bothers you, put a small pinch of baking soda in the water and it negates the salty taste completely.",False,False

The powerade helps a tad, but the only thing that fully gets rid of the headache for me is eating. ðŸ˜‘",False,False

I didn't even realise i was getting headaches because of a caloric deficit. I'd magically feel better after gulping down some fruit though. Based off of personal experience: try to eat something high in water but also electrolytes or sugar. Like oranges or some watermelon. Preferably at regular intervals to avoid the headaches. ALSO: do not eat anything too high in sugar in search for a quick fix, sugar crashes are very real.",False,False

Theyâ€™re pretty well priced and my aunt who has chronic migraines uses them all the time.  Sadly though when Iâ€™m getting extreme cold (basically constant from undereating) I find that they donâ€™t help as they just freeze me &gt;_&lt;,False,False
