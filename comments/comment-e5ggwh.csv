But ultimately I know that I needed that food and I did the correct thing. Thanks for your comment! Also that's a nice inner mantra to have, I'll try to remember it for next time :) Thank you again ❤️",False,True

What you’ve eaten today is totally normal and not at all worth worrying about (I know that it’s easier said than done!). I’m glad that you got something to eat because it sounds like you are under a lot of stress right now, and you can help your body to deal better with that stress by giving it that gift of a little bit of energy. It’s so hard to feel okay sometimes and I often also look for outside help when I feel this way, but the best thing you can do for yourself is to be there for you right now. I like to remind myself that ‘right now, I am exactly where I am supposed to be.’ I repeat that in my head and it makes me feel so much better. I really try to believe it, even if it feels dumb and wrong at first. I know that you’re going to be okay, and I really hope you can believe it too.",False,False
