Basically that it may seem like a lot, but in the grand scheme of things, 10 granola bars isn't a huge binge (probably look like 1000 cals). And suggesting that OP reflect on the emotions they may have been feeling. Sometimes binging is a compulsion, but there could be an underlying emotional component. I'm not in OP's shoes atm, but have been there plenty of times, and I don't understand the problem with this response",False,False
