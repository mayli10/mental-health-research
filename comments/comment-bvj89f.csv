Or someone else you trust? If so, I highly recommend you talk to someone and get more personalized advice?  Not knowing more about the situation and your relationship with your mom, it’s hard to know the best approach. If you think she’d be open to discussing, maybe you can straight up talk to her? Be prepared to share that you feel like she has gone from supportive to critical, and it’s making recovery more difficult for you. Maybe share that you think (hope?) it’s unintentional and maybe you guys could talk about it. Be prepared with some examples of support that you think will help you, and some examples of things people think are supportive but actually make it harder to eat and why (eg. Making a big deal of praising eating seems supportive to norms but can often make people with EDs self conscious about eating too much). If she’s receptive, it’s also worth discussing her ‘why don’t you just eat’ mentality. Some people really struggle with understanding that people with EDs aren’t doing this by choice. I find it helps to put it in terms of an irrational fear the other person actually has, or a common irrational fear. Saying ‘just eat’ is like telling an arachnophobic person to ‘just hold that tarantula’. Even though people without phobias hold tarantulas all the time.  Depending on your mom, this could go well or it could not. I’m hoping the fact that your mom used to be supportive is a positive sign that she really means well and maybe just doesn’t realize how critical she’s become. If it doesn’t go well, or you don’t think it would go well, I’m really sorry. Parents can be terribly critical sometimes. Parents aren’t perfect. Some parents blame their problems on their kids. Don’t accept that blame.  You have a mental illness. You aren’t selfish. You aren’t ‘killing her’. As someone whose mother threatened suicide when I upset her, I definitely empathize with you. It is unfortunate when parents place unreasonable blame their children. Don’t let your mom’s criticism affect your journey to recovery or your self-esteem.  Wishing you the best!",False,False
