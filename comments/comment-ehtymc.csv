They don't do as good of a job (although Topamax gets pretty close for me), but they are still effective and much more safe than anything you'll get off the street. Plus you'd save some money.   But at the end of the day I know how you feel. I have ADHD and I don't use them to suppress my appetite but it's a jolly good side effect and I wouldn't really want to give it up any time soon.",False,False
