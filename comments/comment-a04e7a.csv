Booze has never been a problem for me like food. I get mildly drunk and then I genuinely want to stop. Craft beer is a hobby of mine , but for serious partying I prefer other substances.   It's what I ended up doing lol. Am now mildly drunk. Probs about 300 cals over maintenance- but didn't binge and no longer want to, so fuck it. ",False,True

I hope you feel a lot better after going outside, and I hope you can find a solution that satisfies your hunger without triggering a binge.  I can definitely relate to feeling panicked and stressed about eating even if it's under calories. Binge eating is always about the loss of control for me, feeling like I'm going wild and just eating whatever I can get. Even if that ends up being under my calorie limit, it's scary and powerless to lose control like that. So I know you can snap back from it xx",False,False

Because it was impulsive and I felt like if I didn't, I was gonna binge for real. I've planned and enjoyed far sillier meals, but that was not my head space today. I haven't slept much this week and really don't feel right.   I type this as I'm eating a huge bowl of shirataki noodles. I've been cutting for too long, I'm starting to get that real bad hunger.
