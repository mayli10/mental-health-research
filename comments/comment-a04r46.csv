It was one of the hardest things Iâ€™ve ever done in my life - but it really helped me feel like I was being proactive and that I was on track to be in control of my life.   Maybe consider this time off a blessing and an awesome opportunity to focus on yourself! Iâ€™m sure that work will all come together once you feel more grounded - the time you spent working was valuable experience and will help you reach your goals. And for now, maybe you can accept help from your mom with an intention to pay her back when youâ€™re back and working?   This shit sucks and itâ€™s hard and it feels like the end of the world, but itâ€™s not ðŸ’• thanks for sharing ",False,False

I will definitely hold on to that. I know my Mom loves me so much and it hurts me so badly to put her through this shit and I want so badly to get better. I canâ€™t stand seeing her like this it hurts so bad. ,False,True

Your mom would probably take every pain and worry you have and give it to herself just to see you happy. So remember that... you have a person who loves you more than you will ever realize. Hold onto that, and live minute by minute. You will get there.",False,False
