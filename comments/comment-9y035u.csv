Exercise bulimia and Orthorexia!"" because overexercising and macro obsession is secretly just the way to fit in with gym-bro culture. Lolololol",False,False

I used the word ""caving"" because I wasn't really approved by any mental health professional to start exercising again, but I missed it so much that I didn't bother - it was a very impulsive and not very well-thought-out decision, honestly. I literally woke up one morning and was like, ""I HAVE TO JOIN A GYM."" Fortunately, it seems like the path I'm on is a good one, but it could have gone (and can still go) very wrong. I definitely do have to keep vigilant still.  Agreed; the guy was young, too, and he seemed a little nervous - maybe new at the job - so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.",False,True

Lots of perks that will support you in avoiding the compulsion issues you've struggled with before.  Why are you referring to signing up as ""caving"" in the title of the post. I hope you don't mind me pointing out that you used a word that makes it sound like you may have chosen frame this choice as a bit of a relapse... but the type of gym you chose sounds like it really could just be part of a safe recovery   Kinda weird the person signed you up kinda took a dig at the people who were not as outwardly ""motivated""-seeming as you, but I guess people always say weird shit when making conversation.

Thatâ€™s awesome, it sounds like youâ€™re approaching it from a good headspace. I struggle with feeling anxious not working out but building in rest days to go live life and do fun things is so important!

I hadn't signed up for a gym for years because I was so nervous about relapsing. So far, so good - I don't push myself to overexertion, I focus on the non-weight related health benefits and how awesome it makes me feel,  and try to keep my workouts under an hour.  I also chose to hang out with friends yesterday instead of going to the gym, which was hard, but I did it :) ",False,True

The gym also has an in-house dietitian who'll be helping me with a healthy set meal plan so I don't have to think as much about food on my own.  I'm a little anxious but mostly optimistic because the vibe of the gym is very much wellness-focused, as opposed to weight-loss focused, and has people of all ages, shapes and backgrounds :)",False,True

Like classes? Go for it! Lifting some weights? Ease back into it! Want to hit the treadmill? Set a healthy limit- either in time or miles. Try and stick to a safe routine and remember your limits.
