If i eat almonds, which are generally pretty unsafe, i cannot eat more or less than 7. I've recently developed an irrational fear of oats for NO reason, which used to be safe. I will choose to buy higher calorie per gram foods over lower calorie per gram foods, even if they're more expensive for the only reason that  the food is pre-portioned out. I have to eat between 5 and 8pm, i can't even begin preparing food until after 5pm. I have a panic attack every week, without fail, about electrolytes. I have to recalculate my intake and my electrolyte/vitamins supplements to check that the numbers are all within a 'satisfactory' amount. whatever that means - it's not like im reaching the daily recommended intake for any of them, anyway?. Depending on the result of this panic attack, I can sometimes drink coconut water for a couple days after without being concerned about the calories. Other times, coconut water is a major fear because liquid calories are the devil. Except for in protein drinks, *sometimes*. I have a lot of food that is wildly dangerous on one day, but totally safe on the next. Makes no sense.",False,False
