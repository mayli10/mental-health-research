I think it was due to other substance abuse though i.e. alcohol alongside the medication. I take fluoxetine (generic prozac) and have maintained a BMI of 18 for the last two years. In total I've taken it for about four years now. I wouldn't worry about gaining weight, at worst you might maintain unless you're actively seeking recovery.",False,False
