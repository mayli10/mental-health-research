I told him I was too busy. He has asked every day since last Tuesday.   Today he told me “make myself” available this week for the photo. I have had this photo taken for the last 5 years every year since I was 30. Still can’t get my head around it.   Last year we got Caricatures done. I could have cried. Afterword’s a colleague asked me to go for a coffee (since I never eat with colleagues.) I made an excuse and just walked for a half an hour.   I have ended so many relationships and failed to start so many because of my body dysmorphia or as people tell me my lack of confidence. People try to encourage me but all I want to do is exercise, cut and drink. Sorry I brought down the mood.   Just wanted to share from Male perspective. Hope it helped. Helped me to share.",False,False
