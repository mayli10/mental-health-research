I drink these drinks called spindrift now that are sparkling, but don’t have any artificial flavoring, and the like ones are only like, 4 calories. So now I’m being hydrated/not having any more bloating/diarrhea. Hope that helps.",False,False

I think of it as giving your body a break from digesting food and such so it focuses on getting what you have in there...out lol.       ***Big sister alert*** Drink water!!! Diarrhea dehydrates you faster than you think and it can go from “I feel so much better” to “sweet jesus deliver me from these cramps and dry heaving” in the blink of an eye. DRINK. And remember, if it goes on for more than a day, might wanna get that looked at.      In summary, enjoy the mini cleanse, drink lots of water, and be well.",False,False

However, it should maybe be a sign that you should stop, or at least reevaluate what you’re doing during a fast.  Lots of things can cause it: general digestive weirdness, too many/too few electrolytes, too much water, too much vigorous exercise, stress, etc. Obviously I don’t know you and I can’t tell you what caused *your* diarrhea, but take a minute to think if you’ve done any of the above things. Diarrhea can be a weird but normal thing but it can also be an early sign that something’s going wrong w your health. You don’t want to accidentally hurt yourself.",False,False
