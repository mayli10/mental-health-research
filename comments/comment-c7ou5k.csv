You certainly have my empathy man. Also ftm and have always been obese (now overweight but Jesus Christ what’s the difference). I don’t think I have the COURAGE to do what you’ve already achieved by counting your calories on a “normal” eating day. My parents both overfed me so much with both meals and snacks that intuitive eating seems impossible. I constantly crave sugar and fast food plus I never seem to feel satisfied until I’m in physical pain from eating too much. For a long time, a typical day of eating for me was at least 1L of ice cream just for breakfast, then a couple of large McDonalds meals plus extras (sandwiches, chips and chocolate mostly).  If I tried tracking all those calories I swear I’d have a fucking breakdown. So definitely major respect to you on that part.  I’m also stuck in the 160’s and I had to heavily restrict and exercise just to get and stay there. I’ve also hit a plateau and am terrified of gaining again. Cue the cycle of fasting/restricting to cope with depression (and also as a form of self harm whenever I decide), then bingeing as soon as I start feeling better, feel like absolute shit and hate myself again, rinse and repeat.  My illogical brain often wishes there was a way to both break this cycle and continue to lose weight at such a satisfying rate... I’m sorry you’re going through such bullshit right now and hope venting somewhat helps. If it does then feel free to vent to me. Sorry my comment got so long. Your post felt so relatable and personal to myself and I just wanted to show that.",False,False
