I have some tips:  1) don’t weigh yourself for a few days. You’re gonna be bloated and uncomfortable and most of the weight will be water and food.   2) water. Water water water. You will be dehydrated and your body will be storing three grams of water for every carb you ate. If your skin hurts, this is why.   3) supplements. I take a digestive enzyme (speeds up digestion and helps with gas), a probiotic (for digestion), bromelain (digestion), a diuretic (speeds up getting rid of the bloating), and fibre (speeds up passing the waste).   4) you might feel like you have a hangover. This is because of dehydration, but it’s helpful to have painkillers, an antacid, something for nausea, etc, handy.   5) let go of the guilt. It’s not worth it and it achieves nothing. It happened, think of it like a reset, a tool for facilitating a fresh start. Ymmv, but I always kill it in the gym the day after a binge like this because I have so much energy to burn.",False,False
