I'm like ""cool, which ex?""  He says ""some tiny chick named Jasmine""  I'm like ""oh cool""  Just... ""tiny chick named Jasmine... Tiny chick... Tiny...

Like there are no redeeming qualities for my ex. Like at all. He's not even really attractive. So it shouldn't matter to me who he dates because I don't want him.

This guy is legitimately terrible, and it took me a long time to realize the amount of grooming, abuse, etc that he did. Heâ€™s always insisted on finding me immensely attractive, etc. but it feels impossible to not compare myself when Iâ€™m the only one who looks like me in his long list of very thin flings and girlfriends. One of his exâ€™s is a model and she came up on my Instagram. I can obviously see that sheâ€™s thin but when I looked up her model comp card and calculated her BMI, it made me feel even WORSE. Iâ€™m in a great relationship where I feel loved and validated, but seeing this stuff and looking for more information, is just a form of deciding I want to be hurt and Iâ€™m trying to stop.",False,False

Have you talked to him about it? Might seem weird, but chances are he still finds you super attractive, regardless of his previous relationships. I was my ex's first real relationship, but he still managed to make me feel ugly just with his comments and the way he talked about other women. I really hope that's not the case. My husband's exes kinda run the gamut as far as body type, but he really does do his best to make me feel attractive, even when I insist it's not true.",False,True
