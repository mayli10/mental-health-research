I suffer from severe depression and anxiety and only recently came to terms with the ED I've been struggling with for like 13 years. Also have a history of self harming. So .. I definitely feel like I'm a lot to deal with. I've lost friends over it. I don't let family in on my issues and there are very few people I talk to about anything. I feel like I shouldn't talk about it because I feel shitty so often, what's the point? They'll just get tired of hearing the same shit every day. I hate myself, but I'll put on a mask and pretend to be okay just to fool everyone around me into thinking I'm happy.",False,False

I can’t stand me so how the fuck could anyone else possibly be able to?   In my case I’m fucked if i talk about my problems and I’m fucked if I don’t so I just don’t even know what to do anymore.   *Insert old shrugging man “guess I’ll die” meme here.*,False,False

People get frustrated with me because I can't open up, but it feels better to be bottled up than to spill my messiness and have people either freak out, or get sick of it and drift away.   But anyway, do you have access to a therapist or counselor? It sounds like you could really benefit from seeing one. (I mean, I'm that person who feels guilty burdening their therapist, too, but at least it's their actual, defined job to deal with patients like me.)",False,False

I could only talk to other people with these problems. Around normal people, I mostly joke around and tell basically nothing about myself.  But... I also understand your bf.
