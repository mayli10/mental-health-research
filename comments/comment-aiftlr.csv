I‚Äôm finally at the point where I‚Äôm aware of why the binge and restrict phases are problems, not just normal patterns, and why they are each harmful in their own ways, and I even started working on it in therapy. Hasn‚Äôt helped and I‚Äôm currently back to my bullshit trying to regroup after several months of binge eating and gaining what I‚Äôm pretty sure is 30-40 pounds (I‚Äôm terrified to weigh now). I promised myself I would do better, but here I am ready to pull all my hair out at the idea of doing the ‚Äúintuitive eating‚Äù thing when I already know I can restrict and work out and be down to goal weight by May, or sooner if I want to fast a lot. I mean once you‚Äôve broken the mold so many times I have no idea how not to fall back to it. The worst thing about these phases, I think, is that it feels like the binge phase is just months straight with zero control. I literally feel like a monster. But then restriction gives you so much control, but at so many costs. It‚Äôs exhausting. ",False,False

Then I lose 20 and gain back 15 so I end up in the exact same place I was. Never fails. During my unintentional sustaining weight phases (maybe every other month or so) I do manage to keep that weight stable working two lb fluctuations though. I‚Äôm normally happy and not feeling stressed in my life at those times though.   As soon as I stress though it‚Äôs either a huge binge cycle or a very restrictive restricting cycle until I‚Äôm no longer stressed or I‚Äôm forced by my husband to change my eating. ,False,False

Got weighed at doctor‚Äôs office today and have gained back 20 lbs. it‚Äôs an awful feeling. ",False,False

My longest was a few years ago where I lost 60+ lbs, then gained 100+lbs back bc of pregnancy complications. Since then, my fluctuations last a few months instead of years now. Down 40lbs the backs up 40lbs to my high weight.  It's miserable, and even more so knowing that years ago I was better than this and could hold a low weight for more than 3 months. All this higher weight yo-yoing and bping cycling is bull. ",False,False

I'm hoping to get my binging under control and try to recover from these horrible swings. I'm so sick of having such disordered eating...but it's so hard to break the cycle. ,False,False
