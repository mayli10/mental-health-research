I'm not sure what you normally eat on other days but I'm not seeing a lot of protein sources in what you've listed. The nuts and milk probably barely got you to 40g of protein for the day. Protein massively helps with feeling satiated so if you haven't already try increasing the amount of protein you're eating. 2-4 eggs on toast for breakfast, if you scramble them with milk and a bit of cheese that will increase the protein even more. Not sure if you're vegetarian but for lunch you could try chicken and vegetables or a garden salad with cheese or a tofu curry or something. Same sort of deal for dinner. Try having a protein shake or bar as a snack in the day but make sure the shake or bar has at least 20g of protein or it's not really worth it. Also drinking water which you probably already know. Sometimes I find zero calorie soda like coke zero to help because it distracts me, it has flavour, and it won't add to my calories for the day.",False,False

I went 2 months without eating back last winter and lost about 70 pounds. Now Iâ€™ve gained back like 40 and Iâ€™m in mid panic. Ironically Iâ€™m starting my fast the day I started last year lol. Back when I started eating I binged a lot and tried purging to deal with it. When your body stops fasting our instincts tell us to stock up again in case we start starving ourselves again. This causes our appetite to be ravenous and quite troublesome for people like us lol ,False,False

It fucking sucks and Iâ€™m sorry you have to ride it out. They say that after an extended period of starvation, your hunger cues are out of whack and try to overcompensate just in case. It takes a long period of regular eating to fix them again. Maybe youâ€™re just emotionally hungry? Maybe try throwing yourself into an activity you love might help? Either way, you can get through this!!",False,False
