Is there any way you could convince your boyfriend not to make you eat those foods? Wishing the best for you♥️",False,False

Your appetite goes crazy, your digestion slows down, if you purge enough and your gag reflex dies you'll be forced to deal with painful bloating bc your body is used to you throwing it up, you'll be constipated, you'll have horrible acid reflux. I know scare tactics don't necessarily work, but please stay away from it.   Don't let bulimia form. It will fuck up your life, and you will end up miserable.",False,False
