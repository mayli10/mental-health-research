I have to eat at work so I don't get dizzy from all the physical activity, but then I feel way too full and don't want to eat the rest of the day. Usually I will eat a snack right before I go in and then a 200-300 cal lunch at work. You would think I'd be more hungry after I work, but I feel so gross after lunch, I can't do it. I want more food on my days off, maybe because i'm not distracted. It's a pain. ",False,False

I finally made myself eat some green beans bc I know my body is suffering and then immediately wanted to throw it up--not even as a 'purge', but just because I felt so nauseous.  :( so now i'm back at the library, shaky hands, dressed in 10234 layers and I know I need to eat but I just have no appetite whatsoever",False,False
