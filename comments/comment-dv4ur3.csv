We walked into the first coffee shop and I went ”NOPE this is NOT the one” and me and my SO had to change coffee shops. We ordered a cheesecake with whipped cream and chocolate drizzle and split it in half. Eating that half of a slice of cheesecake (without whipped cream) felt like climbing a huge mountain. Fucking ridiculous, being that worked up about one piece of cheesecake, not like I ate it every day for a week.  Other crowd favourite: picking out a blueberry from my portion ’cos ”oh that’s one blueberry too much”. And thinking it’s normal behavior.",False,False

They used to ask me everyday to go with them for lunch, but because I stopped going with them for lunch for so long, they eventually stopped asking me. I always had an excuse. “Oh I have class” “oh I have to go home my mom told me to go home quick” “Oh I’m eating out with my family” Now, I feel left out because they have different groupchats without me in it and stuff but it’s my fault so.",False,False
