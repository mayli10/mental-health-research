She‚Äôs right in some of her points about the patriarchy and the way women are told their entire life that they just prioritize their looks and weight over everything. But she‚Äôs naturally stunning. She has clear skin so she doesn‚Äôt need photo shop - no wonder she wants to ban it. She doesn‚Äôt need it. She‚Äôs naive to think that she doesn‚Äôt have immense privilege for being born with a beautiful symmetrical face, plush lips, almond eyes and a clear creamy complexion. ",False,False

Stop trying to be quirky).  But I truly appreciate Jameela. She‚Äôs open about her past ED and body image stuff and actively fights against people photoshopping her pics ( https://twitter.com/jameelajamil/status/1069802329245925376?s=21)  Also she posted a gif of her shaking her arm so you can see it jiggle (https://twitter.com/jameelajamil/status/1040288172804956160?s=21)  She‚Äôs just so done with body shaming and self loathing. I‚Äôm here for it.
