Just yesterday I made a broccoli and cauliflower rice stirfry with peas and bell pepper, onion, tofu, fresh garlic. I don‚Äôt use oil when I cook so all of it which was a giant bowl that I split into two meals was 745 calories. Thy was my food for the day and I was full",False,False

I honestly like it more than ice cream. You need a high powered blender or food processor to get the thick consistency.   Once a week, I cut up a ton of veggies and snack on them throughout the week. Carrots, snap peas, cauliflower, bell peppers, cucumber, bell peppers, daikon radish, and celery.   Frozen raspberries or blueberries. Add some vanilla extract and sprinkles to kill a dessert craving.   Dessert teas, like tazo lemon loaf, with a truvia and a splash of almond milk.",False,False

So I'd go on the hunt for oil free hummus. I also want to recommend low cal beans, but I don't know all of them in English. (Young) Capuchins (thanks Google translate because I swear these are bomb), broad beans and baby green kidney beans are all lower calorie than other beans.",False,False

Unfortunately I'm not vegan anymore but I'm transitioning back there.  Vegan snacks are rarely low calories but you can find brands that regularly bring new products in. Depending where you live, that might be fairly hard so I would just suggest finding foreign brands too and find recipes on how to make these snacks.  Another option is to take non vegan recipes and replace meat with cauliflower and milk products with vegan products. It usually works fairly well except for cakes, unless you use almond milks.",False,False

There is /r/vegan1200isplenty which is good for meal/snack ideas. I like pickles and kimchi (without fish) for snacking on, the dairy-free Halo Top is good too. At Asian grocers you can find low-cal snack packs with konnyaku in them in either sweet (like jelly drinks) or savoury (with spiced sauce on them), and fresh-packed seaweed snacks (not crispy like dry seaweed sheets, tho they're good too). Also PB2 is vegan and really hits my PB cravings üòã",False,False
