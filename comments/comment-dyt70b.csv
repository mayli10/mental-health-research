She doesn’t have a higher metabolism than other people would at her level of activity and leanness. She’s really muscular and works out a ton so the energy goes towards maintaining her athletic performance and muscles. She probably does track protein or naturally eat a ton of it. And she’s probably been very athletic her whole life and has always focused on building muscle. She probably does a lot of strength training.  Personally, I know this type of body is not easy to achieve for many people but I also think it’s not that hard. All you have to do is be consistent with diet and the gym which is hard at first but can become easy once you get used to it. My body looks a little bit like this when I exercise a lot, minus the abs of course, but it’s not my aesthetic. I don’t like having muscular arms and legs. Unfortunately it’s difficult for me to maintain that level of leanness at a lower weight because I find it hard to lower my calories and exercise that much at the same time.",False,False

They all have just amazing metabolisms. The mom I’m in her 50s, has had 6 kids, DOESNT work out, and had a body like a fitness model. No plastic surgery. No drugs. Eats a standard American diet. Drinks on the weekends. I just don’t get it.",False,False
