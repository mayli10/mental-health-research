Like if I have cookies instead of just saving some of the cookies for later, I have to eat them all while I’m in a binge mood so I don’t binge on them tomorrow",False,False

I can start the day with such a good mindset and feel so in control, then my brain will be like “fuck this, you need to eat anything you can find.” Some days going over my calorie limit by 500 is enough for me to call it a binge some days it’s 2000+.",False,False

Also eating past the point of fullness, usually to the point where I feel sick either from just how much I’ve eaten or because of all the sugar. There’s this sense of desperation too, like I have to get as much food in my body as possible because after that I’ll have to starve again",False,False
