A 500 calorie deficit per day will have you losing a pound per week. Might be a slower rate of weight loss than you’d like, but it’s sustainable and you can do it in a healthy way.  You can’t remain physically and mentally healthy on 700 calories per day, doesn’t matter how many vitamins you take or how much extra weight you’re carrying. Vitamins aren’t going to provide you with the macronutrients you need to remain physically healthy. Protein and yes, fats and carbs, are all necessary for your body to function properly. And mentally, restricting like that can cause you a whole lot of problems.   If you can afford it, I’d highly recommend seeing a dietician. They can help you come up with a healthy meal plan and provide you with a better understanding of your specific needs.",False,False
