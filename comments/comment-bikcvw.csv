Not a doctor, however it would depend on your current body composition, what types of food you eat, and activity levels.   The internet tells me that when the body runs low on carbs it goes for fat, but if you’re leading a more sedentary lifestyle idk.   Basically it depends on your lifestyle choices and what you eat and I know neither of these things about you. But I’m not a professional.",False,False

That is, is there a point where you can start to see the physical change, rather than just in the numbers?  I lost 5kgs (11lbs) once and I could only see a slight loss in my face, my body was still the same so I'm guessing a major part was muscle loss..but how much more would I have to lose before I would've seen other things get smaller? \[eating &gt;100cal/day with no particular exercise\]  I guess what I'm wanting to know is that will that happen again this time, where I'm aiming for 49kgs (a 20lb loss), or will I actually be able to see real results this time (this time I am working out everyday, though, consuming &gt;500cal/day). I'm 5'4"".  I hope this is making sense, and it probably is asking for tips/help and I understand that it may get deleted.",False,True
