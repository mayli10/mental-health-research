It‚Äôs hard to change habits period, and changing a whole lifestyle which is often a coping mechanism is even harder, but it‚Äôs still possible. Recovery can be a shock so I completely understand the instinct to fall back on old habits to alleviate that anxiety. I‚Äôm just now trying to accept that change is really uncomfortable and will take a lot of holding myself accountable. It‚Äôs a process so don‚Äôt blame yourself for not being totally cool with everything immediately.",False,False

Even when you are gung ho for recovery you‚Äôll still find certain behaviors slipping through occasionally and often won‚Äôt realise until after the fact. It‚Äôs harrrrrd. But they lessen the hold over you as you become more mindful of them and as your resolve to recover strengthens. Very best of luck with your recovery!,False,False

I tried to start recovery a week and a half ago and I told my husband I'm recovering but I already gave up and fell deep into my bad habits. And I know exactly what I'm doing and how bad it is but for some reason I can't stop. It's this weird place to be where you should have control and you think you do because you're so aware of what you're doing to yourself, yet somehow you don't have the control to change. I feel you. I guess all we can do is use everyday as a fresh start and try to do the right thing. If today doesn't workout, just plan to try again tomorrow. I dunno. Sorry you're dealing with this too. üíô",False,False
