(And 20/15 is a huge different). I was a phys ed major so I've done most of my research in the past haha,False,True

(Possibly more, but strength/mass ratio is important to me, so I'll be playing it by ear) But the thing is, I have dysphoria and am bulking VERY slowly and carefully, in order to keep the curves off.   My body fat is around 20%, which is not low enough to be a cause in and of itself. I'm blessed with a distribution of fat that has me looking pretty lean and androgynous at 20%. I wouldn't care to push it lower unless I was at a significantly higher weight. So I have that going for me, too.",False,True

Anorexia has always been the devil on my shoulder, but I've been at a healthy weight and BMI for about a year now, but nada.

Grew up in a stressful environment, I also do crazy sports (outdoor biking and rock climbing), my body was under constant stress when I was restricting, and still have mental stress going on.   I saw an endocrinologist and learned my blood sugar is a roller coaster with extreme highs and lows (which can put stress on the body) so I'm monitoring it and trying to keep it in range, and he gave me a medicine for a thyroid medicine which I've been on for two months, and I've been seeing a nutritionist to clean up my diet - still nothing!! But there is still past and present stress.   I'm worried about bone loss and cancer when I'm older.
