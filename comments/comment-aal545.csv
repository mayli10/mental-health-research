I have feelings for a guy in a relationship.  He has feelings for me. But we cant talk to each other for obvious reasons. We talked for awhile these past 3 days but agreed to cut it off for obvious reasons. I just feel sad and fat. Damn it hurts. ,False,False

I think this was more of a venting post, but it sounds like you're going through a rough time.     I can definitely relate to those self-sabotaging things we do, but you also say sometime really important here, which is that this man is not what you're looking for. I hope I'm not projecting too much here when I say that it's okay to have your own wants and needs, and to choose who to keep in your life because you are so worthy of having a partner who can meet you where you're at.   &amp;#x200B;  I hope that you can feel that your worth as a person, and worthiness of others' care/love, is not dependent on your weight or your appearance.  Emotional eating is a coping mechanism, it doesn't make you a bad person, and with time (if you want) you can try to shift your coping strategies.  &amp;#x200B;  Sending hugs. ",False,False
