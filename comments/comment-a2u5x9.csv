I have severe major depression (untreated) on top of everything and it's insane some if the things I think.    Like last week, I had a typo in a job application and I was like 'go outside, pick up the handsaw, and cut into your thigh with it to punish yourself"".     Just today, I was yelled at for not cleaning the rice cooker and I was just thinking ""you don't deserve food. Go outside and lay in the snow until you freeze to death.""   With thoughts like mine, I wonder if I should be sectioned. ",False,False

As I did it I took out the trash so my mom wouldn't see.  I'm an adult, throwing away high calorie food that I can't allow myself to eat, hoping my mom doesn't find out.  Yeah, that's fucked up.",False,False

Sunday night Inwa snaking a big pot of lentil, veggie and ham soup. I asked my wife to test it and see if it was ready, needed more salt or pepper, etc. It needed more salt. I reached for the salt shaker. The exchange went like this: $Me- I'll add more salt then $Wife - Just add more ham. That will make it saltier $Me - If it just needs more salt, I'll just add salt $Wife - Just use more ham. It will add salt and flavour (go in loop for a while, both getting increasingly irate) $Me - IF IT JUST NEEDS SALT I'M NOT ADDING MORE FOOD TO IT I ALREADY WORKED OUT THE NUMBERS FOR THE POT AND EACH PORTION (insert meltdown on kitchen floor)  $Wife - THE WHOLE THING IS A POT OF FOOD YOU IDIOT! (wife sits in floor next to me) It's a pot of food, not a pot of numbers  We just added more salt ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",False,False

Im excited to be done fasting so i can eat an egg. A fucking egg!  I KNOW that i cant absorb calories from oils through my fingers, but i still use a tissue to touch greasy foods because my mind is telling me that ill gain weight by touching it  A new one is that if i smell a strong flavour im getting calories from that too, so i try hold my breath as long as possible when around food. It all sounds so ridiculous   I have my meals planned out every day for two weeks from now. I keep thinking i cant get worse and then i find a way to make it worse.",False,False

Today I fasted until 6pm and was planning on going until tomorrow night but my husband said he wanted a beer later (wasn't even drinking one! Just mentioned it!) SO now I'm two shots in and just ate 100 calories of green beans. Which is admittedly a lot of green beans and pretty filling but like why did that one sentence trigger me so bad??,False,False
