Upping their intake made it easier to stick to a consistent deficit so they end up losing weight. ",False,False

It’s about gaining muscle, higher muscle mass burns more calories at rest",False,False

Usually the weight difference in the before and after is only 10-15 pounds. ",False,False

Sure, some weight loss/ progress pics are real, but majority of them are good lighting, make up, posing and Photoshop.  I think there may be some truth to it. If you heavily restrict then you will lose weight, but won't have much energy. Even if you do workout, it will be half-assed because you just can't exert yourself. If you high restrict then you will still lose weight, but you will also have the energy to be more active, thus burning more calories naturally. I don't think that eating 2000+ calories a day and being sedentary is a particularly good thing for most people, especially if your bmr is lower than 2000.",False,False
