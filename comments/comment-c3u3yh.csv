But that’s just a small thing I do that actually weirdly helps me keep my mile time around 8:30 even without running for months. (It might be something else too though ahah)  But here are tips I would definitely go with:   1. Set a distance that you want to run for, and make it REALISTIC, and don’t stop running for that distance. Even if u have to jog as slow as you need, don’t stop. It’ll train you to keep going on runs. (But don’t do it to the point of passing out, you just need to push yourself)   2. Do multiple trials with that same distance a few times or even just do it once per day if multiple a day is too much.   3. Time yourself each day and wait until you slowly get faster. Once you can finish it with a good amount of stamina left, increase up the distance.   4. Make the distance increase gradual and attainable, but slowly your time will get better.    The key for me is listening to your body and going towards goals. I run a mile a day and continually log my times and distances and how I felt during the run. I increase miles if I’m feeling extra good that day and make note of that too. It takes time but it does get much easier to enjoy running and be faster!   Good luck! You got this!",False,False
