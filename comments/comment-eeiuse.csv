Cream and sugar in drinks, cooking with extra oil/fat, extra dressing in salad. I rely more and more on prepackaged foods because I can‚Äôt trust home cooked meals.    My brother stood up for me the other day and it made me both so happy and so sad. He stopped my family from giving me a hot cocoa sweetened with real sugar and said ‚ÄúNo, she doesn‚Äôt like sweetened drinks.‚Äù I really only have artificial sweeteners and was both happy and sad that he knew this about me.",False,False

I ask her for recipe and she's like half a butter but puts whole fucking butter in it.. so I overestimate her cooking and then can't almost eat anything else beside her one meal because I don't trust her. but my grandma I tell you. she punt chunks of lard in everything so you eat the small portion of baked pasta and then you find a piece in it like wtf this is not necessary at all,False,False

My mom used to secretly add oil to my food until I found out and had a massive breakdown. Fun times. My biggest advise would be to talk to them. Tell them that it‚Äôs way more beneficial for you to eat the food where you know they didn‚Äôt mess with it, instead of starving yourself bc you‚Äòre scared that they might done something with it. Good luck üíï",False,False
