They suppress jobs, don't care about their workers at all, are not transparent. I prefer spending less but better. Zero waste is the same prisma than ethical thinking. Once you are sensible to one you can not deny the other. That is my opinion.  Anyway like I said I am sure you do your best for changing things and a little at a time is a mountain for the others. Keep going!",False,False

I personally like food gifts because I don't *have* to eat them and it doesn't turn into useless clutter. A chocolate bar can be split up between my coworkers. Cookies can be given to my dad. A gift to me becomes a gift to another, pleasing that person, and leaving me free of the guilt of being an 'ingrate' for not liking whatever trash item i need to find a place for in my room.",False,False

Like potlucks every two weeks etc. I have this huge problem being around food and Iâ€™ve binged at work events several times this year and itâ€™s a gossipy place so on top of the shame of being out of control around food, Iâ€™m afraid people are taking about me.   And two coworkers gave me food for Xmas and Iâ€™m so sad about it. Iâ€™m genuinely trying to control my ED and I donâ€™t want to binge at work or at all and Iâ€™m so ashamed this is a problem and now people have noticed and are gifting me stuff to eat.  ðŸ¥º I canâ€™t really describe how humiliating that feels.",False,False

The polishes are at least better in that they weren't created via slave labor, which is common for a lot of wooden ZW things, because polish is made in a lab.   As far as the work conditions for Amazon, they've gotten better I recent years from a couple of strikes, and Amazon is sometimes the only way I can purchase anything, so it'll have to stay for now.",False,True

But when it's for ^^^*JUST me* I feel angst, disgust, and worthlessness! How could you give me something if you know that there's displacement and homelessness in our city. I know I dont have control over homelessness or consider recovering after 8 years. I understand that it costs less to get food which is no ones fault. I see the gratitude behind that key chain I said was cute, or a cheesy mug that I'd probably wear the heck out it. And that's what I appreciate. I'm not pissy towards anyone just the mere action of giving (food) like it's nothing. And *TAKE ONE. TAKE TWO. BUT SHARE! DON'T EAT THE WHOLE DAMNED PLATE. YOU WE SO SKINNY LAST MONTH. didya enjoy the food tho?* But no one knows about my ed. And I already appreciate ppl being nice&amp;honest to me. At the heart of it tho I know I don't deserve anything.
