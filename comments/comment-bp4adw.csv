And even when you give in (trust me I've been there so many times) it's not like it cancels out the work you did. The successes still exist. They are a thing that happened and nothing can change what happened in the past. The same goes for every purge ever. It's in the past. Can't change it. Do your best to stop thinking of your ""failures""-  focus on the times your resisted a purge. Hold onto those memories very tightly. I'm very proud of you, no matter what happens. The most important thing in all of it is that you are genuinely trying. That is all any person could ever ask from you.",False,False

In the grand scheme of things, this is only a minor mishap. Itâ€™s a hiccup. You are trying. Youâ€™re doing your best, honey.   Youâ€™re not alone. Iâ€™m sorry that you are going through all of this, but donâ€™t feel like you are alone.",False,False
