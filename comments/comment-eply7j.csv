OP didn't say they saw a disabled person struggling. They just saw a disabled person existingâ€”that's it. The way it was framed boils the disabled person's existence down to something undesirable. Do you not see how that can be dehumanising and offensive? Especially when society already systemically marginalises someone for that existence?  It's okay to feel grateful that you're able-bodied, but there are ways of expressing that sentiment that are harmful. Having a mental illness doesn't absolve someone of that. Messages like what came across in the OP, even though it wasn't the intention, can contribute to material consequences in how disabled people are viewed and treated. I could have been nicer in my initial response, but I already have to deal with people thinking I'm something to pity, be disgusted by, or use as inspiration porn every time I dare to exist in a public space. It's tough encountering that in a support group too.",False,False

Sometimes you simply don't realize how your own thoughts/comments which were not meant bad in any way, can hurt other people's feelings. So thanks for making me aware of it! :)  I'll let you read this last comment and then I'm going to delete my post ðŸ™ˆ :)",False,True

I'm also disabled and being used as inspiration porn is fucking maddening (as I'm sure you know) and I hate having to just bear how thoughtless people can be (not just OP but 1 time is enough to be reminded of all the other times people were shitty...)",False,False

There is absolutely nothing wrong with being grateful because you can recognize that you have an advantage to some people. That doesnâ€™t mean disabled people are lesser than, or cant share the same quality of life. OP never even implied that they think disabilities are the final destination or worst of the worst. And i also think its quite rich to vindicate someone for saying something like this when a lot of eating disorders are either the result of or accumulate to comparing yourself to every thinner/heavier person you see. We are all human and to act like someone being grateful that theyâ€™re disability free is a hateful thing is truly twisted and sad. Im grateful that im not a man but that doesnâ€™t mean I think men are the epitome of evil and i go out of my way to hate men. I dont think this is the place to rip people apart when they find something about themselves that they feel good about or thankful for.",False,False

I can understand feeling that way and see how you intended it. In the future, I'd suggest maybe sharing what you're thankful for, are afraid of losing, etc. without linking it to having seen a disabled person as the reason for those thoughts/feelings. I hope that makes sense.",False,False

By no means did I want to insult anybody around here, and definitely _not_ people in wheelchairs.  I also don't think or wanted to bring across that your bodies are ""destroyed"". It doesn't matter what physical state you are, you can have a beautiful and fulfilling life at any state.  What I wanted to actually bring across is, that I am so thankful for being able to run (as it is a big passion of mine) and sometimes I treat my body so bad for no reason, while it provides me with everything so I can do the things I enjoy. And yet I treat it so badly.  That's what I actually wanted to bring across. Be happy for who you are and what you have and try to work _with_ your body, instead of against it.  Once again, I apologize if my post was insulting you and I didn't mean to do that by any means. I hope you forgive me.",False,True

Being a wheelchair-user isn't an inherently bad thing, and it doesn't mean our bodies are ""destroyed"". Using disabled people as motivation for your recovery because you view us as so sad or horrific and our realities as the worst outcome is really gross, and it throws those of us who have eating disorders under the bus.",False,False
