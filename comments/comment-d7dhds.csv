As of today, I think I want to marry this guy. He has his own set of problems but it's nothing we haven't already addressed and talked about. We're crazy for each other, so don't worry. He's probably just worried about you right now, I would give him a call or text to calm him down.",False,False

Last weekend I was alone &amp; my partner was really worried about some SI thoughts I was expressing. I know it's hard to feel you're putting your partner through that.  Try &amp; stay honest with them &amp; be willing to reach out to the appropriate resources for help.  I really truly help things feel better soon. &lt;3,False,False
