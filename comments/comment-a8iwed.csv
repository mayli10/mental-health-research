It‚Äôs funny Bc it makes you realize how much the Instagram models or other ‚Äúfitness‚Äù YouTubers are straight up lying about how they get ‚Äúfit.‚Äù Like this girl is eating one sushi roll a day for 2 months and exercising 3hrs/day.. but you eat 6 times a day and do 15 min of yoga with the same results??? Nah.,False,False
