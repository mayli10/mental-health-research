He’s also obsessive about what he consumes - albeit in a slightly different way - and he helps me stay on top of my nutrition/supplementation and stay as safe as possible. The house is always stocked with healthy safe food, so I’m less afraid to eat. When I was having hormonal issues and sleep disturbances because of excessive fasting, he encouraged me to stop, and I took his advice and felt better. I was dizzy and had daily headaches, and he figured out that I needed to supplement electrolytes; once I started taking a serving of Oxylent every day, my symptoms went away. I don’t have any friends or family, so I feel very lucky that I have one person who cares about my wellbeing and doesn’t judge me.",False,False

Like today when I said I had a big lunch he asked me “nice!!! what did you eat?” And I had to lie and say a hefty sandwich and he asked “what?! Lucky! From where?” And I had to just lie again. It makes me feel sooo bad but.... not eating feels better so I’m going to keep doing it but it’s an overwhelming guilt when you have a boyfriend who loves food.",False,True

I just say something quick and nonchalant and move on. When I give too much detail it’s pretty obvious I’m lying.,False,False

Anyways, I always just look at things like: - if it doesn’t harm the other person mentally or physically - if it’s only pertaining to me - if it would cause more trouble saying it then keeping it in Then it’s fine to lie about it I don’t like causing drama or fights or gossiping so I learned to just keep things to myself and it’s easier that way. That’s my experience c:",False,False
