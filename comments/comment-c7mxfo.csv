When I was 10 lbs lighter my bf was all over me and he'd affectionately comment on how small I was all the time.  Now that I'm heavier... he's not the type to comment on my weight, but I definitely notice him abstaining from giving me compliments... He'll say 'No you're not!' when I complain about how fat I am.  But I know he's less attracted to my body because I have to ask for touch/ always be the one initiating now. ):",False,False

For all intents  and purposes, we are practically married. Through [my] thick and thin [body], he has most definitely said some very insensitive words to me when I was bigger [read: obese] and there were a lot of times that I felt he wasn't attracted to me. I too felt big jealousy when I would see couples like that, but i had to mentally remind myself that it was probably a ""new"" relationship or whatever when both partners are still touchy and whatnot. I've been trying to work on my confidence. I've realized that the lack of intimacy is mostly on me. I used to initiate often. Now I wear clothes to bed. Idk this feels like I'm just rambling now. But he has always loved me. We did have a pretty in depth talk about it. And he said that yes, my body has changed, it's not bad, or better, it's just new. He likes it. But the important part is I guess the communication we've had about everything. He still doesn't know about my issues with eating or my feelings about my body, I'm sure he has a small idea, but not to the depth that this really goes. But the point I'm trying to make is that men say insensitive shit. I think it comes out way harsher than they meant. I hope that's the case with you. As an example: I said something about feeling really bloated and he said oh yeah, I thought you were looking a little pudgy. üòë it was a joke. But when I was bigger that would've made me cry. So I get it. Anyway this got too long, but I'm so sorry you're feeling this way. I know my boyfriend prefers me healthy so we can do fun [scary] things like try new restaurants once a month or go on trips or go hike through the mountains. He's not open about his feelings all the time, but I can tell he prefers me happy, whether that means big or small. Ugh, this turned into horrible word vomit. Sorry.",False,False

So you're not alone.   Husband swears up and down he doesn't mind I'm weight restored, and I know he likes that I have more boob/butt, but the rate of physical affection definitely went down as I gained. And I just get noticeably less attention from strangers (not that I mind *that.*) - I'm a couple lbs into the ""healthy"" bmi range and that's it.   Idk, it's hard sometimes when there's some real-world factor like that (which could be totally unrelated, but the point is it's hard to ignore it like the stuff that's just in your brain).",False,False

I'm down 10 pounds since May 1st though, and the random affection is starting to come back.
