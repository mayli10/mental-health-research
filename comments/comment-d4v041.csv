If we go out to eat together, I'll obsessively calculate the exact calories and macros of everything I'm eating days in advance and usually get the same few safe meals each time (salad with grilled chicken vs salad with tuna etc)  He just orders whatever he feels like and usually leaves most of it by the time we leave. He's trying to gain weight but doesn't seem to be too into it, sometimes I wonder if there's more to his eating habits than what he lets on (AFRID?) but I don't know how to approach him about it.",False,False
