I know it can be daunting but when it comes to something like participation, profs tend to give in easily in my experience. A professional sounding but firm email stating that you made a huge effort to participate/come to class every time, etc. I've done this and the prof immediately bumped up my grade without even responding lol. Or even just asking for clarification as to how this grade is attained- ""show me in the syllabus how it is possible for me to get less than 100% in attendance when I came to every class/made at least a few comments each time""- this has worked for me too. good luck",False,False

If you message them they might change it for you. Have justification (eg. “I made a conscious effort to ask one question and discuss one point per class every class even when we watched videos” or something),False,False
