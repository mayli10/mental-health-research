Scale weight might go up that much, but it isn't actual bodily tissue. You can gain maybe like 2. But it would take a pretty heroic effort. Eating 3500 over maintenance in a day is easy enough if you're hungry and not moving much and eating junk. Doing it again the next day would not come naturally unless you've been restricting too long/are too light.   \-For real, maybe you should re consider your recovery strategy here? Is this one that a professional suggested to you? I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and operate under the assumption that you're not too light to be losing weight/not trying to loose it too fast. If baked goods make you that uncomfortable and that's not a fear you feel like tackling right now, maybe explain that to your gf?",False,False

You can still lose weight when you're eating 3 meals a day.  Eat smart. Go for the safe foods. Use an app to help you judge calories and portions. Make sure you do your exercise. With the baked goods, maybe start hinting you're finding them too heavy. They're making you lethargic or something. Suggest a safer alternative.   Yeah, maybe it won't be as quick as flat out restricting, but you can still fit those new jeans.",False,False
