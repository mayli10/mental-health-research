It cools it to drinking temperature and dilutes the bitterness and acidity of the cheap, stale, over-roasted and badly-brewed coffee.  I definitely recommend quality coffee whenever possible, but cheap caffeine is cheap caffeine.",False,False

There's something about K-cups I can't stand, and I'm too lazy to french press, so I use a Hario V-60.
