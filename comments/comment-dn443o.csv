I was having a horrible week and as soon as my coworker started talking i burst into tears. I was so embarrassed. For a while that was all i can think about especially since i was the newest and youngest person in my department at that time.   I ended up talking to that coworker and apologized if i made them feel uncomfortable. I explained that i was having a rough week and that my reaction was not a result of what they said.,False,False
