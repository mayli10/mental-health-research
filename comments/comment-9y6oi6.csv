I used to get prescription steroid creams, but I don't even need that anymore. I also use the Aveeno body lotion. It's always so tempting to get those fruity, great smelling bodywashes, but I know that'll it just come back if I switch. I can alternate though.",False,False

Our bodies create a histamine response to help us sleep, and when we donâ€™t sleep enough it kicks into overdrive. A histamine response is (drumroll please)... the same thing your body does when youâ€™re having an allergic reaction! It can manifest in a lot of ways, from congestion to a runny nose to hives and other skin conditions. Benadryl would help if you think thatâ€™s what it is. Itâ€™ll also help you sleep (and itâ€™s 0 kcal). (:",False,False
