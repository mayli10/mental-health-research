My friends will ""jokingly"" call me shallow for refusing to even consider going on a date with someone who isn't fit, but honestly why would I when I know that our lifestyles aren't compatible? Secretly I think my friends are just jealous that their dating pool is smaller but of course I can't say that out loud  If I can afford to be picky, then I will. I'm not even that attractive (like a solid 6 in the face), but I've got a hella fit body and know how to dress myself/do makeup/etc.",False,False

I think because of how complicated my relationship with food and body image is, I tend to not judge people based on looks.   However, I am totally and completely shallow about my looks. I judge myself harshly, and even though I don‚Äôt operate this way (and I don‚Äôt think most people generally do) I always think that people won‚Äôt want to be around me unless I‚Äôm skinny.   I also have so many rules about what I can and can‚Äôt do at certain weights, like I must weigh x amount to be able to wear certain types of clothes, or I don‚Äôt allow myself to say yes to being asked out until I‚Äôm x weight, and so on. It literally kills me because I see people who weigh more than me wearing certain clothes or being in a relationship, and I generally think they look beautiful, confident, and happy. But for some reason I can‚Äôt allow myself to to the same smh.",False,False

I mean, society conditions us really strongly to be exactly like you are.  As long as you don't negatively impose your ideas of beauty on other people you definitely have no reason to feel bad. The fact that you feel guilty in the first place is a sign that you're a really good person. Your conscience is a good litmus test for how moral you are, and the fact you care so much speaks volumes about how good of a person you are. Also, people who pretend like personality is really all that matters are kinda full of shit. So you're a good person *and* an honest one.",False,False
