Sounds very similar to some of my behaviours and I'm diagnosed with anorexia.   It's important to note that even within a diagnostic label, people's behaviour can vary wildly. This forum probably gives some insight into it, some people will have calorie limits, some will have rigid set meals, some will focus on macros and eating ""whole"" foods, some will b/p through various methods, some will  exercise, but all are valid.",False,False

I suspect your therapist was mostly interested in just hearing how you view and describe your experience. Thereâ€™s no right or wrong answer for that. (And of course youâ€™re not even obligated to share that with them if youâ€™d rather not.)   Plus, always remember that the diagnostic categories come from humans with limited data and perspective seeking to demarcate and quantify human experiences. The reality of any one personâ€™s life is usually more complex and nuanced. If you feel multiple categories fit or no categories quite fit, thatâ€™s ok! Your experiences are real and valid no. matter. what.",False,False

Perhaps orthorexia with all the working out, although you dont seem health driven. Edns-eating disorder no specific if you dont want a formal label.",False,False
