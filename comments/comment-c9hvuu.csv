It could be because you're ""more anorexic"" than she was, so she's upset/insecure. Or, it could be that she is genuinely concerned about you, and doesn't know how to communicate that. It could be an attempt to say ""Just stop it! I hate hearing you say those things about yourself!"" but that is not really the right way to approach that subject.   Given your age, I'd see it as a communication problem. I know I had girls who were jealous and even competitive when I was struggling with my ED, and later the boys I dated would emulate my behaviors, but also lash out at me for doing the same. It's a confusing thing!   Maybe talk to her about how that comment made you feel? It might be awkward, but maybe it will open up a dialogue that will benefit the both of you.",False,False
