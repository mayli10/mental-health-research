Bulimia just feels like I'm out of control and it's not pretty or perceived as pretty to gorge on tens of thousands of calories of food and force yourself to throw it all up. I'm Korean, so the perception of being really underweight and small and frail is considered beautiful, and not an eating disorder. A lot of Korean women maintain underweight BMI's without having an ED, just because that's the culture. Wish I could do that :S But I guess since I don't have anorexia, I can't actually say one is better or worse",False,False

But I can't go back to BP, so I'm stuck with AN until I die or recover. I'm really hoping that the recovery works because I don't want the other thing. The other thing is bad",False,False

Just had alot of emotional issues around that.  When I lost alot of weight is when I couldn't physically function anymore. I didn't have energy to think, go out with my friends, or even stay awake for a whole day.   B/P is like a disruption when it happens but I was probably at 60%. With AN I was probably at around 20%. Bulimia was definitely the lesser of two evils.",False,False

I get to restrict and feel in control most of the time, yet I also get to feel alive when I B/P. I used to think AN was the gold standard of EDs, until I realized how shitty it was so feel constantly dead.",False,False

I don't know what I'd choose. I guess I'd stick with what I have. Better the devil that you know than the devil that you don't, right?",False,False
