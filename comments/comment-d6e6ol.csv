If so - in theory, if they think your life is in immediate danger, they can call emergency services, who may put you a psych hold, and ultimately grant medical guardianship/conservatorship to a parent or the like. In that sense, you can be forced into treatment. However, I want to emphasis how *vanishingly* unlikely this is. For a psychiatrist to do this, you would have to be basically on death's door (whether physically, like you're a tube-feeding candidate, or bc you're saying you're going to kill yourself).  The psychiatrist also should not withhold meds (unless you're taking something contraindicated for EDs, some of the more common ones being Adderall and Wellbutrin). If they don't feel competent to treat you due to either their inexperience or the severity of your case, they're within their rights to ""break up"" with you as a patient, but this is unlikely unless your case is quite bad.",False,False

In a hypothetical case where op’s health was super super dire, at some point the psych would either a) section you or b) say they morally can’t see you anymore due to health status/their own lack of knowledge/refusal to seek treatment. obviously they are obligated to give you at least three referrals to different providers in that case, but a patient dying on them bc of an ed would NOT be good for their career or license, especially if they knew for a long time how bad the situation was.   but do NOT quote me on this I literally have no extensive/verified knowledge of how true this is. I just know people in treatment that this happened to. op, please please please do not let this persuade you from opening up to your team. if anything, please let if encourage you to be honest with them and get referrals to ed specialized treatment providers so you CAN be open and honest no matter what.",False,False
