Maybe talk to your dr. or a nutritionist about what it is you want to achieve with your body and why you want to be such a low weight. It's possible your vision of **43.1 kilograms** doesn't line up with what you would look and feel like. Trust me, the lower you get, the more difference a pound or two will make in terms of health, lifestyle, energy, etc. I've been all over the map, and higher to medium weight change is VERY different from medium to low weight. Chances are if you're here, you're onto something, so find a dr, therapist, nutritionist, and see if you can find a way to be both happy and healthy. You don't want to ignore it until it's an all consuming problem.

How you view food, the behaviours you have (weighing, body checking, ect.), how weight fluctuations impact you, all that stuff. When these thoughts and habits manifest in a way the takes up a lot of energy and interferes with daily. life, that's when you have a problem.  I'm guessing all the weight you've lost has been via a healthy method, which is adding to the confusion. Correct me if I'm wrong though. To me, going off of what you've said, I would describe your behaviours as more disordered eating with an othorexic tendency, since it sounds like you have some issues with your appearance, but they don't consume you.  I can't tell you what you do or don't have, I'm not a professional. I can o my speculate. So I could be completely wrong. But don't think disordered eating isn't bad, it is, it's just not as outright harmful. In a lot of cases, disordered eating is the gateway into a full blown ED.  If you have concerns, seek out a professional if possible. I would suggest maybe a dietician or an ED specialist, so you can gauge how unhealthy your thinking is, especially since you recognise your BMI would be unhealthy but you still want to get there.  Whatever issues you have, however slight, we'll always welcome you in this sub.",False,False
