I do feel having that support might be necessary. It’s sounds like a very helpful approach for help building then skills with more regular support. I suppose fear is putting me off. Fear of other people, of judgment of not having that bit of control in my hands at home to just not follow through. But I can see it being effective despite what my thoughts are worked up over. It’s hard with the dissonance to get a measure on what is stronger right now. The wise mind or the Ed brain.   Thankyou again.",False,True

I’m struggling to decide whether I’m taking a good game or still being deceptive so my loved ones think I’m capable.  A part of me really does want to get better but I do feel myself already trying to find ways to be work around a plan if I was in charge from home. I’ve had days recently where I have tried to eat more and it has been so stressful and miserable and so detrimental to the next few days intake that I have realised maybe I don’t have as much control as I anticipated.   I know this is what the therapy will explore I suppose it is trying to be honest with myself about what I want to be able to do and what I can actually accomplish at this stage.  Thankyou again.,False,True

Day program is great when you need additional support around meals and you get therapy on top of that. I spent four months in day program before transitioning to outpatient therapy, which really helped solidify the skills and strategies I'd learned during day program.  Prior to doing day program, I'd been seen on an outpatient basis but had really struggled to make the changes necessary so ended up hospitalised, then stepped down to day program.",False,False

The thing is motivation could be really variable, and recovery is rough. Physical changes can be distressing and demotivating, and exploring underlying issues in therapy can be really emotionally stressful, and the impulse to lapse can be really strong if stuff like that comes up. I think meal support is super important and helpful during these times. On the other hand, if you feel strongly that you are really committed to recovering, having more autonomy could be a really empowering part of the process. You’re seeking out help on your own which is a huge part already! I hope this was at least mildly helpful :-)",False,False
