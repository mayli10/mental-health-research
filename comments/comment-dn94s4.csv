But I never really restricted but the intuitive eating was easier with the diet pills and I loved the extra spurt of energy.   Then when I started to restrict, I would get “binges” where I’d just eat normal and feel a crazy amount of guilt and over exercise. Then I started throwing up instead.   Then after a while, the restrictions got insane and then the binges turned into actual binges. And I stopped purging. And I slowly recovered. Then the diet pills started again. Then came the laxatives. Then came the restricting and the bingeing and more diet pills.   No more what I do or where I am, my ED finds some way to adapt and survive. I hate it. It seems to be stronger than any other part of me.   But the binges are the scariest. I hate losing that control too. In recovery, they’ve mentioned only buying enough food to not binge and making more frequent trips to the grocery store. But grocery stores are scary. Most of the food is restricted food and it’s like testing every bit of willpower to not buy the food sometimes.   Sleep can be my only friend at times. I’m not overexercising. I’m not bingeing. I’m not restricting. I’m not worried over every bit in my head or mouth. But sleeping and being on bed for most of the day doesn’t work either.   I hate these ED’s at times but sometimes I have no idea who’d is be without it after spending so long with it.",False,True

My ED started when I was 15 and it was all restrictions - I never binged ever until my ED struck again recently. I am now 32 and grappling with this whole new uncontrollable side to this stupid disorder.   It's like I learned a new language in recovery so I didn't have to talk to my ED anymore but then my ED learned that language even better than I can speak it and now has the louder voice again.   In my head I think I am always able to control what I eat because forever I have been able to restrict but now I can't, I can't control binging despite being confident that I can and it's really scary.",False,False
