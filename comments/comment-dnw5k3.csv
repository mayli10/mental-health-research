I has different coping mechanisms such as cutting and doing wreckless behaviors which were probably worse than starving/binging imo. I relapsed a while back.   I agree this is safe and familiar. I find peace in calculating my calories whenever I can.,False,False

That’s one of the reasons why recovery is so hard. Many of us have forgotten what it’s like to not struggle with this. We know how bad it is, and how much it sucks, but it’s at least what we know. We don’t know what a “normal” non-disordered life is like, it’s an unknown, and the fear of the unknown holds us back from recovering and living our true lives.   I guess sometimes an eating disorder is like self medicating. It’s an an anesthetic and it’s hard to lose that. But also, understand that you can’t let the fear of the unknown hold you back. You deserve to recover. 💕",False,False
