Was hospitalized  multiple  times but I was in recovery from 17 to 24, when my husband died in Iraq and I was a widow with a 2 week old son....recovery went to shit. From 24 to 30 I struggled a lot, was hospitalized at 28 due to collapsing at work. Quit my job at 30 to go back to school and met my current partner, he has helped me stay in recovery for the last decade, he works with me to maintain healthy relationships with food and exercise. But damn if I don't feel fake frequently because I'm a grown ass woman, with a career and partner and two kids, how can my brain be this fucked still.",False,False

It started when I moved out of my parents home and could control what I was eating. I broke up with my uni boyfriend around the same time. So, the combination of being completely alone for the first time with this newfound ability to control my diet mixed with a desire to lose weight whilst simultaneously feeling undesirable and unattractive was a recipe for disaster.   I feel you, but I think young adults are susceptible to EDs for different reasons than younger people, but its equally damaging.   You're not alone.",False,False

If you're underweight, again, ""the stereotype"". If you're a healthy weight, you're ""not really disordered"". If you're no longer a teenager, you're ""too old for it"".
