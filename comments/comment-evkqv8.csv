When I am low restricting, I lose the weight off my upper body so much quicker than off my thighs/hips. To the point where my chest bones are showing underneath my collarbones, but my thighs are still literally the same measurement and won't budge. It sucks that there is nothing we can do about it as you can't spot reduce.",False,False

Your thighs are probably not nearly as large as you perceive but I feel you. Having thicker upper thighs/hips/butt is the downside of having that figure. It isn't a common shape so clothes aren't made for us. I almost always go for stretchy material. I can never wear shirts because I have to size up to fit my breasts and the shirt ends up really baggy and shapeless. I shop base on  material and I almost always go for something fitted.,False,False

My body definitely preferentially stores fat in the thighs-and-butt region. It’s frustrating. Currently, adding in some strength training is helping me feel a little less panicky-sad about it.   I have to get pretty underweight to get the thighs I want...at which point even I can see my arms look alarmingly boney and I start obsessing over my elbows instead. And, ya know, the whole flirting-with-cardiac-and-brain-damage thing. But mostly the elbows.
