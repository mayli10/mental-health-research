He loves you for *who you are* not *what you look like*. You as a person are far more important to him than you as ""a body"".  Would you have *wanted* him to notice the weight gain? What would you have wanted him to say?   My husband once gained about 20lbs &amp; I truly didn't notice at all. Not until he mentioned he was unhappy about it. Because what he looks like is nice &amp; all but that's not what is important about him. I didn't marry him because he had a nice body. One day he will be a wrinkly old man, if all I wanted was his body I'd be sorely disappointed in my old age when neither of us look like we did in our twenties.   Basically, he loves you &amp; wants you for *you*. You obviously matter very much to him &amp; I think it's very important that he has shown you that. It seems you have yourself a genuine guy, congratulations :)",False,False
