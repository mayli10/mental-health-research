So i went with him to pick up the pizza and he said he also ordered spuds and it just made me :/ because i hadn't planned for that. And when we passed by the store on our way home he asked if i wanted root beer (because that was my favorite soda as a kid i guess and he can't let go of that, same thing with spaghetti because i ""loved it"" when i was like 5 apparently) and i said no and he said ok and kept driving. So we had no soda. I said no because i only drink diet soda and i didn't want to feel obligated to drink soda and he only made a specific suggestion and i'd feel weird going against it because he's already suspicious about me (the other day he asked me if i had ""gotten enough calories today"" and it sent alarm bells off in my head that he chose to ask whether i had gotten enough calories instead of asking if i had eaten enough). And as we passed by i could feel myself getting frustrated inside because to me there's no point in eating pizza without soda because if you're going to indulge you might as well all the way.  When we finally got home i put 2 slices on my plate and a couple of spuds and some ranch and ketchup. One of them was a reaaaally small slice, like a sliver, and i ate it, and the entire time i was holding back tears. I made weird faces instead because my dad was sitting next to me while we watched coco. But god i was chewing and just thought ""i dont want this, im not even enjoying this"" even tho i budgeted my calories for the day to allow it i just didnt want it. It felt so mechanical and like i was forcing myself to eat it and it just wasn't it.  While my dad wasn't looking/while he was walking around the house doing things, i fed the other pizza and the spuds to my dog. I feel guilty because I've never done that before but i desperately did not want to eat and i just was frustrated that there's this social obligation to eat. Like if i dont want to eat i shouldn't have to even if i am disordered. If im not even enjoying the food and its also causing me distress i shouldn't have to eat it and it shouldn't matter to others or be their business. But i knew if i told my dad i didn't want to eat the rest he'd be weird about it and at the end of the day the fact that it shouldn't be his business doesn't override our family dynamic and it just sucks. I hate dinner. I just want to eat what i want. I revolve my whole day around shared dinners and base my breakfast and lunch off of the caloric range of what i presume dinner to be because i have to eat a ""normal looking""/typical amount of food at dinner which can sometimes be up to half my tdee because my dad always includes sides like garlic bread or some shit. And i never enjoy dinner because it's not my choice.  I've never been on this extreme of disordered eating where im (practically) crying while eating and its so mechanical and forced. And before i would just get mildly annoyed when things didnt go my way or begrudgingly go along with things, but now im always having mini breakdowns and this complete frustration overwhelm me and i become irritable when i find our plans change or we're having something for dinner i absolutely dont want and see as a waste of my calories.",False,False

My whole life is falling apart ü§†  I've completely fucked up uni - my mental health has been so bad that I completely stopped attending and doing any of my assignments about 6 months ago and obviously that meant that I'd only completed half of the uni year. They gave me an extension (a big one as well, over three months) to catch up bc it was so obvious that I'd been v ill but now I have about 20 days left of said extension and I've barely done anything. At this point I think it'd be mpossible to do the volume of work I need to do before the deadline, but that's irrelevant because it's not like I'd do it anyway - lately I haven't had the motivation to do anything at all except alternate between lying in bed in silence staring at the ceiling and planning my suicide for 95% of every day. If I miss this deadline (*when* really, not *if*, because I will), my life is over. I really don't wanna repeat the year or take time out or anything like that. I know it sounds dumb to care so much about it but I'd envisaged how I wanted my life to go and failing first year is just too much of a deviation from the plan - my stupid bpd brain sees things in black and white and if things don't go perfectly, I see them as iredeemably bad and I'd rather die than fail this badly. I ended up spilling all of this to one of my friends the othe night bc when I'm on coke I just cant keep secrets when asked (lmao) but now all of my friendsare talking about me behind my back trying to figure out what to do about me and it's making me so uncomfortable. One of my friends that live with me told me she was so worried that she'd messaged my best friend about it (who she barely knows and as only met once) and I'm pretty sure they're essentially planning on getting me sectioned if I don't agree cooperate with treatment or taking a year out or whatever. I'm honestly at a loss on what to do at this point. I think it's pretty obvious that I should kms but lowkey theres a tiny dumb ed part of me that wants to live a little longer purely bc restricting is going well right now and I wanna die at a pretty gw. But now I'm worried that I won't oe at all and they'll force me into inpatient and when I come out I'll be stuck living some shitty embarrassing failed life that I dont wanna live :(  That was long but I desperately needed to vent and there's no one else I could tell. If anyone has any advice or ideas or comfort or whatever that'd be appreciated bc I truly am at rock bottom rn lol",False,False
