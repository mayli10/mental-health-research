I also had some trauma issues, and some other stuff going on - it's hard and it sucks and I'm thinking of you &lt;3   If you haven't already, it might be worth being blunt about wanting to talk about other things than the ED.  If you make that very clear, you're in a better position to decide whether she's going to address the non-ED things or whether it might be time to look elsewhere.  But I think that in the end, if you don't feel like you can trust her then perhaps it isn't a good fit.  For what it's worth, I saw a counsellor for some time about my trauma issues, and I did find it really helpful in terms of the ED although that wasn't the focus of why I was there and she wasn't an ED counsellor at all - but it did help me to get through a lot of things that were feeding my ED.",False,False
