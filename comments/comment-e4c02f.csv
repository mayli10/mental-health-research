I know you’re not asking for advice, but I think avoiding her while she is eating is the better option.  Saying something could be a trigger, especially if she’s overweight.   I wouldn’t want to trigger or come off as “fat-shaming” especially if avoiding the issue is an option.",False,False

I don't think you're mad at her for eating, I think you're mad that she doesn't watch what she eats and your brain has a bad relationship with food so seeing somebody not struggle with that and just eat and be overweight is unbearable to you. You're frustrated that she doesn't share your insecurity and have the same burden as you.   I do the same thing whenever one of my old classmates would be totally socially oblivious. Super frustrating because being seen as annoying or unaware of social cues is one of my worst fears, so seeing somebody so ignorant to what I felt should be social doctrine drove me crazy.   I guess it's a sign of insecurity in my case, and isn't something I'm proud of, but I can't really change it.",False,False

I know that’s probably not much solace. I’ve never thought of myself as someone with misophonia, but maybe I need to reassess that; I don’t think I notice it so much with others, but I also spend a lot of time, ergo a lot of mealtimes, with her so it might just be exaggerated in my mind. Thank you for commiserating with me :)",False,True

Like... if this person doesn't care about food the way I care about it, somehow they're suggesting that I'm wrong for caring about food/doing things the way I do it? And once I realised that wasn't the case at all and they had no relation I had an easier time letting it go.  Might just be food revulsion tho. I really hate wet mouth/eating noises and if I have to hear them from one person enough my frustration/disgust/rage will be transferred onto that person and I have to actually distance myself to stop it from making me hate them.",False,False

Wet noises all day. And he ate quickly and lots, too.  He even KNEW that he sounded disgusting (in his own words, ""like a bulldog eating wet food"") but didn't seem to get that maybe he should... work on that...  I could never say anything but I am even worse at handling mouth noises now hdgdn",False,False

But the way she eats just triggers me so so so so much. It's not what she eats- that triggers me just as much as anyone eating fast food would- but the way she eats it.  I swear I've never met anyone who chews like that! It's crazy loud and gross!  I don't know how ANYONE can eat so loud and make such chewing sounds. It's ridiculous.  She also just splatters EVERYTHING all over the place and never cleans up.   I am very aware of the fact that it's my misophonia that's making it worse, but I'm also not the only one it's bothering in our flat.   The moment I see her go into the kitchen I run to my room. *And I can still hear it.* She's a terrible flatmate regardless, and I dislike her in general because of her behaviour, but the way she eats is the cherry on top.",False,False
