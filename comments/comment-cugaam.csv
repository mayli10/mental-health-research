I mean tho, what kind of person follows a sub like rateme and comments on it frequently? Like a pretty shallow person, right? That's prolly part of the problem.   Or the incels are the ones doing the rating. Why can't they find chicks? Idk maybe because they think models are only 8s  Humans shouldn't be on a scale anyway! That's fucked! The whole sub is based on a fucked principal.",False,False
