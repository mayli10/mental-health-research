Some days I want to quit but I’ve been doing it for so long that I have no idea who I am or what I would do without ballet. I feel very lucky to do something that I love but it also is so destructive for me mentally that I can’t tell if I love it any more. I just feel stuck I guess :/,False,False

No other job requires you to train so hard from such a young age just to fight for the chance for an extremely low-paying job. And the culture literally breeds EDs.,False,True
