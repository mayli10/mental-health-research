And he‚Äôs good with just staying friends. And was like super good with not trying to be anything serious rn.   And I even asked him if he wanted a relationship and he said that he‚Äôs never opposed to it, but is glad to just be friends if that‚Äôs what I want. Ugh I love this understanding king üëë",False,True

That'll do nothing but make you both feel worse. If he doesn't know about your ed, don't go into specifics! Just say like 'I'm going through some serious stuff rn and I don't think I'm ready for a proper relationship. HOWEVER I don't regret this one bit, you're amazing and being held by you made me feel like a queen' or something less cheesy lmao but I know what it's like to sabotage any potential relationship and it freaking sucks",False,False

Just tell them that's all it was and you aren't ready for anything more. If they're really your friend, they'll understand. If not, then you know they don't actually value your friendship.",False,False

If you're not ready for a relationship you can say to him that you had fun, and it was great but you have so much going on that it's a really bad idea for us to do this.  People sleep together, it doesn't mean you have to never talk to him again.",False,False
