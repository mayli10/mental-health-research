I learned that packages are allowed to be up to 20% off, which in my brain means they are all reporting calories that are 20% too low.  So 200 cal is actually 240!  And 400 cal is actually almost 500!  I don't trust anything anymore.  At least with fresh produce I know what I'm eating and can weigh it and it's got #health in it.",False,False

When I had an eating disorder, I could spend HOURS agonizing over whether the fruit that I was planning on eating was small, large or average. Also my anorexia had some features of orthorexia so pre-packaged food was a no-go for me. This just meant all the more mental energy was spent on trying to get the closest estimate of how many calories were in my food. It was absolutely exhausting.",False,False

I mean, the other evening I had a panic attack after trying to figure out how many frozen chicken strips are a serving size. And I mean like grilled, no fat, no breaded chicken strips.

I used to be hung up that there was an approx count for ""the average size apple"" and spend ages debating if the one I'm eating is average size.  Those days have passed, but I feel fine with labels.  The only time I didn't trust a label was loaves of bread when I started eating toast again.  There's a count for each slice, but each slice was a different size because of the shape.  Or ""a teaspoon equals x calories"".  Some of my spoons are smaller? Fortunately (again) I got over that.  A few calories either way aren't an issue.  I'm pretty sure there're rigid standards that go with what's put on labels, but when your brain's not thinking correctly because of an eating disorder then you're going to doubt it.  &amp;#x200B;  You honestly couldn't explain to something without eating problems the strangeness that we think, but if food's the enemy then I suppose we're always going to be overthinking everything relating to it.",False,False
