Little slip ups happen but as long as you leave them in the past and try to carry on with recovery they don't matter and show you how to do better. You're literally underweight, you are guaranteed to look skinny even if you gained a little you still would. So proud of you taking this step in recovery, it takes a lot of balls! Try and do something relaxing to calm down or talk to a friend. The feeling will pass. ðŸ’›",False,False
