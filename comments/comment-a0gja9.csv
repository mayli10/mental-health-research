I have a roommate that's super tall and extremely thin and I'd die to be as thin as her. She lost like 20 lbs (before she became my roommate) due to some disorder and meds (maybe ADHD? I forget) so she literally eats like garbage and still is the size of a sheet of paper and it infuriates me to no end. I also have a best friend who has been genetically blessed with like the best body ever since we were kids. She's just naturally very thin with a teeny waist and larger hips and, despite being several inches shorter than me, looks like she has super long legs. I love her but it really fucks with my head when I go out with her. Especially since her other friends are also ALL skinny. I doubt I'll even feel good enough to be in her presence until I'm like bmi 15 lol.",False,False

Not only is she around my height and probably 30lbs less than me, but she's kind of a bitch, especially about my diet. Whenever we eat together I will try not to have anything or eat healthy/low cal and she will make a comment about how  I'm not eating and how she never has to diet. Judging my eating habits while she's stuffing her face with taco bell... Also she's the type of girl who only hangs out with other skinny/attractive girls so I feel like she doesn't like me cause I'm too fat. Typing this out makes me feel pathetic :/   &amp;#x200B;  Anyway, I want to be smaller and fitter than her to make her jealous for once.

My bff is so fucking tiny and beautiful and perfect. Last year our relationship was at its best because I felt like I was thin enough to see her more than once a month (I get triggered being the fat friend so I don‚Äôt see her a lot). She also gained weight at that time so I weighed less than her and even though she was more beautiful and perfect than me I felt like I could be in her presence. Now, she‚Äôs vegan and works out daily, and she‚Äôs lost the weight and then some. She‚Äôs fucking tiny, probably underweight, while I‚Äôm sitting here at a fucking 20 BMI.

She won't admit she has an ED but she'll proudly say she runs on nothing but coffee and a bag of veggies every day. Pair that with a few napkins of food she was clearly trying to toss and the fact that she acts like a goddamn feeder....   1) how quick she is to comment on my weight loss trigger TF out of me. Really makes me feel like my self worth is determined by my size.   2) her eating habits. She constantly makes a show out of eating with me. Like we'll go to a restaurant and she'll order something Big and expensive and then barely pick at it. Meanwhile I'm scarfing down my whole salad or whatever.   3) her eating habits again. We'll go out and she'll keep buying food she doesn't want to eat and then shares it. Like damn bitch, the reason I didn't buy candied almonds was because I knew I'd eat all of them, but I guess you made that decision for me. It's so awkward when she buys a ton of food and we're both staring at it.   4) the comments she makes about her own skinny body make me feel so bad about myself. ""I bought a small and it was too big.... Actually an XS was too big too...."" Kms. I'm in a fucking large because BED and I hate myself. So to hear how small she is makes me want to go home and cry.
