Back at the start of my first attempt and trying to get out of obsessive calorie counting I used to do this bu5 forgot all about it. I would challenge myself to have a couple extra grapes, a mandarin, a bite or spoon of something, a piece of chocolate. And when I realised it didn‚Äôt effect me at all It eventually led me to stopping counting so obsessively for quite some time. I‚Äôm back counting and have been for almost a month even tho this is my last chance at recovery at home with mostly me in control, and if I don‚Äôt profess it‚Äôs gonna get scary. I‚Äôve promised my parents I‚Äôm not counting or tacking but I‚Äôm doing the opposite - still manipulating my cals and not eating enough to even maintain let alone gain and recover.",False,False
