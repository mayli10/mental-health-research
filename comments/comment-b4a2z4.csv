You don't want the calories in the sugars, but you definitely don't want the bacteria feeding off the sugar and sticking around longer.  The cranberry tablets (the brand I have is Azo) at the drug store are more effective and lower calorie.  Fingers crossed for you, UTIs are awful!",False,False

And constipation is obviously another possibility!  I'm glad for you that you're not actually abusing laxatives this time, and I hope your UTI goes away soon!",False,False
