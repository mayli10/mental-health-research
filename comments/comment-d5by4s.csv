You're so right- the longer I wait to get help, the MORE strain I'm knowingly putting on myself, unknowingly putting on my partner, and jeopardizing the surgery I've wanted for years.  I've got life goals and even body goals, and being stuck in this ED isn't getting me anywhere with these goals; ill and emaciated isn't what I want. I was looking at pictures of people who have recovered from eating disorders, many of whom took a healthy fitness route and got very muscular and _damn,_ they look so good! I want that!! I want to bulk up a fair amount and be one of those guys that you're like ""yeah, he could pick me up!""  I've been working on a list of boundaries and obstacles I can foresee being an issue with my recovery, compiling resources, and listening to a podcast, and by god if I can keep this mindset into tomorrow I'm going to come clean about everything.",False,True

EDs don't get easier to address the longer they're entrenched.  * I think you've answered this one for yourself. I'm sorry the financial fears are present, and healthcare access is such shit in this godforsaken country - but even if you don't want to prioritize the money for your ED over the surgery, as you said the ED could upend all of your plans anyway, if left unaddressed.  * This is a hard one, because it shouldn't matter but I know some people have struggled nonetheless based solely on current weight. Remember it's about your mental health and your relationship with food. Be ready to advocate for what you need. Be ready to be very specific about all of the thoughts and behaviors and obsessions, etc, that you struggle with in regards to your ED. Be specific about how it is affecting your day-to-day function, social life, etc, as well as physical issues.     * Don't let ""I don't know what I weigh"" serve as an excuse to never \*find out\* what you weigh and keep pushing off seeking help.     * Goal weight is also an excuse. You won't be satisfied at your goal weight. No one ever is. If you force yourself there before seeking help, you'll probably just set a new one, and push recovery that much further away.  * You're getting ahead of yourself. I saw my primary care doctor about 3 months ago, and started outpatient at an ED clinic about a month ago and no one has once yet told me to eat things that scare me. No one ever even told me to stop counting calories (though I did when I made the swap to tracking food exchanges instead).     * You need to start thinking now about what boundaries you need in place with your fiance. Just because he is a nurse does not make him \*your\* nurse. If you commit to proper treatment, will he yield that treatment to the specialists' hands? Are there any rules you could fathom about what he's allowed to ask, or ask from you, to help him stay reassured without making you feel babysat and pressured? * I'm pulling for you. It's scary. And hard. But you know you need this, sooner rather than later.",False,False
