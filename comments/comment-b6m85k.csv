It normally just takes a day or two of doing better to get back on track  We have a date night tomorrow which is what started the bad cycle last Saturday in the first place so hoping I can still get it under control tomorrow ,False,True

For me, I usually try to stop eating at 6-7pm and eat minimal carbs/sodium so that my body won’t hold onto the water weight  I was exactly like that too but I stopped the cycle yesterday by doing a 20 hour fast and I’ve been eating at a deficit. Can’t explain how much self control it took but I did it and I’m sure you can do it too! ",False,False

Try not to beat yourself up over this, I know it’s hard but there’s always tomorrow :) I spent a week overeating/binging (see post history) and I gained almost nothing (I’m also 5’2). Try again tomorrow! ",False,False
