Never binging or purging again.   Realistically, being able to go out to eat with friends or drink alcohol without it turning into a binge. Not feeling like the world is going to end if I go over my calorie limit.   I've accepted though that I'll never be carefree around food and be perfectly happy with my body image . I'm probably going to watch what I eat and want to be thin for the rest of my life. But that's fine. I just want to stop throwing money down the toilet and free up some mental space to actually achieve real things.",False,False
