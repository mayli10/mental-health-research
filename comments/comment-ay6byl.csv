I don't understand why she ignored your description of it and decided to base the critique on her opinion. I think, even if she is concerned, it was rude and a inconsiderate to make you talk about the topic. Imagine if someone created something that implied abuse, but they didn't state that is what it was about. How would it affect them to then have to stand there and talk about that? If she's actually concerned, she should have talked to you. ",False,False

I cannot fathom someone bringing this up like this during a critique.  Normally critiques go with you showing your piece and saying something about the meaning and the technique in making it. So leaping to eating disorders is very...wtf.  Also i cannot fathom bringing up something so personal as an eating disorder or mental illness of any kind in a persons art piece that contains them that they arent being forthcoming if its about it. Its presumptuous, insulting, and taking a leap that could potentially really offend the artist. Critique is about helping someone with their piece, letting the artist know what does and doesnt work and what was and wasnt successful. Sure reading into the work and interpreting it is expected. But normally in a studio workshop style class you have previously pitched concepts or sketches surrounding your intent with the piece. Or at least stated your thesis in front of your peers and professor.   It was completely inappropriate of her to do that to you. Especially since you two are so close. She should have the sense to know that that wasnt okay, and by now should be able to recognize she has messed up. Tomorrow when you see her I know you cant control how you feel about something but you really shouldnt feel embarrassed to see her. Shes the one who put you on the spot like that and i would be upfront about how uncomfortable that made you, especially as you were the center or the work. I hope you receive an apology.
