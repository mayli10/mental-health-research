I've had two different friends who were always thinner than me, and they were fine and good friends, but then they started gaining weight due to various circumstances and suddenly they got REALLY weird about their bodies and specifically how they related to me.  Society puts a lot of pressure on us not to be ""too fat"", however nebulous that is, and it's hard to measure that fatness except to compare yourself to others, even subconsciously. So if they start gaining weight, or, in your case, if you start losing weight, their perception of their own skinniness is threatened and they can do some really weird stuff subconsciously in their panic.  If she really is a good friend in other ways, you could choose to brush it off or you could address it and be honest and say it makes you uncomfortable when she compares your bodies. But hopefully, it's just a phase she grows out of eventually. Don't stay in an environment that makes you unhappy, though.",False,False

This is just a random thought, and I don't want to sound like I'm forcing you to take any suggestions: I still think that it might be good for you to take a break from talking about specific topics like food and weight with her. Even if she's a generally friendly person, these topics just might be really hard for her to navigate in a healthy manner.  Or I guess you could confront her about it (but only if you also want to; again I don't want to force anything). Although in this circumstance she might not like it either and feel like you're intruding... ack, it's really complicated. Since I don't know the specifics of your relationship I can't say a single path is definitely the right way to go.  Overall I hope your relationship with her doesn't take a toll on your mental health. Whatever she says does not impact what your own food intake is or what your body looks like. &lt;3",False,False

This wouldn’t bother me nearly as much, except she’s 5’11 and probably weighs more than twice as much as me! So it’s always really awkward and weird for me and gives me slight secondhand embarrassment like.... why would someone who has 9 inches on me need the same amount of food....",False,False

It’s just weird because in every other aspect of our friendship she is really great.   I think she might have her own issues with body image and disordered eating habits, and maybe her insecurities are just being expressed when she’s with me.",False,True

I agree with u/ci-fre, that's horrible and tbh i would avoid interacting with her because that's very toxic. I'm so sorry but know shes only saying that bc she feels threatened not bc its true &lt;3",False,False

Do you think it would be good for you to take a break from interacting with her?,False,False
