""It's bad but because I work so much, sometimes I forget to eat. I snack throughout the day, though, especially if I'm on set where there is craft service. My go-to is a cup of noodles with hot sauce. I know it's bad for me. People are like, ""Zendaya, it's high in sodium!"" but it's what I want to eat. I don't drink coffee; it doesn't do anything for me. I don't drink energy drinks or soda, either. And I hate water. I'm a juice drinker but not fancy-people juice. Like Tropicana or lemonade—not fancy.""  Her food habits are...weird, to say the least.  ""I don't cook. I think I could cook—I can do anything I put my mind to, so I could cook. I just (a) don't like following directions, and I'm (b) too lazy. I use Postmates to order food. I can have anything I want; that's the beauty of ordering food. If I'm having my favorite meal, I'll just skip right to ice cream. In fact, I get in trouble with my assistant a lot—he says I shouldn't do that. I usually try to ask everyone in the house what they want, but the final decision is mine. If I want Chick-fil-A, you guys are going to have Chick-fil-A. I will order something for you, but it will be from where I want.""",False,False

They have customised meal plans. Sure a lot of them probably have atleast some disordered behaviours but they are not alone with their weight management like us regular people.,False,False

I don't think she's healthy physically, but she gives off an impression that she's mentally OK. Or she's really good at hiding her disorder. Who knows.",False,False

Bella Thorne has a shit ton of other mental issues and her weight fluctuates a looot, not by a lot but still up and down. I think she even said she has one but idk.   Zendaya has always been consistently the same size, although she’s def underweight. However, she’s also really tall (like 5’11) so I don’t think it’d be unrealistic for her as an, I assume, active person to eat quite a lot and maintain her weight. She also doesn’t seem mentally unstable like that, so I’d say probably not.",False,False
