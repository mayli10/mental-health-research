When I was a teenager I used to think I'd just magically be over my ED in my 20s despite not working toward recovery, I just thought I'd be older and wiser I guess. I'm 23 and I feel like I'm too old to go to treatment (besides I'd have to get medical leave from school/work which would suck). But also I've never actually reached a weight I'm happy with and maintained it so I'm really not too concerned about treatment right now anyway.",False,False

Worst part is that I'm underweight BMI now for the first time in my life considering my age, but I want to be teenager thin, if that makes sense?
