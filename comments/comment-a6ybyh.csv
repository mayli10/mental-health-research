I‚Äôve always been partial to a more vegetarian approach, and that was the longest I‚Äôve gone on any diet I‚Äôve tried.  This time, I was basically experimenting to see if being ‚Äúfat adapted‚Äù and very low-carb, and not worrying too much caloric-wise would cause me to maintain and maybe lose weight. The idea of being in ketosis, and not being afraid of animal fats (like I normally am), was interesting and convincing in theory, but in practice just a huge mistake. One can‚Äôt be in ketosis if the caloric intake is too high, and it doesn‚Äôt take much to ingest 2,000 more calories than normal because of all the fats.   I think I‚Äôm at an age where losing weight gets harder unless real life changes are made, but it is a process, I screwed up, but I kinda knew it might not end well lol.   Thanks for your insight, much appreciated from someone same age/weight/activity. üôÇ",False,True

I'm a powerlifter and a runner too.   Two weeks ago I tried 'keto' but not the way they do it on that sub. I basically shifted my macros not for ketosis but to get more nuts, seeds, avocado, egg yolks and olive oil. No fatty meats or dairy (no bacon, steak, heavy cream, cheese etc). I am doing 50g carbs a day and each other meal with a full fat serving (15g per meal). Even on lifting days.  It's helped a lot - for the first time in years I'm  not obsessing and white-knuckling it. I'm sleeping better (probably because of all the magnesium  in seeds and nuts) I haven't lost weight but I haven't binged or restricted. Today is the first day I'm feeling really hungry (hence browsing the sub) but I'm due for my period. It doesn't have to be cheeseburgers and bacon. It can look like chicken and avocado, Greek yogurt and walnuts, protein powder and nut butter. I'm going to see how far I go with this. ",False,False

Also one down side is that, if it is heavy in saturated fat, as what you describe some food porn, it is terrible for cholesterol levels and cardiovascular system. (Adkins diet due to the consequences of his poor diet)   Yeah some people feel great in fat heavy keto, others feel great in a extremely low fat raw vegan diet. Everyone is different. But best is to try to not fall for a ""miracle"" diet that is based on excluding food groups.",False,False

That sounds like a bad idea for an anorexic, because both red meat and carbs are practically made to make people fatter! The only good meats are non red meats like chicken and seafood, but avoiding carbs is the right way to go about this tbh. I'd stick with keto, just adjust for less red meat.",False,False

Not that I've found anything dietary to help me stop b/ping but at least other diets don't make me feel as moody. It seemed promising (no hunger!) but didn't help my appetite in the slighest, followed by the insomnia. On the bright side, at least now you know that strictly keto might not be for you and can focus on finding a way of eating that works better? No joke tho I'm really annoyed at the keto sub too",False,False
