It just blew my mind too.  Idk if this helps anyone else, but this also ties into gender identity for me - I've been trying to figure out why I've felt so much better, food-wise, since I finally figured out my gender stuff + started semi-passing.  *There's just less discomfort and pain to redirect/express.* Holy shit. Suddenly it actually makes sense.  Thinness has always kinda...felt like an apology to the world, you know? ""I'm not existing selfishly; just look at me."" I don't know how to explain that better. But you probably get what I mean. I hope.  Hope this gives you a solid push towards happier and calmer places with all this bs.",False,False
