I only hide my alcoholism but that’s because I’m so afraid to live without booze, I would *love* to recover from my eating disorder but I cling to alcohol like it’s my only lifeline.  I feel you with the weight standstill. I aim for 800 calories a day and usually hit that five out of seven days, but I’ll end up going wayyy overboard on alcohol anyway. It’s so frustrating.   Alcoholism is a terrifying thing, it’s so life consuming. I hope we both find a way to kick its ass.",False,True

I would never lie to my partner and yet I keep so much from him ... hide so much from him :( For the past 6 months I've gotten well over half of my daily calories from wine and prosecco... to the point that despite purging almost every time food hits my gut, my weight is at a standstill and had even gone up at one point :(:( I know giving up drinking would significantly boost my weight loss but I'm having a really hard time doing that. It's pretty mind blowing and disappointing to realize that my addiction to alcohol might actually be more powerful than my addiction to calorie counting and weight loss.",False,False
