I’ve had ECGs and all that good stuff, my heart rate increases by 20bpm from sitting to standing.   Despite this, they’ve never actually done anything and it’s kinda freaky when suddenly I can feel my heart just not working when I’m trying to get on with my life. If they’re gonna ignore it then so am I, clearly my life isn’t very important to anyone. Sorry, I’m pretty depressed rn.",False,False

I get knots on the left side of my body from this. So basically I had pain in the entire left side of my body. It was fucking awful. My chest/head/jaw was the worst. I had also been having heart palpitations on and off for weeks (honestly looking back, idk if it was the anxiety or the ED). Right before this I realize I had dropped 20lbs in less than a month. My ED wasn't really apparent to me at the time; somehow it was like I was disassociating so hard every day that I didn't realize I was starving myself.  I go in and they slapped an ECG on me for a few hours while they ran a bunch of tests. Nothing exciting at all. In the end (and thank God insurance paid most of this) $10,000 dollars worth of diagnostics were done for me to ask ""Could this all be anxiety?"" And for them to say ""Who knows, probably.""  They wanted to put me on a Holter monitor for a week, despite the doctor at the follow up saying that ""girls my age (21) just get heart palpitations frequently"".   I declined the monitor because they didn't seem to care too much to me. No one ever asked me about my mental health. It caused me to avoid seeking treatment for many issues because they didn't seem to think it mattered.  In all it was a shitty time. :/",False,False
