Electrolytes: Propel makes a 0cal powder, and there are other low cal options that shouldnt break ketosis.  Broth: If you can manage, a nutrient dense low cal broth can help your fast. Fasting/keto subs normally have more info on this.  I'm not 100% sure but I think you can have 50 cal from liquid a day and not break ketosis.  Also, flavored 0cal teas are great for when you crave flavors. Tazo Lemon Pound Cake is a personal favorite.",False,False
