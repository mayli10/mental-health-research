I totally recommend getting some nicotine lozenge or gum and just keep it with you, if you never use it that’s okay but better if you crack to have some of that than a cig.  I can tell you I feel much better now that I don’t smoke in a million ways, my skin literally started glowing and I heal so much faster, I’m not joking this is the BEST thing you are doing for yourself and all your body cells are jumping up and down cheering you on!!",False,False

I don’t know if I did it for a distraction, bc everyone else was doing it, or what. But a couple of my friends quit too so now I’m just like meh. So gross don’t want to pick the habit back up. I haven’t really craved one but I’ve still been chewing lots of gum and sucking on hard candies. Hoping within a week or so to not even feel the need to do that, but I do always chew lot of gum in general so idk!",False,True

So I personally believe that the ""you gain weight when you quit smoking"" rule is for the normies mostly.  I think the people that do gain weight are the ones that smoked in order to distract themselves... To have something to do with their hands and mouth. I smoked because I wanted to die lol. So when I quit, I did it with an optimistic attitude and I didn't need to ""replace"" the habit with something else.",False,False

Nicotine gum or lozenges can also be helpful   Best of luck, you are doing your health a huge favor",False,False

But on all my quit attempts, it was almost like I had to relearn how to eat without smoking. What I mean is that I can’t fast for long/at all when I’m not smoking, so I had to adjust the spacing and timing of my meals to still be able to lose weight. (More regular but smaller portions.) Otherwise my anxiety would flare up bad (if I tried to fast OR if I ate too much at a time I’d want to smoke).  IMO, it’s definitely possible to lose weight while quitting. I did the first two weeks and then got too crazy so I decided to try maintaining until I leveled out from quitting. Ultimately, I picked it back up due to stressors outside of my ED.  At the end of the day, I really think it’s just CICO. I craved sugar more than usual, but I found ways to satisfy those and keep a deficit. Things like canned peaches, certain low cal ice creams/popsicles, etc.   Best of luck with quitting! I’m planning on doing it again myself and I’m rooting for ya",False,False
