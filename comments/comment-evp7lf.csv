There was another one where my parents told me we were going to a museum, but it ended up being an ED treatment center.   One time there was a Cheeto vending machine in my parents' room and I kept using and ended up eating 432 cals. l When I woke up I was freaking out because I was supposed to be fasting, so I started working out at like 3 am to burn this off. I slowly started to realize it was a dream, but decided to finish the workout anyway because ""thinking about food probably has some calories"".  (Side note: When I did some math a long time ago, I came to the conclusion that there are 7.6 cals in one Cheeto, so if you round up to 8 and divide it actually works out lol)",False,False
