In some places the law is 16 and under, other places it's 18. If you're under that age, you might want to think about whether you would rather tell your parents yourself or have them be in the room (I know when I was a teen I haaated the idea of the doc talking to my mom about me behind my back.) That's not a reason not to do it, just something I think you should know up front.  My best guess? The doc will refer you to a psychologist or therapist, hopefully one that specializes in ED or depression. They will ask you a lot of questions about your ED behaviors and the self-harm, but as long as you aren't at risk of suicide they probably won't want you to go to the hospital or anything like that. They may want to do a blood test, to check for things like thyroid disease which have depression as a side effect. They might want you to come back for a visit once a month or two months for a while to make sure you aren't losing weight too fast.  It's understandable to be nervous! But I really think you should do it. You deserve help, and treatment could potentially make a huge difference in your life. Getting an official diagnosis might make it easier for you to understand what you're feeling and what to do about it, and alleviate the fear of not knowing what you have. Good luck!",False,False

One or the other can still help, but doing both is better. A therapist basically helps you rewire your brain. They literally help you create new neural pathways and teach you how to strengthen those neural pathways so that your old ones (the unhealthy behaviours) die off. Medication helps speed that up by changing your brain chemistry.",False,False

Remember that you need to be your own advocate and stand up for yourself. Some doctors are not well-equipped to work with someone with an eating disorder, so don't be surprised if the doctor isn't very knowledgeable. You can also look up eating disorder specialists in your area and reach out to them directly, possibly with the help of your parents if you are comfortable telling them.",False,False

How will that make me happy   Also therapy?

You are absolutely worthy of getting help.   Depression is a terrible, terrible disease and nobody should ever have to go through it. But it is treatable. It may take a few tries to find the right medication, or you may get lucky and the first one helps. Therapy is also a big help. Same thing there, sometimes it takes a few tries to find the right therapist.   Don't ever give up. Fight for yourself. You deserve that.   ❤",False,False
