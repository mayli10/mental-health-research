It does help a lot know I’m not alone!   I think you’re right about my mind now being like “wooo let’s go ham before she stops us again”, which is a shame because it makes me less likely to indulge more regularly because of my fear that I won’t be able to stop it. I have uni orientation in 10 days where I’m gonna meet a bunch of my classmates for the first time so I think that’s a good goal to work towards! The week after that I have an appointment with my GP to discuss my weight, which will reset my brain anyway.   Thank you for your advice ❤️",False,True

Like a date, or a vacation, or another event where I'm gonna be eating and want to enjoy it, or I just want to look my best by then. So I behave very well the days prior like you did, as in no binging because as soon as a hint of a urge comes up I remember I have to stay on track for said event. Then the event comes along and I do as planned. Aka, enjoy a date like you did, or enjoy some special food during vacation without going overboard. That's the prize. But then as soon as the next day comes along, you might not realize it but your subconscious does, there's no more short term goal or deadline. Sometimes restricting can feel easier than it actually is on our brains because what it is is well, restricting yourself, limiting and controlling instincts like, eating at maintenance. As soon as your brain doesn't have that limitation, even though you still want to restrict/ not binge for your long term goals, you let your gusrds down so to speak. I've had this happen countless times before I stopped to realize why it happened. Like I would fear going on vacation because 1 wabted to look better in front of whoever I'm seeing there and 2 fear of bingeing. Those fears usually keep me on track in at least a week leading up to said vacation. Then during vacation I'm even able to turn down certain foods but indulge in some safer still enjoyable options. Then on the first day back home I almost always end up bingeing no matter how much I tell myself this time Wil be different and to me at least it's because all of a sudden i dont have any other short term event to plan for.  So how I've managed to control that is, during said event, vacation, date, whatever I look at my calendar and find what the next thing is gonna be. A party, or a social gathering where I'm gonna be indulging in special food. I count the days or weeks leading up to it and start from scratch. I can't give myself time to relax too much because it back fires, cuz your brain is tired of being controlled and it knows soon enough you're gonna open your eyes and force it to restrict again. So it goes overboard with a binge to have some freedom while it Stil can. Hope this made sense, at least for me that's exactly what it is. And being aware made it easy to control. ",False,False
