However, since you're already in therapy, this is probably a good opportunity to learn to deal with those foods and the feelings/urges they cause and how to handle such an environment without derailing recovery. I mean, that's the whole point of therapy, learning to deal with all this shit, right? In the meanwhile, if you're comfortable, you could ask your parents if you could reorganize the fridge/pantry, etc. in such a way that you wouldn't be faced with those foods when they're not what you're looking for. For example, have all the ice creams and other frozen fear foods in separate freezer drawers from the veggies, have a separate cupboard for the cookies and chips so they won't stare you in the face when you go looking for oats or rice. I'm not sure how much help that would be in reality because you'll know that stuff is still there, but it might be a tiny bit easier to deal with them if you're not faced with Lays while getting some oats for breakfast. ""Out of sight, out of mind"" and all that, plus your parents wouldn't have to change their habits (aside from the organizational ones).",False,False
