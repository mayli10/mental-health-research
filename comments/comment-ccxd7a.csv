I kind of understand what you're going through because I have kidney problems too. Almost 3 years ago I had a really bad infection which affected my right kidney.

I had random shooting pains in my side, weird smelling pee... And your story scares me, because it could've happened to me too. I'm trying to recover, and things are going okay now, but you made me realize that I really need to get an ultrasound and see if I have further damaged my kidney with my behavior.
