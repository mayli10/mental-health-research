Short version is that:      I feel like theres a difference between eating disorders and disordered eating, and that a lot of weight loss subs have people with disordered eating habits even if they don’t have an eating disorder. Like, fasting for 30 days, 40 days, I think I even seen one for 70 days once? Id call that disordered eating.      Ive also heard that the difference between people with eating disorders and the other people who restrict calories and fast for long periods, is the mindset. That if they’re not hung up on food, and they don’t feel guilty when they eat, then they don’t have an eating disorder. But wheres the line? How long will it take being in that lifestyle before they DO start feeling guilty about eating/breaking their fast or diet? When does “harmless diets and fasting” turn into an actual eating disorder? How many people on there actually do have an eating disorder but are in denial because they’re just doing what the other people on the sub are doing so they don’t think/realize that they have a problem right away?      Maybe Im just overly worried though about these people because I wouldn’t want anyone developing a shitty eating disorder. ",False,False

That means more posts, and for your post to get noticed you have to be more extreme, more attention grabbing, and often concerning. That's how you get clicks, votes, and comments, and that's often the validation people look for. Also with the proed Exodus, there likely ARE more disordered people in there, especially the casual proed users who haven't put in the work to seek out this or similar subs. Just my 2 cents.

One post in particular really stood out to me the other day as being quite disordered. Huge weight loss in a very short amount of time, relatively low daily caloric intake and extended fasts every week. Not one person in the comments addressed  this.

The dangers need to be highlighted and people need to be told when their behaviour is becoming unhealthy, not just given a pat on the back. It’s madness. ",False,False

If anyone says anything against their doctor whatever on YouTube or that crazy snake juice guy, they're downvoted to oblivion, even in a perfectly reasonable comment or even just an innocent question.
