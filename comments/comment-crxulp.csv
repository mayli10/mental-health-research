I feel like he does have feelings but is a typical dude who is afraid to admit it. He acts like he likes me. Especially since our relationship was pretty toxic since we both were really depressed and were codependent at the time. But we’ve grown and are still growing. And we aren’t as serious, just working on being friends and being healthy. At least I am. And fucking is nice lol.   And I don’t mind my little tits!!! No more bras for meeee!",False,True

Maybe he sleeps with you because he likes you. There are levels to what attraction is and it's not always just physical.",False,False
