I personally usually say that I just haven't been feeling hungry/something along those lines if someone asks, although I'm sure you've already thought of that excuse. Good luck!ðŸ¥°",False,False

Iâ€™ve just been procrastinating bc I donâ€™t quite know what to say to my doctor about my eating (Iâ€™ve been like this for close to a week?) but I think I just gotta buck up and do it!

I've had vomit that was more digested than my dookie. I've always figured it was just my body being done with my shit (heh) and finally getting me back for it. But hey, it's free laxatives.   But also you should maybe go to a doctor if you can, just to make sure everything's alright. Or try probiotics if that's not an option. Digestive systems just kind of suck in general",False,False

Having prolonged diarrhea can actually be really bad for you because it means your body doesn't have a chance to absorb any nutrients from the food you're eating. (Gonna assume you don't take laxes either bc you didn't mention it in the post.)",False,False
