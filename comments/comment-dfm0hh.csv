I am in a partial program for my mood disorder, but I'm being cross-tracked with a dietitian in the ED program. I was given a meal plan last week to help me build a new relationship with food, but I'm just super hungry and want to binge all the time now. It's like...I'm addicted to food and so having a regular amount of it just triggers me to go out of control. It's so much easier for me to either fast/restrict or binge than it is to eat reasonably. It's just one extreme or the other for me and it's SO FRUSTRATING. Like you, I wonder if I'll ever be able to not struggle.",False,False

I have considered doing that kind of ""all in"" approach but I'm scared my body won't stop at a reasonable weight. I binged myself into obesity when I was in high school (although to be fair, I was still trying to restrict and probably making the issue worse).",False,True

The body stops when it's satisfied so even though you follow the dieticians plan it might just be the case that your body wants even more food to make up for the starvation it's been put through.",False,False
