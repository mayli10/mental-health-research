It was like every touch or act that was supposed to feel sexy felt wrong because my disgusting self was involved. Just know that this is not you’re fault, and that these thoughts ARE absolutely just a result of your negative body image, NOT the truth!! Hugs, we are all here to support you",False,False

I know it’s super hard but when you should try to talk to him! He definitely cares about you if he’s willing to listen and it helps so much more letting it all out as well as knowing your man is there for you and knows your struggles.   After I told my boyfriend everything our relationship definitely struggled at first, but it’s only gotten stronger ever since. I can talk to him about anything and he supports me when I need it most even if I don’t tell him I need his help",False,False

But i totally understand your situation.  You seem to have a really loving and caring boyfriend, so maybe try to talk to him. Im pretty sure you both could benefit from talking about this. But i would recommend to talk about this when you dont feel upset and not after you tried to sleep with him.  Anyway, i really wish you the best and hope that you and your boyfriend can sort this out &lt;3",False,False
