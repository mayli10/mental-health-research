I read your comment yesterday but was too emotional to respond still. I needed it, reading back I was clearly panicking, not thinking clearly. The amount I ate, in consideration with everything you said, really wasn’t a binge. I was just already upset and watching myself finish a big meal of course made me more upset when it wouldn’t have so much otherwise.   Anyways thanks! I feel a lot better and this comment helped a lot.",False,True

You ate (based on your height) probably about as much as your body needs a day. You had a rough day, and you were drained, and you refilled your body just the right amount, and that's it, and that's okay.",False,False
