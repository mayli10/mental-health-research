The rest of the time I was almost underweight. Eating disorders seem like they are about weight on the surface, but they affect all different sizes.",False,False

My mother was mildly disgusted by the thought of me purging (which I don't do through vomiting because I'm emetophobic) but also wouldn't believe that I could binge as much as I did. This is because at first I was my normal weight, same as always, then I was underweight. I feel like other  people will react the same way. They really don't believe I can have such horrible binges if I maintain or even lose in the long run. Its a very misunderstood situation, and incredibly isolating. It's as if an ED is only understood by some people when you're restricting and underweight. If you don't fit that understanding they don't know what to do with you or what you're going through.",False,False

Of course I’m not going to binge eat in front of people! It’s like the most unstable and humiliating thing I do to myself, why would I ever expose that to someone in person? I’m sorry you’ve been through a similar experience, it’s at least comforting to know we are not alone ✨",False,True

I'm not bulimic, but I've struggled with binging and I have a friend who straight up doesn't believe it. She's said 'I've never seen you binge or eat much, I don't believe it'. It was stressing me out so much because I was like, I don't like eating and certainly not binging in front of people so that's why! And she kept saying I don't believe it. It's pretty rude when people make and stick to a judgement when you've literally told them it's the opposite... Surely you of all people would be aware of your own eating habits ffs. I'm sorry that you've recieved such insensitive reactions, especially from people who are supposed to support you.",False,False
