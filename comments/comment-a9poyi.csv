This disease is bullshit, you clearly still don’t have a healthy relationship with food by a long shot, but there’s this arbitrary line in the sand that your body crossed and now you have to deal with feeling like this. Sorry, it sucks. ",False,False

I know it feels shitty and to me it’s always felt like a slap in the face and a reminder of how fat I am.  But again, I have to remind myself that they aren’t everything and people can be really small and still get a period ",False,False

I feel like I've undone all my progress (?) Like losing my period was a checkpoint in my ED journey or something, smh. Ugh, at least my therapist and dietitian will be happy. ",False,True

I'd been really hoping it would come back a few months before, because I was worried my mum would catch on, but I ended up really liking not having it. Less dysphoria, and it made me feel 'skinny enough'. How silly.  I was genuinely quite heartbroken when it came back, like I'd lost a part of my identity. It triggered me to binge, haha. I have gained a bit of weight over the past few months, and I purge a lot less these days, so that must be why, but it was oddly jarring.  Objectively of course, it is a good thing. I can't stop hoping it'll go away again though.  ",False,False

I've seen numerous postings on here from people on here that are underweight but still get their peirod due to the amount of harm reduction they partake in. They are not healthy but still have their peirod. You are not a failure. You are still suffering. You are valid.  (Also you can still get pregnant even if you don't have your period,  just a heads up)",False,False
