I just found it at the supermarket, sitting quietly with the flours trying to act like it belongs. 1/4 cup is 80 calories and an astounding 12g protein - that's better than any protein powder or bar I know of. That's 6.66 calories per gram protein, better than quest bars. The best part? It's $3 for a pack with 11 servings. That's right. 11 servings of 12g protein for $3- that's one quest bar (six if you get them on a discount at this one surplus store, but those always taste... off). Cheaper than protein powder for sure.  You'll have to cook it with something to make it taste good. I haven't had any yet, but the macros are good enough for me to eat it even if it doesn't taste great. ",False,False

If you're looking for more 'real food', broccoli, spinach, and pumpkin seeds are all high in protein per calorie. ",False,False

I usually do a 10g serving.   I like it because it’s completely neutral and doesn’t have any calories or weird taste from artificial sweeteners. ,False,False
