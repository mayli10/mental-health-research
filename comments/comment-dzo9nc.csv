I feel lonely in crowded room of people even when I have lots of friends who see, I feel lonely when after I have been to uni I come and home and I am feeling miserable, because dads got the flipping news on brexit, dad never says anything that is remotely positive, family tend to see what they can do about problems but dismiss the feelings, worries, symptoms, they don’t know what living with chronic physical condition and mental health conditions , they know what living me is like ? But the internal stuff of what I feel?  Everything is as dismissed as “I can’t be fibromylagia” or “depression”  as I thought only “unemployed ppl get that.  They didn’t tend to realise that when I am busy, doing stuff  I st I’ll have the conditions to worry about daily, symptoms etc and the same was when I able to work “your better now your at work!”” Your cured BS my ass  They tend also to confused over the whole what like vs what I don’t.   For example : I got to uni, like going to uni I like being productive but I still have conditions.  But when : I wasn’t doing any of these things, I hated leaving leaving my house and would easily bunk off every group ppl made to turn to “to get out of the house”  A lot of the time, I would take a Valium too late at night so I would miss going to art cafe/Wednesday club and feel grateful and glad  or if my agoraphobia isisss would crop up I wouldn’t show the sadness “I would be thinking “ yes!!! That group is bunked no more mindless conversations with Laura talking about weather. Another day of Netflix :) ❤️w which is something I miss now as I don’t always have time. It’s something I wait till Xmas, Easter etc. Since being at uni I sadly don’t have time to enjoy myself outside it the study life balance. It’s these things and he’ll load more things that could be mentioned with Phenibut and ordering Modafinil etc, all the stuff I do so I can do better a uni, get good grades and so I can prove to ppl ain’t special needs",False,True

But to people who are obese, it may be their lifestyle choices, using a car when they can walk a few blocks to work, having portion control issues, having sedentary job or simply enjoying the chippy everyday. “Nah I can’t bothered to cook, I’ll order pizza, and then may have 10 mars bars”   I’m in the stage where I am not dangerously underweight or close to that so I stay in the middle with Ednos and I get all the symptoms mentally and physically but not to extent where I am desperate.   Also money is huge factor for me at the moment, I used to enjoy a nice latte or expensive coffee now I can’t  afford those things i don’t drink, I bring in a flask from home and nab a few teabags. I lost interest in snacks in order to save money, then became breakfast and lunch and quite easily became dinner, but I must some strength to keep going every day otherwise how the heck am I still walking for miles, doing countless up and down uni.  But at least, I can run upstairs everyday and my blood glucose levels aren’t dramatically low or too high, my relationship with food is down the bog and at the stage where it doesn’t bother me physically. It bothers me slightly in the sense that “everyone can afford” and it having to make excuses” but then the after side of me at stage I feel constantly high like I am on drugs 24/7, full of energy don’t want it stop.",False,True
