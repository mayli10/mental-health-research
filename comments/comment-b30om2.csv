One day my mom woke me up and said ""Oh my god You're getting thin. Your arms are like a doll's"" she was kinda worried but my fucked-up ass was happy for the next few days after this. When anyone comments on how thin I am, It's basically like a dopamine hit",False,False

It fuels me more though, but between the binging and the restricting, I’m just gaining and losing the same 5 lbs.",False,False

Thanks Susan, it’s the eating disorder...”   But I used to just thank them pretty sincerely, for the most part anyway. My ED Brain loved that shit, even though it was also a little depressing and frustrating at times. It’s fueled me.   Since I’ve gained some weight back, it’s actually kinda weird seeing people I haven’t seen in a while and *not* immediately receiving that sweet, sweet Validation or whatever, lol. A few of the people who would compliment me on my weight loss on the reg know I’m seeing an ED therapist/sort of getting ED treatment (kinda), and one of them actually apologized which I thought was super nice! But unnecessary really.",False,False

Granted, I’m about fifteen pounds up from my low weight right now, but back then-  “Wow you look so good!” I’d say thanks and smile.  “Oh, you’ve lost so much weight..” I’d say yes, I’m having some health issues right now.",False,False

(It's true, considering I'm trying to recover. I can't really expect coworkers or distant friends to know about my ed or know how to respond if I told them, and I know their intention is to compliment me, so it's easiest just to focus on my health and not my size.)",False,False
