The chocolate brownie was ok but I probably wouldn’t buy it again, but still not bad. Then again, the last protein bar I tried was awful, so I set the bar pretty low for these. They’re a lot better than I expected in any case, and I may or may not have ordered several boxes from Target and Amazon today.",False,True

It's... bleached? so it has this processed taste and smell that works really well in cakes, not so much in bread and pasta.   Honestly though, get what's affordable and available to you. They're all pretty much interchangeable and the differences are minor.",False,False
