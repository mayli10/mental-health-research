I'm currently on Prozac 10 mg and even though it's the smallest dosage I still notice that my appetite is slightly lower. I've also heard people say it increased their appetite but I think it just depends on the person and their body. I can't say for certain but I don't believe your medications will affect your metabolism or anything so if that's what you are worried about then you should be fine. :),False,False
