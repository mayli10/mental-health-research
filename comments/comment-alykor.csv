It seems from what you’ve said that you sort of feel like reality is flipping the script on you; things used to make sense and now they don’t anymore, things that used to work don’t work anymore. EDs being centred on control, this must feel pretty catastrophic. But everything that’s changing is internal to you, and you have the power to get on top of it, just give yourself some slack and some space to get centred.
