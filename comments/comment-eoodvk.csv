We should -TRY- to be nicer to ourselves, easier said than done, it helps longterm!  You don't have to eat the cake, but it would be special to them. You also deserve inner peace!  Both you and your self-discipline are great - regardless of how you choose to spend your day!  I wish you a very happy birthday and I so understand both sides of this fasting struggle today!",False,False
