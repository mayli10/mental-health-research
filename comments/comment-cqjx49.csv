The better communication, the better you can avoid bad situations  Understand that the ed already takes up a TON of her time and mental space. Be there to help her and support her, but make sure the ed isn’t the  only thing you’re there for. When she talks about it listen but make sure it isn’t the only thing y’all talk about. She’s still HER and it really helps to spend a little time away from the disorder.   The phrase “I don’t support that but ily and I’m here for you” works very well for me when I talk about behaviors and destructive habits. I can still share, and my friends/so can listen without encouraging me",False,False

He is the most important thing in the world to me so even though its hard, I am starting recovery for him. I don't know if it will help her but I just know that hearing how my husband was really affected by my eating order is what I needed to hear to push me into recovery. Love conquers all.",False,False

Different people need different kinds of support.  It might also be a good idea for you to see if there is a local support group for the loved ones of people with EDs.  Others who are in the same position as you can give you a lifeline that you can draw on and help you feel less alone in your supportive role.,False,False
