I know exactly how you feel. My clothes not fitting me has been the hardest thing for me to deal with, especially since clothes and fashion were the only things that made me happy &amp; I can't afford to go shopping for anything new right now. I don't really have any advice to offer, just the fact that I know what you're going through and how similar our stats/time-frame is so I like GET it.",False,False

I was relatively skinny from all the stress i was under and my ex picking fights literally any time i would try to have a meal turning eating into a horrific experience.  Now i've gained 20 pounds, feel absolutely disgusting in my own skin and im back to restricting heavily so i can maybe start to eat dinner without binging for days and feeling like absolute shit, fat, guilty, and stressed.  i feel like nothing matters except being smaller and i hate it.",False,False

That went on for another couple of months. Then I really tried to restrict again. But I continued to c/sp. Then I was sent to the hospital(unrelated to ed) and that’s when the restriction came in full force. After that I was sent to a PRTF where I continued to restrict and lose weight. I eventually became underweight again. But once I left the PRTF I started the daily binging all over again. Gained ten pounds in a weeks time. This is where I am now. Although the binging has been shrinking in size somewhat. And I’ve only binged twice this week. I’m also currently in an ED PHP.   So really, I don’t know what to tell you or how to stop it. But I’ll say this- maybe you should consider treatment if you’re not already getting it. The thing is though, that you kind of have to want to recover to get anywhere in treatment. I’m kind of stuck in the middle because I want to recover but I still want to restrict until I’m underweight again. So treatment isn’t going well.",False,False

Went from very underweight to normal weight with a gain of 47 pounds in the span of 3/4 months. Binging everyday. It was the worst time of my life.
