She's really open about her struggle with binge eating but it wasn't something she had ever experienced until overrestricting at points as an adult despite being very overweight since childhood.  You've laid it out really well here and I hope someone reads this comment and clicks just like I did.,False,False

For me, there'd be a lot of times I'd eat way over my calorie limit in a day and then feel like I'd binged even though I hadn't really sat down and binged... I'd just been giving into my appetite all day.  So then I'd freak out and feel broken because of it- since I had a high calorie day, I /must've/ binged, that means I broke my binge-free streak, I'm a binger, I'm out of control. etc etc etc it would sometimes set off a real binge.  But it's very natural to have a huge appetite while restricting and such... There's actually nothing unusual about a starving person wanting to eat 3000, 4000 calories. Most people in that position would want to do the same. It's a survival reaction, that big appetite is how ancient humans survived. As hunter-gatherers, we had to eat whenever we could, since high calorie food is scarce. (Humans have high calorie needs for our size bc our brains use tons and tons of energy)  Anyway my point is that it can be helpful to try and recognize the reasons we might have unplanned, unexpected high calorie intake days. Obviously my experience doesn't apply to everyone (or maybe not anyone at all) but it was helpful for me to distinguish between the two and recognize that I am not out of control just because I ate a lot of food.  Either way, binge or not, you deserve love and kindness and to treat yourself well. You are valid. And you are going to be okay! (oh god this post ended up so long)",False,False
