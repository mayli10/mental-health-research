I understand. I completely get it. When I had BED I would wake up everyday praying I had anorexia.   Like all eating disorders mess with you both mentally and physically but if you’re trying to lose weight then of course you’d want anorexia. Of course you would wish for that. When I’m binging all I want is to be anorexic cause then I’m getting closer to my goal. I want to be underweight and binging compulsively won’t get me there. And then society CLEARLY values certain things more than others. If you’re anorexic and thin then it’s like of course you need help. But you’re anything else and people are justifying why your eating disorder is invalid. I understand how it is to live in a society where if you have BED, it’s a lack of willpower and self-control. Instead of people realizing it’s literally a compulsion and I’m not in control and can’t stop myself from eating and eating and eating. Yeah anorexia does suck. It’s terrible. I always felt like I was going to die at any moment. Or that one day I would be on the elliptical and just fall down and die. But it was still so much better than preparing 5 meals and shame eating them in my closet because we already ate dinner. So no I don’t really fault you for thinking like that. I think it’s important to remember that we are all suffering and the grass does seem greener on the other side. Especially when you’re gaining weight and that’s the last thing you wanted.

Physically of course, but emotionally too. There's a chemical in our brains called serotonin. It's part of what makes you able to feel happiness. It helps with appetite too, as well as sleep and your sex drive and lots of things that make life worth living. And starvation messes with it. There's a whole ""chicken or the egg"" thing with EDs and depression, but as someone who doesn't necessarily struggle with depression or anxiety *usually*, but is generally sensitive, it's like I can feel the serotonin switch being flipped in my head. There's no happiness, no energy, no ability to focus, only negative thoughts, anxiety through the roof and a stress level that makes my phone's health app suggest ways of calming down. Of course, the fucked up things happening in your brain also combines with the fact that your body is a machine running without fuel.  I'm not at all offended by your post, but just know that even reaching an UGW can feel like absolutely nothing, or can even feel bad, when anorexia is how you achieved it. You get what you want, but the price is your ability to appreciate getting it. It's like getting the man of your dreams, but only if you stop being in love with him the moment he kisses you.",False,False
