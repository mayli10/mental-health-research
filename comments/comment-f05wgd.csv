I used to eat a tiny amount but now I eat well in the 2thousands and I’m basically the same. I just eat once a day to offset my insulin and hormones that would cause me to store energy",False,False

Also, the person you're responding to is a pseudoscience-spewing HAES troll.",False,False

Someone can have a seemingly fuckoff low met rate and feel completely serene with zero starvation symptoms, and it's because they are still engaging in all of the expensive metabolic processes, but they're just sarcopenic as fuck. Is that person healthy? No, but they don't have a met rate crash, and their met rate &amp; appetite will go up if they attempt to put on muscle.  I surmise that what the study shows is that the predicted met rate is much higher than the actual met rate for the same FFM (muscle, organs, sinews) after massive weight loss.",False,False

Did they consider the drop in muscle mass that likely occurred? It's very late at night for me so I might just be not comprehending it properly,False,False
