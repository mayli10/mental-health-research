Because I already knew it was harmful, but the fear of losing control was crippling.   Feeling in control is such a great feeling. But there are ways to control your calories in a *healthy* way, whether you're trying to maintain, gain or lose weight. Balance and nutrition is important. You'll find your niche. It'll take time, but always remember that YOU are the one in control of your life. Stress will always try to throw you off track. Kick that stress in the face and remember that you'll get through it.   You're not alone in your struggles. You're not a failure. This feeling will pass. Focus on your recovery and what makes you happy.",False,False
