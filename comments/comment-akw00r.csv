Broccoli. Monster Zero. Pizza. Apples.   It’s all chemicals and everyone who acts like some chemicals in food are somehow different or morally superior than other chemicals drives me up the wall.

If they told you that salad you ate (just veggies, no dressing or anything) was high in carbs and therefore bad for you would you no longer eat salads? No! You'd call them stupid (in your head) cause you know better than them, in that it's full of that good shit (vitamins)  Same thing with the Gatorade. It has that good shit (vitamins and added bonus of salts), both of which you need. A little preservatives for a food that has good shit and you enjoy makes it totally worth it  So don't let them take a safe food away from you cause they don't know what they're talking about. ESPECIALLY if you enjoy it",False,False
