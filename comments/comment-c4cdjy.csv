I'm thinking like the deli section where they have prepackaged salads or precut veggies with little hummus cups. Things like that. Would you be able to keep food down if you bought just a single yogurt cup and maybe one or two of your favorite fruits?  I know shopping can be so triggering and all of a sudden you're compulsively buying everything, so apologies if my suggestion was super obvious or if you're looking to vent more than get advice from randos, but yeah. I feel you and I wish you at least one small success this evening :)",False,False
