I love the smell as its brewing, I love when I'm bringing the cup to my mouth and anticipating each sip, I love the moment that wonderful taste (I like flavored coffee), hits my tongue, and I love the way it feels going down my throat and ultimately my stomach.  The best part is that it can fill me up, and speed up my metabolism at the same time.  My favorite flavor is peanut butter coffee, so this way I can still drink something with a peanut butter flavor, yet have 0 calories except for when I add cream. I usually drink about 10 cups a day.",False,False
