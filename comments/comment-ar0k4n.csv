I believe this is also why the cause of brain fog.  BMR doesn't decrease by a lot though. I don't remember exactly but I wanna say it's like 10%. and it is not a permanent change. your BMR will return to normal when your body is no longer in a state of starvation.  so basically, yes your metabolism slows when you're starving. but not by a lot, and it certainly will not cause you to GAIN weight, or for ""every calorie to stick to your body"" that's all a myth. you'll just lose weight a tad more slowly because your body doesn't wanna die.",False,False
