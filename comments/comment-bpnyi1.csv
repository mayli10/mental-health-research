I know it's frustrating, and losing weight would be less maddening if it were linear but it's not.... I would always plateau for a week to TEN DAYS and then suddenly whoosh down several pounds.  The Whoosh is real. Just be patient and try to be kind with yourself.  CICO does work, it's just not always a nice even staircase down.   : )",False,False

Weight loss is infuriatingly nonlinear. Like, Iâ€™ve been at a massive deficit and the scale didnâ€™t move for 6 freaking days. (Heck, I fasted for 4 days a couple weeks ago and it went down a whopping 0.2 lb.) The scale finally went down a little yesterday, but no movement again today. Argh. In the long run, things do mostly seem to shake out, but the waiting and uncertainty suck.",False,False

I'm 163(5'5) and I lost a little over 2 kg with eating under 1000 cals, some days also under 800. I eat all of my calories, I only drink water, I do not exercise but I only eat once a day. Omad is the way to go. Maybe you're counting your calories wrong...? Do not beat yourself up.",False,False
