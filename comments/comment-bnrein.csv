You take it daily and I noticed no obvious physical effects, but it gradually helped reduce my constant moderate anxiety. So, it’s more slow-burn assistance for GAD than the powerful PRN short-term help from benzos. Depending on your anxiety symptoms it may or may not be a good candidate. I did try benzos too, but weirdly they would calm my physical symptoms without calming my frantically obsessing mind, so they just weren’t a good fit for me. Wishing you the best of luck on your journey!",False,False

You have given me hope. :-)        As for Buspirone, can it be as immediate/effective as Xanax for anxiety? Ideally, I'd like a non-addictive anti-anxiety med or supplement that can work ""on a dime,"" without the addictive qualities.       Again, thank you, I needed to hear all this.",False,True

I’m down to just one med (for sleep) now, and I don’t feel like those thousands of pills had any permanent effect. I feel like ‘myself’. - Developing a strong support system and targeting the best nutrition you can seem like really excellent ideas, separate from the question of meds. For one thing, meds often take weeks to become effective. For another, meds at best gave me maybe a 20% boost...they didn’t do anything magical or fix my underlying issues. They just made it easier for me to do the necessary therapy work. (I was super angry for a long time that there was no quick, low-effort fix...but there wasn’t, at least not for me.)",False,False
