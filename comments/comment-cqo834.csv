I always wait too long to break my daily IF and sometimes I’m literally shaking as I’m cooking &amp; I have to talk myself through it... but sometimes I let myself have a few bites of Halo Top right before I cook, which makes me marginally less shaky.   Salmon + pico de gallo sounds amazing! It reminds me of how I make fake “sushi” (I gave up raw fish because of health problems)... smoked salmon + avocado + a little splash of soy sauce.",False,False

I used to fuck all my fingers up on mandoline slicers all the time from restriction. Not fun. I love having things really fresh but I often meal prep in the morning when I have the most energy now. :/  Have you been using good knife technique? If not now sounds like a perfect time to check it out for some harm reduction in the future!",False,False
