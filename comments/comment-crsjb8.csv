However, for the 500lb person, they have a lot of weight to lose and can do this safely by fasting. Ofc it isn't for everyone, but with the supervision of a doctor and the proper supplements, it's alright.",False,False

Disordered eating is engaging in irregular and unhealthy eating habits *without* the mental components of an eating disorder. A non-ED person can fast or overexercise or whatever on occasion, it doesn‚Äôt mean they have an ED but it also isn‚Äôt healthy. Plenty of people damage themselves with their diet and have no ED to speak of, just as plenty of people with ED‚Äôs maintain a healthy physical state throughout the course of their disorder.   I just can‚Äôt get behind saying it‚Äôs fine to deprive oneself of food pretty much ever. Fasting has become the new crappy fad diet.

I'm not going to call that disordered eating or wrong or bad. Even if they fast for days.  Ehhh but we‚Äôd say someone who is 100lbs shouldn‚Äôt do that. It‚Äôs also pretty likely that lack of regular and nutritious meals contributed to this in one capacity or another. I don‚Äôt think anyone can truly say someone got to 500lbs without some disordered habits.   &gt;I agree with the idea that our bodies weren't meant to have access to food 24/7 &amp; make out life an all you can eat buffet lol it makes sense to me to have times of feast vs fast.   Do you not believe that human biology has evolved a bit in the thousands of years since the introduction of agriculture?   &gt;To give our bodies time to digest and use what we store.  This is fluid. Our bodies use what we store as we move through our lives. Fasting doesn‚Äôt affect that process; it just doesn‚Äôt replace what we use. Which is why fasting makes most people feel like garbage.,False,False
