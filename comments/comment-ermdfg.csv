I have an IRL friend with bulimia whose parents are also just so normal with food it confuses us both. Like at least in my childhood things were actually fucked up wrt food to put a pin on it.   I think the worldy/variety part is something I could work on. How did she react when *you* spoke about her/your/someone else's body? My kid cannot stop talking about mine sometimes and I try so hard to remain [neutral](https://youtu.be/ussCHoQttyQ) cauae I feel that overpositivity is possibly as bad as being overtly negative? In Sara Pascoe's bool Animal she talks about how her mum was constantly down on her own body and Jesus it broke my heart a bit.",False,False

And I'll admit, I'm a step parent now who desperately wants to do the same, but it's hard. Now that I have this perspective, I realize no one is perfect.  To summarize... She never commented on her own body or mine or anyone else's. She made a well-rounded dinner nearly each weekday and we sat down together as a family to eat, kept healthy food in the house, as well as treats that we had soft limits on. She cooked good food from across the world, took us to different restaurants. Food was an experience as well as nourishment. Maybe it wasn't enough, but I can't figure out where she went wrong.",False,False

Both of my parents seem to land somewhere on the binge eating disorder spectrum, my Dad moreso than my Mom. My Mom has been throwing herself into various health fads for as long as I can remember. Off the top of my head, I remember her doing: WW, Jenny Craig, South Beach, Atkins, the Abs Diet, the Beyonce juice cleanse, Slimfast, P90X, TurboJam, Tae Bo, and literally everything Oprah ever recommended. And we, her daughters, saw and internalized every bit of this, especially the parts of it she tried to hide. After she finished reading The Abs Diet book, I snuck it into my backpack so I could read it at school. I distinctly remember coming home from middle school and stealing the TurboJam DVDs so I could work out in secret in my room before she got home — and this was looooong after she’d abandoned that program. She never encouraged me to pick up any of those things. But I did. And it shaped a lot of how I thought about food and about my body at a very fragile time.   Anyway, I guess my point is that the only way to really teach your kids good food habits is to *have good food habits*, because kids are sponges and they’ll model you. Which I know is horrifying, because we’re both here and thus have awful habits, but ... yeah.",False,False

I've had friends and supportive pro-recovery group chats online but never met anyone supportive and positive within the ED community IRL. recently one of my closest friends and I just sat down and talked and I found out that she had recovered from an ED before high school and it felt so validating and relieving to have someone be in a similar mindset to me and actually understand everything.,False,False
