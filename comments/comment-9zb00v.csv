It angers me because the extreme before photo compounds the misconception that only when a person's body looks like these physical extremes of malnutrition do they have an eating disorder and require treatment.   Especially, I do believe all these people know that seeing these images is triggering to ED sufferers, because they've been there, and yet they continue to post them for their own satisfaction. If you personally wish to Share your ED recovery/ experience, it should be to help other people in their struggles, or to educate non sufferers.   On both these counts, the photos must not be included, just as weights or measurements should not. It is my potentially unpopular opinion that these people are not fully recovered and still seek validation through their bodies, albeit a photograph of them some time ago, and several pounds different in weight.   The consumption and popularity of such media posts only harms that person more, since they receive the message that their body is still the way to gain attention/ validation.  I've seen people that I have been in hospital with post these types of posts and I often have to restrain myself from messaging them in anger, I want to tell them. We weren't allowed to wear revealing clothing in hospital incase our underweight bodies triggered others, so why the fuck would it be appropriate to broadcast your photos of your lowest weight, knowing full well that a vast majority of your media followers are friends made in treatment.

I remember the hashtag #boycottthebefore.  I don't get triggered but I know a huge amount of people with EDs do (or else there wouldn't be the hashtag thing).    I agree that it reinforces the misconception that you can only be eating disordered if you look like a coat hanger.  It's good people are proud of their recovery, but I don't think it's necessary to post befores.    &amp;#x200B;",False,False

I've had experiences where people in my life did not take me seriously about my ED and the boundaries I was literally *begging* them to respect until, as a last resort, I show them pictures of myself about 15 lbs above my LW (I deleted all the pics of myself at my actual LW whilst in recovery). Then they realise, oh this is serious, but honestly I should NOT have to do that in the first place.",False,False

I also get this extreme feeling of guilt when I immediately see them in their disorder and think they looked better at a lower weight. I don’t actually like the look of bones at all but I do prefer a lower weight on a girl. 105 at 5’7 doesn’t look scary skinny or scary bony to me. It looks healthy if the girl has muscle tone.  I feel guilty thinking her face and body looked better in her “before recovery” weight and thinking she looks worse recovered at her healthy weight.   It’s usually when I see girls who are very pretty at a lower weight. One person I think of at this moment is Demi Lovato before she gained the weight while in recovery. Yes she’s a beautiful girl at any weight but I personally felt she looked so much better aesthetically at her sick weight and that makes me feel guilty but I can’t help it.  ,False,False
