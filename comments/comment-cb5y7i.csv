My eating disorder got the worst when I first seriously dedicated myself to regular exercise. If you find the right sides of both communities (good health advice and supportive rather than tipping ed community) you can totally do it!   I believe in you and you can totally do this! I hope that you stick to your goals whatever they are so long as they make you healthy and happy. ❤️,False,False

I impulsed bought some home work out program thing.  I'm watching some videos and im like im not sure about this anymore.  Then my mind goes which one is easier.. starving yourself or getting up and doing something.  So i leaned to starving myself.. then i look in the mirror and just be so grossed out that i want to build muscle and look fit but i dont want that either..  Maybe i maintain but i don't want to get gain weight in anyway.  I actually spent my entire day thinking of this shit.,False,False
