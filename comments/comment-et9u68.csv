I wish that I was someone who didn't, but I guess that some people need attention and love more than others and that's okay üòå I'm not dumb and pathetic for wanting people to care about me and support me!!!!",False,True

It feel like such an attention seeker when I tell people about my problems so instead I keep silent and try to become thin so that people start to worry aS IF THAT ISN'T ATTENTION SEEKING BEHAVIOUR???",False,True

I recently had a convo about it with my therapist and I said something like ‚Äúmaybe I should stop talking with him about food because I was getting a weird thrill out of his concern‚Äù and he was like, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just what it‚Äôs like to feel cared for... ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø ‚Äú",False,False

My parents only really ever praised me when I did well in school or played my clarinet well. When I went to college and no longer got great grades, they stopped praising me and became ccritical of me. I thought losing weight would make them care again but it didn‚Äôt work. My mom is now dead and I don‚Äôt know what is holding me back from recovery now...I‚Äôve always been self sufficient and stoic, so maybe it‚Äôs wanting to be disabled and unable to work. Or something. I‚Äôm just really messed up I think.",False,False

This just made me realize the reason for my Ed. Sure, I use it to cope with life stressors,but I always knew there was a deeper reason for my ED and I couldn't ever pinpoint it no matter how hard I tried. I just want to be noticed.   My whole life I've felt overshadowed by other people, disposable, and insignificant. I'm the ""extra"" friend. My parents swoon over my little sister when she has a problem, yet tease me for being over emotional when I'm having a rough day.   I've constantly been compared to other people my entire life and I've never felt a sense of individuality. And I wish so, so, so bad someone would care about me. I wish so bad my family would ask me ""are you okay?""  And my brain just tells me that the only way that can happen, is if I'm underweight, then they will notice. And I think it's true.",False,False

I mean, I use a lot of self depricating humor but I close others off from how bad my mental health is. My brand of isolation is almost aggressive, friends won't hear from me in months as I silently self destruct in a corner.   And yet, sometimes I do wonder if I want someone to worry. The idea of someone commenting on my habits is mortifying, but at times I also fantasize about people commenting on it. I'm afraid of reaching out because I'm afraid of rejection or looking like an attention seeker, but if I were 90 lbs people might take my other illnesses more seriously. I don't know.",False,False

It's a tough one but gaining it will help you move forward and learn to find the confirmation of love that you need (which EVERYONE needs) in a healthy way. You're not alone feeling like this. If you're anything like me you're a bit more than slightly embarrassed about this need (I used to think I was pathetic for wanting attention) but reality is, that all humans need love and attention.

I mean, my mother does love me and care for me as in she wants the best for me and wants me to be --happy-- but not the extent that she wants to ask me how I'm truly doing. According to her my life is perfect, I have perfect genes, perfect family, good looks, everything is alright, and I have nothing failing me. But I think that it's the truth she wants to see because she wants to see her daughter as this good girl with perfect grades, perfect health, perfect looks, perfect life etc. And it's probably too scary to look underneath all that --perfection-- and ask what I'm truly feeling because she probably knows, from her own experience, that life is tough and she wasn't the best parent and I had a lot of struggles and there's probably a lot to talk about.   The first time I opened to a psychologist about my eating I had the EXACT same reaction as you. She looked genuinely concerned and taken aback and during the last session with her she was REALLY pushing me to get more help and asked me two times: ""you WILL seek help right? Right?"" with a concerned look and like üòéüòéüòé that was exactly what my attention deprived ass wanted and it made me feel so good. Now I've gone to higher level of care and had my first meeting with a psychologist this week. Next meeting is the 20th of february and I kinda want starve myself so that she gets more concerned for me ü§™ü§™ü§™.

I always feel completely invalidated for even thinking it, because I would say that I was cared for deeply by my parents, but you wrote this -  ""She was more concerned with my outside - if I was smart, successful, got good grades, looked thin and beautiful, behaved well, was funny, charismatic, etc"" - and this is the explanation I needed. We rarely, if ever, talk about feelings. They're not a factor in my life, according to my parents.   I got some weird sick satisfaction from telling my counsellor and therapist this week about my current eating habits, because they showed genuine concern. Honestly, I think that's all I'm looking for. I replay those moments over and over again and feel so ashamed that it's got to this.",False,False
