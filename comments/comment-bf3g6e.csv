So glad it's a wholesome post instead!   Tbh baby food eaten by adults is becoming way more normalized. Especially the cereal and little yogurt bite snacks. Dieters, health conscious people and of course ED crowd are starting to realize many snacks for babies are way healthier, lower calorie, less processed and/or simpler ingredients because every parent wants the best for their babies. Wouldn't be surprised to see brands start selling essentially the same products marketed towards dieting adults in the near future.",False,False
