I can relate, on a small scale, to some of what you feel now. I haven't suffered with my ED as long as you and I'm so sorry it's been your life for so long, but I definitely  feel the stupidity of my past-self.",False,False

When I compare life and social media and everything I know now to what I did back then, I'm not sure if I'm relieved to have grown up in a darker age, or wistful that I didn't have today's knowledge and technology at my disposal. I'm almost 30 now, and while I cringe looking back, I also had no fucking clue what my life would look like at my current age, or that the worst parts of my eating disorder were still yet to come. I'm finally thin, but it's not how I thought it would be and my life is pretty damn empty because of it.  I hope I'm not coming across as a pathetic old woman right now, though I certainly feel it. Just, 2007 anorexia. Wow, we were idiots. I was an idiot.",False,False

Then: sneaky-sneak 2007 anorexic, hiding food, pretending to be recovering while relapsing  Now: straight out telling my therapist I won't maintain recovery because I have zero fucks left to give  Then: yogurt and protein bars were safe foods  Now: I'd probably have a panic attack if I had to eat a Luna Bar rn  Then: spend 40 bucks on halo top and powdered peanut butter  Now: intense guilt if I spend too much on myself bc this bitch only deserves the cheapest shit  Then: (slightly underweight) thinking I was actually starting to look okay, wow I'm pretty thin huh, golly I kinda like my body  Now: (""extreme"" anorexic BMI by DSM-5 standards) wow I wasn't even that sick, why did I need to go to treatment, I could've lost more, how does someone look like such a fatass while they're literally dying of starvation?

Then: restricting all the time with no end in sight; having a bad day and binging out of control.   Now: restricting on a schedule with a pre-planned binge; never losing control.    Then: weird superstitions around foods, like never eating anything coloured  white and thinking fettuccini Alfredo was a safe food.   Now: owning a food scale and understanding how calories work.    Then: feeling defeated and panicked if I got tired while trying to work out; quitting after a couple of minutes because I wasnâ€™t a super athlete already.   Now: understanding that building strength and fitness takes time and that I can improve incrementally while still burning calories and trying to improve my cardiovascular health.     Then: spending hours and hours staring at myself in the mirror and taking photos of my body, judging and critiquing and hating myself, pinching fat bits and telling myself how worthless I was.   Now: feeling much happier and healthier in my body, examining parts of myself but not dwelling on it, rarely succumbing to negative thoughts about being disgusting.  ",False,False
