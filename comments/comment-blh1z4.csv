This may not work every time and this may not work at all for you but a couple things I do to break out of a binge cycle is 1) try my absolute best to eat at or near maintenance. Dont tell your brain you need to restrict to ""fix"" things- for me, thi causes me to panic once again and only bingemore, because part of my binging is from a panic of how it was when I was little, some days you dont know if you get another meal. 2) try not to feel bad for eating something unhealthy. If you are craving say, chocolate, give yourself permission to eat chocolate. Tell your brain, ""in 20 minutes, if we still want chocolate, we can have ""xyz"" chocolate and ""x"" amount of it."" Before you eat it, tell your brain, hey we get to have some, don't worry, and tell your brain, we will have it at x o clock and we will have this much and this kind. Sometimes that helps me to eat an amount that would be considered part of a balanced diet.  I dont really have any other tips, but please do your best to practice self care. Have a nice bath, or go out and buy a small lovely non food treat (so you do not trigger another binge) and be gentle with yourself. Your eating disorder may be trying to convince you that you are bad for binging- it is wrong. One thing I see on this sub occasionally is that if stress is causing you to binge, try to just allow it to happen. Give yourself some grace, say, ""it's okay to temporarily find comfort in food"" d remind yourself that NO weight gain has to be permanent.   I'm so sorry you're struggling, I hope at least something helps, DM me if need be",False,False
