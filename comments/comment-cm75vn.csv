They are probably questioning you because many with an ED struggle with compulsive exercising. If you are lifting more than 2 hours a day, you should reevaluate your routine and if its healthful for you. If it is genuinely helpful, you should offer to your friends to cone to the gym with you once, and to come to your house/ apartment/ where you live after to see how your recovery process is going.   Also, you should inform them that lifting can help improve bone density, which is something that can be easily damaged by AN.   Either way, props to you for the lifting. Most of us with EDs are very cardio based. I think the lifting alone should signal to your friends you arent trying to get skinny, but toned (maybe straight up muscular) and Healthy.  If it would he helpful, feel free to screenshot this and send it to your friends.",False,False
