The thing is, these comments are a big deal and they stick with you. I'm the smallest weight I've ever been and 10 lbs under my original goal weight and even now I think about the comments my family (and friends and teachers) have made to me throughout my developing years and they still contribute to my ED greatly. It's like people don't realize how their words can affect you for your entire life.",False,False

Please bear in mind that not everyone understands what we go through, and my family do shit like this all the time, because it's just their shit sense of humour. There's nothing here to suggest that OP's dad is abusive (an asshole maybe or maybe not), so seriously calm down on these sort of comments because people who actually have abusive parents / family figures suffer.

For the record I was 17 then and 34 now (ugh) and it still haunts me. Hit my lowest weight at 19 yrs old and of course I never let him know how that comment hurt me, because when I was at my worst I could tell he was hurting too.   *Me eating a candy bar.* (pretty sure it was a Milky Way and I fucking hate those candy bars too, but I wanted sugar?)   Dad: You’re gonna be fat if you keep eating like that.   I still have no idea if he was joking or what, but I was def messed in the head enough to take it completely to heart and clearly still bother me today. Granted he died when I was 28, so that’s part of it.   Either way. It sucks how bad some comments just can’t be unheard or unsaid and always linger.",False,False
