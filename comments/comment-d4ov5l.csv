First of all, i believe that in Halseys case it could easily be her bipolar disorder. Idk if she is on medication or not but being manic would explain it better than abusing a certain medication and even if not: painting is such a process which has the potential to pull u in completely.

I dont know about emma chamberlain but dont forget that some people just do have very upbeat and overly energetic personalities? Just a theory  Anyways, have a good day",False,False
