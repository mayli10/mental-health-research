I was fat, now I'm not. For me, 200 was a decent weight. That put me at the high end of healthy body fat percentage. But I can keep going. And I did. Below 180 I'm exhausted all the time, but I still managed to get to less than 170. I'm thrilled every time I see a lower weight.",False,False

It really ruins my mood when the number goes up, even when I know I ate up to maintenance cals and didn’t gain actual weight. But fuck when the number goes down, yeeeees.   It truly is an addiction. I remember restricting heavily or fasting and going to bed early bc I was so excited to lose weight in the morning.",False,False

Great fun.",False,False
