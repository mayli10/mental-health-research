It’s always better to have these conversations in person but it’s obviously harder to do it that way. If you really feel like you need to text him I would consolidate what you want to say by a lot, maybe send one or two paragraphs and then let him respond. This helps because 1) if he’s u supportive you haven’t given him the whole story and won’t feel as vulnerable. 2) it gives him a chance to ask questions and start a conversation rather than being handed all the info at once",False,False

I think this is more something to discuss in person for the first time and not via txt. I hope that is helpful to you. It’s just that I’ve got a lot of years on me and have been around this block a few times.,False,False
