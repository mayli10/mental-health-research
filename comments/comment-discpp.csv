Weight and color are two different things. Sure some races might be more genetically incline to hold more weight, but no race is naturally at 300lb. Unless you are over 6ft or a weight lifter, 300lb just isn’t reasonable. And if you want everyone to stand together, maybe you shouldn’t call people “heroin chics”.

I have been underweight and overweight and every weight in between I have never had a doctor consider when I was overweight that I might have an ED. When I was prescribed depression medication a few years ago and overweight my psychiatrist said and it is a good medication for weight loss. Guess what about 2 years before that I was at a BMI of 15.5. When I was at that low BMI I got prraised all the time because I was the fat kid that lost a ton of weight and I have a big bone structure and was working out all the time I got praised for being in shape. Since I was a fat kid that lost all of the weight any time I have ever gained weight I get called out and no one in my life ever even thought to ask if I might not be eating enough when I lose weight fast and become underweight.

Maybe I am blind but I have not seen media massively portrait obesity as a beauty standard, nor major fashion brands use obese women as their preferred models for runways or photo-shoots for decades.  The fashion industry likes unattainable beauty standards because they profit from our insecurities.   &gt; Doesn’t telling a “heroin chic” to gain some weight make them feel like shit too?  I never said that it doesn't. All type of body shaming is bad. But you can't compare the frequency at which fat shaming happens in comparison to the ""eat a burger"" ones. One is systemic. Is like comparing ""omg you are a ghost"" (that I got all my life) with actual racism.       &gt;The whole fat acceptance movement just sounds hypocritical to me.  It is not fat acceptance, the movement is BODY POSITIVISTY. And is based in the simple  concept that everyone deserves love, respect and to be happy in their skin regardless of how they look. Sure some people go the extra to say fat is beautiful, but is just a punch back to the fat shaming. In no moment they are ignoring that obesity can increase your risk for diseases. But you know what is worse than being fat, constantly yoyo dieting. Stable weight even if it is high on the spectrum is better than constant efforts to loose weight and gain it back, and this is a scientific fact.      Both types of body shaming is bad, any type of body shaming is bad. But kicking down obese people to bring attention to the skinny shaming is not the way. We stand and we fight together.  More so lets stop pretending or even suggesting that ""we have it worse"" than fat shaming because that is just ignorant and insensitive. Fat shaming and fat phobia is fucking systematic, look at the [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8014833), look at the prove of society bias and even medical bias against fat people, they are deemed as lazy, unattractive unhealthy and guilty of their own problems. There is people that die because their doctors dismiss their pain or issues as ""you just have to loose weight"" or ""is just indigestion"" when they actually have a congenital heard condition or appendicitis.  The amount of violence they experience from health providers is not something we experience. The discrimination in the work pool, I talk about being rejected for a job because you are fat, is not something we experience. Shaming comments are nasty, but fatphobia is way more than that.",False,False

This is not to say that all people covet thin bodies, or that those with an ED are doing so purely for vanity.   EDs are just another manifestation of mental illness, but people like to shoehorn us into this awful intersection - ""You wouldn't be so miserable if we hadn't idolized lithe celebrities, you poor dear who is so weak willed that you fell into this trap."". No, fuckwad, I'd find some other way to be miserable. This shit just is NOT HELPING. It seems so infantilizing while people who feign concern are doing so to mend their own guilty conscience.   &amp;#x200B;  I have a lot of incoherent angry feelings about it.  &amp;#x200B;  As for obesity not being stigmatized so hard, it's simple - food feels good.

As a society, thin people, especially women, have been the beauty standard for many decades. So it’s okay to make fun of the UW chick because she’s skinny and that makes her life “easier” and more “valid” to society.

Maybe it's related to how society perceives the solution... For example, a normal-weight or overweight person sees someone who's UW and thinks to themselves, *It's so easy for me to eat and gain weight. If they didn't want to be made fun of for being UW, they could just eat and gain a little weight* (insert Elle Woods: What, like it's hard?)*. Plus, I'm sure people tell her she's pretty all the time. She'll be fine.*  Whereas if a normal-weight or overweight person sees someone who's overweight, they may think, *It's so hard for me to lose weight; it must be hard for that person too. Maybe they have some sort of condition or just can't help it. They've probably been made fun of, and I can relate to their struggle.*  idk",False,True
