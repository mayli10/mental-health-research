This is isn't just a holiday thing...he always buys and cooks amounts of food that no one living here could ever possibly want or need, but the holidays are just that much more excessive.  He gets irritated when the food doesn't get eaten despite being told over and over by his family that if he doesn't want so much leftover food then don't make/buy so much.  I cannot go into the kitchen without him giving me a detailed rundown of what food is currently available and pressure to eat it.  Last night I just wanted to grab a small clementine and he expressed his pleasure that I was getting my appetite back and urged me to have some of 3 pies he baked that are still sitting in the fridge from Christmas.  Then he said when i fly home they will have to ""weigh me instead of my luggage.""  I don't know what sort of hilarious joke he thought that was but I just gave him a blank look and walked away.  He's repeatedly been asked not to make comments about how much or how little I'm eating but my boyfriend said it's pointless because he corrects the behavior for a short while and then just forgets.
