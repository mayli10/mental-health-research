My period coming back because I gained weight, making me feel fatter and less feminine (again, logic)   My mum saying I was too thin because I didn't feel thin so I felt like a fraud   Disappointing grades because that somehow made me feel fat  Strangely enough I was most easily triggered at my LW and restricting the most. When I'm in a b/p phase I become numb to even the rudest comments",False,False

I don't consider that dumb at all, that's really very understandable!  Personally my saddest thing is getting triggered by art that's not even a realistic portrayal of the human body. Giacometti is a trigger bc I'm legit that dumb lol",False,False
