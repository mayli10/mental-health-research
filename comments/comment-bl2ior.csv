Energy doesnâ€™t come from nowhere and you donâ€™t get energy for free. Especially if youâ€™re already at a normal or low BMI,False,False

I don't know what people are talking about when they say fasting makes them feel ""sharp"", it makes me feel stupid and tired and cranky and unproductive. I was never a big TV person until I started restricting, and was suddenly too tired to play video games in the evenings. I'd rather put on the TV and stare blankly at for a few hours it until it's an acceptable time to go to bed.  Then if/when I inevitably binge or give up and try to eat maintenance, I'm shocked by the sudden burst of energy and optimism!  I guess that makes sense, if you were a wild animal and food was scarce (say, in winter) it would make sense for the body to want to move less and sleep more to conserve energy.",False,False

It is easy to forget to drink enough water when you are fasting (because you need a lot more than when you are eating) and dehydration can make you VERY sleepy and not feeling well.,False,False
