I know that at first my team tried to get me to eat at maintenance and the bloating and pain that came with it caused me to relapse very hard so they took a more gentle approach. Anyways, I'm proud of you for getting through a rough time like that. I hope your recovery goes as smoothly as recovery can &lt;3",False,True
