I can't assume anything, but problems like this do come up when changes happen. If you have a close relationship, possibly ask her how she has been feeling while you have been gone. Don't immediately go into her eating habits, but see if she opens up to what has been bothering her, since this seems like a recent development. She could also be in a depressed state where her appetite is low and her eating less isn't intentional. Either way, she's struggling with something. If you are comfortable with this and have this kind of relationship with her, see if she can open up to you about the problem.  &amp;#x200B;  It's good that you notice these things. It shows that you care and want the best for those around you. That's a wonderful thing. As for you personally coping with this, I'm not sure as to what has helped you recover in the past, but revisit things that have worked before. You can't control how she is feeling. You can't control her relationship with food or the reason for her behavior. Please, try not to dwell on the things that you can't control. I know more than anyone else that this is hard to do, but trying just a little to affirm that helps. What you can control is your response. You have worked hard for a long time to fight this disorder. You have the strength to overcome this. Prove to yourself that you have defeated this before, and you can defeat it again. And, if you can, prove to your mom that she can defeat this, too.",False,False

A growing teen likely needs even more. So comparing your mom to your sister is just never going to be accurate.   Also, it's just really hard to accurately gauge how much someone needs, and you know there are a lot of ways to get and burn calories.",False,False
