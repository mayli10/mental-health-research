And by paralysis, I mean paralysis of your happiness, your sense of peace, your self-worth. Whoever this girl is who allegedly said this is petty AF, and clearly has her own demons. But, the chance that it was somehow misconstrued somehow is all too real. The only facts that are known with 100% certainty is that The Bride asked YOU to be one of her chosen bridesmaids, presumably based on the history of your friendship (seriously, trust me, I have been a bridesmaid too many times to even count...in EVERY wedding party, there's always at least some manufactured scandal! She asked you because you matter, don't overthink it).  As much as I am all for justice and standing up for ourselves when wrongly called out, I will say that when I was about 24-25, I was probably the ugliest bridesmaid of a group of 7 girls from one of my high school BFFs. One of the prettier ones happened to be the girl who bullied me, rather relentlessly, I might add, 1st through 10th grades. By that time though, I was in law school and was consumed by that. So when it came time for the bach party and even the wedding itself, I was too preoccipied by all of that to even worry about what some random chick from my hometown thought of me, even though I did obviously feel some level of residual insecurity and resentment. Well, the wedding happened without a hitch, and what do you know...bitch started following me on social media soon after, even commenting on some of my posts! She still follows me now, your post inspired me to check! So, basically, my point is, you just never know, and as shitty as it is for these rumors to have been started, however they may have come about, but I straight guarantee you that you will feel better years later knowing you did right by your friend in showing class and style by brushing it off and feigning an inability to be riled... Just my two cents! (Source: walked out on a wedding where the bride was being a bitch; friendship lost forever and now we're both sad about it but are both too stubborn to do anything aside from IG hearting pictures of each other's kids being born or beloved dogs dying...you don't want to your friendship to go down like that.   TL/DR: As low as Anonymous Bride/Bridal Party Bitch Goes, Go 10X  Higher.  (ALSO, I have a hooded sweatshirt from one bachelorette party that was CUSTOM emblazoned for me, with the words, ""This Bitch Needs One Too.)"" Hahahhaa, sooooo, yeah, I'm def a Subject Matter Expert in this arena!!!)",False,False

At least in that situation I didnâ€™t really know this girl. Sucks that itâ€™s supposedly a friend. People get real weird with wedding stuff. Sorry youâ€™re going through this.,False,False

Iâ€™ve narrowed it down to one of two people. Both vehemently deny it so Iâ€™m kind of stuck. Only one really has a motive to get me out of the wedding but the other seems like the type to make up stuff like that for a reaction.   Weâ€™ve all been friends for so long Iâ€™m just trying to get past it and chalk it up to people saying mean shit when theyâ€™re drinking and they just assumed obviously because Iâ€™m chubby now and used to be thin that OF COURSE I hate how I look.   Another possibility is that the bride asked too many people to be bridesmaids and was looking for the weakest link to cut and someone suggested me for these reasons.   I really appreciate your kind words, thank you!",False,True

But... fact is that someone, and we don't know who, either wants to make you feel awful or doesn't want you there... for whatever reason. Could you imagine who did that? One of the other bridesmaids? Or could it be the bride? I remember another post about something like that in another sub where it turned out, that the bride didn't want her there, but did't want to tell her directly so she started rumors and lied to everyone about it, until everyone found out during the wedding.     But no matter who it was... you really should find out who it was to cut them out of your life... This is just so mean and this person shouldn't be allowed to mess with your feelings this way. I hope you don't lose your self-esteem  because of this weird girl :(",False,False
