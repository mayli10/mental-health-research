What has been working for me though is just telling myself that even if I binge, that is in the past-- I dont have to account for those extra calories because I would only be hurting myself in the process. Eating protein filled meals/snacks every 3 hours or so has also helped with keeping me full and preventing me from binging in general.   &amp;#x200B;  It's difficult and you may not succeed right away, so please don't get discouraged if slip-ups occur! Victories are victories, no matter how small they may be. :) I believe in you friend!!",False,False
