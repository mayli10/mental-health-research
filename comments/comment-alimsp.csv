I get the feeling that if we asked you to elaborate on this, some disordered thinking would start leaking out.  &gt; When I do eat itâ€™s only because my stomach gives me nausea and I feel like passing out from exhaustion  Red flag.  &gt; outside of gender dysphoria, which I think is different  There can be a lot of overlap for some people.  &gt; not having an appetite ever and not enjoying food  Red flag.",False,False

For example, ARFID - Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder. You may or may not have this, but it's an example of ED that has nothing to do with body image or deliberate self-harm.   People with ARFID tend to be extremely picky eaters, for one reason or another. It's commonly comorbid with autism, and in those cases, stems from sensory issues with food. It's also commonly related to anxiety and OCD. But for whatever reason, people with ARFID have a very short list of foods they are willing to eat, and would rather go without than eat anything not on the list. This becomes a clinical problem when it leads to nutritional deficiencies and/or significant weight loss, or is significantly interfering with one's psycho-social health. (Which is why it's most commonly diagnosed in children.)  ARFID has nothing to do with body image, mood, trauma, self-esteem, control issues, coping mechanisms, or any of the other things that anorexia and bulimia are all about. But it's still an eating disorder. ",False,False
