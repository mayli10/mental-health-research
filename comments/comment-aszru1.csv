But I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd try talking to her. Find out what's going on. Make sure she's eating. Or when she comes over, make lunch. See if she even tries to eat at all. But above all, talk to her and support her.  Talk to her more. She may be suffering a number of issues right now. And she may be depressed and need someone to talk to. Even if it's just texting or phone calls since you're busy. Maybe pry a little bit and see why she's so into running so hardcore.. Is it cause it helps her be ""fit""? Is it cause she likes the escape? Cause it helps her focus?   But it kinda sounds like she's got anorexia or bulimia. Or perhaps isn't eating due to poverty or an abusive family? Perhaps starving herself due to depression?  Do you know how her home life is? Sometimes it's hard to tell because abusive parents may not look abusive from a third party perspective..   And if it is anorexia or bulimia, that's not your fault really. It can happen to anyone.. Our society holds it very high to look pretty, to be skinny. It's so ingrained in our culture but it's all fake. The photos of celebrities are photoshopped and airbrushed. They aren't REAL. And thats hard for normal people like us to understand after we've been bombarded with being told to look like celebrities  or even being called ""fat"" by a bully in highschool. Anorexia/bulimia are mental disorders. And they can lead to severe medical problems. The people who have them honestly think they're still fat even though they are just skin and bones. They look in the mirror and see fat and ugly. They don't see beauty.  Remind her she's beautiful no matter what. Compliment her attitude towards things. And if you find out she's depressed, perhaps try and push her towards talking to a professional. If  you find out she's suicidal by any means, please report it to try and get her the proper care. She may not like you if you have to get her committed for her own good. But it may be something that saves her life.  Why do you think this is your fault though? I don't understand that part.",False,False
