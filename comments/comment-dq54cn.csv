Consistency. And probably a lot more strength and stamina than you realize. Even if the result isn't immediate and obvious weight loss, exercise (in general) is a good thing. You're making your body work, keeping your muscles alive, keeping your heart pumping. I'm REALLY proud of you.   Binging and overeating might be something best talked to a therapist about. Also, keeping up the gym routine might help you get the mental clarity you need to find a healthier happier approach to food rather than a disordered one.",False,False

Try upping your daily calories by like 200-300 and see if you're still binging. Seems counter intuitive but by properly fueling you should be able to combat the binges. Also, check out r/loseit.",False,False
