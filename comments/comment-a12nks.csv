The week after proed got banned was one of my worst and longest dissociative episodes. I JUST snapped out of it yesterday. Fucking hell. It was so god damn terrifying and I know that losing proed forever felt like the straw that broke the camels back. It was like someone took my last lifeline then dumped me in the ocean to drown.  I don’t think I can survive another episode like that. I think either my mind will nope out for good next time, or I just won’t be able to take it anymore and kms :/ fuck sorry for being depressing af. I was trying to let you know that I can relate and that you’re not alone but that might’ve made you feel worse haha",False,False

I just lost my mom to cancer. I've been eating way too much of all the wrong foods and feeling so sick. I went to check proed and it was gone. I'm just now coming to terms with my history being whipped. I was part of that sub from right near the beginning. I started this account shortly after my father was taken by cancer. I'm seriously so lost right now. I feel sick and angry but mostly lost. ,False,False
