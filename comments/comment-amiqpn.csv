Although it feels good in the moment remembering how you feel after usually gives me some motivation. Do you have a go to outlet like writing or music when you feel like bingeing? Although it won’t 100% make those feelings go away it might take up enough of your time until the urge somewhat passes enough for you to feel stronger ❤️,False,False
