They are generally not judgmental and if they are it’s like one of the few times it’s appropriate to tell a professional to fuck off :) but really, they can help you find your limits and address your weaknesses. And have fun running! It’s my least favorite hobby that I truly love!",False,False

They will be able to review your bone density and any other issues as well as recommend resources for exercising in a healthy way to build up to the 5k.   Another important thing will be finding appropriate supportive shoes. Talk to an expert at a shoe store like Fleet Feet. Some stores even offer gait analysis to show your running/walking form and offer suggestions to minimize injury.,False,False
