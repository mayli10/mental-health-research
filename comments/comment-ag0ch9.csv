I would caution you about the director of CEDC, who is really a business woman more concerned about making money than about really caring for clients. I’m sure there are some great clinicians there but I strongly dislike Seda.   I can’t say much about the actual program since it’s been so long since I went, but I remember we’d bring in our dinners every night and they would help us portion/plate it.   I would consider another program in the area (Walden, Renfrew, Monte Nido EDCB). I’ve been to a couple of them, feel free to PM me",False,False
