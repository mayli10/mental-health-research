I really never understood this until I came into his family. His Grandma sounds like your family too! Mine was your typical 50's housewife who ate on salad plates her entire life. So even then I never experienced food=loving/care.  Reaching your goal weight and still feeling unhappy is such a common thing I think. We often forget all the other shit will still be here once our bodies change. Maybe not all the shit...but most of it.   Glad to have found a kindred spirit though! This sub has been so wonderful in making me reflect more and everyone is so supportive. I've never felt more empowered to keep trying.   Much love for your journey friendo üíñ,False,True
