I’m sorry you’re going through this.  Try to enjoy your trip.  When I’m in a similar situation I try to eat only what I really like.  If I’m traveling I try to eat a bit of dinner and lunch when it’s something local to the place I’m seeing but skip out if we’re getting fast food. I hope this helps.  Above all, try to enjoy your trip!",False,False
