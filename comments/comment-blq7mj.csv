I'm having some health problems, and even though I am not overweight, I think my rapid weight gain lately has definitely exacerbated them.   So I have managed to snap out of it partially by trying to focus on how awful it has been making me feel. I know that's kind of a BS answer, because EDs aren't just fixed by thinking mind over matter. But it isn't the worst baby step tool to use to try to manage things when you can. When I try to buy binge food or reach for the fridge, or whatever else, I just take a breath and try to remember how sick and bloated and in pain I have been feeling. Bingeing has always been a compulsion I run to when I am seeking comfort.... so I keep just trying to remind myself that it doesn't bring comfort very well when it makes me feel so physically ill.   It doesn't always work, of course. But it has helped a few times, and even helped me stop mid binge once, when I was able to stop shoving my face when I realized that I was making myself feel awful in every possible way.   Is it some magical fix it cure all? Of course not. Does it always work? Of course not. Will it work for you? Who knows. Everyone is different. But like I said, it is a little bit of a tool that I have found can be effective, so I thought it was worth mentioning to you. :)   Other than that, I try to just stick to keeping filling, low cal food around. Things that I can try to gorge myself on, but that will fill me up super fast and do less damage, and will also leave me feeling full for longer. My personal saving grace this last week have been omelettes loaded up with mushrooms and spinach. I get so damn full and feel like I gorged myself, but it was just 2 eggs and a bunch of low cal veggies and a splash of skim milk.   Again, not a guaranteed thing, but it comes in handy trying to manage it by redirecting your brain a little. My view is that even if it helps stop or prevent one out of every five binges, then that's something at least.",False,False

I spent the whole Bank Holiday weekend binging (I broke the chocolate seal). The only thing that stopped me today was going back to work and getting back into my usual routine.  Is there a usual routine that you have that would break the binge cycle? E.g. I usually eat one toast, go to work, have lunch, have 1 snack, go home, go to the gym, eat dinner, go to bed. I.e. Being a routine and having my 'fixed eating schedule' means I am less likely to binge.  Also being at work means I'm not around binge foods!  My advice: get out of the place where you binge, whether that means getting out of the house, going for a walk, going to the gym, going to work, whatever works for you. Don't bring money anywhere, it means you can't buy binge food. Get rid of the potential binge food in your house, if it's not there you won't be able to eat it.  Besides that, honestly hunger is so difficult to manage, especially if you've had restriction cycles. So be kind to yourself, beating yourself up is probably gonna make you want to 'comfort binge'. It will get better, just hang in there. You can take control again ðŸ’•",False,False

I am trying so hard but my willpower is just nonexistent in the face of this overwhelming compulsion to shovel food in my mouth all day. I know I'm gaining weight (obviously) and I am panicking about it constantly and STILL I can't stop. Fuckkkkkk!!!!,False,False
