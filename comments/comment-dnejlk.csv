As for incorporating challenge foods, take it in steps. Add one food in a meal that you're uncomfortable with to foods that feel safe. If you have a friend who knows about your ED and you can have food challenges with them, that can help too. You can message me if you want, just for accountability. It is really hard to stay accountable on your own. The best ""little"" thing that you can do is putting food on a plate that will help you reach your goal to normalize eating, and sit with the food for 45-60 minutes or until you've eaten it. Plating the food is half the battle for me.  Have you done DBT in your treatments before? Distress tolerance skills really help in the post meal time, either a distraction or self-soothing activities. I do sudoku and play some other games on my phone.",False,False
