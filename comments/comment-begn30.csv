The only reason I wasn't successful was because I was involuntarily committed. I got to a BMI 14 twice. My ultimate goal is a BMI 9 or something.,False,False

This is so hard for me to explain in words. It's something I think about intuitively-- the thought is fully formed and understood in my mind, but the words just will not come out. :( Maybe I shouldn't have said anything. If I can ever get myself organized about it, I'll make a post about it.",False,False

But I also want to grow old with my husband. I love him so much and i want to be healthy and fun and have the energy to love him as much as he deserves.,False,False

Good days and bad days, you know. A mix of behaviors. I've maintained a mostly-comfortable healthy weight for almost two years now. I've come to believe that there's a distinct demarcation between those of us who get better and those of us who don't. Not that either group suffers more or less than the other, just that they may have different types of root causes or something like that. I think there's a certain portion of our population that for whatever reason ends up ""chronic"" instead of ""cured.""",False,False

Lol.  I did go to treatment. The waiting list is about a year for IOP, so only the worst off go. I got weekly group therapy for slightly under 5 months. I guess I have been normal weight more often than underweight since then, but mostly it wasn't helpful tbh. I'm obviously not ED free. They ignored everything except my ED and in addition have become my go-to example of care providers not being educated on/knowing how to treat queer people. So cool.  Idk since then I've recognised this will be a life long thing for me. Ideally the severity will decrease and I'll remain at a normal weight, but the obsessiom and desires will always be there.",False,False

Like when people who are ex alcoholics, people on my 600lb life or whatever say that they’re going to be dealing with this ‘disease’ for the rest of their life I’m like no thank you. It’s unbearable esp as life seems to get harder. Yet I don’t really want to give it up. Cool.",False,False

I havent had a normal relationship with food since I was like 8 years old and I literally cant comprehend being normal when it comes to eating. Equally important, I've literally always hated my body, as far back as I remember. I dont even know what I actually look like anymore and havent for a long time. I dont see any way to change either of these things no matter how much therapy or whatever I go to",False,False
