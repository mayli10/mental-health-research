All I know is that I’ve been maintaining my weight over the past month eating 2300 per day. I also think you may have selected male on active’s calculator. If you change it to female, I’m within the recommendations. I spend a lot of time in the gym (probably 8-10 hours each week), but some of that time is for stretching and warming up. I also work in an office and am sedentary most of the day.",False,True

I haven’t had chest pain since I was underweight and doing tons of cardio several years ago. I’ll keep it in my mind if things get bad though.",False,True

Right now you’re still processing the responses you’ve had here, for one thing.   It’s not for me to pressure you with regard to seeking external support. This community is accepting of people at all stages of struggle, from being actively unwell to being in recovery. I’m sorry to hear you don’t feel like you can talk to anyone irl about it - please at least feel free to come back to this community for support.   Another thing open to you is practising harm reduction. One example of this that might apply to you is taking electrolytes if and when you have symptoms of low electrolytes, and if you restrict. Low electrolytes are especially risky in terms of an actual threat to your life, and you can take them in capsule form to try to limit this risk somewhat. You will need to look into it in more detail if you decide to do this, to ascertain what would be helpful for you and when, but I wanted to flag it up.   Another thing you could consider is getting some self-purchased, simple equipment to take your basic observations (orthostatic vitals) at home, so that you will at least know if your heart, blood pressure, etc., are drifting into the danger zone. Then you could make an informed decision about whether to go to the ER.   Again, not intending any of this as pressure! Just some other things to consider that don’t jump straight to telling someone and asking for help.",False,False

I'm not triggered. I'm living it up, eating ramen with eggs and peas at 11pm and feeling like an Extreme Hunger King!  It's okay to let your body go into extreme hunger- it's not binging, it's recovering and giving your body the chance to take in a lot of nutrients it wasn't getting before!",False,False

I heard of it and have even told other ED people here on reddit about it. But hearing it from someone else was... different. I'm relapsing hard and b/p tonight and then binged again. Before that I did a 48 hr fast and it was the most difficult because I was starting to honor my extreme hunger and then took food away again. Agh I hope my comment isnt triggering I just wanted to say thank you for letting me see that tonight wasnt a true binge even if my anorexia tells me it is,False,False

Plugging in your height and activity level to Active's fitness calculator suggests that you should be eating at least 2500, probably closer to 2800 just to maintain. And 2500 is for ""low active""!! If you're going to a gym regularly I'd bet you're in the 'active' category.  &gt;I still just seriously doubt that it’s anything worth anyone’s time.  Your life is worth it! There are many people who have made a career for themselves out of their empathetic nature that would love to be given the opportunity to help you recover. You sound very kind and worth it &lt;3  I know you said you don't plan to seek help, but I hope you can at least someday recognize your strength and your worth.  It got admittedly super cheesy at a few points, but I checked out [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Self-Love-Experiment-Principles-Compassionate-Accepting/dp/0143130692) from my local library and really got a lot of good messages out of it!",False,False

I read the link about extreme hunger. That sounds a lot like what I experienced. As for now, the part of me that thinks I don’t have an issue tells me that I eat way too much to have a problem - I’ve been averaging 2300 calories per day over the past month. That’s a lot. Also, that body scanner is nowhere near accurate. It’s just a fancy bio-electrical impedance scanner. Based on how my body looks, I’d say I’m probably 14-15% body fat. You could probably argue that’s still low for a female, but I don’t look sick or anything.   Anyway, I don’t mean to argue with you. I know a lot of what you said is probably right. Thanks for replying, and good luck in your recovery!",False,True

I guess I know something is wrong and has been for a while. I still just seriously doubt that it’s anything worth anyone’s time. Plus, as much as I wonder what it would be like to feel free, I don’t want my body to become less lean or muscular. I appreciate your advice, but I don’t plan to seek help. I really just wish I could talk to someone who actually knows me, but that’s not going to happen either.",False,True

And, while I did read your full post, all I needed for my answer were specific bits of your narrative:  &gt;and I think I probably had a restrictive eating disorder several years ago, though I was never diagnosed. I got down to an underweight BMI by dieting and exercising obsessively.  You're correct, and this would be disordered behavior even if you hadn't dropped to an underweight BMI.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;but then I snapped and I just couldn’t stop eating. I felt hungry all the time and I couldn’t inhibit the urge to eat like I had in the past.  This is a phase of recovering from restrictive anorexia- the phase I'm in currently, in fact. It's called [""extreme hunger""](https://www.recoverywarriors.com/truth-about-extreme-hunger/)  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;My weight was in the normal BMI range, but I felt fat and disgusting most of the time   &gt;   &gt;continued tracking my calories/macros everyday, weighing all my food on a scale.   &gt;   &gt;reawakened my ability to restrict food and worsened my food- and body-related thoughts (they never really went away)   &gt;   &gt;hoping it would provide the accountability and motivation I needed to finally get lean   &gt;   &gt;7% body fat   &gt;   &gt;but I can’t bring myself to do it. I feel a desire to continue losing weight  All stellar examples of thoughts and behaviors that someone with body dysmorphia and anorexia/orthorexia would have. You were already lean before you went on that challenge- we're the same height, and if you have muscle weight built on, weighing 152 at the start of the challenge is already lean. Your dysmorphia distorts the way you see and feel about your body, and your fear of gaining weight is a common ED behavior.  Feel free to ask me questions or message me!",False,False

Whether or not that would meet the clinical criteria of a diagnosed ED is a more technical and delicate question, even harder to make an attempt at online – I think there are some professionals who would diagnose you with an eating disorder, yes. There are others who might not.   Ultimately I think (and have said this to others) that by the time a person feels the need to present their history here and ask the question, *something* is probably wrong. It almost doesn’t matter so much what the exact diagnosis may be (not least because we definitely cannot make it); anyone who is experiencing or has experienced considerable dysfunction relating to eating, weight, body image and connected behaviours, should seriously consider getting a professional evaluation and looking into further treatment.   I hope you can get some help with this. For what it’s worth, I honestly do think it sounds like you are unwell and could use the support.",False,False
