I still think of that as a goal to this day,False,False

I can vividly recall a scene in the Big Bang Theory that I caught a glimpse of once. I was maybe 13 at the time. The blonde girl was having a conversation with Sheldon who said something along the lines of ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre probably, what, 120 pounds-‚Äú and she cuts him off with an offended, ‚Äú120?!‚Äù   For whatever reason that stupid line stuck with me for years and years, past high school and college, and I‚Äôm still constantly basing my body image satisfaction on whether or not my weight is close to 120 pounds. It is an insanely low weight, by most standards. I know that. But to the blonde girl on TV, Sheldon was essentially calling her fat. Am I fat?",False,False

There was a sitcom I saw an episode of once and they kept making reference to women's body fat percentages (one person said someone had a 2% body fat and another person said someone else had 0%)  and that has stuck with me for probably 6 years now lol. No idea why the show felt the need to mention those numbers, it was just a normal sitcom as far as i remember",False,False

Currently I‚Äôve been watching and listening to a lot of musicals. ‚ÄúMatilda‚Äù has a song about Bruce eating chocolate cake that starts out with ‚ÄúEat/he can‚Äôt! Eat/he surely can‚Äôt!‚Äù. It does not help that the beat is so catchy and gets stuck in my head independent from the lyrics. üòÇ,False,False
