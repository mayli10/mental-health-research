Obviously i don't know how they're feeling ,but posting ""ootd"" (bodychecks) constantly is basically gaining weight in he spotlight (and tbh, most of the people following wouldn't follow if they didn't look emaciated at one point).

On the matter of displaying underweight bodies (in the context of OOTDs or otherwise) I have this belief- nobody who isn't already ill (even if it hasn't manifested yet as behavior) is going to want to mimic it so it does no harm that hasn't already been done. Regarding showing their meals, I also think it's important for people to share what works for them, even if what works for them isn't quite perfect. Plus, some people just like to share. I've seen plenty of non-disordered folks instagram everything they eat.   It doesn't seem disingenuous to me because they really are doing better, even if not 100%. I think any and all degrees of recovery, complete or not and regardless of intent to complete, should be glamorized. That 100% non-disordered just isn't possible for everyone and I think it's okay for those who can't reach that to be proud/document their experiences. ",False,False

As most people who have been very underweight with an ED know, it completely changes the way people treat you... people show this concern for you and are more likely to positively regard the things you do when you are underweight. I can see how it would be extremely addicting to maintain this ""look at me i'm doing my best and i'm being a good influence!"" persona on the outside while you are essentially babied by your followers.  Plus it's totally a food-outlet for them. Anorexics are almost always obsessed with food and having a ""food instagram"" honestly probably enables a lot of them",False,False

I think perpetuating the idea that recovery is all or nothing is *more* dangerous. Halfway saves lives in my opinion. It's very realistic, and unfortunately, in many cases more practical.

""Recovery"" means you're making strides toward conquering your inner demons, your perception of yourself and respective body, and that you're making healthy, nutritious food decisions. ""Recovery"" isn't reaching and stabilizing an underweight (and unhealthy) goal weight; it's merely being happy that you've reached your goal.   If you were to take these ""recovered"" underweight peeps and threw some 10-15lbs on them, surely they'd quickly return to their old habits.

Achieving a healthy weight is extremely psychologically distressing for people like us and it can be a massive trigger. That's always been a problem for me. I know the moment I hit a BMI of 18.5 I'd throw all my hard work toward being healthier straight down the drain, so instead I'm hovering around 17.5-18 because it's wayyyy better for me than the 14.5-15 I maintained for so long.   Recovery isn't always about being the perfect shining picture of flawless health.   Sometimes it's just about being healthier than you used to.   Is being underweight bad? Yeah, absolutely. But being *less* underweight than your ED tells you to be is still a massive victory that requires amazing courage and it seems kind of harsh to criticize people for that. ",False,False
