They'd be able to make a meal plan with you according to your dietary choices and they'll know what you should eat to be healthy and not go back to bulimia or any other ED.",False,False

I will keep up with my weight loss over the next month and see if the numbers slow down or not, which would be good (I am quite worried that I may be losing muscle but idk). Yeah, it is very difficult to track calories as a lot of the meals I'm eating atm are homemade, so it is an estimate, but I am trying to add some more calories by including more vegetables etc, but I could be eating more than I think anyway. I have suffered with bulimia a couple of years ago (I felt terrible all the time) whereas now I'm feeling good eating as I am, that's why I'm a bit confused. But thanks for the advice.",False,True

First of all you might want to put a TW on this post because numbers can be triggering here.  Then we're not doctors and can't tell you whether you have an ED or not. You might want to see one if you're really concerned, and you seem to be.  However, a lot of people lose quite a bit of weight in the beginning of their weight loss journey. It's the water weight and it's normal when you stop eating junk. Eating around 1k calories is way too low but tracking calories isn't always easy and some people underestimate how much they're really eating.   Those are just my two cents but again, I'm not a doctor. No one on this sub is going to tell you if you have an ED or not. Please reach out for professional help. Going down the ED path is not good at all and better be safe than sorry!",False,False
