I've always wanted to be able to pull off high fashion. My body (average-thin) hasn't stopped me from wearing what I want, but I definitely still desire that model-skinny body type for this reason alone.",False,False

It set off a lot of ED red flags. I totally agree with you that if it was a woman saying this stuff, omg the outrage! She’d get so much hate. ",False,False

A woman losing that amount of weight would be vilified by people on both sides of the spectrum (while also being praised). Twisted world we live in.   I do sympathize with how it must feel to be a part of the fashion industry, even for people who aren’t models. Their job relies less on looking a certain way but they feel the pressure. ",False,True

It was painfully relatable in some ways but publishing these kinds of articles normalizes ED behaviors. Especially for young minds. ,False,True

How reverent the article is for his candidness how fucked up his relationship with food and his body image was. If a famous woman talked that way she’d be vilified for promoting eating disorders. Lagerfield himself was a POS misogynist. ,False,False

He also suggested fellow dieters have to white-knuckle their way to a slimmer body through sheer willpower alone.  god this really echoes the driving mentality behind a couple hundred pro-ana tumblr textposts that bounced around 2012 going something like ""imagine the shorts you'll be able to wear without your thighs rubbing together, imagine your crop top showing a flat stomach and not a muffin top..."" etc etc  like, if I'm being honest, this totally resonates with me. *looks guility at ugw clothes hanging in closet* but advocating this mentally the ED un-cursed general public really rubs me the wrong way. this isn't a wholesome lifestyle lol",False,False
