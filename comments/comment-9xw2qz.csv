No for fucks sake. Youre my parents, you give me food, how would i know it better?  I am 30 now, and that still bothers me. When they see me, lost weight, they try to force feed me. Like, sorry, i love you guys, but how stupid are you guys that you dont see the correlation between eating and being fat? ",False,False

She's overweight, and I am too but I've been losing lots from restricting. But she still fit my clothes. She wore one of my shirts for one day without saying she would. She didn't think it would be a problem because I never wear them anyway(I always wear a sweater or baggy clothes because I hate my body). I of course couldn't tell her my issue because she doesn't know I have an eating disorder and I don't want to recover. She hasn't tried on any of my things for at least a month at this point. Another thing my family does sometimes is say I don't need things. Like if I have 2 yogurts instead of one they'll say ""You don't need that yogurt"". Or if I just want to actually eat something unhealthy I might be told I don't need it. Sometimes it's in a joking sense, but it still hurts. And sometimes my family might comment on my weight. Especially my younger brother. He won't say anything to hurt me. He has ADHD and he rarely thinks about the things that come out of his mouth. He will sometimes tell me I need to lose weight or things like that. Sorry for the long post but yea my family is my biggest trigger pretty much.",False,False

They're all obese. I've never been overweight because I'm terrified of ending up like them. I'll never forget my sister telling me that she wished she could become anorexic so she could lose a bunch of weight and look like me. I was in recovery from anorexia at that time.    I don't blame them for their eating and body image issues, but it definitely affected me negatively.",False,False

All of the adult women do, most to the point it could be an eating disorder, but there's also this idea against getting help.  Also, as long as you don't say the words ""eating disorder"", any disordered behaviors you do to lose weight and that weight loss are praised. Once anyone hears about an eating disorder, all food choices etc are suspect, but weight loss is still praised lol. Recently someone got weight loss surgery, to the tune of losing 5lbs a week, and I feel frustrated at their behavior and like a failure for not keeping up. It's unhealthy as hell.",False,False
e9w472t,t3_9xw2qz,t3_9xw2qz,my-destructive-side,1,2018-11-17 10:23:56,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/9xw2qz/how_have_your_parentsfamily_impacted_your_ed/e9w472t/,"(Sorry this is so long üòü)  My dad‚Äôs an immigrant too. He doesn‚Äôt believe in mental illness at all (not sure if that‚Äôs a result of the culture he grew up in or just a stupid conclusion he‚Äôs come to on his own) and thinks you can just stop doing/feeling whatever (drug addicts could ‚Äújust stop‚Äù if they wanted to, my crippling anxiety would be cured if I ‚Äújust stopped ‚Äúworrying about the 10000 things I am constantly thinking could go wrong, schizophrenics could ‚Äúchoose‚Äù to recognise that the voice in their head/person they think they‚Äôre talking to isn‚Äôt actually real, etc). It‚Äôs especially maddening to me because he has an advanced degree in a health related field and in theory should have a strong understanding of the chemical imbalances and brain abnormalities of people with mental illness, even if he can‚Äôt understand the emotions. But nope.  Anyway, the impact of that is twofold: first, I‚Äôve been anxious and depressed ever since childhood (abusive mother, more on her later) and have always had unhealthy coping mechanisms that generally are self destructive. If I‚Äôd received proper therapy when I was younger then perhaps I never would have gotten to the ‚Äúself destruction via starvation‚Äù stage, but I guess it just never occurred to either one of them that therapy might help me.  Second, after developing an ED, I was on my own trying to battle it. I was actively extremely ill for 7-8 years, ‚Äúrecovered‚Äù for 4 ish years, and have been right on the brink of relapse for a year or so now (I‚Äôve more or less relapsed mentally, just not entirely physically yet if that makes sense). When I was sick, I put together a treatment team (physician, psychiatrist, therapist, dietician) without any help or even the knowledge of my parents. I stayed in therapy for seven years. I read self help books. I frequented ED forums. I made progress extremely slowly because I had no support system, largely because of my dads denial of mental illness. I was sick enough that I was constantly being threatened with involuntary hospitalisation due to ‚Äúweight incomparable with life‚Äù, I was sick enough to be registered with my university‚Äôs Disability Services, I was sick enough that everyone who treated me was convinced I would drop dead at any moment, but to this day there has been no acknowledgement of my ED within my family. Dad refers to it as my ‚Äúvegetarian thing.‚Äù (Still vegetarian btw, regardless of whether I‚Äôm actively ill, in recovery, or relapse. He‚Äôs gonna need to find something new to call it I guess.)   My mother is a narcissist and has been emotionally and at times physically abusive my entire life. She‚Äôs also been overweight my entire life, and at this point is morbidly obese. The abuse has shattered my self esteem and any sense of who I am. It‚Äôs the root cause of my anxiety, phobias, depression, and self destructive nature. I‚Äôd experimented with just about every unhealthy coping mechanism imaginable over the years, and the ED is the one that stuck.   The ED didn‚Äôt start on purpose as a coping mechanism though. When I was 17 I took a nutrition course and learned all about how calories and weight works, and decided to put myself on a two week long diet to test out what I‚Äôd learned. I was underweight (just barely, naturally) to begin with but wanted to prove to myself that if I ever started getting fat like my mother, I‚Äôd be able to get it under control and not end up like her. I don‚Äôt ever want to be like her in any way. So I went on my experimental diet to prove to myself I could do it, and I did it, and then I just didn‚Äôt want to stop. I couldn‚Äôt. It happened that fast.   When I was very sick, it‚Äôs like she could automatically sense when I‚Äôd made just the tiniest bit of progress, and then she‚Äôd start a huge fight or just be nasty and it would undo whatever progress I‚Äôd been making. She also said and did a lot of fucked up stuff directly related to my weight (weighed me in public or used a neighbours scale, accused me of ‚Äútrying to look sexy for boys‚Äù, brought up the brilliant and original ‚Äúthere‚Äôs starving children in Africa‚Äù bullshit, stuck her hand in the waistband of my jeans to ‚Äúmake sure there‚Äôs room‚Äù when her and my dad decided they‚Äôd cure me by forcing me to drink Ensure Plus for a couple of weeks, etc).  Not going to get too much into it now since this is already so long, but I‚Äôve spent the last three months with my parents and that‚Äôs about done the trick to fully push me into relapse I think. I‚Äôve definitely gained weight while here because I‚Äôm not able to move around much and I‚Äôve been eating like shit‚Äî I suppose compared to the average person it‚Äôs really not bad, but compared to what I‚Äôm used to it‚Äôs a lot. My mother is driving me insane with her antics. Annnnd bonus points for watching her eat All. Night. Long. She‚Äôll say goodnight and then half an hour later she‚Äôs in the kitchen grabbing pb or cheese or a container of leftovers or a bowl of whatever snack food. An hour later, she‚Äôs back for more. Wake up at 3 am to use the toilet? Oh look, the kitchen light is on again and she‚Äôs on the sofa eating fuck knows what. Rinse and repeat.  I‚Äôve gained weight here. I‚Äôve gained weight being in this environment. I‚Äôm going to fix it when I get home, and then some. I will not become that person.",False,False

Like I'd have two bowls of cereal like it was nothing. But then i was too chubby??? No shit Sherlock.... My mum had ana when she wss younger so i think her letting me eat what i wanted was her overcompensating for her own restriction. But it was so twisted. Then at some point in my teenage years i wanted to diet and they kinda didn't like it, they said dieting was unhealthy... But then when i lost weight i was praised LOL.
