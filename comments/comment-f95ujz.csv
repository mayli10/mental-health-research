Basically, you need to figure out whether the binging is purely being caused by the restriction or if it is a separate thing.   If it’s being caused purely by the intense restriction (which would be my guess by seeing how low your cals are) then you increase your daily calories to a level that at least allows for basic bodily functioning, but basically you increase until it stops happening. This happened to me for a long time at the height of my anorexia, but I don’t consider mine true binges because it was just my body’s natural preservation instincts being able to override the ED for a minute. It’s not an uncommon thing, and it’s more of a physical response to starvation than anything else.   If it’s a disordered reaction in itself, then just increasing your daily cals wont fix it (though you still really need to), and you need to also treat it as BED/bulimia/binge purge anorexia. If you feel like you’re eating to cope with things going on in your life (as opposed to doing it because you’re not able to starve yourself that intensely for that long), then it’s probably something that needs to be addressed on it’s own.",False,False

Same deal on the moderate-severe front. I know the answer is probably “eat a few more calories a day than you’re getting!” But demon ED brain sees anything above 300 as a loss and makes me binge. And honestly I can’t deal with the purging anymore so I’m just really trying to get a handle on it.   You’re not alone OP! This blows. And is indicative extreme malnutrition according to my dietician sibling.,False,False

I have moderate-severe anorexia too and experience the same exact thing. I either eat nothing/very little or I try to eat normally but I go ape and eat until I force myself to stop. I get cravings too that are almost impossible to ignore :-/ I don't hate myself as much as I used to so I've been trying to eat a bit more but it's so hard when one meal makes me want to eat the entire kitchen.,False,False

All summer I will be out biking, walking, barely have time for food. Here Im trapped inside with my children, not allowed to sleep, in the kitchen.  Holiday candy is everywhere from October to April, if youre in USA like me. Just saying. I feel set up for failure rn.
