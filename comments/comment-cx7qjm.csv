I had a costume fitting the other day and I was in such a fragile head space at the time, so when the costume was too tight I wanted to cry. I felt so bad.",False,False

I always had more boobs than everyone else and was wider in my ribcages and the amount of diet talks I got from the ballet mistresses just completely deflated my confidence. I’d cry all the time. Getting fit for costumes can be so unforgiving when you’re with all these skinny girls around who don’t seem to have a problem staying thin :/,False,False

I went to a private school with a really good dance program. EDs were so prevalent among the dancers that we were required to keep a food journal and the school nurse would check it every week. We all just lied about what we ate and kept starving. I had to quit dancing at 16 because I became too weak to keep up with the physical demands. It sucked.,False,False

Interestingly cheer is a pro-recovery motivator for me because I can really tell the difference in tumbling performance when I’m restricting versus nourishing myself. The more consistently I eat, the more my tumbling improves, and that makes me feel a lot better about what my body and muscles can do for me. Of course a slew of other factors have made my ED worse over the years but I’m glad that cheer isn’t one of them.",False,False

Plus skimpy costumes.  I remember I always wanted to stay in the girl sizes and never move up to the ladies because something about moving up made me not skinny enough. I wanted to remain a girl not a woman I suppose.,False,False
