When I was younger I was a bit chubby. My highest weight was 140 lbs at 13 years old (5‚Äô3‚Äù) and I have been engaged in disordered eating for 3 years. While my situation isn‚Äôt as extreme as your situation, my family is the typical ‚ÄúAmericans are so unhealthy‚Äù type, it just seems so disordered. My mother lost 50 lbs (100 lbs at 5‚Äô5‚Äù) after my parents divorce, though she mostly gained it back she still calls herself fat even though she‚Äôs at my weight and she knows this.  I wanted to be a ballerina, or a gymnast (particularly a rhythmic gymnast), figure skater. But it‚Äôs all gone now. Im still a teenager but I can‚Äôt reach what I could of been.  It‚Äôs like the parents in these situations project the insecurities they hold towards their bodies on their own children. It makes me so angry.",False,False

I was 260 lbs in athletics, I played basketball &amp; id powerlifting and yet I was still. Gaining. Weight. Because my mom grew up with disordered eating and was so worried I wasn't eating enough doing do much activity I had food shoved on me constantly.   I do have some good news, when I went off to college there were a lot of good resources on eating healthily, mindfully. After the first 2 weeks of binge-fest in the all-you-can-eat dining halls my body adjusted to not having food thrusted on mr constantly. I ate a normal, healthy amount. I lost a lot of weight the normal, healthy way. I learned I preferred OMAD, and would eat one ~1700 cal meal a day and felt great! I stayed somewhat active and learned to not eat like I had been taught the entirety of the first 18 years of my life.   What I'm getting at is food habits can be unlearned and relearned, for better or for worse. It's a lot of baggage to work thru, but it IS possible. You can't change the past, but the future is all yours. It's not easy, but changing your habits to eating a healthy amount of food, not over-eating or under-eating, is possible. I know you feel cheated and robbed, I feel the same way, I could have been an actual, good, athlete and not just a try-hard obese monster, but I can't change that and it's okay. I'm gonna be okay. We're gonna be okay.",False,False
