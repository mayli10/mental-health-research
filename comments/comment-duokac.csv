Feel free to PM me if you ever want to chat or are feeling vulnerable.   I got that impression but didn‚Äôt want to immediately suggest leaving him, as everybody‚Äôs situations are different. You are rightfully taking care of yourself first and foremost, people like him will always contribute to your life negatively - you should be *incredibly* proud of how strong you are to make that decision, it can‚Äôt be easy but you‚Äôre taking the steps to a healthier life.",False,True

I have made some recent steps in the past few weeks towards recovery (seeing a therapist, etc) and all signs are pointing to having to let him go in order to be able to move forward. Oddly enough, I am more okay with that as time goes on.",False,False
