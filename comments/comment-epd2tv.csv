I used to hang out over there to convince myself that calorie counting and restricted eating was normal, but I didn't realize the people on there were coming at calorie restriction with a much different view than I did. The mindsets behind the posts here and most posts over there are miles apart though, you're so right about that.",False,False

It clearly states the sub is for people with low TDEEs and discourages men and taller women (as in, 5ft 4 and over)  from eating only 1200 calories a day, and any mention of going under 1200 is always ridiculed (quite rightly) by other members.   You see a lot of people on the sub saying they don’t even eat 1200cals, but 1500, 1700, 2000 even, and they just like the community/recipes, like a lot of us do as well.   Most people on here will be quick to argue that eating disorders aren’t diets, but will accuse people on diets that they have eating disorders.   On a very superficial level, it’s the same. We both restrict calories to lose weight and restriction sucks lets make a meme to cope. But dig a tiiiiny bit deeper and there’s one person with a complex mental illness and another who wants to lose weight/be healthier.  Of course people with disordered eating will be attracted to any diet sub. That’s a given. You have to remember that when you actively look for something, you see it everywhere.   * No shade at OP or anyone who finds the sub triggering or anyone at all really this is just my thoughts on the whole topic that comes up a lot on here :)",False,False

Like someone else commented, calorie restriction tips are useful for both dieters and people with EDs. But it’s the difference in the way the people think about food that makes the real difference. A lot of their memes seem to come from a place of lighthearted “oh no, I messed up and ate over my limit! Welp, better get right back on the wagon!” whereas our memes seem to come from more obsessive thoughts about food and whatnot",False,False
