It’s so, so hard to break out of that binge/purge cycle, and it’s okay to fail sometimes, as long as you don’t give up. I recently fell back into it too. It’s such a slippery slope, and once you start, it’s just too easy to get stuck.   Tonight is the first night in a while that I’m promising myself not to purge. We got this!",False,False

I have been trying to recover from bulimia all year and I’ve definitely had my ups and downs. So far the longest I’ve gone is 30 days but I intend to beat that streak now. Also remember in order to stop the b/p cycle you have to have some binges that you do not “compensate” (purge) for. It’s hard and it sucks but once you stop purging then eventually you will stop binging. You are still doing great! Good luck!!!,False,False
