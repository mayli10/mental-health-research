I replaced them with zucchini noodles and cauliflower rice two-ish years ago.   In December I went to a Christmas party that had a bunch of share plates, one of which had rice. Turns out rice is super grainy and has a flavour and I no longer like it. So I decided to make some pasta at home. Same deal.   I now desire neither of these things after having tasted them again. I don't even want to make a boxed macaroni I once liked for fear of realizing it tasted like cheddar-coated semolina. I see no point to making rice that will add that grainy flavour and texture to my food when I could make cauliflower rice that becomes the flavour of whatever I combine it with and doesn't feel grainy in my mouth. It's not even just about the calories anymore - they just plain taste better. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",False,False
