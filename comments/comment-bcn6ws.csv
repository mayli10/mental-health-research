I'm not sure if she has recently spoke on it, but I'm speculating it's something that never quite goes away. )^:",False,True

All in the past 3 or 4 months I think! She's quite a disordered eater from what I've seen, but I still love her vids lol",False,False

I just checked her last diet video and she says two months ago she was 217 and she's now 192, that's a weight loss of 25 lbs in 2 months. Keep in mind that at 217 she had a BMI of 38 which is obese, pushing morbidly obese (40 BMI).   It's much easier for someone who's obese- morbidly obese to lose weight than it is for slimmer people. At 25 lbs in 2 months, that's 3.1 lbs per week which is quite safe. That's not to say she doesn't have an ED but hopefully she's doing things safely and she's okay.",False,False

Everyone drops weight quickly at first.  She’s been a positive influence for me, body image wise and helped with my anorexia a couple years ago",False,False
