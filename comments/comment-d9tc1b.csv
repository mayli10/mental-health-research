Why don’t you take the opportunity to look as ghoulish as you feel? Halloween is my fav excuse to be ugly. First off, it’s cold, why you wanna be exposing skin? Second, would you rather be the 100th sexy nurse someone saw that night, or a terrifying creature? Idk I’d rather be a creature and have fun rather than worrying about being sexy and how uncomfortable my shoes are.",False,False

I'd rather just be covered up and shapeless. It's not great, but at least I'm not thinking about my body nonstop.   (If this idea resonates with you at all, I feel like a fair few people are gonna go as Billie Eilish this year. That would be an easy and bulky costume.)",False,False
