This was me when I was really sick (currently recovering and it's so worth it). I could never go a full 24 hours fasting, and most days I ate 2-3 times, I just cut the cals lower and lower. I was never medically considered underweight, but i was so preoccupied with food that I was in this weird, starved daze all the time (I'm sure you know what I mean). I thought that I was weak, that I was just a pig who couldn't control herself enough to lose weight. If you're sick enough to suffer, you're sick enough to recover, and I really hope you can recover someday",False,False

Tbh it‚Äôs really the only food I eat   And I always feel terrible bc whenever I meet w a health professional or do an intake assessment for inpatient they always expect me to be afraid of ice cream and fries and peanut butter and all that stuff and I‚Äôm like no I eat those every day I just don‚Äôt eat anything else   But them thinking that and then their reaction to it always makes me feel like I‚Äôm the worst Ana ever üò≠üò≠üò≠,False,False

One thing I remember is watching this recovered girl‚Äôs video on YouTube. It was titled ‚Äúdo I have a eating disorder?‚Äù And in it she explained that people that have undisordered eating don‚Äôt have thoughts about ‚Äúdo I have a eating disorder. She said that if you‚Äôre even searching for stuff like ‚Äúdo I have a eating disorder‚Äù your behaviors are probably disordered. Im probably not explaining it right but I can try to find the video so it makes more sense. ‚ô•Ô∏è ,False,False
