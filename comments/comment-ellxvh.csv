To this day, that competitive mindset poisons my relationships with other people. I can't even put into words how intensely I despise my parents. If I could kill them painfully and get away with it, I gladly would.",False,False

You’d only be leaving them so that you CAN be there for them, ya know?   I hope- whether you end up going intensive or not- things get easier for you. Try to treat yourself with the same compassion that you do with your students. You deserve it. That little girl you once were still lives in you. Be kind to her. You would be if you met her now. *many virtual hugs",False,False

That’s probably something I needed to hear. I may end up having to leave for intensive treatment and I feel so guilty leaving them.,False,True

It has been so so hard to start unweaving those fibers and make a new pattern.  Having even one person in their lives offering caring, accepting, encouragement can make a huge difference. (Like, legit - I think there are studies to corroborate.)  There's a documentary I love where in one scene a music teacher is instructing a group of kids in singing the notes of the C-major scale. One young girl is clearly hesitant to make much sound. The teacher looks her in the eye and says ""I want you to make a huge noise! Make a huge mistake! I love you no matter what!"" And I tear up every time I even think about that moment. Like, yes yes YES. You're doing it right.",False,False
