I had a co-worker who was on weight watchers and would eat so many huge portions of “zero” foods and I’d be counting on my head.. 90 in that Apple, 350 calories of grapes.. etc. I always find myself staying lower than anyone who is dieting. I literally have had to tell EVERYONE I work with that they can’t talk about diets in front of me or I’ll loose even if I’m really trying to do better. It sucks to call myself out but everyone knows about my ED anyway.",False,False
