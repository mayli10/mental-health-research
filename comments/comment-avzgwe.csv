Even when you weigh out an apple one is gonna have more sugar than another anyway and you'll burn more calories on a cold day Vs a warm one etc etc.  It's all about the level of control we personally feel the need to have I think. At times I feel safe logging sauces and at times strangely empowered by the things I choose not to log like  coffee and soy sauce as if I get to have some negotiating power against my disease.,False,False

I do think it is important to be mindful of what you chose to ignore because they certainly can add up, but not as much as our minds might try to make it seem.   You're tdee could also be different than the calculators predict and you are +/- 100 calories. Maybe things like this would be more noticeable in that type of situation and potentially cause people more distress. ",False,False
