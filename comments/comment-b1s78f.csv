I wake up excited to get my fructose and lactose rush for the day, it gives me energy for all morning, and tbh, that helps me restrict more later. I do find it quite easy for the rest of my day to fit into 700 Calories as well, because the rest of my diet is basically just veggies and meats/fish.",False,False
