I worked for someone like this and I often felt like crap just from being around them a few hours a week.  Your response is normal because you’ve betrayed by family, and a sibling no less. Granted I’m (technically) an only child, but I can’t imagine being this petty with a sibling, especially one struggling with body issues.  If you haven’t already, have a private conversation with her and explain that comments like that are harming you. If she seems unreceptive, stop thinking of her as your sister. It’s cold but it’s what my wife essentially had to with one of her brothers.  Either way, wishing you luck and sending love ❤️",False,False

I’ve definitely said stuff I don’t mean and essentially thrown tantrums when someone eats food I specifically bought for myself and carefully budgeted for. Either way, try not to take it personally, whether she’s just a bitch, was having a bad day, or has issues of her own, it doesn’t mean anything. I hope you are well",False,False

She's beautiful and I love her, but she is tall and rail thin. I was a goddamn mess at 12. She's naturally thin as hell (on vyvanse) and is just gorgeous.
