I tolerated months of not being treated the way a loving partner should treat you, and I took it all out on myself during that year. I knew that I hated myself, and that I needed outside help if I wanted to change that..because due to the nature of hating yourself, it's really hard to change that on your own because you often just feel like you don't deserve to help yourself get better.  I also started purging around the time my ex and I met, and I knew that while bingeing is often not validated as a real ED (even though I was diagnosed with BED two years before that) there is no disputing the fact that I sometimes induced vomiting post-binge was considered ED. I knew that normal people ""overate"" sometimes or even daily, but no normal person would ever purge, at least not through vomiting.   Please note that I think all ED's are valid (I've struggled with BED since I was 12 and I have also purged through exercise in the past), and I was only referring to myself at the time.",False,False

I was talking to a therapist about my depression and suddenly I just couldn’t hide the eating disorder anymore. This was when I was 20, so 8 years after I first started showing symptoms.   You get to decide when ‘sick enough’ is. No one else can define it for you. It could be after three months or after 30 years. It’s whenever you’ve realized that you can’t handle this on your own anymore and you need more help",False,False
