I walk around the huge ones for like an hour or more mentally planning all my meals for the week or just fantasizing about eating all the junk and then by the end i‚Äôm like ‚Äúwell i got a few thousand steps in :)‚Äù and leave with nothing because i‚Äôm like ‚Äúi don‚Äôt deserve this‚Äù LMAO  or the grocery store i work at has like a hot bar/almost buffet thing and sometimes i will drive 30 minutes away to go to the next closest one in binge mode (so none of my coworkers see me but i still have the familiarity of a place i know) and waste money on this huge plate that i used to purge in the bathroom but now i just force down a taste of everything i got before i snap out of it and either throw it out (which i‚Äôm ashamed of) or take it home for someone else to eat.,False,False

I am walking (pacing lanes) for hours, filling, and emptying a shoppingbasket, carrying the basket. And stressing about what to buy.",False,False

I will often pace the store with my cart or basket, picking things up, getting across the store, grabbing other things, going back to the other side to put an item back, etc. Sometimes I also ping pong around between ""safe foods safe foods safe foods"" and ""I should just fucking binge tonight!""   It results in an hour or two, sometimes more, of just wandering the store in circles, picking new things up and returning other items to their spots upon each lap until I finally run out of time or get too exhausted and just want to go home and be done.",False,False

My bf never writes his groceries down though (we normally eat separate meals) and when he starts taking too long it makes me feel really stressed out and irritated cause I get stuck like this too.   I go to the supermarket excited to get groceries for a yummy dinner but then sometimes I get so frustrated in the supermarket I don't want to eat when I get home - so annoying.,False,False

I have a hard time shopping alone because of this. I need a companion who is doing their shopping so I can just follow their path and grab what I need along the way and desperately try not to look stressed out by the ordeal.   I buy groceries so infrequently that my fridge and pantry shelves are populated in strange/depressing ways. But then I have nothing at home and have to eat out and that‚Äôs a whole other stressful ordeal and FUCK",False,False

It‚Äôs dawned on me that all the thought loops/panic moments I have in there look *to others* like I‚Äôm just a high maintenance girl who‚Äôs picky about produce.  The other day, the manager of the whole store came over with a little cart especially for me, and wandered with me around all the expensive supplements, pointing out which ones were best for a ‚Äúlady like me.‚Äù üßöüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",False,False
