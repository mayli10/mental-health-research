Didn't feel anything pop or anything like that. But I do feel a slight achy-ness. I'm piss terrified that I've hurt myself. Guess I'll see how easy it is to get out of bed tomorrow morning :p   Couldn't do my last rep for overhead, either. I ate to maintenance when I got home. I have to stop cutting for a bit. In the absolute worst case scenario, I'm still up like 1/3 of a pound from my last ~~planned binge~~  holiday. That shit isn't worth de-loading any lifts to me. ",False,False

He and I have been broken up for like six months but you know how there are different layers of resentment after bad relationships?   So new things have surfaced after I got over other things.

I know that doesn't always mean the other person wants to also open up, but it still sorta bothered me how he handled it all. It would be too long to post the full rant on here but basically I just needed to get out some of my frustration at this guy. The relationship was bad enough without him triggering my ED on top of it. And the way he did it sometimes seemed like he was doing it specifically to upset me or whatever. He did that with a lot of stuff though.   I know this is word vomit and doesn't make much sense. I just needed to type it out I think and at least get some of this out. ",False,False
