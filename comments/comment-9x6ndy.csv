I love MMORPGs and if I know this will reduce my time spent on Reddit by a lot.   People with eating disorders buy shit too. ,False,False

That's also why sanctionedsuicide and it's successors were all banned/quarantined. Really though, there's been this weird stigma about any sort of online ed community ever since all that pro-ana hysteria 5-10 years. ",False,False

We’re trying to make it very clear in the description and sidebar but honestly whoooo knows what’ll happen.   At the least, this sub can hopefully encourage people to share links of discord, peach, other forums so we can stay connected :(",False,False

Too popular. Apparently it wasn't a joke. I wouldn't be surprised to see other mental health subs get the ban hammer.,False,False
