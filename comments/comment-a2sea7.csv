(I smiled warmly, ""as they say, looks can be deceiving!"") Do i have a shortsighted disregard for office civility, or am i speaking truth to misogyny, establishing boundaries, making our workplace more inclusive? lofty excuses, i'm just the uptight bitch.  i'm sure there's a tactful way to change behavior, because it sounds like the things they say are inappropriate (maybe stop acting?). anyway, i feel for you. chin up, good luck, and fuck 'em.",False,False
