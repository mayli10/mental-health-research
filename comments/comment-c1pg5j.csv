I too shower with the lights off, almost do everything with the lights off. If someone touches me I get a sudden rise of nausea and panic. It's so invasive and sickening. I'm just ... sorry that it's like this for you too. The loneliness and forced distance/ isolation is unbearable, especially when you feel like it's your fault. It's really not though. You're beautiful and lovable and so much more than how you perceive your body to be. I've never in my life hugged someone and thought about what their body felt like, I doubt anyone else does either unless they're really disordered themselves. I hope your shower makes you feel better &lt;3",False,False
