I'm a huge metalhead and rock fan lol.   Favorite band, that's a super tough one, I would say right now probably either Architects or maybe Rise Against or something like that.  Best trip was my first week-long backpacking trip through the middle of nowhere, with camp based right by an isolated glacier lake (I've done 3 now). Took the trip with a group of virtual strangers which actually was like...way better?   I've had really long hair but I always got this point and chop it off to shoulder length so...lol  Super curly dirty blonde hair.  Sporty I guess, I'm like the most laid back, calm person so definitely not high-maintenance.  Style....dark and practical I guess haha  Rainy day any day. I would prefer a long walk on a super isolated beach but could also do a snowy vacation at a little warm lodge in the middle of nowhere, basically if it's an introvert paradise I'm in.  112% night owl. Have to be up at 4-5 in the morning during uni season tho, I get usef to it but never like it.",False,False

Also a good reminder that I am still a real person outside of anorexia too  London UK waheeey  Fave music is I definitely prefer old music to new pop music (the doors, Lou Reed, also the velvet undergound, the cranberries, the Beatles the kinks and bob Dylan etc. And the Animals) but also hip hop like Nas and Wu tang clan and the beastie boys,  and other stuff like Elliot Smith, tame impala, the XX, the war on drugs, the vaccines (sorry that got really long)  Favourite band: no way could I choose one, refer to above list lol  Best trip: one of the best was when I went volunteering in Israel when I was 17 and made really good friends with another volunteer, we lived and worked together and we had an amazing time exploring Jerusalem and the markets and free pita and hummus, we had our local bar we would go drink and play cards every other night, I designed her tattoo that she got out there on her ankle and the tattoo parlour became our best friends  Looooong hair I can sit on it  Wavy but because it‚Äôs long it makes it straighter  Blonde  Green eyes  Not sporty lol, but not really high maintenance either (except for my anxieties and anorexia)... ok lol I am also stubborn haha, but in general I am pretty chilled and easy going  My style is like cute dresses or playsuits or lil skirts and t shirts, and sometimes it‚Äôs kinda retro? Sometimes skinny jeans or leggings with big snuggly jumpers too  Sunny makes me happy and I can wear what I want without freezing my tits off, but my room is an attic and I love the sound the rain makes on the roof when I‚Äôm warm and toasty inside   Any vacation sounds good to me lol! I love trying new things though  Unfortunately a night owl because I‚Äôm not very good at getting to sleep but I‚Äôm gonna have to change that around fast lol because I got a new job with 5am shifts starting at the end of this month üò¨",False,False

(damien jurado's ""caught in the trees"" album is incredible).  \- I travel a lot, so this is tough. I camped in Patagonia for 3 weeks last winter, and that is probably near the top of my list.  \- Long hair right now; but every 3 or so years, I cut it super short (above my shoulders) and then just let it grow. It's dark brown mostly, but gets a lot lighter/beachier as it gets longer. Brown eyes too.  \- My style is really...utilitarian? Jeans, t-shirt, puffer jacket, blundstones. I've had to adapt slightly for work, but I'm glad to work in a place where a plaid shirt is totally acceptable.   \- Rainy, I guess. I'm not a fan of summer (too hot and sweaty), and definitely prefer winter. Oh, and early riser for the most part.",False,False

I like sooo many different kinds of music. I don‚Äôt know that I have a favorite.   Not technically my favorite band, but my mom took my best friend and I to a Sugarland concert when I was little, so they always bring back the best memories.   I loved a trip I took with one of my best friends to NYC. It was really quick but we had the best time and met some of the most interesting people. I don‚Äôt know how New Yorkers got the reputation for being rude, because that‚Äôs never been my experience!   My hair really really needs a trim, but it‚Äôs to my waist and super straight. It‚Äôs a whole ordeal to get enough volume into it, but when it‚Äôs done, I love it. I‚Äôm kind of brunette now with the tiniest touch of auburn in the light.   I have blue eyes.   I‚Äôm a little high maintenance, and unapologetic haha  My style is usually as close to Parisienne as I can get, though life outside of work usually means I‚Äôm more Lululemon than St Laurent.   I love the rain, and I could spend forever in the ocean, but I live and work close enough to the beach that a snowy mountain trip would be more of a treat.
