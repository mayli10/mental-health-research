I had emergency surgery and I left the hospital 20kg yes KG heavier. That was because I was in septic shock and they had to pump me full of saline and plasma for days to save my life.  The 2 kg is literally just 2 liters of fluid they used during surgery to deliver meds etc that stick around. Often there is urinary retention after surgery so it takes longer than normal to get rid of it.,False,False
