Diarrhea can sometimes occur alongside refeeding syndrome, but refeeding syndrome primarily affects the heart, muscles, breathing, blood sugar, and body temp, as it has to do with metabolizing carbohydrates rather than pure digestion.   But for anyone restricting it's so important to be aware of, because it can be fatal, so good on you for keeping OP aware ðŸ‘Œ",False,False

Personally, I had to figure out what foods end up causing it when I break the fast. And generally Iâ€™m okay if the fast is relatively short, like 36 hours.   I canâ€™t have *anything* dairy right off the bat- thatâ€™ll give me legit liquid poop and itâ€™s terrible. Really acidic fruits will make me vomit. Spicy food is hell. Soup is actually a bit dangerous. Pretty much anything that could potentially upset a stomach, will.   So I make sure to be consistent (usually) with what I use to break my fast. Plain oatmeal, plain toast, plain rice. Things that are gentle and in small quantities. Then in an hour or so Iâ€™ll let myself have something more and not as gentle. Basically I just give my body time to adjust.   That or I break and eat a huge pile of nachos and am miserable for the next two days. Ha ha. Not that Iâ€™m totally going through that right now or anything. &lt;_&lt;",False,False
