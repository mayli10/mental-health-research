She's tried super hard to disguise that:  1. Obviously she has her clothing sitting differently. But the offset timing is meant to disguise how she's angling how she's ""scooped and swooped"" to look as different as possible in one day. Her bra band sits identically, though, and if I lost even 5 pounds I'd probably need to adjust my bra hooks. 2. Hairstyle- in the ""fat"" version she always sweeps her hair back to expose her armpit/forehead pudge. 3. She moves SUPER fast to hide her hands and you never see her manicure on well the ""before"", but it's pretty much always apparent on the  ""after"". From the brief flashes in the ""before"", they look identical to me. 4. Why randomly take pictures facing 2 sides of the same kitchen with super different color temps if you really want a fair comparison?
