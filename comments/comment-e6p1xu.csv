I was the manager and had to listen to these people rip apart every new person we hired, before even giving them a chance to learn the way things worked around there. Also heard them talk so much shit about me as well. It was such a busy place and I worked so fucking hard every day and gave them whatever they wanted and still with that crap. Worst place I ever worked and it completely soured the industry for me. Which sucks because I kind of enjoyed the work and felt like I was good at parts of it. I don’t think I’ve encountered more backstabby shit ever in my life, except maybe high school. People fucking suck!!",False,False

In my experience a ton of people in the restaurant industry are very high-drama, catty, and gossipy. I worked as a hostess for a bit, my roommates are both bartenders, and my sister was a server for 2 years. We all have had experiences as different jobs at different restaurants and the result was the same: cliquey, gossipy, and people being rude to make themselves feel better. I’m sorry you were the target of everyone else’s insecurities :(",False,False
