Why 16. Not really sure tbh. Or I will have this odd recurring dream where I'm sitting in a empty room with a mirror but I cant seem to see myself in it just some black figure blocking me from seeing myself. Also kinda off topic I guess but does anyone know any tricks to get sleep paralysis? My old ways of doing it are no longer working and it really sucks cause the adrenaline rush from it is exhilarating.,False,False

Could've sworn I was out"": wake up this morning and only remembered the dream when I open the pantry and I am indeed out of Clif bars)",False,False
