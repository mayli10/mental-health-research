Like, I'm majorly obsessed with the size and shape of my body, but cellulite is something I've rationalised in my brain because it's *so normal* for women that I don't think twice about it.   I often forget that it's something that's not necessarily accepted by society at large (or at least, some people). Like, a friend of mine the other day was talking about a girl he likes and he said ""she's got nice thighs - no cellulite"" and it was really jarring for me because I was shocked it was even something he would care about. And even now, after hearing him mention it, I still don't really care about it because it's not something that can be changed.   It's odd how some things are so important to me and others don't matter at all.",False,False
