Iâ€™m trying to get a dietitian right now. I have a feeling additional structure to my eating would take a whole lot of weight off my shoulders, if that makes sense. Iâ€™d love to just put all my food worries and calorie/intake related thoughts into a professionalâ€™s hands. It feels hard to trust my own intuition with eating, even when I am trying to take proper care of myself.",False,False

Is there any other way you can get more support without going inpatient? Like for example going to a dietitian, support groups, more therapy or just anything that you think will help you? Iâ€™m glad your boyfriend is so supportive. Itâ€™s always easier when you have someone you can talk to and who encourages you to get better. Thank you for asking. Right now Iâ€™m doing okay. Iâ€™m going out with some friends and that will hopefully take my mind off of things a bit.",False,True

If you struggle with falling a sleep maybe try listening to audiobooks. I often have a hard time falling asleep bc I overthink literally everything. Audiobooks really helped bc I canâ€™t listen and overthink at the same time. But hey at least you catched up on some sleep today! xx,False,True

Thank you for the encouragement!! I totally agree that recovery and pursuing recovery is the only way things will get better. And I do, I have my boyfriend. Heâ€™s my biggest cheerleader and honestly Iâ€™m so grateful for him. How about you? Also, just in general, any encouragement or reassurance you need to hear right now?",False,False

Iâ€™m not sure how the health system works in the US but isnâ€™t inpatient covered by your insurance? good that youâ€™re trying to push yourself! ðŸ’•I know itâ€™s hard but ultimately thatâ€™s the only way that things will get a bit better.

A week ago my psychiatrist said sheâ€™d like me to go back to inpatient but I donâ€™t have the ability to take time off work or the money. But Iâ€™m pushing through.
