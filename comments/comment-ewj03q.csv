I don't get why I miss that.  That introspection is really valuable and I'm proud of you for recognizing that your desire is irrational.   &gt;I think it's a mix of things. Thinness in society equals hard work, success, beauty, and it's also an outward cry for help.   I get that so so much. I want to be sick. It's extremely irrational but I want it.   To answer your question : I hope not. Some people claim to recover to the point that the thoughts aren't there, or at least not nearly as common. Have you tried therapy? It's not a perfect cure but it's about as close as you can get.   &gt;I want to lose weight, but I know that's a slippery slope for me.   This already indicates a willingness to recover, so I implore you to seek out therapy because you're already a good portion the way there. Not that it'll be easy - it won't. But you have a good shot.",False,False
