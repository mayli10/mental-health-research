Take a minute to mindfully breathe. I promise no one thought you were cuter when you were skinnier, if anything the people who love you would find you cuter now beacause you're healthier :). getting to the point of being physically recovered is really difficult and you should be hella proud of yourself. Dont let your ED tell you things would've been different if you were unhealthily skinny. Their will be more auditions. Their will be more rules. This one missed opportunity does not make or break your acting carear. Anyways, imagine you were dying-level-skinny and you got the role,  you wouldn't be able to properly act for it while being malnourished and low energy. I'm sorry things are tough rn but itll get better. Try and be kind to yourself tonight okay &lt;3",False,False
