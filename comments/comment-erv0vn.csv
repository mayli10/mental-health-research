The only way I know how to tell the difference between sativa and indica is indica has big fat short buds and sativa they tend to have long skinny buds. Most weed is a mix of both and not straight up either type.,False,False

Which is too bad cause they‚Äôre more relaxing, and hence more appealing. But I definitely feel less munchies with sativa. You can ask the people working which strains induce hunger and then not got those ones! They don‚Äôt judge.",False,False

I can‚Äôt remember what strains I specifically used to smoke but I just told the guy at the counter I didn‚Äôt want to get the munchies and he hooked me up.,False,False

Thank you! I have concluded the hunger depends on one as a person. Do u have any favorite concentrates or strains?,False,True
ff64ngi,t3_erv0vn,t1_ff641yk,CloudySideDown,1,2020-01-21 09:03:46,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/erv0vn/cannabis/ff64ngi/,Sativa can also increase anxiety and other issues. I exclusively smoke indica or indica dominant strains because I have PTSD and anxiety issues. Smoking sativa dominant strains put me on edge paranoia and anxiety. I smoke to relax and chill out. I also have to say that indica never gave me the munchies any more so than sativa does. Your mileage may vary.,False,False

That being said, you‚Äôll be less likely to get hungry with Sativa strains versus indica or even hybrids. So really aim for those, they‚Äôre your best bet",False,False
