I slept between 0-1.5 hours a day for 2 weeks somehow without feeling tired and was eating close to nothing. I was overweight and wanting to lose weight for a long time, but I think primarily my manic energy and level of activity made me forget about food and I never felt hunger vs me very actively trying to restrict. Since then I’ve been put on a mood stabilizer, and experience more mild depressive episodes, but struggle so so much with binge eating during them. So yeah, definitely a correlation for me",False,False

Of course, when I am in certain moods I do tend to feel differently about food than when I'm normal and level-headed, so it makes sense that bipolar would make an ED worse.",False,False

I’ve never been diagnosed with an ED, but I go through periods of really intense restricting and intense binging. t’s never enough to get me diagnosed, but it definitely is because of bipolar.   What’s weird though is that it seems like I both restrict and binge within each mood. Like there are times when I am hypomanic where I will say “there’s no reason to eat I don’t need food “but also times where I say “life is too short why not eat everything” but this also happens when I’m depressed.   it’s hard to explain, and sounds kind of confusing when I’m writing it out, but basically within each mood, Depending on the situation, I fluctuate between between the two.",False,False

I binge when depressed, restrict when manic. When I'm feeling super impulsive, I binge. When I want to feel something, anything, I binge. When I think I'm the hottest shit ever, I restrict. They are inexplicably tied together.",False,False
