Its more like I give myself permission to eat. Every time I reach a low weight this happens. I think it's the whole ""battle"" part. When I'm really thin the good part of my mind is like ""its ok, you're thin, I know you don't feel that way but you are. Be kind to me! Eat Sierra!:)"" of course I always regret it but hey. Those good parts are keeping me here! :)",False,False

And it happens right at the cutoff point for me, too. At about 104, I'm ok. Under, and I start feeling like shit really fast. Athletic performance starts to suffer, too.  Almost as if that cutoff point is there because of a reason, lol ",False,False

I've been recovered and get what you're saying.  I experienced it but eventually reached the point where I was satiated and whatever else I ate was for pleasure.  This time I'm scared it's going to make me binge eat (even though I never have in my life).  I'm hungry because my (and your) body needs to eat.  My fear's irrational, but I think it demonstrates how the hunger does get back to ""normal"" hunger.  Nice work if you're aiming to gain that weight.  Just go with (sorry for the cliche) whatever your body needs.  That's only my advice, I'm not a therapist lol.  x",False,False

Atm I eat high fat diet (50%) but low cals and seriously always full so easily. My dietician has asked me to try more carbs so I can put on weight. But I find it hard maybe bc I eat too much fat. If you want to satiate yourself on very little try cutting out carbs and feast upon hummous, Thai curries, bibimbap, ranch dressing, fried veggies, avocado crackers mmm yum! Nom nom nom. I can never clear my plate with these things and so full for ages. ",False,False

The lower you are from your ""natural weight range"" (why some people are naturally BMI 18 and others BMI 24 with a diet consisting of the same foods), the lower your satiety hormone levels drop. When satiety hormones are in balance with hunger hormones, eating until satiety leads to weight maintenance. After weight loss they are not in balance, and eating until satiety leads to weight gain until they eventually are in balance again.  That's just an unfortunate reality that anyone wanting to be an ""artificial weight"" has to deal with. My natural weight even with a healthy diet and some exercise is nearly overweight, but my current artificial weight that I maintain by enduring hunger daily is BMI 16.8.",False,False
