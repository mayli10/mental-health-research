But over the months I’ve become even scared of 700, and it just keeps going. I’m doing 399 right now because I tried 300 but after like 4 days of going it, I’d have a day where I’d binge and go up to like 800-1000 and hate myself. So I’ve been doing 399 for a few weeks and it’s going well - I’ve been Meal planning and eating 3 times a day too. There have been a couple of days where I’ve eaten 400-600, but I didn’t panic and exercised it off. Anyway, it’s going ok for now lmao. But we’ll see!",False,True
