Not related to my ED, but I had a similar experience once and I was mortified. I had just come out as trans a few weeks before a new semester had started and  the professor in my first class asked me my name before I answered a question (he was the kind of prof that wanted to get know all of his students) and I was really nervous, wasn't sure if I should introduce myself with my preferred name or not, especially in front of the entire class, so I hesitated and then some guy (I didn't see who, but it was probably somebody I had class with before since I was already being read as female by strangers constantly) shouted out ""he doesn't even know his name"". Like obviously I know my own name... I just can't believe some people can be so clueless to how their ""jokes"" make other people feel or that they could just not care if they hurt somebody for a quick laugh. I know when it happened to me that I didn't hear a single person laugh except the guy who shouted that out. Normal people don't even find this kind of thing funny, so I wonder where people get the confidence to act this way.",False,False
