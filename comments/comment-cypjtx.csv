I'm an American so I wish I could advise you, but I don't know how NHS appeals work. If I'm asking dumbass questions just ignore me, but I tried to google this, and the NHS does cover pumps, right? (I'm seeing that the NHS takes the same bullshit position on CGM as Medicare, which is basically that they won't fund it so...I'm not sure there's anything to be done there.) Do you meet the ""NICE"" requirements, and did your doctor say you needed this equipment, and file the appropriate paperwork? Because I'm looking at the JDRF site and it says you cannot be refused a pump in that case.   However, I'm guessing you fall under ABCD guidelines instead, and your doctor was supposed to make a case for you, and failed? In that case, what has your doctor said about this? Do they think you're in danger?   Please don't lose hope. I know this is very bad news, but Medicare also has shitty diabetes coverage, and my grandma deals with similar issues. It really sucks, but it shouldn't be a death sentence. Right? If it is a matter of life or death, you *have* to keep fighting to either get this equipment covered or else go to the media, open a Kickstarter, do all the things that underinsured Americans unfortunately often do. Your life has value, even if your brain (and health service) is trying to tell you otherwise.",False,False
