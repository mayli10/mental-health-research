She's now succesfully passed the issues onto you, but that doesn't mean her own problems are gone.      It's definitely all horrible things to say, and you don't deserve to have to listen to that. If it's necessary for your mental health to limit contact, so be it.   I hope her nasty words don't hurt your recovery too much",False,False

Family therapy has been suggested and maybe even tried.     Last things. You can't control her. You just can't. She's awful. But you can control how she effects you. It's great you're venting here to people who get it.  I hope you have a therapist and irl support groups and friends to get healthy support from. I validate your feelings and commend your efforts. Also i would understand if you straight up NEED TO SAY: ""mom when you say xyz it undermines my feelings and efforts in recovery. If you can't be more cognizant of your own behaviors and actions i can no longer continue to listen or participate in topics pertaining to xyz with you out of concern for my own well being. Be prepared she might freak out. But it's basically best way of telling her to stfu while being a class act and using I statements and some great cbt skills",False,False
