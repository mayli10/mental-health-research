Relative risk can be misleading if the absolute risk is small. The example used in the study material was the recent/ish headlines about red meat increasing cancer risk by 20%, which is true, although in actual fact it‚Äôs still incredibly small. So don‚Äôt freak out if you love your diet sodas! I think we all know anyway that they‚Äôre not the healthiest choices, and if you cut down your intake that‚Äôs a good thing üôÉ",False,False

I didn't have a choice - I was told I would never regain full use of my knees if I didn't meet a specific protein or at least calorie goal to maintain muscle after my surgery. That said, diabetes makes it much easier to abuse eating patterns. On restrictive days I wouldn't have to take any extra insulin for carbs, and on binge days I could either take a bunch of insulin if I felt like it since I had a stockpile or I could not take insulin and feel like I was doing something because I would pee so much and drink so much water from the high blood sugar it helped give the stomach a flat appearance. But yes, I am doing okay now and I very much appreciate the sentiment. Thank you.",False,False
