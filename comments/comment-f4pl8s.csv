I've been struggling after a party over last weekend and got some food events coming up but I've tried upping my calories some and I'm scared of weight gain and I'm still fighting to keep it a slow gain/ maintenance because the scale isn't being my buddy  I was thinking about not letting myself go to a thing the 26th because food was gonna be involved but it's letting the negative thoughts win if I let that be the reason why I'm not going. It's a chili + wild game dish competition dinner with everything going to be home-made including desserts so it seems intimidating but it's alright to let myself indulge? Only happens once a year and I've never been but worst case scenario I can just try a little bit of what seems the best option and call it enough instead of going in more because I'm a sucker for sweets as much as I hate it,False,False

Iâ€™ve had an awful weekend of nonstop binge and purge after restricting like crazy for weeks. My body is falling apart and Iâ€™m honestly just rotting from the inside out. I think itâ€™s time to really put effort into recovery.,False,False
