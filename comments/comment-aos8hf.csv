We dont glorify anything and if anything we push others to recovery. We want recovery &gt; all, but in the meantime it helps having a place to vent. But i guess according to high and mighty r/fasting we need to suffer in silence.",False,False

The psychology is totally different. Fasting safely and semi-infrequently is not going to destroy your body or your mind like living in a constant state of deprivation. It's like getting drunk in Friday might versus getting drunk every night. Fasting does not equal eating disorder. ,False,False

Everyone that has ED  doesn't necessarily fasts.   I don't think anyone is saying that fasting is 100% disordered behaviour. No one is projecting their ED thoughts on others - we are simply recognising patterns that we have in common. No need to get defensive on their side. I would rather suggest them to rethink some of their behaviour and mindsets.,False,False
