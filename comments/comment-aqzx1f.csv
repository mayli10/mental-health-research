Obviously it's very different for everyone, but what has been a huge help for me lately is I am going 10 days without foods that have processed sugars. I find that if I'm eating until I'm full(but not overeating) healthy foods, I dont feel the need to purge. I think maybe a crucial ""mistake"" (I dont think its inherently wrong, just maybe what triggered you) was that you ate something somewhat unhealthy and in a bigger portion than was needed. I'm not trying to criticize, I promise, just throwing out a possible issue. If that kept you full for a long time, eating other foods would just pile up and make you feel sick.  I hope that helps you a little. If you need anything, feel free to DM me. Also if you havent please have something to get electrolytes back up! Your post has me worried about you, I hope you can realize that you're worth health and happiness and can power through and have something to replenish your body",False,False
