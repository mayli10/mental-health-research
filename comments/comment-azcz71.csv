No one in my real life knows about my ED even though I've been struggling for ~15 years and my weight/habits have been all over the place. It's so frustrating because I could really use their help. But my family culture is such that they don't acknowledge mental health needs and would never be willing/able to help me.  It sucks, but makes me glad I have this sub to turn to. The community here is the only support system I have.üñ§",False,False

It's just hard to understand unless you've been there",False,False

I think in times like these you have to be your own support system. Yes, you are disordered, but there is still a rational side to you. Be kind to yourself, acknowledge your struggle, treat your mind and your body the way they deserve to be treated. &lt;3   Of course, you always have this sub and me if you ever feel like PMing to vent or just chat. &lt;3",False,False
