I find that its easier for me to not binge when I have 1000-1200 as my limit and sometimes I'll be 400 under whereas if I restricted I'd be over 800.,False,False

I was in exactly the same situation a couple months back - really struggling with severe binging + low restriction + laxative abuse.  It was a nightmare and I felt so defeated.  I forced myself to up my calories to around 1000 and work out most days to quiet the panic - and it worked.  I just didn't need to binge anymore, and the running and strength training was so good for my mood and mental health, and made me feel like I had a strong, capable body again, which I thought the ED had stolen from me forever.  It's been such a positive experience, you deserve it, I believe in you and I hope you have the best time.",False,False

Thankyou for posting this, i recently have had to up my calories to around 1200 a day because of the dietician and i mentally feel like shit because it still feels like a lot even though i can still lose from it :/  This made me feel slightly less alone. Feel like im faking an ed now just because im eafing more :/ i know its nit true but i cat help  thinking it, so this kind of reassured me  I hope you can do it though! Upping your calories even a little and spreading your food throughout the day can really help you stop bingeing, even if there are a few slip ups.",False,False
