It amazes me sometimes how I throw something in on top of what I maintain with and it makes zero difference. You've got to have the extra every day though. When I was doing recovery once and I was told I had to have x amount of calories extra every day to start gaining. I kinda didn't want to recover then, so did it twice the following week to keep them happy and it made no difference to my weight.  It's worth trying because even if you did gain a nth of an ounce you know you'd lose it really quickly (such is the awful power of anorexia).  That's what puts me off recovery - the sheer amount you have to eat to gain.",False,False
