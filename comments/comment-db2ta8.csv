When I did it before I would have to freeze it to really get that ice cream feeling, and it usually froze rock solid so that was annoying to thaw out.",False,False

Also if I‚Äôm feeling something crunchy and salty I make air popped popcorn and add a lil salt on top, they are really low cal and pretty filling if you ask me.",False,False

Wasn‚Äôt expecting that, I will definitely do the banana thing and the baked goods replacement.

These r just personal recipes i use from time to time when i get sick of my shitty safe foods haha   ice cream: blend up a banana with light greek yogurt and whatever flavorings (fruit, cocoa powder, etc) u want! or try halo top or some low cal ice cream brand but they‚Äôre so expensive rip  fries/ chips: slice up 1 potato (i use sweet potato) with seasoning, a little light oil spray, bake that babey in the oven at 425¬∞ for like 15-25 mins depending on thickness, and enjoy (i dip them in hummus &lt;3)  juice/ soda: crystal light powder + like 2 cups of sparkling water. yum i use a caffeinated knockoff version of crystal light i could prob find the exact brand if u want  baked goods: ok obviously nothing can imitate the satisfaction of sinking ur teeth into some luxuriously doughy yet horrifically calorific treat, but i find that oatmeal w/ cinnamon, crushed walnuts, chia seeds, and frozen blueberries makes god-tier blueberry muffin flavored oats. other add-in ingredient ideas: banana, cocoa powder or pb2 powder, strawberries, light agave/ stevia, pumpkin pur√©e + spices, cacao nibs.  instant ramen: a packet of instant miso soup powder + add ins like egg, veggies, tofu, konjac noodles  also this isn‚Äôt rlly a replacement for anything but one of the most luxurious yet restrictive breakfasts I‚Äôve created is: 1 frozen waffle, 2 tsp nut butter (use pb2 for even lower cals), and 1 tbsp sugar free jam. It‚Äôs just over 200 calories and the pb gets all melty n warm on the waffle and it just tastes so heavenly lol üòáü•úüçìü•û",False,False
