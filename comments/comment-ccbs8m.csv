At that weight I was clearly underweight, but I still carried noticeable fat in my legs, upper cheeks, and lower stomach.  Natalia looks much thinner than I was at 90 pounds.

My BMI was around 17 then and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù.  But most of that cast is tiny height-wise from seeing them out and about.,False,False

She had a period between seasons where she looked healthier but recent photoshoots and appearances have her thinner than I've ever seen her. Even if it's not an ED (there are many different reasons a person could be underweight) being that thin has critical side effects. Even if it's ""natural"" it could be a crisis if she got ill.
