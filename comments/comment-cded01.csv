Her response was to go ""Wait, you?"" cause I was overweight at the time. Guess who didn't eat more than 100 calories a day for the next two months hint it was me",False,False

Well, his comment was: ""Yeah, but the difference is that other people really do have depression."" ... Okay... Thx, I guess? I mean... I am good at hiding my true feelings and I act all normal around other people and try to not be too obvious with my eating habits etc. But when I tried to tell someone, tried to open up, I actually thought I'd get support and not a remark like that.   People also never believe that I am actually underweight, because I don't look underweight.. I know it sucks. You're feeling invalid, but that's not fair at all. I wish some people would think more before they're saying crap like that.",False,False

I got tests done and I matched anorexic blood work, doctor said I was emaciated and at anorexic BMI, told therapist I didn't believe the diagnosis and she read aloud the criteria and we went through it together. All of that came undone when I went to a few friends for support when treatment felt like too much to handle alone. My friends were like, ""you? ... REALLY?"" It hurt. I'm so sorry you're going through this too. You are worthy of treatment. You are worthy of a healthy life after treatment. Please keep going. Also please keep in mind that you don't have to be your friends' definition of ""sick enough"" to get treatment. Your friends should be supportive during this difficult time. If they aren't, it doesn't hurt to say ""I need support right now.""",False,False
