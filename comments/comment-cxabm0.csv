Edys slow churned ice cream is about 100-130 cals depending on the flavor so I just get that but itâ€™s so much harder to not overeat it bc it comes in such a big tub   Lately my fiancÃ© will buy bigger packs of things like Hershey kisses (I usually buy tiny packs so even if I eat them all itâ€™s not too much damage) and just gives me a serving size and hides the rest until I want more,False,True

Might not be many options for you, but the staples they tend to give might offer your bf more substantial variety *and* it might help you feel less guilty about needing safe foods.
