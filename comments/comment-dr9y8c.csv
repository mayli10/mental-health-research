I think I’M often that person in a relationship, I get depressed and bad at replying to texts. Doesn’t always mean anything. My best friend from high school and I have drifted and come back so many times, and the essence of our bond is always still there - relationships expand and contract.   I wish one of my current friends was more caring. She knows about my issues, has seen me lose a ton of weight lately, knows I’ve gone days fasting, etc etc etc, but she still doesn’t GET IT and is still able to trigger the shit out of me with stuff she says and with her just not getting that it’s serious. That and idk if she has body dysmorphia but she literally weighs 100 lbs more than I do and still says we should go plus size shopping and stuff???? It’s the most crazy triggering shit but I also love her to death and she’s great otherwise soooo.... 🤷🏼‍♀️",False,False
