There’s a decent percentage of people whose bodies just can’t tolerate sugar substitutes (artificial, natural, or both — I’m one of the “both” people, grr). Halo top has erythritol and steviol glycosides, which causes a bad reaction for some. I get stomach cramps and sooo nauseated for the whole day after just a couple bites of HT, so it’s just not worth it.  I stick to tiny (100ml or so) tubs of real ice cream and sometimes Ben and Jerry’s moophoria (light ice cream without fake sugars... about 1/2 the calories of regular b and j but twice that of halo top). Still wish I could dive into a pint of halo top sometimes :(",False,False
