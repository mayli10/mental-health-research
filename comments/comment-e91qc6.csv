It seems fo be a tough situation for you guys. Im not a professional and not in a relationship with someone with an ED so take this with a grain of salt but in what ive seen with my friendships, people can get competitive, so you might want to tread carefully with that. Not sure if you are at this stage yet, but one thing that has helped me talk about my issues with my bf is talking about how the triggers affect me. Im still uncomfortable admitting I have a bad relationship with food with people I know IRL so what I do is talk about how i feel anxious about all of the work I need to do, my bad grades, my friendship issues, or feeling inferior. He helps me navigate it and identify where the anxiety comes from and how its often all in my head. Perhaps that might be a better segue into talking about it directly with her?",False,False
