Whenever I‚Äôve got a planned cheat day coming up I always start to crave candy and chips but once the day comes it‚Äôs always like ‚ÄúI *could* eat these Twizzlers...

Every time I give in and binge real pasta now I get an awful heavy feeling that sucks. üòî  BUT what I have found is edamame pasta tastes better and has a better texture than shirataki pasta, but it's still way lower than actual semolina pasta. I actually prefer the flavour and texture to normal pasta now as I find them more substantial and flavourful (like, I still crave plain carby pasta sometimes, but these are really nice, kind of like soba noodles).  [This is the brand I use](https://slendier.com/product/edamame-bean-organic-spaghetti/) but idk if it will be available in your area - but it might give you something to look for more locally? It's been a good compromise for me between ""I don't have the 400cal to spend on the amount of pasta I want before I even add any sauce BUT I really can't stomach a bowl full of konjac right now"".",False,False
