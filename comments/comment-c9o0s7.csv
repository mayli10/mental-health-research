Honestly, anxiety is going to happen. You know it. Embrace it. You're going to feel like shit for a while. Own that. It's just a feeling. It can't actually hurt you. Ignore the thoughts, block them out, distract yourself with something else (paint your nails, do a face mask, read a book, knit, crochet, do a colouring book, learn an instrument, learn a new language etc). Basically as one of my fave YouTubers (megsyrecovery) says ""Feel shit &amp; do it anyway"".  I figured I already felt like shit regardless of my weight but feeling like shit at a healthier weight &amp; using ""normal"" behaviour (aka no calorie counting, no purging, no overexercise) was less likely to actually kill me!   Wishing you loads of luck!",False,False
