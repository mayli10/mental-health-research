I spent the entire film waiting for her to be on screen, just so I could take in her appearance in different angles and lighting. And then I needed to pee mid film, so I went to the toilet and body checked way too much in the cinema mirrors.  I've always admired AJ from a young age, viewing her as perfection and hoping I could be even a fraction of the woman she is. Wonder if that plays into my ED in any way.",False,False
