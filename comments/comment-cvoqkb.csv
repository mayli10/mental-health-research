I made small bullet point notes to read them and try to say the topic in my head while walking. Maybe something like that, or recording yourself like the others said might be a good idea to compensate for it  Either way good luck on your paper and i hope you can handle this obsession in the near future D: i know it can be hard",False,False

Based on my current weight its pretty obvious it's been years since that's happened but I get it.   Once during my exercise obsession/ exercise bulimia phase I went for a bike ride hung over. Big mistake. Totally threw up on a bike path. Thank god no one was around. I walked my bike most of the way back home and only rode a short way once I got closer to home so my parents wouldnt question me. Then I forced myself to eat a banana and drink water and spent the rest of the day lounging around, what I should have done in the first place.",False,False
