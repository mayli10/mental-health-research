I do have a prescription that helps tremendously, but doesn't stop the attacks.  Restricting and the winter is always the worst. And summers are surprisingly bad because office areas are so dang cold.       My dad also has it and he told me that when he starts to eat more it gets a lot better. He's also thin as a rail.       Make sure to keep lots of layers on. At night I have ""rice bag"" I have made and heat up in the microwave to keep warm. Wool socks tend to make my feet cold and sweaty, so I tend to avoid wearing those during the day when I'm not working out. Working out twice a day also helps keep my blood pumping. But the no blood in your fingers and toes, causing the cold and numbness is literally the worst.",False,False

Maybe invest in those hand warmer pack thingies and they have them for feet too i think? Also make sure to try and keep all parts of your body warm to help regulate your temp and encourage blood circulation,False,False

My podiatrist recommended anti wicking socks or copper socks and the copper socks are life changing. I went from being in tears daily to maybe once a week. Also, “warm skin” cream is somewhat helpful for my hands although nothing really helps the bone chill",False,False
