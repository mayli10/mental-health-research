On another note, I completely understand where you‚Äôre coming from with the dainty smaller than my bf thing when it comes to dating bigger guys. It‚Äôs not unreasonable at all to want to feel small and feminine with a romantic partner x",False,False

As a guy who's had friends who are short, I can confirm it does indeed fuck with their self esteem at times.  I still agree with your last sentence, you shouldn't have to settle, but we all deserve love(generalization, exceptions exist).",False,False

So many dudes in here put their heights in their bios... Is that something people actually ask about?"" And he immediately told me his height without feeling like I was asking. So I tried it a few more times. And every tall guy told me without a fuss and every short guy complained about how too many girls are fussy about that sort of thing.

It's absolutely not worth getting worked up over trolls, that's what they want.  Also, that triggering you're feeling is exactly why they do this, because that's what they feel when rejected because of their height.  These people typically refer to online dating as a market like ebay or silkroad. The more specific your buying criteria, the harder it will be to find the right deal.  This doesn't mean you settle. Life's too...  short... to commit to an unhappy path.",False,False

And yeah...i think it's pretty natural to want to be w someone taller than u! I kno personally, i feel more comforted snd safe and i like being the little spoon üò§üò§. plus, Lord knows when i dated a guy shorter than me ppl lost their minds. ""HoW dO yOu gUyS KiSs???""
