It gets really awkward because sometimes, I have a feeling that some of them don’t really buy it and I also feel pretty guilty for always having to lie to my family and friends. Anyways, I genuinely do hope you develop a healthier relationship with food in the future &lt;3 Take care ",False,True

I relapsed into anorexia due to changing my eating habits to become healthier so I can't stand eating junk food. It makes me feel disgusting. I also used to love curry but ever since I became of how calorically dense it is, it doesn't seem as appetizing. Since my mother is aware of my restrictive habits recently I find it difficult to force myself to eat ""junk"" in order to make myself look ""normal"". You aren't the only one :(",False,False
