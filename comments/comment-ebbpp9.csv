It is OK. Weight restoration will continue.  Also my skin has been low key yellow for a few years now, no period for 4 years, been UW or borderline UW for a yearish but was BMI 18.5-20 for the three prior (briefly over 20 but actively losing weight then). I don't think it's liver stuff because I don't restrict that much, I just have issues eating TDEE (which is why I'm disordered and no and ED ) and I'm very 'clean eating' and a bit of a starch phone so I eat lots of carrots instead of like, potatoes or bread. But low key like that's just carotenemia right... Would it go away with weight restoration or..  Since I'm rambling already, I appreciate the support I get to weight restore but I'm fairly certain that those that aren't recovering but support me take a private joy in knowing that I'm gaining and eating more than them. Don't blame yah. ^(I have a recovery insta with my food and exercise logs btw same username no bodychecks ^yet? Because am shy ^? )",False,False
