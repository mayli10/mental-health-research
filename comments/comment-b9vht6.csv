I very very rarely get migraines (like I've had no more than 5 in my 24 years) and a couple of months ago one hit where I suddenly couldn't speak properly, I just couldn't get the proper words out, it was all jumbled up but there was nothing I could do about it. I was reading just prior to this and couldn't make sense of any of the words either.  I was terrified I was having a stroke but it turns out that sometimes this happens with migraines, though it's apparently uncommon. Sure enough it hit fully about ten minutes later.  I'm not saying this is what happened with you but it could maybe be a factor if you had head pain at any point",False,False

These kinds of symptoms are very consistent with heart attack symptoms, and even if it wasn't a heart attack, many cases begin with prodromal symptoms (ie, early signs of an illness before it takes place). The issues you described about not being able to talk properly could also be symptomatic of something like TSA (transient ischaemic attack) so I really wouldn't just let this one slide without seeking medical attention.  Hope things turn out ok. ♥️",False,False

In fact, the wrong sounds and syllables are coming out instead???  This scares me in particular. That's a symptom of a stroke.  Please be willing to go in for some kind of medical evaluation.
