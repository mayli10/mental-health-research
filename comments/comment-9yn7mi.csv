I usually try not to talk for the rest of the day, and I also drink a cup or two of cashew milk. Warmed up is nice too! Unsweetened is best if you can find it since sugar makes my throat feel worse. Cold applesauce is a nice refresher too for the next day.   Take careüíú ",False,False

Drink something for electrolytes, rinse out your mouth with a bit of baking soda and water but don't brush. Gargle salt water for the hurt throat. If you can tolerate honey it has antibacterial properties and is good in tea. And forgive yourself because you're not as horrible as the EDemon wants you to believe ‚ù§",False,False
