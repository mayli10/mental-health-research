That sucks that you built up that courage and it didn’t go well.   Sometimes people need to put up boundaries with what they can and can’t handle. My brother had the same sort of reaction when I confided in him but I understand now that he was protecting his own mental health and sanity.  I hope you can tell someone like a parent or older relative - they are usually more capable to be able to deal with these things better.,False,False

Or possibly she just knows that she's not a professional and doesn't feel qualified to say anything at all (which may seem heartless, but the responses I've gotten were ""you're so thin, though, start eating more"" or ""you don't look that bad,"" both of which were crazy triggering and actively made me worse). And/or possibly she just doesn't like to engage in people's serious issues if it makes her feel bad feelings - which is valid and we should all feel comfortable opting out of situations we find toxic.  BUT there's a line somewhere between protecting yourself and just being emotionally lazy/disengaged. Hard to say where she falls without knowing backstory. Anyway, it really sucks to try to lean on someone for support and fall through thin air instead. I'm really sorry :( But I hope your relationship with her survives.",False,False
