Not too long ago I saw something on reddit about a girl that went to inpatient and refused to eat, and one of the nurses/wards/etc. got down on her level and said something like “You don’t need to prove to me you’re hurting. Tell me.”      Your therapist is there to help you, TALK to her and TELL her your hurting, instead of trying to SHOW her. She knows you are already, no need to prove it &lt;3 sending good vibes",False,False
