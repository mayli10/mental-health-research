It is safe to use daily unlike most laxatives because it is an osmotic laxative (works by drawing water into the intestines to help push the fecal matter along) as opposed to a stimulant laxative.,False,False

It's an overnight laxative so shouldn't be a big deal. First day nothing really happened for over 12 hours and then I went to bathroom once. Not fun. Still super bloated, so I took another that night. Second day was awful. Needed to not have a third day. Still a little bloated, but mostly back to normal.",False,False

For instance 2 cups of lettuce or spinach, 2 baby bell peppers, a couple broccoli florets, a few cherry tomatoes, and just some vinegar and salt+pepper on top. Pair it with warm coffee and I always go and it’s pretty low calorie for the amount of food you get to consume.",False,False
