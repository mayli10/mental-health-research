I went from being the fat ugly duckling girl that everyone picked on to this sultry ridiculously hot version of myself in one summer between 8th and 9th grade.

I went from like 130 to 108 in a summer. Got hot. Loved it. After highschool gained back to like 160 then dropped to 120.  I hit 160 again like a month ago.  Now I‚Äôm back at 150 and also back on my bullshit. üôÉ  Hurray binge/ restrict cycles !   FML.   I‚Äôm hoping that I‚Äôll be able to stop and maintain at like 120-130 and try and actually kick this cause I‚Äôm goin on almost 11 years of this bullshit. It‚Äôs fucking up my life in every aspect.   Sorry for the long rant.",False,False
