It’s total bs. Like, docs don’t say “Oh, you have mild cancer” ...cuz it’s effing cancer. It’s all serious. Granted, even if AN was classified by numbers like cancer my brain would probably still run with that...but, the mild/moderate/etc descriptions based on BMI seriously mess with my emotions. I know it’s technically a neutral clinical description that’s only considering the physical side of things...they’re not actually judging the difficulty of my experience...but it sure can feel like judgement. Sorry to hear you’re riding that emotional roller coaster too.",False,False
