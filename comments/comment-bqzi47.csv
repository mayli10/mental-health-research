It feels like I have so many problems and negatively already running through my head that I can't stop feeling beat-down and angry",False,True

I feel you. It’s the implication that’s hurt you, even though it wasn’t her intention.  I think you’re completely within your rights to be upset, and I’m sorry that she put you in that position. I was in the same position as you earlier in the month and I know the awful feeling of other people’s reactions after you’ve been on a spree of binging. I’m sorry ♥️ sending you hope and positivity that I hope you can find in the world around you (hopefully that doesn’t sound disingenuous because I do mean it!)",False,False
