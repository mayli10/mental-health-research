I let him have the cardboard bc that isn’t that bad and he doesn’t do it as much but the bags. Oh god the bags. I have to hide them from him but if he finds them he actually strips the plastic bags and stashes them all over in very strange places, underneath things or in corners I can’t reach etc. he either slowly nibbles them or binges on them all at once and then pukes them up shortly after",False,False

She came from a house with multiple dogs and was the smallest one so I think it's just learned behavior bc otherwise she wouldn't have been able to eat.   She also has a loose esophagus so if she drinks too quickly she'll throw up. She does that multiple times a day. I've started calling her bulimic bc my sense of humor is jacked up.",False,False
