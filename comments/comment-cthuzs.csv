With that, I’m sorry.  I do think in a sub where we’re trying to cultivate a healthy and supportive community regarding EDs, it’s a little inappropriate to be critical of others’ bodies and food choices. I worry that sort of talk is going to be triggering or enabling to those new to recovery or at a point of struggling with their disorder.  OP expressed/clarified what they intended to say, but the majority of comments reflect the same perception I got, which which overtly critical of others. However, again, my own personal standards and the way I choose to talk and think about other people’s behavior isn’t mind to put on or expect of others.
