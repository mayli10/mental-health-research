It a lot cheesy and not something I would watch if it didn’t have the Ed ish storyline and some interesting characters.   Honestly Nonnie (patty’s best friend) is the one of the only characters that is actually likable though.  I probably wouldn’t watch a second season but it wasn’t terrible just not that good and the perceptions in it were for sure healthier than my own and it portrayed food stuff without being overly triggering or overly dumb.  ,False,False
