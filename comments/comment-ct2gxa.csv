I have the same issue when I visit my family for a couple days or a week. They eat crap and I have terrible control when I’m around them.  Have learned to not freak out and drink a ton of water and it will go away after a week or two of being back on my normal routine.,False,False

That said SO MANY posts on here show super toxic home environments for someone with eating issues.  Getting away from toxic environments is so important to feeling less like shit,False,False

You would have had to eaten 3,500 over your regular TDEE to gain even a pound of fat. I don't think you overate 17,500 calories in a week. It's probably all water weight that will flush off as soon as you start eating like you did before.",False,False
