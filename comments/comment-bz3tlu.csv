I started on this bullshit telling myself that starvation is an invisible alternative to cutting....until it wasn't. I'm trying to convince myself that AN is a terrible way to die, but now it's just to important to stay thin.  My stats are really close to yours. Message me if u want another grown up to chat with around here",False,False

The ultimate self harm with an exit strategy.   I’ve since decided that I don’t want to die but turns out my disorder doesn’t give a fuck what I want and I can’t just flip a switch and turn it off.    Big oops.",False,False

Man, I grew up the daughter of a former small time model turned obese. My whole family taught me bad eating habits. I ate because I was emotional, bored, etc. But eventually, it got worse. After I gave birth (which was forced and is a long, traumatic story), I gave up on my body, because I was already fat and ugly.  I tried to be and feel pretty, but I haven't seen under 200lbs since I was 14. I'm 345lbs now.  I just make excuses, because I'm used to being fat. I can't picture myself thin, or even healthy. I don't remember what my face really looks like. I don't remember what running feels like, or playing outside. I just remember pain, being winded, hating that I feel that way.  I don't have anything to offer the world anymore, not even my body anymore, so, I might as well just stay fat and die early. There's nothing here for me. I have the most wonderful, loving, supportive Fiance. I really wanna marry this guy, but he's getting the short end of the stick.   He's told me before he's upset that in my 20s is where I was adventurous, and sexual, and I'm boring by comparison now because I play it safe. Wants me out of my shell. But I'm just stagnant...fat, and stagnant.   I'd love to fast away all this weight, but my body will *still* be in fucking ruins, and I'd just be trading one form of unattractiveness for another. I'm too poor to afford surgery. So...bon appetit.",False,False

It’s like I’m eating just to make myself upset.  Especially with this.",False,False

This doesn’t get talked about anywhere near as much as it should!   In that mindset, I deserve to feel horrible from all the food I’ve binged on. I deserve to feel lethargic, heavy, like I’m going to throw up (I stop myself because I haven’t purged in a long time, though)... the list feels endless. I deliberately binge on things I *know* will make me run to the toilet.   I also do the same with not eating and in that mindset, I don’t deserve food or nourishment.",False,False

I didn't recognize my binges were a form of self harm until about 6 months ago. I really wish I had realized it sooner because now it's much easier to talk myself down from binges. I know there are a lot of people who don't eat as a form of self harm, it makes sense that binging could be too.",False,False

They both serve the same purpose for me! Also if you normally restrict, binging on purpose to freak yourself out later would definitely be SH.   Basically, yes. I think that Eating, both binging or restricting can be forms of self harm",False,False
