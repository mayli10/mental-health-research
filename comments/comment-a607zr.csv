Yeah, that's exactly what I try to concentrate on these days.

One wants me to eat myself into my grave and the other wants me to starve myself into my grave. But I've read hundreds of studies on obesity, metabolism, building muscle, losing fat, body weight/fat set point, etc. It's been an obsession of mine for over a year because I want to understand the state I am in and get a better understanding of what is objectively normal and healthy. So these days what I try to do is concentrate on doing what is objectively healthy at any given moment regardless of whatever the voices in my head are saying. I try to make eating/exercise decisions based on ""what will make me feel stronger/better tomorrow"" or ""how can I respect my body right now"" instead of ""how can I eat as little as possible or not at all"" or ""How can I manipulate myself to achieve the ideal in my mind"" (that doesn't really exist) or ""what would feel/taste good right now?"".

All of the body fat measurement methods are pretty crude approximations though. Both me and another guy I know measure like 7-8% by calipers (I measure about the same using all the different methods since I store about the same amount of body fat in my upper and lower torso) and 15% by DXA. That's a pretty stupid amount of variability.  &amp;#x200B;  Really how you look/feel is more important. Both too little and too much body fat make both your performance and general health worse. Probably one of the best things about gaining fat during recovery was seeing the effects it had on my exercise and general health. I've been cycling for years and how I perform is a great barometer for my general health. Literally all I needed to do was put on a few pounds of fat and all of a sudden tons of problems disappeared and my athletic performance went to a completely different level. Pretty much since I decided to recover, every single pound of body weight I've put on has actually made me faster, and biking is an unforgiving sport where extra weight is punished severely in terms of your speed and efficiency.  &amp;#x200B;  Anyway this is why I made my original comment. Gaining weight has made everything better for me. I may be an outlier but I feel like a lot of other manorexics get caught in the trap of trying to just cut more and more and more weight (""my BMI is still such and such!"") looking for that useless 6-pack that will never be there for some of us, and all you're really doing at a certain point is eating your own muscle.

I was two different people, restriction-brain and binge-brain. I got a lot treatment for both (my family is quite well off it was the best treatment money could buy but tbh it all sucked in one way or another). Finally, after having some (scary but thankfully temporary) health issues caused by binging, I had an epiphany that I would probably never have a fully healthy relationship with food, having spent the better part of my life (age 5-25) dealing with some type of food related issue. I accepted that I couldn’t ever erase that and that a full recover from my mental disorder was about as likely as an amputee regrowing  limb, but I COULD ensure that I live in a way that keeps my body healthy.   Fortunately I majored in a field they taught me how to research really well, and I started to teach myself about nutrition, healthy living, weight loss, muscle gain, maintenance, aging well, longevity etc. This is when I realized the full scope of how much my “treatment teams” (not just the ones from the terrible clinic, but others as well!) had lied to me.   To make a long story full of trial and error short: I found things that help me balance my ed with the reality of what my body needs to stay healthy. I’m learning more everyday and always improving.

A lot of the things they told me could have literally been copy-pasted from FA tumblr pages (though I don’t even know if FA tumblr was a thing at the time, it was the late 2000’s). They showed us healthy women’s bodies and talked about how malnourished they must be, and showed us overweight and obese women and discussed how much better those women’s bodies could function. They were supposed to be professionals so I trusted and believed them.   They encouraged me to eat my feelings. I was literally told “when you’re stressed out and would usually work off that energy by exerting yourself physically, try eating a comfort meal like pasta or a sweet treat instead”. We had to write about how we were handling our feelings and were ENCOURAGED to use food as a coping mechanism for negative feelings, as well a way to celebrate victories.   They discouraged me from eating low cal high volume foods. One memory that enrages me to this day is of being discouraged from eating broccoli and other cruciferous veggies because they’re not high calorie enough. I was basically told that eating too many veggies is disordered and even taught that it would DAMAGE THE LINING OF MY STOMACH to eat too many fibrous veggies. I vividly recall being lectured about having a preference for cauliflower over potatoes and being told that was just my disordered brain trying to kill me.   They taught me that working out and other forms of exercise and physical excretion were always negative and disordered. Working out was only ever discussed as if it were inherently unpleasant and a self inflicted punishment. No one ever out and out said “working out is tantamount to self harming” but that was the message. Anything other than a half hour of slow yoga a day was discouraged and analyzed and judged and berated. I caught shit from a therapist for walking my dog “too long” every day, and was told I was damaging my own joints and my dogs joints by walking him for an hour a day, and was told to take my dog to the dog park so I could sit on a bench and relax while he played.   Every single person who was “treating me” were either overweight or obese and they used this as a tool to emotionally manipulate. If I said “well isn’t being too fat just as bad as being too thin?” responses were always “DO I LOOK UNHEALTHY TO YOU?! I’m healthy BECAUSE I’ve got more weight on me! You’re unhealthy because you’ve gotten too thin!!”. This is actually something I’ve experienced in every treatment situation I’ve ever been in. I’ve literally never had a recovery professional who was a healthy weight. The last time I tried to get help the only specialist in my area who took my insurance was borderline immobile due to her obesity and could barely fit through the door to her own office. It’s incredibly difficult to talk about weight issues to someone who’s morbidly obese themselves and WILL act as if their feelings are hurt when the topic of obesity being unhealthy comes up.",False,False

Ever heard of prednisone? It is a glucocorticoid that is notorious for causing weight gain due to various mechanisms of action. I read full studies on PubMed, Medscape, etc., in order to fully understand how it worked because I had read all the anecdotal horror stories online. Turns out, the drug promotes fluid retention, it increases appetite, and it also alters carbohydrate metabolism in such a way that people who are on high doses in the long-term can develop side effects like diabetes. It actually messes with your hormones (cortisol, insulin). It can also cause fat redistribution to weird places like your face and the back of your neck.  So, not to generalize, but certainly this is an example of a medication that absolutely can lead *directly* to weight gain. And here's the thing: it didn't work that way for me. No, I personally managed to lose weight while on prednisone (91 to 88 lbs) because I logged EVERY FUCKING THING I ATE and stayed below 800-1000 calories a day.

So much of what they included in my treatment seemed empowering and steeped in self-love at the time, but really it was mostly fatlogic. They lied to me about how the body functions (“starvation mode is real”, “what even IS a calorie?!”, “some metabolisms are just slow!” etc.), they instilled some really fucked up ideals in me, and basically encouraged me to binge, engage in emotional eating, and use food as a drug.
