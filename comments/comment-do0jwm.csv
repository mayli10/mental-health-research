Super super helpful, I highlight while I read stuff and do the exercises. These are the same sheets we used in treatment. Second I also have the “dialectic behavior therapy wellness planner” to keep myself accountable and as a way to work through my day at the end of every night. It has little check boxes of skills you can say what you used that day. I LOVE both of these. I bought both on Amazon.",False,False

I had a cousin that couldn't stop eating (as a kid) because she had a mal-absorption of iron so her hunger cues was off. Maybe something like that is going on. Whole foods is very healthy but still maybe something can be not doing its way to the blood.,False,False

It's what many call extreme hunger and it's completely normal especially if you've ever restricted in the past. I've dealt with this as well and I completely understand how you feel and all the guilt.
