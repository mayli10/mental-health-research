I should know. I used to be there. It was hell.!&lt;  &gt;!And you keep harping on CICO and how it's true, but at the end of the day, it's a truISM. It literally doesn't mean anything. CICO is the result of weight loss or gain and not the cause. And for what it's worth, no-one that provides the 3,500kcal/lb formula has been able to provide an evidence base for it.!&lt;  &gt;!The reason I say it feels gluttonous how much I eat is because my body now stops me when it's had enough energy to run itself, now I've removed the abnormal stimulus (which was, in my body, carbohydrate (generates insulin) and vegetable oil (sensitises the fat cells to insulin)). Before, it stopped me at maybe 150% or 200%, partially because of aripiprazole (which I had been on for at least 8 years since 2008) and partially because of the abnormal stimulus. I literally used to binge every day and that was just my appetite - I didn't feel bad about it or anything. Still don't, because I know what was causing that. You'd do well to look into metabolic endocrinology, especially that of the metabolic syndrome.!&lt;  [TW: All the hormones involved in appetite regulation :D This comment is just a whole ass trip really and it could probably trigger some peoples' orthorexia.]",False,False

It's just hunger. It's not a bottomless abyss even. There are people literally starving, and none of them are obese.  Having energy vs lack of energy has more to do with nutrition and what you are eating. It just sounds like you should seek a nutritionist and discuss a healthy diet.  If I eat 1500 calories of Oreos I'm going to feel sick, and my energy will crash. If I eat 1500 calories of a healthy balanced meal of protein, carbs, etc... I will have lasting energy.   CICO is true for weight, 100%. Obviously all calories are not the same for nutrition. You can be thin and unhealthy, I'm sure everyone here knows that lol but if you eat at a calorie deficit, you will lose weight.   If you were feeling hungry after eating, you are likely eating foods that don't keep you satisfied for long periods of time. Hunger doesn't mean starving either. As someone with binge eating issues I'd also suggest looking into your relationship with food if you feel you need to be gluttonous to feel satisfied.  I have looked into endocrinology, I have PCOS. It's a highly important subject for me.",False,False

Gluttony, in the absence of an abnormal stimulus, does not cause adiposity in the long term. It causes loss of appetite and profound energy availability. When I removed the abnormal stimulus that kept me hungry even though I had months of fuel attached to every part of my body, I had, guess what, loss of appetite and profound energy availability. That insane ride has calmed down now, and now I have to eat gluttonously today if I want profound energy availability today. If I use energy without having consumed it that day, my body will make me cranky and tell me to eat, like it used to do whenever I even so much as lifted a feather.  Until you've looked into endocrinology, you do not and cannot understand the pathogenesis of obesity",False,False

People who eat in excess to obesity are not doing so because they are just hungry, and they literally are not starving in any way. It has to do with mental issues much of the time ""eating their emotions"" for example or eating out of boredom/distraction. Or just being gluttons.   They are not in anyway starving.
