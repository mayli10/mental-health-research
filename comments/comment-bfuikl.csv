You can’t tell on your own what caused/contributed to the faint, but restricting can affect your heart regardless of the weight you are currently at, as there are so many other factors involved. I’m not at all trying to say “oh it’s definitely your heart”... no one can do that over the internet. But you need to get checked, because it could be one part of what happened. Try to be honest with the doctor if you can - if in the end you just can’t bring up the ED, do what the above commenter suggested and claim you’ve been doing one of the fasting plans like IF. You can always add that you’ve “been stressed about [school/work] and forgot a meal a couple times” to underline for the doctor that you really have been restricting beyond what is normal. But it would be better to tell the truth; I’m only suggesting this in a spirit of harm reduction &lt;3",False,False

You should def atleast inform your doctor even if you lie and say youre intermittent fasting or something (**please please please do not lie**). You could have a lot of ED related things such as anemia, low blood pressure, low blood sugar (all of which are easily treatable) or worse. Take care of yourself",False,False
