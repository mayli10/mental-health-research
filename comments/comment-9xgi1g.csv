They're sweetened with sucralose (splenda).  The skinny mocha is an exception because it contains cocoa powder, it comes in around 5kcal/pump (3/4/5 pumps for tall/grande/venti).  Starbucks almond milk is sweetened btw, and clocks in at 60kcal/cup. So a grande London Fog with almond milk and sugar free vanilla is actually gonna be around 60kcal a cup only for the 8oz of almond milk that go into it (half water/tea and half milk).  You can cut the calories by asking for light almond milk or even a tea with just a splash of milk, to taste.  (You can also ask for a tea with room and just add your own milk, it's a common request lol)",False,False
