I think it comes from the way I grew up and the people around me. Up until I hit puberty I was underweight and it became part of my identity to be thin. My mom also dieted all the time and talked about how unhappy she was with her appearance. Naturally I learned that being overweight or at a healthy weight was bad and that being skinny was the only way to be happy.  Unfortunately, right as I hit my goal weight I started binging and gained until I was heavier than when I started. Now I have been getting back into restricting after being constantly reminded of the weight I gained. I don't think I'll ever be able to be happy at a healthy weight at least with my family around.",False,False

Tbh I feel like for me it’s just wanting to be pretty and skinny and feeling better about myself. And also I guess another part of how my ed formed is wanting people to notice me. Not so much as in attention for my ed but attention for being skinny/ loosing weight. Like I don’t want people’s pity I just want them to be shocked when they see me. It’s effed ik,False,False

Which really is a load of BS because I accomplish a lot with school and taking care of my health (I have a chronic illness). But yeah even this I can't control. Oh the irony. I try to control my weight and it doesn't work. The paradox of having an ED is that it controls you.,False,False

There has been lots of drama and chaos around me by external factors. The ED is the only way to control SOMETHING. I’ve been seeing a psychologist, which I would recommend if you relate to this story.",False,False

Many hours of introspection and analysing my life led me to such a conclusion. It isn't always about control, but in most cases it is. It's a way to avoid dealing with things you find difficult. I can't process emotions, so instead of dealing with them and feeling like I'm at the mercy of my feelings, I just starve them away. Which is great, until they creep up again.  There is a reason you're engaging in this behaviour, and that may simply be to look better. You do sound like you have disordered eating though, which can suddenly morph into a full blown ED when you least expect it. I would recommend reaching out to a dietician so they can help you resume a more normal eating pattern whilst allowing your weight to stablise in a healthy range. Should it turn out there are more issues with food than you realised, they can help you whilst also pointing you to additional help.",False,False
