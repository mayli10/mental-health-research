I can barely make it a day on that anymore and I have no clue what changed other than I have more stuff to do so I cant get everything done on the bare minimum.",False,False

I have no memories whatsoever of that time period other than the fact I lost weight, its so weird.",False,False

Severe. I was in constant pain, could only lie down and even breathing was uncomfortable. It was hell.  Then I had weeks lightheadedness from not eating. Weeks of water fasting, coffee with some creamer from a dirty kiosk machine and... Yeah, no idea how I functioned. Going up the straits from the underground to the street level would leave me out of breath and needing to take a moment to gather myself. Fucking awful.",False,False

I mean I'd deadass b/p for hours every night and then just not eat for a couple of days after that. If I tried some shit like that right now I'd slump over dead into the toilet bowl like an upside down Elvis,False,False

One year i was constantly exercising while living on a pack of dark chocolate m&amp;ms and diet coke. Another time it was gummy bears. And now here I am eating like a starved cat -.-,False,False

And it was like my disordered behaviors made me feel amazing (mostly mentally sometimes physically) even though it was so rough on my body and I knew it was hurting me?

But in terms of your question yes sometimes I am shocked! I can wonder if knowing less about nutrition and health detriments maybe made me less aware of how much of a toll I was really under.,False,False
