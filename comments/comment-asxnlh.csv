I remember getting to 140 which scared me because it was my hw and then I got down to 112 just for me to binge for hmm over a damn year and then I went up to 146.   which is super embarrassing because everyone noticed when I lost weight so for sure they noticed when I gained it fall back. my point is this isn’t the end, you can still get back to a healthy weight no matter how long it takes ",False,False
