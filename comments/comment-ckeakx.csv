That is honestly so hard to get through, I can't imagine a situation like that. Only my brother does that, but I have grown to push away the thoughts and the negativity he put in my head. But it wasn't easy and I felt like shit knowing a family member was pushing me to slowly kill myself.",False,True

I'm so, so sorry. I can't imagine what you're going through because everyone's struggle is different but maybe we can relate to each other if I tell you my story.  The person who's always triggered my eating order was my father. When I became thinner and thinner during my late teens, he'd always say how good I looked. Always. But if I ate *anything* and he found out about it, he'd berate me.  In college, I entered anorexic territory and he said nothing. It was like he wanted it to happen. Didn't matter if I drank the pain away and abused alcohol; as long as I remained skeletal, he was happy. In fact, I'll never forget him complimenting my ass while I wore XS Victoria's Secret pajamas that were too baggy on me. Fucking disgusting.  To this day, I'm very wary whenever anyone comments on my body. Doesn't matter if they think they're complimenting me or not; I may get triggered thanks to my dad. And I'm so sorry you're going through that yourself. Just know if you ever want to talk, I'm here for you.",False,False
