My SO says he's equally attracted to me, and he certainly acts it.  I do think he'd be less attracted to me if I ever hit like 200 pounds or something, but I honestly think as long as I'm under 150 (perhaps even more, but he's never seen that and I've never been past 160 so idk), he doesn't care. He's treated me the same, beautiful girl the entire time.",False,False

Lost maybe 15 lbs in a month or two, then a month later I met my bf. Maybe it's coincidence, maybe not, but I kept losing after that and I look objectively better. He said 1.5 years into dating that I'm much cuter now than I was then (lol), yet expressed concern when I was at my lowest, and then also complimented my hipbones (rip) within the same conversation.

Overweight/obese, nope. Healthily weight restored, smack dab in the middle of my weight range, yep.

I’m in a sickly range, I think my partner is more attracted to me when I’m ‘glowing’, if that makes sense. ",False,False

In the back of my mind I’m always worried he found me most attractive at that lower weight, though he tells me otherwise. Over the five years we’ve been together I’ve never been at a BMI over 18.5 at the most, so it’s something that I’m always kind of struggling with. It really sucks. Even when he insists he would/does find me more attractive when I’m at a higher weight, I can’t help but doubt it.   In the end I know this concern can’t be determinative of my mental health but,,, yeah. It’s hard. You’d think being in a serious relationship would make you feel more comfortable in your body and all. Wish it actually worked that way.",False,False

I said mine was, that's it.  All I was saying is if he knows you're starving yourself and says he's more attracted to you, there may be a problem that needs to be addressed, don't make him a monster, just a good reason to reevaluate the relationship. Are there other problems? Does he *want* her to starve, or is he just more attracted to her at a lower weight?  Dear god, I didn't mean to make OPs S/O sound like an abuser, *that's* a stretch.",False,False

This is such a stretch. You can't project your relationship to OP's.   To the OP, it sounds like though your bf may find you more physically attractive now, as long as he's not pushing you to stay at this weight regardless of your health, he's just expressing an opinion. Maybe it's one you wish you didn't hear, but it doesn't seem like he wants you to risk your health to stay at this weight. If the are other signs of him putting his wants in front of your health, THEN yes definitely reassess the relationship. But to me it just sounds like he expressed a normal opinion like a normal human. But only you can really guess how he meant it. ",False,False

It wasn't the weight loss that he was attracted to, it was that I was so much more confident. He couldn't keep his hands off me! Even though he prefers when I weigh a little more, I am more confident when I weigh less, which makes him more attracted to me. ",False,False
