I have hundreds of YouTube tabs. I have a stash of food. I have written memos of my meal plans and food i want to make or buy. All of this prevents me from being present.  I'm constantly stimulating and numbing myself. Whenever i lost interest in all of the things i normally distracted myself with, i would go to food as a pick-me-up, and then I'd manage to find something to distract myself with again. I was always a normal weight, but i never ate when i was actually hungry-- i only ate for the change of pace it provided whenever i found myself spiraling whenever i became too present. I recognized this behavior of mine and starved myself in an attempt to be disciplined i guess. Now I'm maintaining an underweight bmi and I'm always preoccupied with thoughts of food and calories and what I'm going to eat next and now everything ties into food and i don't want this to be my life. I know the sense of control derived from regulating my intake is false and that my existence will be miserable if i keep this up.  I deleted my hundreds of tabs and unsubscribed to nearly all of my youtube subscriptions. I also deleted all of my memos, everything about food, etc. I deleted all of my recipe memos and meal plan memos and weight logging memos. I'm going to stop visiting this subreddit as well. Deep down, i always knew coming here was bad, sort of like when you're in a codependent relationship and deep down know it isn't good for you, but staying is easier so you stay.  I'm not going to plan out what i eat anymore or eat in mealtime windows. I'm just going to eat when im hungry. Instead of obsessing about my next meal even when im stuffed, I'm not going to worry about it. I'll see what's in the fridge and pantry and make do. I'm not going to ""keep myself busy"" and ""be productive"" between meals like a sad boring anorexic girl life that has nothing else going for herself-- I'm going to eat meals between keeping myself busy and being productive, because i no longer want food to be the highlight or preoccupation of my life. I'm no longer going to consume ED content because that's not how i want to identify myself. I'll still count calories because im not ready to let go of that yet. But i have to start asking how i want to identify myself and work towards being that.  I feel like i need to heal and confront myself.

So, since monday i have a big ass thicc chocolate bar (300g) inside the house. Fastfoward to today, saturday, almost the end of the week and i only ate 33g (4 squares) that clocked at 186kcal.  Feeling so fucking proud but can't say to anybody else because they would be like ""That's fucked up, mate. You can eat that chocolate bar, it wouldn't kill you."". Obviously, i had to go exercise after eating those squares but that's a different issue.  Also, when my father opened the chocolate bar i was so fucking mad. I guess i liked to watch the tablet paper untouched and closed.",False,False
