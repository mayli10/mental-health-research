I gained weight with both major major surgeries, and see the same with patients because they infuse you with fluids during surgery and your body tends to hold onto it.   You should also expect swelling of the surgical area which means that if you are having abdominal surgery you will be super bloated and swollen.   That said, as the water weight comes off of you it tends to come off with a little excess gone due to poor appetite and lower intake in the days post op.   Restricting intentionally after surgery is big no no. Your BMR will increase due to more metabolic needs to heal and recover from the trauma and restriction, especially protein restriction, can delay healing, cause excess edema and swelling to the surgical site and put you at risk for post op infection.   At the very least, if you can't bring yourself to eat much try and make the calories count by eating higher protein foods like Greek yogurt, bone broth, or fortified cereals/oatmeal instead of just crackers and jello.",False,False

Another way to get in some extra protein that's super easy and not crazy high on calories -  equate and some other brands make LOW-SUGAR protein shakes that are a godsend. I like the ""Pure Protein"" brand because each one is only 140 calories for 30 grams (!!!) of protein and 6 g of carbs.  Maybe pick up a couple of packs of those to have on hand to supplement or if you're a bit low on protein for the day and don't want something higher in fat or calories?  They helped me a lot because I knew I was able to get in a ton of protein to heal without a crazy scary calorie count that would make my ED lizard brain freak out.  : )",False,False

Thank you so much for your kind words and understanding.  I WILL trust you, hydrate and stock up on protein rich foods and I’ll even stay off the scale for at least 2 weeks.

Seriously.  I know it sucks and it's really really hard but please eat at least at maintenance for a couple weeks after, if you're going to have a major/serious surgery. Also -- if you're trying not to freak out about calories and ED brain is forcing you track that number, at LEAST tilt your macros to higher on the protein. Protein, protein, protein, protein - it's essential for recovery. To be clear - you WILL slow down the healing process if you're not getting enough of those essential macros, ESPECIALLY protein.  Ask your husband/friends to provide you with healthy, whole foods - lean chicken breast/turkey, egg whites, green veg.  Also - you are very likely to GAIN (false) weight right after a major surgery. For your own sanity, do NOT got on a scale for the first week.  Your body will be retaining a ton of fluid, and if you're having major surgery, you will have been on IV fluids.  My last go-round I ""gained"" 10 pounds from before surgery to the day after - this is NOT real weight.  It fell off after a week or so, it's just fluids from your body attempting to recover.   You know how if you've done heavy restriction for a bit and suddenly every cut or scrape or bruise takes ten times longer to heal? Yeah, you DON""T want that with a major surgery/huge incisions. Trust me.  I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly!!",False,False

I’m absolutely terrified and I’m kind of looking at each part of my worries and singling them out.    I will focus on my health and healing and get back after it once my stupid body gets itself in gear.  You are very wise and knowledgeable.  Thanks again for answering, I’m glad I asked.",False,True

Surgery usually involves swelling, which could cause a temporary gain depending on the size of the affected area, but it won't mean anything and will go back down as you heal. You also might gain some water weight if your friends &amp; family bring you lots of carb-heavy comfort foods, but please don't worry about it!  You are right, you will be less active as well as less hungry due to the meds, so honestly most of it will cancel out. Healing &amp; repairing tissues takes calories too, and you want your body to be at 100% while you heal, so  if you can manage I suggest eating at maintenance for at least a week if you can. Restricting puts added strain on your body which will already be stressed. It will balance out, and even if it doesn't, it won't be permanent or long term gain.",False,False
