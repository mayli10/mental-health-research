But, in my own IRL story, those illnesses probably would also have the person in question running hill repeats in sub-freezing temperatures. (The'res a woman who uses the same running trail I do who is extremely underweight -- I'd be surprised if she were even at 5 percent body fat, and she literally looks like a skin-covered skeleton. Triggering AF, and every time I see her, I'm both triggered, relieved she's still alive, but also hoping she's getting help.)",False,False

I’m a runner so I have muscular legs and sometimes I wonder if anyone can tell I’m sick or not. Yesterday I also weighed myself before and after my stair workout :(,False,False
