I *could not* stop before five slices of pizza or 90 g of cheese but after just letting myself eat however much I wanted over the past seven months, I'm over it. No more crappy pizza cravings and when I make the real stuff at home, it's satisfying in small amounts. Same with cheese; haven't craved it in a hot second. Getting enough fat in to my daily intake probably also helped.",False,False

I binged hardcore on clif bars for months until I eventually got sick of them. I'm saying you really have to go all out, not simply eat once or twice.

Like, pizza is a huge fear food. If I eat one slice I'll eat 4 and then for the next week keep eating it. And I will see it and want it and have to force myself not to",False,False

In recovery the first fear food I ate was clif bars - the first time that ish hit my mouth I was in heaven.  Read that again. C L I F  BARS. Of all things. I used to hardcore binge out on those suckers &amp; other protein/granola bars.   I had one the other day &amp; nearly chucked it in the garbage. Not because it didn't taste the same, but because I didn't experience the sort of pleasure from it I did when initially having it. The moment was over.",False,True

Last night I had a multigrain english muffin with a butter substitute and now toast doesn’t sound good. This shit’s real.   That said, ya girl is also not doing so hot bc I’m 3lbs from my ugw and won’t be following my meal plan until then. I just make sure I carve out room in my daily limit to get what I crave",False,False
