Then I saw a group therapist who didn’t usually work with EDs but HAD one at one point in her life, so she had a personal understanding. I know 2 others who I’ve met professionally (student therapist) who reaaaally didn’t get it. So it could go either way, just like with most disorders, unfortunately.   If they don’t understand, you can ask them for a referral to someone who specializes in EDs and they will hopefully be a better fit. Thankfully, they will likely approach with compassion even if it’s outside of their wheelhouse.",False,False
