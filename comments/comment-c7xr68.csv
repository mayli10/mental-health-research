It can be hard to pin down for a 9 year old, though).  For ex. a chicken breast, broccoli and rice is “good fuel”, because it powers your body and gives you good energy for swimming and playing and having fun. Candy and chips and such are “sometimes fuel” because they can give your body some power, but if you eat too much of them it takes away your energy for swimming and playing and having fun. Like when a car gets the wrong type of gasoline put into it, a little bit isn’t bad for it but too much can make your car break down.  Ofc tread lightly with this, because too much of this type of thinking can become a “safe food vs fear food” mentality which is the exact thing you’re wanting to avoid. Maybe also get your thin sister a little involved as well, because kids are smart and as soon as your overweight sister figures out the thin one isn’t being held to the same standards, she’ll think that it’s all unfair BS because she’s fat.",False,False

She might be overweight but i think its more likely she's on the upper end of normal (I don't live with them so I'm not sure about the exact numbers). She hadn't mentioned her weight at all until my mom started having her measure her waist, and making comments when clothes stopped fitting her. I honestly think this is largely my mother's fault because she's the one who takes care of her and shouldn't just let her eat four slices of buttered bread as a ""snack"".   I think I'll talk to my mom and ask her to stop constantly talking about my sister's weight and maybe have a conversation with my sister to try and encourage her to get out more/move more. I think the eating part, my mom can largely control.",False,True

But turns out, she had an undiagnosed thyroid issue.   However, many kids just go through phases. There are weeks my kids are going to more social events, especially during holidays, and might gain some weight, but then they go back to eating normally, and it all evens out. It might be that your sister was actually eating more than your other siblings (even if it wasn't noticed, likely because of the decreased appetite during the flu) and her body is trying to normalize,  or she might have a slower metabolism that is kicking in now, or she might be going through puberty soon.  Does the weight gain bother her? Has she said anything about it? If not, then I wouldn't mention it. Unless she is clinically obese and her weight is posing a health risk (in which case I would consult a doctor), I would make her healthier meals and limit snacks. Children are resilient, but they are also fragile and impressionable. She is still growing and will gain/lose weight throughout life; low self esteem is much harder to get rid of.",False,False

That might be a way for you to focus her (and your mom’s) idea of “health” as strength, speed, physical ability instead of just “skinny”.  Getting her involved in, like, tennis for example could help because 1) she’ll be losing weight and getting healthier from physical activity and 2) her role models could be Venus and Serena Williams who are badass, beautiful, strong, healthy women but aren’t exactly the traditional pictures of “skinniness”. Same with other sports like soccer and Mia Hamm, or gymnastics and Simone Biles, etc etc.  Sports can also be really self-esteem promoting, which might help protect her from body shame and future disordered eating.",False,False

But it doesn't make sense how she's the only one out of my other 3 siblings who gained weight when my mom is the one who meal preps. Maybe there is an underlying issue? She recently got the flu and lost some weight as she wasn't eating much and she got happy about it (this is what made me concerned). How do you suggest I talk to her about weight while keeping it positive but stirring her in a direction where she values being healthy?,False,True

It's difficult for them to comprehend what life would be like at a different weight because their capacity for abstract thinking is still not fully developed, nor do they have the life experience or luxury of foresight to guide them. They rely on their parents for this. It is probably most helpful for your mom to find out why she put on weight quickly. Is there an underlying medical issue? And if she is overeating, then why?  More often than not, it has to do with something they are not getting or that is not being addressed at home. Criticizing or berating her (not saying that is what your mom is doing, just generally speaking) will only make her feel badly about herself for reasons she won't fully understand or process and  give her a lifelong complex about her body.",False,False
