My hair fell out and I had to wear a hat for a year. This really triggered a desire to get better, when I was at my worst. It kind of makes sense in a way; vanity led me down this rabbit hole so vanity kind of helps me into recovery too. A voice in my head always says 'you were driven by a desire to look your best, so a desire to look your best should tell you that it is possible to be too thin'.",False,False

I always thought I was too young for anything to happen to me. If thought ‚Äúif there are SKIIIIINNY girls that have starved themselves for years I, as fat as I am, definitely have a lot of wiggle room‚Äù  Nothing really happened at first. I was just losing weight and still felt ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù.  Later, after losing weight so quickly I developed gallstones and ulcers from puking. My esophagus is fucked. The most painful thing I‚Äôve ever felt and had to get surgery. Sometimes I feel my heart doing weird shit and it‚Äôs scary in the moment. I cry because I‚Äôm scared to die then I forget about it.  I guess at first I really thought I could get away with anything I did because I wasn‚Äôt underweight but the hard reality is that your body is a machine and sooner or later there will be consequences and they will show.",False,False

I thought the nurse woke me up bc I was snoring or smth so when it actually happened I swatted her away and went back to sleep   And I've had osteoporosis since I was 16 and now I'm 19... still on my bullshit,False,False

My heart has been doing a lot of weird shit, I‚Äôve been having more cognitive and physical problems lately, my kidneys have been rebelling, I may have gastroparesis, and my bones are fucked.   It‚Äôs not all fun and games. I‚Äôve been doing fucked it shit to myself for a few decades and there are consequences. Some can be reversed, some can‚Äôt. I may have permanently damaged my heart, my guts and my organs and I‚Äôve definitely damaged my bones.   Thinking you might be having a cardiac failure of some sort (at 44 years old) but having your irrational ED brain convince you not to call 911 is scary when your clarity rolls back around. It was enough to get me to at least try to make an honest effort with recovery this time.   Please be safe. Every one of you. Yeah I‚Äôm that Mom Friend. But seriously, be careful and take care of yourselves. üíô",False,False

While I think fear could be a starting point in wanting to recover, positive motivation is probably more sustainable like being able to picture how much your life would improve without the ED.",False,False

My biggest motivation is the hope of a normal life, like, being able to function as a normal human being, enjoy life... That's what I want.",False,False
