Then you’re away from the house for a few hours every day, if It’s a retail job you get some exercise (i used to walk 13000-15000 steps a day when i worked in a supermarket just at work) and you can control what you eat at ur break! The food can be triggering for some ppl but i found it the opposite, i kind of lived through what other people bought and any cravings i might have had was always gone after a shift.",False,False
