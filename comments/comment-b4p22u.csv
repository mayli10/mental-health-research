Tbh I find it upsetting that she claims to be 120. She's clearly gained recently; I think it's more damaging to continue to perpetuate unrealistic body standards with lies than to come clean about a change in weight. Not to mention the fact that agencies frequently exaggerate heights of their girls...  As someone who is actually 5'9, 120, and models, I  would love to see a curvier girl in the VS show. But the blatant, upsetting, and damaging lies show that Barbara and her agents don't care about the struggles that so many models and PEOPLE are going through. ",False,False

They love that weight unless they know you're unhealthy with it. Ignorance is bliss.  Me underweight and friends knowing about it, only underweight by 3 lbs: OMG RECOVER  Mutual friends even more underweight: yeah but they don't have an ED (that they know about) so they're fine / naturally skinny",False,False

I cackled when VS made Barbara Palvin an angel and everyone was like, ""Omg a realistic model? It's about time!"" People fail to realize that she is literally 120 pounds and is 5'9, just like damn near every other VS angel. The only difference in comparison to the other angels is that her hips are bigger.",False,False

I’m a model and to my agency I’m too far above 116-7 lbs. Telling me to love my body is not going to give me $ for college tuition. ",False,False
