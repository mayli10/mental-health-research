It wasn't a printed resource but just a list of things that I used to do before my ED took over and small steps that I could take to start doing those again (e.g. exercising, socializing w food, etc). Also some tips on how to distract a binge.   It's like not super unique stuff, but I'm hoping I can make some changes solely based on the fact that I'll have my therapist to hold me accountable for it",False,False

I've taken this year off and am going back in the fall. the added stress of higher education plus my ED really messed me up mentally. I'm moving out in a few days though, so hopefully when I go back to school, I'll be more in control of things (I live with my parents rn)  as for turning 18, i personally found it kind of hard that no one was forcing me to get better anymore. they were kinda like ""well if you wanna live like this then fine. you're an adult."" which was hard. but I do enjoy being in control of my decisions. most of the time lol ",False,False
