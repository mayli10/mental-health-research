Because your body thinks it's starving from the low insulin, it starts creating ketones. In an actual, controlled starvation state with minimal but sufficient insulin, having some minimal ketone level along with euglycemia (not hyperglycemia) is fine. In insulin-agenetic diabetes, where the minimal (or totally lacking) insulin is not sufficient to control the glycemia and inhibit excessive ketogenesis, you can get enough ketones to cause an acidosis, which could kill you, on top of the hyperosmolar state from the hyperglycemia, which itself can kill you.!&lt; [CW: potentially wrong information; it's based on a laywoman's understanding of the pathophysiology of insulin agenesis]",False,False

My mum slowly pieced it together when I was about 15-16 and then found out about it again when I started to binge and omit (age 17) as  I went into DKA 3 times in a couple of weeks. So I never really told her about it but when she knew we sat down and talked it out. That did feel like a weight had been lifted but I get if talking about it to a parent can be daunting but I‚Äôd really try to work up to it.   But after this talk I felt confident enough to tell my endo. The thought of telling them was a lot worse then actually telling them. Remember they‚Äôre there not to judge you but support you and your diabetes good and bad.  2. Okay, this answer might be a little disappointing, I‚Äôm not fully recovered and have bad days. But from where I was a year ago I have got a lot better. If you have Facebook I‚Äôd really recommend joining a diabulimic support group, it definitely feels a lot less lonely to be in a group with people going through the same thing, as well as seeing people in recovery and recovered is motivating.    If you can really reach out of help, if you want to get better your endo should hopefully have resources to help you, similarly with your therapist. Just remember they are there to help not judge you.   I‚Äôm not sure if this helped but stay safe  and I wish you the best of luck üíñ",False,True

Sometimes I may give myself a couple of units like once a week. I have a dexcom and a pump but I don‚Äôt wear either most of the time (or if I am wearing a dexcom I‚Äôll just ignore it). I‚Äôm 19, and I constantly feel weak, terrible, and like I have no energy at all.  I want to get help but I don‚Äôt know where to start or how to bring it up to either my endo or therapist.   How did you go about telling anyone about it? What was the road towards recovery like for you? Sorry if either of these questions are too intrusive, you don‚Äôt when to answer if you feel uncomfortable:)",False,False

I‚Äôve had two experiences, my last year in paediatrics diabetic team they were concerned but the problem was injecting worsened my mental health, and not injecting worsens my physical health. That‚Äôs kinda where they left it. I‚Äôm now at adults and they‚Äôre pretty stretched thin I had to miss my first appointment and since then have requested another and haven‚Äôt received another, Walker this year I caught a bug and went into DKA (diabetic keto acidosis) before being discharged I have to be cleared by the diabetic team, I told them about my issues with insulin and whilst I have gotten better on my own I do want therapy for further recovery I was told I would recover a call a week later for someone with diabetic background knowledge, that was three months ago I did call every week for about a month to try and chase it but nothing. I don‚Äôt blame the diabetic team the NHS is stretched thin and even private mental health services have long waiting lists, so I‚Äôm not to angry.    2. I remember when I was between 8-10 there was a British show called Waterloo Road and they did a small story on a it and my mum told me it‚Äôs because she was omitting her insulin and that always stuck with me. So I guess that‚Äôs when I figured it was a thing but didn‚Äôt really ‚Äòstart‚Äô until about 16, omitting becoming a gradual thing I think cutting out a couple units here and there and it slowly escalated. Then insulin became a fear I guess,  like ‚Äòoh no if I inject for that I‚Äôll get fat‚Äô. I went to this table top club which encouraged me to both keep omitting both food and insulin as I was told I was to skinny, could snap in two, or someone said they wanted to lose some weight but not be as thin as me. I don‚Äôt blame them for saying that stuff as yea it‚Äôs technically negative I just spun it as a way for me to keep going.   3.  I‚Äôd rather not say specifically (number wise etc) if that‚Äôs cool. But unfortunately and what makes people do it is you drop weight fast, and you don‚Äôt really need to diet. Shame about the side effects.   I hope I answered them all alright üòä",False,True

Did you know this was a thing, that it had a name, before you started doing it, or did you learn about it first and start doing it after? Omitting, I mean.

Honestly, any documentaries covering eating disorders or mental health issues (as long as presented fairly and factually) is a good thing as although things are better there are still misconceptions about mental illness floating around   As for this documentary specifically I was really happy to see the girl who had recovered, despite her having issues with her legs she‚Äôs incredible. I feel the same about the girl who was currently in recovery, I‚Äôm really happy for her and hope she‚Äôs doing well.   However, for me personally it made me more scared to recover. Personally I just want to be thin, I don‚Äôt care about beauty or being healthy or glowing (I don‚Äôt hold others to this standard people of all shapes and sizes are gorgeous, I just hold myself to a different standard) I just want to be seen as thin, like that‚Äôs the first thing I want people to notice. When I saw the recovered girl it scared the hell out of me I don‚Äôt want to look like that, especially seeing the before photos. I know that might sound harsh but yea...  Overall though despite it triggering me I guess I do have a positive opinion on it as diabulimia isn‚Äôt well known about and it helped spread information. üòä",False,True

It got so bad I got out of breath straightening my hair from the effort of keeping my arms raised. For the first year or two I was able to omit enough so my sugars ran high but I could still function, I lost weight very easily, it seemed great. But then I lost almost all ability to function while high, I felt like death all the time. I have had to battle for years and years to get my A1c down, and it still isn't in normal range.

I‚Äôve never 100% fully omitted always taking my long acting and now even on bad days injecting at the minimum something and correcting high blood sugars   Short term, a majority of type one diabetics will generally go through this (typically when you‚Äôre ill, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important to have your flu shot) but if you‚Äôre sugars are high ketones can build up and essentially you‚Äôre blood becomes acidic you throw up everything you eat and drink. Once you‚Äôre in hospital it‚Äôs easily treatable but it can kill pretty quickly (we‚Äôre talking like 2 days).  My worst DKA case was when I had the flu around age 8 my mother wasn‚Äôt made aware of it and called an ambulance when I was going in and out of consciousness. She was told if I drank any more my brain would have swelled and I could of died.  So whilst it‚Äôs easily treatable it‚Äôs pretty dangerous, I went in it twice last year when my binging was at its worst.  But yea, a lot of diabetics will experience this once.   Long term, I mean death. But also kidney failure, neuropathy, you can go blind   It‚Äôs pretty dangerous, and it‚Äôs strange to think people do this to help with weight loss with consequences like this. I liken it to people overdosing on laxatives, you know the consequences but still do it.    I wouldn‚Äôt say you‚Äôre in a perilous spot every time, there are factors that raise your blood sugars like having a panic attack or stress, that‚Äôs when you test your sugars and correct.
