And it would point more to body dysmorphia, I think, if we can see somebody with our same body shape/weight/height and think they look good but see ourselves as unacceptable.   Also, I think it‚Äôs unhealthy to tell someone with an ed to follow instagram pages where body shape is the main focus.

I don‚Äôt hate fat people and I think it‚Äôs messed up how unkind people are to them (or generally unattractive people in general). We place way too much emphasis on looks in our society.
