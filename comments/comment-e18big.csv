Please be careful and make sure you take care of yourself. Make sure to drink loooooooots of water the fiber, laxatives, and caffeine are going to really dehydrate you, and the fiber will constipate you without enough fluids. Also make sure to keep up and find a way to up your electrolytes. Calcium, sodium, potassium, and magnesium are the big’uns. Also know any medications you’re on may be effected by the laxatives (talking about that proper uptake). Also maybe consider doing some Pinterest level self care shit. It ain’t gunna solve anything or make anything go away, but it may help sooth some of the self hate rn. Or if you want the Ed perspective cause that’s the mind set you’re in, if you feel at least a little bit better about yourself you might be less likely to binge again. Obligatory stay safe lovelies 🖤  Edit: also maybe consider keeping a spare pair of panties and or leggings on your person. I’ve managed to never shit myself due to laxatives (yet lol), but I have due to other Ed dumb assery and it was a w f u l 🤦‍♀️",False,False
