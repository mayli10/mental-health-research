It depends on how much I take tho. If I take less than my recommended amount for my ADHD I feel nothing/no side affects. If I take more than it doesn’t just make my appetite like fade, it kills it completely and I separate the feeling of hunger from my stomach growling. It’s fuckin weird.   That’s a good way to think. I’ll try to force myself to eat today. Hopefully I don’t binge again. Thanks for the advice love 😍😘",False,True

For me doesn't work 😑 I would say focus on the positives by doing the best you can about looking great in a healthy way. Like think: I'll look my best if I don't binge instead of I'll look best if I restrict. This will prevent you from jumping on what you want to avoid...,False,False
