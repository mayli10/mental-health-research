My insurance company gave me a list. (2) try to get input from your current doctor on which people on this list are actually good at their jobs. They may not have a suggestion but it’s worth trying. Sadly, there are some not-so-great psychiatrists out there. People who don’t listen. People who prescribe meds willy-nilly.   The side note is that, at least in the US “psychiatrists” mostly just prescribe medications. (Some other medical professionals can also prescribe psych meds.) In contrast “therapists” and “psychologists”provide 50-minute therapy sessions using an array of methodologies. The same (1), (2) apply for finding a therapist, and ofc you also want to pick someone with knowledge and experience in the specific area(s) you’re looking to work on.   Good luck! It takes courage to ask for what you need but finding the help that works for you can really improve life. I hope you find what you need.",False,False
