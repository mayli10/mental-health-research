Some people genuinely feel they have failed at 300 calories and it is genuinely devastating not to reach it.   I am medically literally obese, and I see people say they think they’re obese in this sub despite not being so. I don’t let it bother me too much because I know that this is many people’s mindset and the struggle of the disorder.  I don’t think you should want people to censor their posts and discussions because you dislike it. Everyone is different and failing is different for everyone. There are so many different mindsets for eating disorders.  So yeah, a lot of stuff is triggering, but we shouldn’t censor people and complain about their posts and feelings - everyone is valid.",False,False

It’s also not like these people can magically just stop, restriction is a way to control and when you lose control of the only thing in your life, complete disaster mode ensues. This isn’t anything new this is a common reason people resort to eating disorders.  Lastly no one is trying to invalidate eating disorder. Just like you, they are using this platform as a safe way to express their struggles. I also ask you to reframe from going on submissions that contain trigger warnings as the seem to put you in a state of distress.",False,False
