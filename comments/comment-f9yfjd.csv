Partially because it‚Äôs so hard on the body (plus I have roommates, and I am anything but a quiet ‚Äúpurger‚Äù...) so the consequences of doing it usually outweigh my compulsion to attempt it.  I brushed my teeth and gargled immediately after. Purging is especially hard on the esophagus. I‚Äôve heard that topping the stomach off with milk can help cut down the acidity a bit, but even then, it‚Äôs still going to hurt your body and shouldn‚Äôt be purging in the first place. :/",False,True

So i really get why you feel happy.   Of course, I also think it's a horrible act of violence against the body and I worry for your teeth and heart...So. üôÉ",False,False
