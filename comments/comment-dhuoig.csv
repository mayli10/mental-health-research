I can suggest that when I try to use others as a sounding board about how I look. It makes my anorexic voice louder in my head, because they must be lying to me! My scale, my clothing, my own eyes are the worst metric for me. I am so close to going back to the rolled up tape measure (the kind you use for sewing) but, I know that that is a really bad place for me to go again.. (I like numbers way to much, and my OCD kick's into high gear). When I was IP we did this exercise, where we drew ourselves life size on a piece of paper then we laid down and had someone trace us. It was a serious wake up. Maybe you could have a friend or loved one try that with you.  I wish you well. Your not alone. (hugs)",False,False

Several times when I was younger I nearly outed my ED to the world because of how fucking confusing it gets. (◞‸◟)  I recall this one experience—   A friend of my friend/an acquaintance of mine (*lets call her “Addison”*) decided to ‘humorously’ make fun of some girl’s body (*lets call her “Lindsey”*) while we were hanging out.  Later on I decided to express to my friend (the mutual friend) that I took offense to the kind of jokes ‘Addison’  likes to make since ‘Lindsey’ and I are rather similar in size despite being shaped different...  The conversation topic ended right there because she was so startled by what I said. She told me in some creepily serious voice that ‘Lindsey’ had to be at least  6 clothing sizes bigger than I am and asked if I was being serious when I said that. It got even more awkward when my dumbass asked if *she* was being serious. I don’t remember how I recovered from that shit but I do remember I was awkward as fuck around her  for a long time after that because that made her ask if I “could tell” i was thinner than she was.,False,False
