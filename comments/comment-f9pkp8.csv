I’d rather stick between 800-900 per day (which still gives me a large enough deficit). I’m in school and I have a full time job and can’t let my performance slip in either. 500 or less would destroy me and my ability to function, or I’d just end up binging. I used to fast but that was when I didn’t have so much going on.  Idk, as far as feeling “fake” goes, I kind of stopped feeling that way when I found this sub and can relate to the majority of posts. I may not be underweight, but Im somewhere in disordered eating territory.   I’m mainly asking so I know how hard I’m running myself into the ground physically. My mind always pushes me to do better with cals, but like I said, there’s kind of a minimum I have to eat to function decently",False,True

I’m sure it’s different for everyone, I know 1200 would be close to maintenance for short sedentary people. But I definitely feel like a fake or a pig when I see other people eating &lt;500 for weeks on end... I would actually faint on the second or third day if I did that lol.",False,False

(TW Numbers)  My high restriction tends to be 800-1200 give or take, and low restriction is anything below. Im in a big deficit considering my tdee is over 2000, its different for everyone.",False,False
