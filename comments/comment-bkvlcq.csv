Everyone who thinks anaroxia is a ""cool"", ""hip""  thing to ""get"" is stupid. But when people struggling mentally with eating it's not easy to admit that, because eating is ""technically"" a easy thing to do and everyone around you does it normal. I've been binging since I'm little. When I was 12 and first heard of bulimia I thought it was the most stupid thing to do. When I was 14 I sticked my Finger down my throat because I binged. Still a stupid thing to do, no question. All this time I never realized I have an actual eating disorder. An actual mental problem with food. And I didn't found it out because of an online community. I realized it after googling for a the millionth time how to throw up, how to lose 10kg in ten days, after I realized the most important thing in my life is lose weight and not a single day passed by where I don't think about food, binging, fasting, losing weight etc. eating 1800 calories is good. sometimes I get myself to do that and feel good sometimes I feel bad about 600cal. Sometimes I eat 5000 sometimes I eat 200 and sometimes I starve myself. Ed Twitter is the only space where I'm feeling safe to share and we're not pro I get nothing but support there. Not for losing weight but for that I look great however much i weight, that I deserve to eat whatever I want. We know that what we do isn't good better than no one else that's why we can support each other for recovery the most. My timeline is only filled with supportive people who are telling me to break my fast, eat and feel good.  I grew up fat and my mom brought me to different places because she wanted me to lose weight. Wherever I went nobody talked about an eating disorder, when I would be a stick they would be nothing but the word anaroxia.

There’s always been forums like MPA, and tumblr before that, and livejournal before that. (There probably were even earlier precursors.)  -	Often ED communities are drawn to certain characters and people. On Tumblr, everyone was obsessed with *Skins* because there was a character with an ED plus this very beautiful, very thin girl. LJ’s ED community was based a lot around high fashion models, as I remember. Honestly I think this is because your ED tells you that being thin is what makes you beautiful. You don’t think about all the actual symptoms that would come from being underweight. No one is idolizing average-looking skinny people. It’s always these aspirationally attractive people. Like K-pop idols. -	I read someone’s theory on this years ago, and they proposed that ED communities flourish because they are inherently competitive. I don’t feel that way anymore but I think most of us have had that feeling of constantly comparing ourselves to others.

Teenagers will often (un?)intentionally say/do awful things to try and be part of a group, so they belong somewhere and can build an identity off of that - we've all heard of teenage phases etc. And they tend to take those crafted identities to extremes because that feels more unique and distinct from other people's identities... but they still need to have people who think similarly to them in order to get that sense of belonging. It's a balancing act.   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  I think a LOT of teenage girls go through a period of disordered eating, even if it would not 'qualify' as an ED. If you combine that with the weird romanticisation of people with mental health issues (but only the cool ones, of course) being these tortured souls/long-suffering martyr types and a need for attention (not a negative thing!! Just being sought out in a negative way), then the kind of community you're describing seems like a natural consequence. They have a 'tribe' they can belong to, they can build an identity which is made up of apparently positive traits (self-disciplined, martyred, health-conscious, attractive), and they have space for exploring the very real experiences of disordered eating.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  So, yes, some of these people are probably just acting like and saying they have an ED for attention and to be part of a group, and yes, that is damaging, frustrating behaviour. I can understand why it angers you as you understand how devastating an ED can be, and they probably do not, and treat it as a trend or a badge of honour. But I can promise you that it doesn't come from malice, just ignorance and the general bizarre, scary nature of being a teenager.
