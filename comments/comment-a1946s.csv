I just had another such epiphany at Thanksgiving when I was confronted with how much my normal weight coworkers and relatives eat.   I‚Äôm a formerly obese binger who is now restricting to 800-1000 calories per day, but the binge monster is still very much alive and I still have skewed perceptions of things. Like, you mean normal people can just eat 4 bites of very rich cake and just stop? They routinely have leftovers because they don‚Äôt feel compelled to clean their plates?? There‚Äôs actually something in their brains that tells them to stop eating when they‚Äôre full??? They can stand to eat slowly and chew a lot????   Otherwise I avoid eating with people, so I tend to not notice how different their habits and attitudes are from mine. I almost start thinking maybe I‚Äôm just a normal person. lol Nope.

I was like, ""You know what, you eat at least 1,000 calories a day, you're normal.""  But then I was like, ""But normal people don't take appetite suppressants instead of snacks, and they don't cry if they eat a pizza or french fries in public, and they don't buy XL clothes when they're small.  Normal people don't start exercising right before midnight if they didn't make a deficit yet.  They don't cry after seeing the number on the scale.  Nor do these people don't go to sleep hungry to avoid going over and not making a deficit.  And they don't secretly eat yogurt, popcorn, and anything else as soon as they're the only one in the house who's awake..."" And so on, and so forth.",False,False
