I started running on the treadmill and was so proud of myself that I could run at high intensity for 10 minutes straight, so I kept trying to do that. Almost everyday, but it was actually getting harder and harder for some reason. I was also trying to watch what I ate nonstop while getting in as much exercise as possible through my daily life. Parking as far away from buildings as possible, walking to the grocery store about a half-hour away so I wouldn't buy too much food since I couldn't carry much and I'd burn calories, etc.. I was dating a guy who was in the gym for hours every day. He drank protein smoothies and **only** ate high protein foods so he could build muscle mass. He was obsessed with his body and in hindsight he had his own eating disorder and body dismorphia. I worked my body down to nothing. By the end of the year I started shaking uncontrollably everyday and was diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder. I feel responsible for doing it at least partly to myself, but the diagnosis only sparked B/P issues.",False,False
