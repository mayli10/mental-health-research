That being said, there's been times now where I've eaten outside my meal plan without an ounce of guilt.",False,False

Just in the time being though, what worked or didn’t work for you? Just for your own personal thoughts on the matter. It’s cool if you don’t wanna share though, totally get it.",False,True

Some say honour the hunger, but for some that can lead to binging or a binge purge cycle if you feel out of control while eating. Others say stick to the meal plan and your body will learn to have regular hunger cues. But either is fine really, as long as you are meeting your needs in terms of calories. I'd discuss it maybe with a dietician.",False,False

Should I listen to these cravings/weird hunger cues or try to eat normally for now and they will subside?",False,True

Your body also craves high energy foods as it thinks it has been a period of famine and is trying to get as much food as it can to prepare for the next. You can also experience extreme hunger in this stage and it is completely normal. Everything settles once the body learns it is getting regular meals.",False,False
