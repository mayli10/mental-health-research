You paid lip service in the OP to feeling bad for thinking that way, but then listed all the reasons you felt justified in that opinion. It's like insulting someone, then saying ""no offense"" - I understand you raised this in the context of EDs and mental health, but that doesn't mean it was above reproach. It wasn't until other people in the comments started challenging the views you expressed that anything constructive or positive happened. So this is more of the same, which will hopefully lead to more of the same.  Also, it's disingenuous to imply that all content has equal potential to trigger. The potential for content to trigger people is something that should be considered on a case-by-case basis. It's not as easy to predict, in your example, that sharing experiences with a ""restriction high"" will cause someone else to reflect negatively on their own calorie intake as it is to predict that creating a thread titled ""I've become repulsed by fat people"" will trigger people's body image in a subreddit made for eating disorders, even if you talk about how badly you feel about it.  In short, yes, EDs are bad, and they impact the way we think, but that doesn't absolve us of individual responsibility for our words/actions. Like I said, I'm not criticising you for holding this opinion or for wanting to discuss it.

My recent experiences with people in the body positivity movement, including overweight/obese people, have been VERY negative.

Skinny people have been supportive of me and my ED because they understand- overweight people have continuously shamed me for being anorexic because they think it's fatphobic and I'm trying to oppress myself. If I manage to eat at maintenance but stick to healthy food, they shame me for my food choices and ""not letting go of it enough"". The past few months, I've only gotten harrassive comments from people who are overweight. I've only had my boundaries with food not respected by overweight people.  I recognize that this is an experience coined to me, and doesn't represent the broad community of those people, but it's the reason why I'm very.. prejudiced now, and I get OP completely.

But I know that‚Äôs my ED voice because I never EVER see my friends for their bodies/diet. Family... different story.  Most of my family has been overweight for the majority of my life. I used to have this bottomless appetite during my pre-teen years and was always praised for how much and how unhealthy I could eat and still remain super skinny.  Maybe I fucked up my metabolism or maybe I‚Äôm just no longer going through puberty but I don‚Äôt have that same appetite anymore and now that I am eating less  + eating less carbs my family sees all this as a characteristic of my ED. I get where they are coming from but only now after spiraling into anorexia have I realized that on top of past restriction tendencies I have had periods of emotional overeating too. I just never noticed it based on how my family encouraged overeating. I realized I never got to understand what fullness felt like. Feeling stuffed and bloated was normalized. I don‚Äôt like it and when I see my family getting increasingly sicker from their weight/lifestyle habits I get upset at seeing them suffer and then my ED convinces me that I am fat and on track to be like them.   Another point I want to make is how my family makes healthy eating sound like suffering. I eat healthy because I have health issues that would really benefit from eating this way and I just feel good overall. I believe in balanced nourishment not gluttony nor restriction. I am still trying to find balance in both but this has been my experience in also being repulsed by fat people (and I hate at all that I am).,False,False

That leads to women having health issues, being addicted to food, having more mental problems (because sugar worsens anxiety, depression, etc). This whole body positivity movement has turned mainly to that of fat acceptance. And yeah I don't like it. Because being fat isn't good. It's not because it's unattractive but because it makes people slaves in their bodies. It limits their physical capabilities. It affects their joints and their health. People who are overweight are usually slaves to their addiction and food and need help. it leads people to be less independent and productive and yeah usually unhappier. This movement is mainly targeted towards women and it is encouraging them to be stuck in their ways and not break away from their addiction to food but rather embrace it. It makes women weaker. We should be encouraging everyone to be healthy not for the sake of looking attraction but for liberation. Women taking control of their lives and building muscles and the gym and losing weight and be healthy is how that happens. Which is why this whole fat acceptance whatever movement bothers me so much.

That addendum about BED was probably better left out and the full sentiment should have been better explained, but I won‚Äôt edit the original to come across as nicer at this point. I find people who have a decent but ignorant relationship with food frustrating. Someone who could change their diet and body by cutting out easy extra calories with minimal stress. Diet or no soda, less cheese or sauce on food, less processed, etc.",False,True

We live in a fatphobic society, so every one of us sops up implicit negative feelings about fatness and overweight people. It just sounds like yours has gotten worse lately (not uncommon when you have an ED). I know it sucks to have upsetting thoughts manifesting in your head, but the important thing is that a. you're able to acknowledge these thoughts, b. you know these thoughts don't reflect your deepest values, and c. you strive not to let these thoughts affect how you interact with overweight people.   Like, it's so much worse to have these thoughts and refuse to confront them, whether bc you *believe* them and *are* voicing them and *want* overweight people to feel bad about themselves...or bc you can't recognize your implicit fatphobia and insist you're totally cool with fatness and don't notice that you're treating overweight people in not-great ways.   Bottom line, don't hate yourself for this! That helps nothing, and if anything, may make the thoughts feel even more powerful. You can be critical of your thoughts without coming down hard on yourself just for having them.",False,False

It‚Äôs not who you actually are, it‚Äôs just a part of your illness.   What matters at the end of the day isn‚Äôt your internal dialogue. There‚Äôs a quote I like, I can‚Äôt remember it exactly but it‚Äôs along the lines of, ‚Äúyour first gut reaction isn‚Äôt who you are; who you are is the rational thought that follows.‚Äù So when your instinct is to think ‚Äúgod that person‚Äôs is disgusting‚Äù and your brain follows it up with, ‚Äúthat was an unkind sentiment, I don‚Äôt know that person‚Äôs struggles,‚Äù the latter is what counts, not the former.",False,False

If fat people want to be happy in their bodies, that really doesn‚Äôt effect me. I‚Äôm overweight (thanks pre-bulimia BED) and know it‚Äôs unhealthy, but for me and many other fat people, feeling like shit can trigger overeating and binging. I think it‚Äôs worth exploring why you feel this way because it seems like you don‚Äôt want to. Sometimes being harsh and judging others is just a roundabout way of judging ourselves. Projecting self-hatred and body fears can be part of the eating disorder.   And I will warn you that your post may come off poorly due to the harsh language and a parentheses about BED probably won‚Äôt ameliorate that. I think it‚Äôs a positive step to admit that you don‚Äôt want to be judgmental anymore.",False,False
