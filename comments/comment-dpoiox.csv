It sounds like this person may have struggled to feel at home in their body despite having been at a healthy (not at all high) weight to start with.   When people talk like this it’s so so instinctive for me to turn it on myself and double down on judging my own body. The idea that I might see my body as “less disgusting” than anyone looking at me is terrifying to me. So I judge myself even more to try and protect myself, in a way. But the fact that someone else has a distorted perception does not mean I should increase my distortion too. Heck, I’ve got enough baggage of my own without picking up someone else’s! &lt;3   As for the response this person is getting from others...society in general also has a lot of confusion and turmoil about physical appearance. But as history can attest, loads of people being wrong in unison doesn’t actually make it right.",False,False

To be honest, I think the reason I developed an eating disorder was partly (largely) because my mom started calorie counting and bragging about her weight loss.   If it persists you can always mention the way it makes you feel",False,False
