It still often has the multiple entries issue but at least you can input everything by the gram. It even stops me from being lazy and if i have idk a coffee with mil and 1tsp sugar i have to put the coffee, the milk and the sugar in separately for a more accurate calorie count.  And, you know, it gives you a detailed break down of nutrients if you are really focusing on idk getting enough protein to stop hair loss or whatever.  And you can set your calorie limit to whatever the hell you want.",False,False

It's pretty great, except that it doesn't have as many prepackaged items listed as MFP does. It's great for if/when you're focusing on whole foods. Also, the measurement options are good.

It's extra annoying when it's something like a pint of blueberries. How much can a pint of blueberries possibly vary ffs (yes I know measuring in volume is not going to be 100% accurate but sTiLl)  I've noticed some people's solution to inaccurate entries is to make a new food entry and for the brand put their name. But part of why I'm using a damn app is so I don't have to search the calories.   My solution has been to just go with the highest calories on whatever I search and ""high restrict"" lmao. Pretty much all my meals are logged at 500 calories just to be safe. ",False,False
