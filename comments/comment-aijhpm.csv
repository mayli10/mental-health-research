I'd overhear them talking about my weight. I'd see them looking at my body, noticing the gaining. I had very low self esteem about my looks due to the way people treated me so gaining weight made it all worse. Ten years I spent overweight and now I'm at a normal weight, almost close to being underweight and I'll never go back. Even if that means starving and purging.  ",False,False

So I eventually found other ways.  I'm sure she would be proud if she knew where her attitude got me, but I stopped talking with her years ago.  (Sorry if that is more angry than sad.)",False,False
