I didn't have 3 meals a day because of my schedule, but I'd get breakfast sometimes by my school or get snacks after if I felt like it. When I got home, I'd go into the kitchen and have a snack, usually chips and dip or something. I'd eat the dinner my mom made, and if I liked one part of it a lot, I'd have as much as I wanted. If I had something unhealthy or excessive, I'd feel a bit bad but I'd move on because it didn't happen super often.  Mostly, it was just eating what I wanted. I wouldn't have to fight myself to avoid it. I'd have unhealthy food when I wanted it, in moderation. I was aware of what I needed to eat to function and be healthy, and while I didn't always follow it, I didn't fight it.  Going out to get food was so fun, and I'd love getting and trying new snacks and drinks. I miss that, now I just get diet stuff.  I didn't have the all or nothing mentality I have now, either. If I do let myself eat, I don't give a shit about moderation. I just feel like I should eat as much as possible before I'm not allowed again.",False,False

I'd never hide food, or sneak into the kitchen to binge. Meals were social family occasions firstly. Cooking was a good time to hang out with my mom.   I'd sometimes eat till I was full but that was usually saved for special occasions like parties or when we cook something extravagant. Otherwise you'd just eat till you weren't hungry anymore. Desserts and candies were treats, not coping mechanisms.   It also helped that I had brothers 2x my size who did a LOT of sports ( and are miles tall, not overweight) so eating a caloric surplus for them was a necessity. Which means they would eat all the fucking food in the house after practice (and bring their friends over too because our house had The Good Noms) so there was never anything available to tempt me to binge on. Lol  Can't binge if your house is full of quarterbacks carb loading everything in sight",False,False

I never thought about my body, and when I tried on clothes I cared more about the logo/pattern and didn't notice how my body looked at all.   I would sometimes lose weight when I went away for camp but I never yo-yo'd too much.   I wasn't self conscious about people taking photographs of me, I didn't think that other girls were better than me for being skinnier. I was always excited to eat pasta, pizza, chocolate cake etc. I ate snacks whenever I felt like it and didn't feel guilty afterwards. I didn't feel anxious before leaving the house and nothing in my closet made me feel 'fat' or uncomfortable. I enjoyed trying clothes on in changing rooms. I didn't notice/care that wearing baggy hoodys made me look 'bigger'. I never even looked at my body in the mirror, I just didn't think about it at all.",False,False

I don't even remember what it was like to just... Eat. I know I did it but I have absolutely zero memory of it.
