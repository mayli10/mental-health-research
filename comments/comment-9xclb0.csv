A diet by itself isn't illness and doesn't require oversight. The risks and consequences of giving wrong advice are far greater when discussing EDs. Idk I don't see it as hypocritical. ,False,False

I get they don’t want to be banned but in my opinion it’s hypocritical.,False,False

I have always loved that sub but I don’t think for a second that everyone has an ED.

They are NOT a sub that is about EDs. They are a sub for a specific diet which tbh is not objectively disordered.  Sure there are sometimes some suspicious looking posts, but I think often times when people try to analyze them and call them disordered, it really is just a manner of confirmation bias.  I also think it is worth noting that calorie deficits will result in similar behaviours between both disordered and non-disordered individuals. So intense cravings, binging, even certain thoughts regarding food and food obsession, are found in both groups during prolonged caloric restriction. The difference is in why someone is restricting calories, and how much psychological duress the process causes them overall, plus whether their able to maintain a normal life while restricting.
