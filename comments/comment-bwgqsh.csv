When I am deep in the throes of my ED, I love being alone because 1) I can either restrict or B/P to my heart's content. And 2) I struggle quite a bit with acting normal and not fixating on ED thoughts and food and exercise and calories. Like, I'm a normal, functioning adult but the second my ED comes back in full force I'm suddenly like ""what do I talk about other than calories? Quick... new topic. No! Casual comments about how you've gone to the gym 4 times in the last two days isn't better! Stop!""",False,False

I can absolutely spiral really deep when I'm completely alone. Whenever my roommates are at work I usually make myself leave the house even if it's to sit and read in the park or going up to the library or sipping a coke zero at mcdonalds. For some reason being alone in a quiet dark house makes things much much worse for my mental state.,False,False
