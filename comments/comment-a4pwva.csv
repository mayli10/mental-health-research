I usually do self-checkout because I generally don’t like talking to random people in stores but I like to think that if I had to go through a cashier’s lane and they said something about it I’d call them out on it.

(sorry, that was bad.) But anyway, that sounds like such an obnoxious comment to make. I don't understand what could be so fun about commenting about the food people buy.   I've had two people react to food that I've bought afaik. A cashier gave me a weird look (and in my peripheral I noticed she turned head in my direction as I was packing the food, this didn't feel like only paranoia ok) when I bought a frozen pizza, blueberry pie, and big bottle of diet coke at 8 pm. Another time when I was getting Nutella and a bag of bread, a person in the same queue as me said ''Nutella is really tasty, right?''. Just awkwardly replied ''yeah'' and tried to pay quickly lol",False,False

God why do they even make diet pickles, who ever heard of such a thing lolol""  Now I almost never go to stores without self-checkout anymore unless it's for a binge food I can't get anywhere else (looking at you trader joe's).
