I‚Äôm way younger than you are honestly, but I really relate with the ugliness thing. Anyway, as a person who witnessed my parents‚Äô divorce and how shitty my dad treated my mom (and also my friends‚Äô horrible experiences), I started to believe that marriage ends up horribly most of the time. You just meet a person for several months and then you‚Äôre vowing to spend 50 or something years with them? You get to realize their hidden flaws (spending too much/ too little, and I‚Äôve seen both. Being an alcoholic, being a cheater, being abusive) and it goes on and on. And who knows, if you end up with an ugly child that feels the same way you do, they may end up blaming you for even bringing them into this world (me with my parents),   I hope this doesn‚Äôt sound too harsh, but the thing is; maybe you should focus on better things. Focus on finding a skill you‚Äôre good at. It doesn‚Äôt even have to be something you have to join a class for, maybe art or writing. Something that helps you kind of escape and yet still be doing something productive. Try to fall in love with the idea of being alone (not completely alone, but just having a few close friends without being married). Imagine a cozy apartment or house in and playing your favorite music, watching whatever you want, and just bring you without anyone bitching about it. And just work for that. Try to let work or useful hobbies take up your space instead of marriage. Finding a good partner is really rare.   And honestly, it‚Äôs not even about looks for a relationship to be horrible. Trust me, my country has a lot of horrible looking boys/ girls who end up getting married to attractive people from other countries. So if you‚Äôre truly focused on getting married to a person from another country, there‚Äôs a bigger chance they might fall in love with purely because you‚Äôre a foreigner and they‚Äôre interested in your country or tradition.   I hope this helped in some sort of way. Really wishing you the best. ",False,False
