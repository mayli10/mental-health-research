Maybe lighting a candle while drinking the tea can help. Also having a water bottle nearby might make it easier to fight off the bedtime snack urges. I like to drink tea, listen to a calming video like rain sounds or ASMR, and diffuse this peppermint oil blend. Maybe keeping your hands busy like knitting or even treating yourself to a new blanket can make it so that you no longer want to risk getting crumbs on your bed. I hope something helps. I remember binging right before bed almost every night and waking up with a stomach ache, I hope that doesnâ€™t happen to you.",False,False
