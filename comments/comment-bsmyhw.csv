He also believes calories don't matter at all when it comes to weight gain, but makes fun of me for eating large portions of things like salad or popcorn. I don't think he truly understands how much I think about every food i put in my body and how poorly i view myself.",False,False

It entangles a terrible manic and depressive cycle. Its not the ED that is my problem. My problem is having these dark depressive relentless thoughts so I use the ED to help drag me out of it and give me a sense of control and make me stop thinking about something other than suicide. On days when I cant seem to get out of bed, I lie to him and say I've done like 30 crunches or some shit. and hes like ""GOOD JOB WOW. LETS GO ON A RUN NEXT."" me: .",False,False

Maybe throw some literature at him or link him to the NEDA website? I hate that people discount you when you actually do answer irritating questions like that.
