Like, literally one piece of paper that i just scribble everything i have to do on as soon as i remember. it's not in any order or anything but this way i can check over it say once or twice a day and then do everything that i can do in that moment and just leave it on there if i can't so I'll just read over it every time and don't forget until i can get it done. or immediately set alarms on my phone as soon as i know a to do or an appointment and then do it immediately. once the alarm rings (this takes some practice but it gets easier imo). sending hugs",False,False

I just want you to understand that I‚Äôm not doing this on purpose, and I have actually been trying really hard to get better at remembering things. I know that it must be frustrating for you and I know that I‚Äôm painful. But I need you to understand that I am not malicious or lazy. It feels like you and dad both think I am and that really hurts. I have been trying really hard and I‚Äôm sorry for being rude, but I‚Äôm just constantly frustrated.‚Äù   Reading it back now, its not the best, but whatever I can talk about it with her later.   I know I‚Äôve said this a lot but seriously, thank you for understanding, and for the resources, and for just being here right now. I really appreciate it.  The way you explain emotions really makes sense to me, and understanding and controlling them is a lot less frustrating when I think about it like that.",False,True

You are so understanding and mature for your age. You shouldn‚Äôt ever feel bad for what you feel or DONT feel. The thing is, the mind feels like the lungs breathe. There will always be feelings, and ‚Äúcontrolling‚Äù them doesn‚Äôt mean manipulating them, denying them, forcing them, it simply means we can be AWARE of our feelings and from that, we can chose how we react to them. You are well on the way to this, I can tell from the way you are aware of your feelings enough to feel uncomfortable with them. This is a really good sign!   I would totally send the message. Your parents might just need a reminder that you‚Äôre actually struggling with something bigger than normal teenage stuff. Are you on IG? If so, these accounts have some really great resources and infographics I think would be really helpful to share with your mum: the.holistic.psychologist , nedratawwab, and lizlistens :)",False,False

I just told her to get out and I just don‚Äôt know how I feel. I should feel bad for not being able to control my emotions. I should feel bad for speaking to my mum like that. But I don‚Äôt.

Like cool that high schools are trying buuuut.   Basically I started by finding teachers and guides who worked for me - I.e people I trusted, and reading and watching their material. You could try Mindvalley videos for a start, several of my friends are teachers there and I really really look up to them.   I also highly recommend lucid dreaming. I know it sounds a bit woo woo haha. Charlie Morley is an amazing teacher for this. Lucid dreaming allowed me to literally interact with my subconscious in a world of my choosing. I can create a scene, enter it, and ask to speak to the part of my brain that has an ED. And it all feels as real as my waking life does. This has truly been a fundamental part in my healing journey.   As for mindfulness and meditation, I really struggle with it ay. I feel such an intense resistance and anger when I‚Äôm forced to do it. But as soon as I surrender to it, I feel big changes. Start by bringing your awareness to your body, and then your mind. You don‚Äôt have to do anything. Just sit there, close your eyes and breathe. Take note of what you feel in your body and mind. Don‚Äôt push anything away. If you feel sadness, anger, hatred, joy, fear, excitement, whatever. Just breathe, and sit with the feeling.   I KNOW it sounds crazy üòÇ but I promise you, if you set your intention to learn to master your mind, you WILL.",False,False

I‚Äôve always been pretty close off towards mindfulness stuff since my high school really pushes it, but hearing what you‚Äôve done to make it work for you (rather than just following a blanket program for 800 teenagers lol) would be really interesting and helpful :) and I‚Äôm actually in Australia myself so we‚Äôre on the same timezone!",False,True
