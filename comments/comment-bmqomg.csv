Feeling ill when eating &gt;600 calories a day is not normal- either psychological or pathological. We don't know your medical history and we don't presume to give medical advice. Go see your doctor if you are actually concerned.,True,False

Well you can't defy the laws of thermodynamics. Clearly your judgement is very wrong (in many different ways), which would be obvious if you were at all honest with yourself.  And if you ""weren't trying to lose weight"" you wouldn't be trying to eat at 400 or 600 calories a day. So stop bullshitting yourself and stop bullshitting us. It's not fucking complicated, it's basic math. There's no condition in the world that'll make a 5'8'' person maintain or gain on 600 cals/day or even 1500 cals/day. So you're likely eating at least triple of what you claim.",False,False

It doesn't make any sense. The assumption would be that I'm overestimating my calories but that's not true. I've been stuck like this long enough to know what my body wants. I actually plan to eat 400 every day before I go to bed just in case I do overestimate.
