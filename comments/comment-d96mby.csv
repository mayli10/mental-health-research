I'm a former barista and even though I'm in a career in marketing, I still think I'd secretly be endlessly happy having a little coffee shop in a log cabin somewhere remote (that makes espresso martinis and sells wine in the evening).   I completely understand where you are coming from though. I've only just been able to have cappuccinos again after months of staying away from foamy milk.",False,False

Surviving the world and it's rat race is hard, and you are allowed things that make it a little more bearable.  Besides which, medically, caffeine is the best way to start your day. Coffee naturally spikes your metabolism so you burn more fat when you have caffeine in your body than if you don't.  It works much better on a fasted system, which is why it's the best way to break the fast you build up through the night.   A good coffee also gives a burst of dopamine as you experience the pure joy of your favourite cup of java. You will have a better day, every day, by starting the morning with your favourite coffee.  The tannins in coffee are good for your heart.  If you have any milk, including nut milks, in your coffee, then it is also a source of vital protein - making it easier for your muscles to keep your body moving.  In conclusion, coffee is the nectar of Gods, both flavour wise but also health wise. Like everything, it should be drunk in moderation (lol) but there's definite health benefits to having your fav coffee in the morning.",False,False
