Bread will never really inherently be a health food I think, but it's a good source of energy and can totally fit into a healthy diet. The more whole grains you use, the healthier the bread will be (more fibre + vitamins &amp; minerals), but most recipes will use some proportion of refined bread flour because that gives the best texture (think of the texture of light, fluffy bread made with 100% white flour vs. a really dense wholegrain rye bread).  You'll probably be looking more into making lean breads! They're a bit harder to work with compared to enriched breads like bread rolls or basic grocery store loaves but they're lots of fun. The sidebar over at r/Breadit/ is definitely a good place to start. [Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/tags/breadmaking%20101) has some good articles to start with too. Youtube is also a great resource.  I'd say start by learning the basics, maybe get a sourdough starter going ðŸ‘€. Once you get a hang of the techniques and the basic science behind breadmaking you're pretty much set and can explore using different grains and flour blends.   (Also, the dutch oven is one way to introduce steam during the baking process, which slows down the formation of the crust, letting your bread rise more while also helping it crisp up better towards the end of baking.)",False,False
