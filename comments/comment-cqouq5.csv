Omg tho I’m so glad you told her - you are really helping out other people too 💕💕💕.   Hopefully a good therapist can help with what happened at the crap one! I bet they will be hella pissed off on your behalf.   FWIW, been there done that w this type of stuff. My sibling had ED therapists refuse to believe that it wasn’t due to sexual trauma and that SOMEONE had obviously raped them. It was super traumatic and they literally fled the place :( We’ve all collectively got your back here 💕",False,False

Holy fuck, this is the kind of experience that hearing about made me so scared to get therapy or see a psychiatrist for YEARS. Shit, I’m so sorry.   Good ones are out there - I’m so sorry you opened yourself in a vulnerable position and were ill-used. That was incredibly awful and you will be incredibly strong moving on from it. On the plus side -  now you know what you do NOT want from a therapist 🤪",False,False
