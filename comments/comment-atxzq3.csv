That is a good way to describe it.   The most vivid incident I remember was when I was taking an elevator and a very large man got on with me. I could hear his laborerd breathing. I could see the sweat rolling down his forehead. All I could think was ""please don't let this guy have a heart attack right now."" It was so uncomfortable. I felt like such an ass.   Then my dad passed away from cancer. He was 400lbs when he went into the hospital and just over 300 when he passed. That was about the time my body issues ramped up and I lost 60lbs. I'm so afraid of those health consequences; I think that mixed with the pretty relentless teasing I got growing up has resulted in my discomfort around very obese people.   Feederisum is a whole other level of scary. To me it seems like a way to control the feedie and borders on/crosses over to abusive. ",False,False
