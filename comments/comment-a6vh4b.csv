I'm scared that I won't be able to cut, for some reason. Even though I literally did just do a cut... altogether *too* successfully lol.   Several people have assured me that as long as I'm conservative and careful with it, I'll like my body better even before I cut the fat. I'll believe it when I see it :p ",False,True

Then when you look in the mirror and don't like what you see on the odd day here and there, you can remind yourself, ""I am doing the right thing. I know I am stronger, both mentally and physically, because I have objectively been doing the right thing for my body"".",False,False
