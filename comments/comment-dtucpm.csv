Actually, before I became anorexic I had problems with stress eating too, I could literally eat 2 bowls of ramen and a whole chocolate bar in one sitting, so I understand where you're coming from. But tbh, not being able to eat is bad too, even if it may sound good, when you're trying to recover, as I do now. I have so much stress because of school and have at least one crying/breakdown session again because of how much I hate myself and want this all to end etc... so, of course, J just don't have the energy to eat, and rarely do as a consequence. Thing is, that I'm already underweight by 10kg and will have to go to a hospital if I don't gain weight in the time to come, I literally have to eat so I don't die, but I just can't. And I know, you can't compare both but still, you should NOT be jealous of this.   Ps: I'm sorry if you have a hard time run, but remember, you are being loved and you can always get help, even if it doesn't seem like it sometimes",False,False

I've been dealing with depression and anxiety for years, and there was only ONE episode when my depression made me lose my appetite.

Or I binge because I'm anxious, then I tell myself I'm going to restrict, I get even more depressed and I'm like ""fuck it, gonna binge"".",False,False
