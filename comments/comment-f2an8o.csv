I'm pretty sure those girls don't understand the gravity of the situation, it's also an age thing, people start to settle down when they are around 25, so it's normal.  For some people like you and me, misery comes knocking on your door when you are still a child, and you have to deal with the difficulties of the world, and hopefully be more empathic after going through those hard times.  But a lot of people don't go through EDs and other traumatic experiences, or at least, don't have to face the harsh reality until they are in their mid 20s and looking for a job. It's not that they mean to harm, they probably don't know they are saying hurtful stuff.  Maybe they are narcissistic bitches who just wanted to hurt you, but who am I to tell.",False,False
