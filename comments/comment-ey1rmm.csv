I liken it to how when you start to really clean and organize a messy room, it tends to get way messier before things are really put to rights. Of course, there are also considerations of finding a therapist that’s a good fit for you and your needs in terms of both personality and expertise. There are also quite a few different types of therapy and it can take a little time to discover what will be most effective for you. (After two not-good-fits, my first ‘good’ therapist eventually realized I needed someone with a more trauma-informed practice and she suggested switching to a different person in town. And that new person connected me to DBT which has been the best fit for me so far and has helped a lot.)   I’ve seen a few reasons for why I had the worse-before-better arc: - Like you, I waited a long time to ask for help. Actually talking about the things I had been dealing with for so long and hearing those words out loud with another person, that was an overwhelming experience. I was swamped with emotions and a new sense of just how dark things had gotten. - Seeking help is stressful. How do I deal with stress? Yup. With the exact thing I’m seeking help for. - Destructive instincts often aren’t very happy at our taking a close look at them. They start screaming even louder than usual when we’re thinking about firing them as the boss of our universe.   Your concerns are valid and important, and would probably be great things to bring up at your next appointment. I hope the therapist will listen and have helpful suggestions. If I could go back in time to 19 year old me, the first thing I would tell her is that she deserves help that helps, and that finding that is possible.",False,False

I have had at least 5 different therapists over the course of my life and was very skeptical of it, in general, because I never made progress. I started counseling again in January with yet another new therapist and this time it is actually helping. Her personality and insights are exactly what I have needed. I feel supported, heard, and understood with her. She has helped me realize I need to be kinder to myself. It’s worth giving it a try. You aren’t obligated to continue if it isn’t what you need. Good luck.",False,False
