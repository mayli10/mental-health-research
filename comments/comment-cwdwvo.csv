I just got my blood tested though and my electrolytes and iron are pretty wacky, so I think that might be it, maybe you should check that as well especially if you purge. My creatinine, albumin, and potassium were too high, and my ferritin is basically nothing. I’m hoping once I can balance my levels the nausea will go away.",False,False
