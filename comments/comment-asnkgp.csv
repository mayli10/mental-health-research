I found if you stretch out as much as possible and if you can get up and walk around it helps a lot. A cold and wet washcloth on the face is also helpful to me. Idk if that'll help you but it's worth a shot.,False,False

Thereâ€™s another technique in meditation which I am just learning and havenâ€™t perfected it yet but have already tried with some success, seems promising. When you feel an unpleasant emotion, try to focus on the location of the sensation, which part of your body do you feel it in the most. Could you ascribe it a particular shape or a color? When Iâ€™ve tried this Iâ€™ve found that looking towards it in this way actually makes it dissipate a little bit.  Regarding the food anxiety, take one step at a time. Small bites. Breathe. Remind yourself you made the rational decision to do this, that you made a promise to yourself. It may help if you think of it as medicine. You donâ€™t want it, ok. But you need it. Think about when you may have got up early one morning for work or school, when you really wanted to stay in bed. You just go through the motions because you want an education, because you need to make money to pay your bills. Apply the same logic. Do what you can, and youâ€™ll be so proud of yourself and with each victory the anxiety will decrease.   It gets easier! Very best wishes.",False,False
