Sounds like maybe it‚Äôs time to rethink the relationship (I mean, not that you aren‚Äôt already). You deserve better, and plenty of people out there will treat you better.

But I will at least play partial devil‚Äôs advocate depending on details of the porn/masturbation stuff... is he literally unwilling to have sex with you? If so, then yeah, the relationship should come to an end.   But masturbation and porn wouldn‚Äôt be dealbreakers for me. My husband and I have radically different sex drives. He wants a lot of sex whereas I tend to forget it‚Äôs even something I‚Äôm supposed to be wanting. So he needs some extra stimulation between episodes of my libido rearing its tiny head. It doesn‚Äôt bother me. And I‚Äôm bi, so I definitely understand getting aroused by women on the internet, lol. At the end of the day, if we could change one thing, I think it would just be that my libido is higher. He has never told me I‚Äôm fat and always says that even if he were, he‚Äôs attracted to my body because it‚Äôs mine.  At the VERY least, if the relationship continues, your SO needs serious education on what kinds of things it‚Äôs okay to say to someone with an eating disorder history, and what just aren‚Äôt. Bare minimum. So sorry you‚Äôre in this situation. :(",False,False

I'm sorry you had to go through that. It's heartbreaking. Especially when he knew I had AN in the past. üíî But such is life. Hopefully he'll get counseling and I'll get my shit together.

You deserve so much better than that and I really hope you know that.   I haven‚Äôt been pregnant but my ED started to develop because I found out my partner hid similar habits to your partner and lied about it for years. I was devestated (mainly because they were thinspo). I wasn‚Äôt even overweight at the time but now I‚Äôm underweight, and I still feel empty inside.   Take care of yourself honestly, you sound like you‚Äôve been through a lot and his comments on your body and porn ain‚Äôt worth shit.",False,False

In reality what I really want is for you to do yourself up more."" I ALMOST DIED GIVING BIRTH THEN HAD MY HIP SURGICALLY BROKEN IN 4 PLACES AND THEN HAD THAT DONE AGAIN. FUCKING FORGIVE ME. But in reality I guess he has a ""porn addiction"" and exhibits the classic signs of multiple failed relationships because beginning of relationships are new so the porn gets sidelined until the newness wears off and then its back to that. We aren't currently together, we're on a mandatory 90 day break and are only reevaluating at the end of 90 days and POSSIBLY trying to date at that point. Only if he goes to counseling and doesn't masturbate or watch porn this entire 3 months. And if he ever does again it's instantly over.",False,True
