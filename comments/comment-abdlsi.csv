Interestingly, I could starve all week no problem, but religious fasting was a huge anxiety/binge trigger for me.  I'm not Mormon anymore, but I do have fasting days occasionally.  These days I just say ""I'm full"" and that gets me out of most unwanted food situations.",False,False

I think, ""wouldn't the gods see how devoted you are if you refuse to eat?"" But in my heart I know I'm doing it for the wrong reasons and it still feels wrong. I've fasted over 72 hours for a spell once though. It felt like it worked better, but it could have just been the mix of no food plus coffee. ",False,False

I want to try it again and see if it makes me feel that way again.,False,False
