Turn that shit around. Say to yourself I have an ed its not my fault its an illness im going thru enough shit right now im a tough bitch for getting thru taco night and trying to still build a relationship.  Focus on good things your doing. Even the little things your still trying to do count. Cut that self debricating shit out best you consciously can,False,False
