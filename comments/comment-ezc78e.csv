One thing I've learned is people don't always understand what a problem means to you, as in how much distress it causes you. They don't mean to invalidate you, they just don't understand what's going on inside your head, what your experience is like.    I think that's part of the thing with EDs, acting out internal pain and hoping people notice. I think it's better to tell people.",False,False
