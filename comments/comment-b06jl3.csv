I know when I was in high school, I would've never in a million years told someone unless I was super close to them and trusted that wouldn't tell anyone else.",False,False

I'm glad she has you in her life.  Do you know if there are any adults she trusts, like a teacher or a guidance counselor or something? I think it might be a good idea to try to tell someone you think she might feel safe talking to, if you know of anyone.   This might sound silly, but if you frame things in ""I statements,"" people get less defensive. For example, instead of saying, ""you aren't eating very much at school and it's worrying me,"" you could say, ""I feel really worried when I see you skipping lunch all the time."" Also, if you're comfortable with it, it might help to make it clear to her if she doesn't already know that you understand where she is coming from. That's ONLY if you want to talk about it yourself. If you don't, that's totally ok!",False,False
