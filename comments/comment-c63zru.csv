Like those jean leggings cause they feel and stretch like leggings but look like jeans so maybe it'll feel less casual but still comfy  I feel you on the not too flowy/baggy thing. If you're comfy with dresses, I'd suggest and a-line dress that is cinched/has a belt at the waist or below the bust. It gives definition like ""oh theres her waist she's clearly very tiny""  It should be breathable and flowy while still showing people that you are not lumpy (cause you are not!!!!)",False,False
