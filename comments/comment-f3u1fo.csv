Like, a White Monster is usually 6-8 per can; the FDA lets companies mark anything under 5cal as 0cal for some bizarre fuckin reason, so Monster can make the serving size half a can and still say it's zero calories despite each of those two servings being three or four calories.  So, like. A 10cal energy drink is just barely above average and for me it's well worth it if the taste is good enough and the caffeine is high enough.",False,False
