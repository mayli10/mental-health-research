It definitely stems from our EDs, but we’re not as holds about it, and more often they’re just thoughts we don’t vocalize.",False,False

When people act like flaming dicks in those subs, they probably get downvoted/reported/deleted/banned real fast, so that's probable a reason I don't see it too often!  I remember back in Livejournal days (late 1990's early-mid 2000's) some people were VICIOUS in the ana/mia subs. There was one community owner that would insult/disrespect anyone who didn't have a less than 16bmi, and there was another girl in a different community who would mercilessly mock people who were bulimic but she was really skinny and always kept posting pics of herself so people (even the bulimic girls) just kept sucking up to her, it was so gross.",False,False

Yeah, that's exactly where my thought process went. Maybe ""kindness"" is the wrong word and ""empathy"" is better.  I'm not in most of those subs but I'm not surprised, either. It probably helps that they're support spaces and moderation is done with that in mind, but even so...moderators are people too, and maybe that's an example more than a negation.",False,True

I guess it just comes off to me like a symptom more than anything else.  I definitely see more judgment about others' food and weight habits, but even then, a surprising number of the posts include ""I feel so badly for thinking this and I'd never say it to their face"". And I don't know that I've seen increased judgment about any other topic.  Of course, YMMV. God knows most assholes think it's justified or not-that-bad because [insert reasons], so motivation and backstory can only excuse so much. I wouldn't want to imply that being a symptom and being a dick move are somehow mutually exclusive. Just that I've gotten the impression that it tends to be expressed as nasty private thoughts, even intrusive ones, more than anything else.  And there's definitely individuals who survive serious shit and come out of the other side as a rude asshole who picks on shit that doesn't matter. How? I dunno. But I can't help but feel like they're the exception to the rule.",False,True

I kinda noticed that my examples were starting to revolve around money, just because virtually everyone I've known who did seem to have a perfect life (and was very shallow and petty about others' flaws like 'lol u losers') came from money, but I'm sorry if that implied that wealth automatically=a pristine life.  That's not true, and it'd be a really unfair kick in the teeth for anyone who lived through hellish shit regardless of what their parents made or how well they did for themselves.",False,True

But look at that in and of itself. Your example of being judgmental was privately thinking something. And if you didn't go ""ehh it's off to think that, though"", you wouldn't have shared it here.  Meanwhile, take a hit for every customer with perfect hair who screams at cashiers for not accepting expired coupons/saying ""no problem"" instead of ""no thank you""/breathing wrong.  *And they think they're in the right.*  I know that group of people is mostly just a loud minority, though. What I'm trying to say is that I bet you're actually a pretty nice person who's overly hard on themselves about shit.  Sometimes I get weirdly angry at people with great families who complain about minor stuff like being asked to help around the house, too. But I keep it to myself and acknowledge that it's rooted in jealousy and pain. That's all any of us can do, you know? Can't help feelings, only words and actions.",False,True

I at least find it hard to not judge people who haven't had the same issues I've had.   It's easy to be supportive here since everyone has the same problems, so everything is very relatable, but also I feel like this sub is self-selective as people don't come here if they don't want to talk about their issues.",False,False
