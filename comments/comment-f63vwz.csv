OP is at a beach and sees a woman in a bikini, and OP's initial reaction is ""Wow, that looks awful"". Right after which, OP questions themself as to why their initial thought was so mean and spiteful. They came to the conclusion that our first thoughts are how we were conditioned to think, and our second thoughts are how we truly are. It's good that you recognised it as a harmful mindset, ED mindsets warp your perception of things.  I don't think you're a bad person for thinking what you did at all.",False,False
