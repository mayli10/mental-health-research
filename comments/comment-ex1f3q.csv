Maybe even hair masks if you can afford them. I have heard that repairing conditioners are only for certain kinds of damage and can make hair less healthy if used when not needed, so idk if those are a good idea. You should ask a salon worker. They have to go to school to learn stuff like that, so they'll know.",False,False

I believe polyunsaturated fats may also help, but I don't quite remember. I just remember that Omega-3 has anti-inflammatory properties while Omega-6 has inflammatory properties. Both are important to maintaining health as inflammation is a part of the healing process, but you want at least double the Omega-3 as you do Omega-6. I don't know by what metric you would need to double however. I can't imagine it is by gram because you need so much more Omega-6 to reach the RDA. I think the comparative RDA is what is important from what information I have come across. (Admittedly this is sparse information.) It seems that getting a ratio equivalent to 200% the RDA of Omega-3 to 100% the RDA of Omega-6 is ideal.",False,False
