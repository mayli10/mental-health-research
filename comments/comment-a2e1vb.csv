Family and friends are not therapists, they have no place meddling. It's not only useless, but it's also harmful.",False,False

I find it most helpful for my peace of mind to make a joke of it. When he starts making comments, I'll go ""weeewooo food police! Hands up!"" Or whatever, and he gets the point that his comments aren't appreciated without it having to be like, a serious conversation, which can be exhausting.",False,False

I have to block out my SO sometimes because if I have a set back he will tell me how disappointed he is and he truly doesn't understand why that makes it so much worse. He shouldn't get to be disappointed in me for failing when I have a serious illness and neither should your friend. ,False,False
