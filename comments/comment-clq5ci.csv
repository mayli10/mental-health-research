I’m only in high school, but when you’re at home with your parents all day they notice when you don’t eat. At least at school I can skip breakfast and just give my packed lunch away, and then the only meal I HAVE to eat is dinner which ends up being pretty low calorie since my mom is a health nut.",False,False

I mean, it's weird, bc my mind is sharper when I eat less, but if I eat nothing at all there's just this quasi-physical fog that sets in and I can't concentrate. My recommendation would be to eat unexciting brain food that fills you up for a while. Which for me was usually oatmeal. If I ate anything I truly craved at that juncture, it easily turned into a binge (that also prevented me from doing work, both bc I was wasting time binging, and then bc I was too depressed to do anything but lie in bed hating myself).",False,False

School just takes so much energy that when I get home I really wanna binge. Idk. I can restrict better on school breaks?? Everyone else says they think it‘s easier during school,False,False

Coffee helps. But in general I find it harder to binge at school when I only rely on my meal plan.",False,True

Did you struggle with this, if so, how’d you deal with it? I can fast during the school day but it’s when I’m back home and I gotta get down to business is when I’m most susceptible to a binge.",False,False
