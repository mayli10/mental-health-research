Now it’s keeping that momentum and NOT binging tonight and getting back to the gym again tomorrow. It’s a shitty, uphill battle but I’m glad there are so many kind people on this board to help..",False,True

It’s hard separating out disordered eating from anxiety and sometimes it gets so blurry, but even when I’m eating well and working out consistently I’m still on klonopin and gabapentin ( +CBD oil at night) for panic attacks. I feel like it makes my habits so much worse because I’ll get so immobilized that I can’t bring myself to purge on my own, but I’ve been taking these supplements (Catalyst Gold) that seem to be helping when I eat too much ... I wouldn’t recommend them as they have weird side effects including bloating and terrible sulfur breath so that makes the anxiety even WORSE, ha.   One thing that does help me get back in barre is doing one of the on demand classes on the PB app. It’s a good reminder that 95% of the time, I can get through the workout, and it’s more of the other stuff making it hard to go to class. I’ve been disordered eating for so long my metabolism is shot and after my dad passed away I went from 145 (5”7, and 145 was already super high for me) and I’m now at 175 ... down from a high of 212 🤦🏻‍♀️😣.  Walking into a studio of girls that are all so much thinner is really, really hard, and even when I’m shopping around in the studio for size M Leggings or a L sports bra (I’m 34DD, so no getting around that size as much as it sucks), all I can find is xsmall/small.   I don’t know you or your situation, but maybe try the app for an on demand class or I think you can get them on YouTube if you don’t have the pass for the app. I bet you’ll get through the workout and feel a bit more in control and better about getting back into a class. when it’s especially bad I ask random friends, coworkers, and now reddit to push me ... I obviously don’t tell the people in my life why I need some support to get into a class, but I’ve found people rarely question you if you just keep getting it vague &amp; relatable like “oh I haaaate working out, but I need to get back to barre today or I’ll lose my class pass for the week. Would you maybe remind me I need to go later?”.  Always here if you wanna chat 🖤.",False,True

Because at the end of the day - nobody really cares lol   I mean.. people in the gym usually think the same. Everyone always worries about themself.  And your husband sounds great. He sounds like a good person and remember he's with you for a reason. I'm sure he loves you and he thinks you're beautiful. Did you ever compare him to some other random dude at the gym? I'm guessing not, and he didn't think this way about you. Don't let your brain get the best of you. ",False,False

I’m so nervous about the weirdest stuff before classes ... will my water bottle fit in the holder? Will some random person that bullied me 15 yrs ago be there (despite living 2 hours away from my hometown, ha). And to make it worse my husband is coming with me for support which I SHOULD be so grateful for but all I can think is that he will see me compared to people so much thinner and fitter and think I’m as disgusting as I do 🥺",False,True
