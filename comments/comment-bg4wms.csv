Even people with exposure to other mental illnesses can‚Äôt seem to wrap their heads around our particular brand of neuroses, not even people who understand addiction, which I consider to be the most similar. It‚Äôs painful, but we can‚Äôt really blame them... I understand on a non-emotional level that I must be a fucking nightmare to deal with and why people can‚Äôt understand just why the fuck I can‚Äôt get my shit together. It‚Äôs often mentioned here that eating disorders seem to be the only mental disorders left that sufferers get blamed for having. It sucks, but sometimes it really does feel like we only have each other.   FWIW, you‚Äôll always have support on here.",False,False

I used to feel as if my friends hated me, and all I wanted to do was to lie in bed and sleep all day... Everything will settle down and things will turn out to be fine in the end, I can promise you that. Never forget that you are not alone and that you will always find people who love and support you in this community ‚ô°",False,False
