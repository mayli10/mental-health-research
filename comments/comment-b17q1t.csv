They're always chapped, but I think it's because I can't leave them alone long enough for them to heal. I also pick and bite my cuticles. I wouldn't say it's as a way to not eat but if I'm not eating I'm biting my lips and cuticles so it's probably more about the part of brain that gets obsessive over everything. ",False,False

For me, it's definitely a way to cope with stress/boredom - I do it a lot when I'm browsing the Internet and not doing something more engaging, for example. I mainly pick my face, and it's gotten worse because I recently went on testosterone (I'm transgender) which has caused my acne to get worse. It's a shitty cycle of getting pimples because I pick at my face/hormones, then I pick at the pimples, which causes scarring and more pimples, and so forth. It sucks.",False,False
