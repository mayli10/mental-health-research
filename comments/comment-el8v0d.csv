I haven't had the laxative problem since I barely use them but I can't count the number of times where I *just barely* dodged the bullet of peeing on myself in public because of all the diuretic teas and water I consume.

Far from it, it got to the point where I felt queasy way too easily and ended up not being able to control the purging bit of it. not glamorous at all . I cringe .
