'oh i wish i had this person's *before* body. they must've been feeling awful at this weight but .,.. i wish this was me ugh' and then even worse is when they weigh more than me in the after picture and still look better :( makes me think 'wow i can't win'. like the girl who posted today is my height and weighs more than me now and looks so much cuter :( i am so happy for her but also feel terrible and i feel terrible for measuring myself with someone who managed to rid themselves of this garbage illness (to whatever degree they managed to recover, obviously ED thoughts stay around for a long time even afterwards)",False,True
