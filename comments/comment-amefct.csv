I'm not in school but I do have a treatment team that does help a bit. All this is despite that help, which makes it feel even more hopeless. Like, I have all these resources to get better, but I'm still unable to.  But you are right about things being overwhelming and too heavy. I'll try to approach my friends the way you suggested, and I think you've given me the push I need to finally commit to maintenance calories for now. Really, thanks.",False,True

So here are some for you  You need to reach out to a doctor. It's too hard to live like this and you don't have to. You can find a better way to be healthy and have experiences with food that aren't terrible  You can reach out to your friends and just tell them you're struggling. If you're worried you might trigger them, just talk about mood stuff. That you're scared, and this is hard.   Do you have other resources? Are you in school? If you are, make an appointment with the student health center for counseling. Even if they're not great, they can refer you to someone who can help.   I want you to pick one thing to put down right now. Maybe it's cardio exercise, maybe it's changing your calories to a ""maintenance"" amount, maybe it's figuring out how to fit in a candy bar.   Sometimes we have to put things down, if only because they are too heavy. Things are too heavy for you right now. That doesn't mean you're failing. It means you understand that something has to change and youre willing to take the steps to change it. Because something has to change. That's why you posted here. This is too hard. And it's ok to realize that and to decide that things have to be different.   I'm going to repeat it, because this was really important to me: sometimes you have to put things down, simply for the fact that they are too heavy. ",False,False

It sucks. I just recently had the courage to go to the doctor about my depression myself, and now I'm starting actual treatment(just meds for me), and even though I can't really tell much of a difference in my moods yet, I already am starting to feel better just knowing I'm finally getting help. You should really reach out to someone. A doctor if possible, maybe a teacher or counselor at school, your family, or one of your friends, as much as you don't want to. The thought that finally pushed me to get help was, would I rather go to the doctor and be vulnerable and get help, or...die. Cause I'm sure I would wind up killing myself at some point if I dont get treatment.   That's me, though. All I'm saying is I understand how you're feeling. Sometimes I feel the loneliest when I'm surrounded by people I know. Even if you decide you're not ready to reach out to someone in real life or seek help, we're still here.  ED's suck",False,False
