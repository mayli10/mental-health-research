I binged too, a lot actuall, but little 14y.o. Finnley stuck her fingers down her throat a few times but could never bring herself to purge, because I also had crippling anxiety about dentists and tooth decay, so no bulimia.  I don't even think orthorexia was in the DSM back then, but I wonder now why they didn't think it was EDNOS.  For years and years my only diagnosis was anxiety and they all believed that everything else would go away if i just got over my fear of high cholesterol/heart disease/all the other things i thought food would give me. And \~obviously\~ my overexercising was all about performance, not thinly veiled purging. I fit the mold I guess, overobsessive straight-A athlete - and they never looked any deeper  &amp;#x200B;  Fast forward to my first therapist visit as an adult, after I broke down sobbing in my GP's office when I had an elevated blood pressure reading. I'm still sort of trying to lose weight, because obviously my heart health is at stake, but as soon as I started telling her my process and restricting and all my fear foods she called it what it is - orthorexia - and said that's probably what i had before too. I've decided against anxiety meds this time. I don't think it's as bad as before. I've only binged once so far. I feel better after going to therapy now, whereas 14 year old Finnley was a brat and hated it",False,False

I was in inpatient for a suicide attempt and my roommate caught me purging. She told a tech and I quickly got branded with an ED note in my chart and bulimia diagnosis ,False,False
