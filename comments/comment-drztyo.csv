Also maybe it‚Äôs just confusing because of the math? Because if I‚Äôm not mistaken a deficit of 10,500 is 3 pounds (because 3,500x3=10,500). But if you divide 10,500 by 7 (days in a week) you get a deficit of 1,500 which I was getting a deficit of about 800-1,000 a day from cutting food and the rest is from my workouts and the walking.

I was thinking, hmmm do you go to the same hilly campus I did with a certain set of ‚Äùdeath stairs‚Äù but sounds less likely (but not impossible) if you have a bunch of pets in your dorm too :)   The thing is, with 3lbs/week (10,500 calories), that‚Äôs a 2,700 deficit/day, so you‚Äôd have to burn 2,700/day and not eat anything (or burn 3,900/day while eating 1,200). It makes sense if you‚Äôve lost water weight (but not something that continues to keep happening) but otherwise, I don‚Äôt know how anyone would manage to burn 2,700 calories a day while fasting every single day in order to be losing fat at a rate of 3lbs/week. I think it‚Äôs my damn brain fog these days, this is all a tad more confusing to me than I would expect - I‚Äôm noticing that this time around my brain fog is much worse/noticeable.

I think 2,000 a day is pretty normal for a young woman. I only count my food calories and not what I spend but my general expenditure is that I walk about 5 miles a day on a hilly campus and I‚Äôm pretty proactive in general (cook all my meals, dishes by hand everyday, other assorted house chores pretty often).  I also have to walk like 20 flights of stairs a day on top of my normal walking. So I think that‚Äôs what has me at 2,000 a day, or a bit higher from the walking. I think it all just adds up. I probably burn 30 calories here from cleaning my pet‚Äôs homes, 15 for taking out the garbage and recycling, etc. adding maybe 150 or more a day in chores.   On top of that I usually do a hike once a week for fun not for burning calories and sometimes I‚Äôll do leisure walks (maybe 1 a week or so for 30 min). As for intentional working out I run 2x a week for about 45 minutes each time (and about 1/3 is uphill) and I do weight lifting 2x a week about 45-60 minutes each time. My workout routine changes somewhat often though, sometimes it‚Äôs more of running other times more weights.  So I think I‚Äôm just really active and don‚Äôt really pay attention to it. I will walk to coffee shops and the store sometimes too. I definitely have the advantage of being a student and having the time for all of this. I‚Äôm sure once I am working full time I will still keep up my deliberate workouts and my hiking but I probably won‚Äôt have time to walk as much unless my job illicits walking. Though, usually I have had to walk a lot in my jobs. When I used to work at a restaurant I walked at least 2-4 miles a 4-6 hour shift and so I burned a bit there too.",False,True

And I'm bringing that up to back up my point that comparing EDs is a totally fruitless effort. It's reflexive and par for the course for most ED patients to compare their bodies or caloric intake to one another but that doesn't make it okay-- that action in it of itself is disordered and unhealthy. Every eating disorder is equally valid and *equally dangerous.*  Also, everyone's body is different. Everyone operates best at a different calorie range, weight, activity level, etc etc. There will never be anything wrong with your body just needing what it needs.

Staying at high maintenance without going into binging is actually really freakin hard. Sometimes it's even harder than just continuing a fast because once you put SOME food in your mouth you want to go into binge-mode, whereas after a little while without eating your body is like, okay cool, I forgot what food is.  Also, literally the same amount of your mental time and energy is spent devoted to obsessing over food and calories whether you eat 1200, or less. Like this shit is just as anguishing and exhausting, it's the worst trade deal of all time. It's no less difficult or stressful to high-restrict when you're disordered.
