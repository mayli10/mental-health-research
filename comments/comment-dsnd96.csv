Upping your electrolyte intake and focusing more on macros may help- but keep in mind, the brain does need carbohydrates to stay healthy and therefore function best. That’ll take a lot more effort and meal planning, though.   What I do, personally, is pepper in maintenance days when I start getting really bad or if I do have something big coming up. Even a maintenance week, at times. More food does = more energy and brain power. Careful not to binge, though. Because if you’re like me, it tends to spiral and then you resort to fasting for days on end to make up for it and that makes you even stupider. Lol.",False,False
