I would be able to take my partner breaking up with me, fucking other women, then wanting to get back with me. I just couldn't do it.  You don't have to either. You deserve so much more than that. No one deserves that if they don't want it. That honestly sounds awful.",False,False

I honestly think by the time I turn 21 in August this year, there is a possibility my BMI will be low enough to be considered full-blown anorexic...and I'd be more okay with it if it was something I struggled with my whole life, but it's not. I feel so immature, going through a mental illness that most people get at 15/16. But nope, when I was 15/16, I was struggling with full-blown BED and getting fatter and fatter. I missed the prime time to be bulimic/anorexic, so why the fuck is my body slowly starting to do it now? I feel like a child. People have a lot more sympathy for the teenager who develops anorexia than the adult that does. To the adult, they just say, ""Grow up.""",False,False

I've always had issues with him during long distance relationship with body dysmorphia and severe insecurities. But now that we're not together and I'm preparing for him possibly moving away despite him taking me to meet with extended family and telling me we'll find a way no matter what, I can't stop imagining him fucking other women over me, and they they'd all be skinny/mentally healthy and I just can't. If I can't get back to a normal or low BMI I might go insane.",False,False

I feel like such an idiot for having these issues that seem like something out of a teenage drama. How does a person go 40+ years of eating like a normal person and then turn into this????,False,False

I was severely depressed all through school, but there’s nothing like being raped a dozen or more times to give you a self hatred so intense you want to die every time you remember and the ability to release that the only way to soothe those feelings is bingeing and purging, That and starving yourself and exercising until your legs feel like they’re going to drop off makes you not want to kill yourself because you can’t be skinny if you’re dead, right?  TL;DR: I developed BN in adulthood. It sucks.",False,False
