I get in bed and have to rub my skin and I'm still shivering.  Sometimes it's so exhausting I fall asleep.  I can't be bothered to ask anyone about it and I haven't seen anyone else write about it, but it must be a similar thing to you feeling hot.  Let's face it, our system's all messed up so I guess that's the reason.  You could try sticking a hot water bottle in the freezer for a while next time.  It's weird how the hot/cold doesn't go away though like you can't get cool and I can't get warm.",False,False

I have osteoporosis too (I'm only 24). It might be a hormonal imbalance.,False,False

Weirdest was always when I'd low-key binge through the night to keep me going when I needed to study for a big exam the next day. Every hour or so I'd get a snack and ten minutes after, the collateral wave of heat and sweat would hit me like a truck. So my temperature would just be spiking up and down all night long. Aaaaaish it sucked",False,False
