It may be that your bmr and tdee has gone down (it goes down about every 5 pounds) and you're intake is around maintenance now. Another thing could be that you are due for a woosh, especially if you lost the weight fast. Your fat cells will take on water as a desperate attempt to hold on, but eventually they'll go away. If you keep gaining for the next couple of weeks, you should recalculate your tdee and aim for a healthy deficit. Obviously losing slowly hurts like hell because you just want to get there, but it's the only thing that has worked for me.  Hope that helps &lt;3",False,False

Its harder to lose the thinner you are, and your weight is pretty low for you height. I'd have to weigh 110 to have your BMI and I would personally look really thin at that weight (but I also have a borderline large frame).   I know we all think losing weight is the path to happiness and I hate seeing how miserable people are here at my gw or lower. I really do believe I'd have a partner if I never got fat.
