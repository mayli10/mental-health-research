I know the feeling well of being determined to eat but just not being able to force yourself to do it. I've used two strategies in the past to get over this kind of hump:  Strategy 1 is to start with liquids. Broth or miso soup at first, just something warm and nourishing that's still low-enough calorie to not set off too much anxiety. Then add more substantial soups like veggie or minestrone or light chicken noodle. At some point this turns my hunger cues back on and it gets easier to add in things like toast, crackers, other veggies, etc.  My second strategy is to go bland. When you haven't eaten properly in a long time, your senses can get overwhelmed really easily. (Example: I usually do OMAD, and I tend to break my fast at the end of the day with some Veggie Straws, which come in three ""flavors"" that essentially all taste the same, but sometimes at the end of the day I absolutely cannot stand the spinach ones, they're offensively bitter.) So with this strategy you're starting out with more nutritionally substantial foods, but leaving out anything that's even a little extreme. Plain or lightly sweetened oatmeal is good for this, as are things like rice porridge (look up congee or juk), saltines, plain chips/crisps, etc.   Super Secret Strategy #3 is to hook up with everyone's good old friend Mary Jane, but obviously that's not possible or desirable for everyone, YMMV.   And of course all this also depends on what your specific safe and fear foods are, too. Let me know if you want to talk about it some more, I'm not on reddit a lot on the weekends but I'll be around here and there &lt;3",False,False
