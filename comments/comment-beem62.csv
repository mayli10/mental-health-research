Self-conscious when people comment on my weight loss, offended when they don't comment on it, feel unsexy/curveless when I'm told I look too thin, then when my friend said my body type was average the other day I felt huge and gross because in my brain 'average' implies you could do with losing a bit of weight... no idea what my brain even wants to hear at this point. Completely irrational.",False,False

I've seen her twice since shes said anything, I've put on like 10ish lbs since the last time she told me that, and so its fucked but i definitely am using her silence as 'fuel'. Maybe I'm just sensitive to it rn, but I stg she wouldnt stop talking about people in our family gaining weight (most of them are obese).",False,False
