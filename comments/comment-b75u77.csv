I lost a lot of weight after high school and saved my prom dress... when I tried it on for the lolz last spring, it was falling off me.

Hell i'm a size 14, my gut is gonna stick out of every one of them. On top of that, I also have to try to get rid of some of the redness, scarring, and inflammation on my face which is gonna be damn near impossible. Life truly sucks. But, best of luck :(",False,False

I promise you will look gorgeous, no matter what size you are. Even if you don't feel it, one day you'll look back at prom photos and realize how much you underestimated your own beauty.
