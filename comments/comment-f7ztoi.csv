I obviously don’t know what you have gone through, but by the sounds of your distress you should be so goddamn proud of yourself that you have not purged because I know I am.  Even in this fragile state you did not relapse and that shows you the control and strength you do have to overcome the battle within yourself.  You are human and at times, we falter.  We just have to stop and pick up the pieces again.  You are more than just this week.  You are more than just an eating disorder.  You are you, and the ups and downs are part of your journey.  I send my love and kind regards, wishing you the best.",False,False
