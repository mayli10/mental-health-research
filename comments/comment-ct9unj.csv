I mean,I have people who reach out to me still, people I talk to through screens and update them about my life, but in times of stress (like crying in the shower, my kitchen, tonight on my off night (3rd shift)), I really can't say I'm close enough to anyone to make a reach-out appropriate at all. It would just be a selfish move on my part, as I keep myself far enough away from everyone to avoid... everything.  You're not alone, even though no one is sitting next to you. There's plenty of us, sitting somewhere else, but sharing the same emotional burdens. It might not help or sound very nice, but it's true. You aren't alone in your suffering. I wish I knew how to fix things for us. Or, I wish I had the courage to do what I think would help.  PM me anytime. Old folks gotta stick together rofl.",False,False

I'm 27, and have been struggling for many years with EDNOS, swinging back and forth between binging and restricting phases. I honestly forget about the chat feature and never check it, but I don't think anyone here would purposely ignore you.

I’ve got one irl friend cause she’s basically blind to my ED (lmao I send her so many memes from the meme sub) and everyone else got sick of my shit.   If you wanna talk, PM me!

I know it can be hard to deal with an ed as an adult (26 here, developed it as an adult too) and this sub is much more active than the adult centered one. That said, I think the chatroom feature is only accessible via the redesigned version of reddit, so people like myself who only use old reddit and mobile can't access it at all without switching. That might be why there's such little activity, that and it being a relatively new feature that not many people know or care about. So I would try to not take it too personally.",False,False
