These days I really try to avoid the scale tbh, I really had the power the make or break a day for me. However my clothes all still fit the same (my reflection isn‚Äôt an accurate gauge because i don‚Äôt fucking have a consistent concept of myself). I still have weird food rituals, and I still count calories, but like once a month or so I try to budget in a ‚Äútreat‚Äù meal or something, and I‚Äôll go get something from the vegan place by my apartment.   It feels way less destructive than when I was actively restricting (or in a restriction/binging) cycle, but it‚Äôs also in some ways more insidious. I don‚Äôt really feel or view myself as sick, even though I probably am? My eating disorder just feels like another aspect of my life now.",False,False

I‚Äôve never counted binge days but I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve had really bad ones above 2000.   I basically eat safe foods but will treat myself to a dinner out here and there. I‚Äôve ventured out and will eat some things I like but try to modify them to be lower calorie. Or I eat things that comfort me (soups/stir fry) and bulk them up with lots of veggies and a little bit of tofu for protein because I was severely lacking for like 3 months and was losing hair. I decided to start maintaining because I didn‚Äôt wanna lose more hair. I know that wasn‚Äôt the best reason but it‚Äôs something. The two day binges only give me maybe a 1lb gain but it‚Äôs obviously just water retention and I‚Äôm back to my CW in about two days so it‚Äôs not horrible but I do get very anxious about it.,False,False

Got halfway through a large weight loss goal (morbidly obese to low end of healthy, got to somewhat overweight) then had some major life changes that made it much harder to keep up the same eating habits (less privacy, lost access to body and food scales for a while, financial issues so less freedom to buy what I want to eat) and also my hair started falling out so I figured I needed to stop and just maintain until I'm in a better place to finish the job so to speak. I haven't been counting calories but I know the calories in almost everything I eat so I try to just ballpark it and keep it at or under my TDEE. I don't really like it because maintaining portions feel like... Big enough that I know it's not ""good"" and I'm not ""making progress"" but also too small to fill the void? Allowing myself this much food is definitely making me want to binge, I definitely don't eat the same amount every day because of that, which I hate because I feel more hungry when I'm eating more whereas when I stick to a small intake for a while it's easier to just keep going at that same intake. I hate weighing myself because the number is all over the place from food weight, water weight, period weight... My weight is pretty predictable when restricting so it's hard not knowing my ""real""weight anymore, like if I'm up a few pounds is it normal body functions or fat?? I def don't think what I'm doing right now is sustainable and once I get closer to my goal and have to think about maintaining indefinitely I'm going to need a different strategy. üòí a lot of the issues that made me need to take a break are nearly resolved so I'm kind of nervous about how the transition back to restricting is going to go... Guess we'll see?  Your vegan donut sounds delicious and I hope you enjoy it!!!",False,False
