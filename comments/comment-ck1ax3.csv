I feel more like im mourning the opportunity to know an otherwise bad ass woman because her husband was an absolute fucker, than I am her herself.  Not to mention the complicated feelings when the asshole in question kicked it.   This is totally the place to dump about complicated family deaths because this bitch thrives on complicated.
