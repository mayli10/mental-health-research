It's probably because I walk around A LOT. Since I'm a nurse (in school to take extra classes to go to medical school so I walk a bunch there, too) and had a lot of more energy to walk instead of feeling extremely lethargic when I was restricting, that allowed me to walk more and do activities with more energy. I walk about 15,000 to 20,000 steps a day.  It is so insane--I drank SOOOOO many margaritas, had SO many of Chili's skillet cookies (like 1,500 calories alone... let's not forget about the 1,000 calorie dinner and I had before that) and was absolutely RUTHLESS with candy since they had it out for free at my job.
