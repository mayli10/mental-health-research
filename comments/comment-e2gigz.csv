I definitely notice the difference on weeks when I've been walking vs not",False,False

But the vast majority of people will never be in that situation.,False,False

You’re moving your body which requires energy so yes it burns calories. It doesn’t burn calories as fast as other types of exercise but you can do it for much longer and it also used mainly fat for energy rather than glycogen which is cool. You can also burn more calories by carrying more weight, like if you’re backpacking and carrying 20 lbs.",False,False

I walk roughly 45 min-1 hour each day 5x a week to and from my campus and will burn like 150 calories. Saves me having to do cardio on days I’m too exhausted to do it.,False,False

I do know people who have made progress with walking, because they couldn't stand any other form of exercise. However, that was combined with improved eating habits. The biggest contributor to weight loss is honestly diet (reduced caloric intake). While exercise is beneficial in its own right, and can contribute to increased energy expenditure when you have more muscle mass, it has a lesser effect on weight loss because you just have to do *so much more* to get the same result as not eating that amount in calories.",False,False
