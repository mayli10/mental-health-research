I'll definitely talk to my GP once I get the chance. I feel like I'm just not getting hunger cues at all. For me it seems there's no in-between between obsessing about food and just forgetting it exists.,False,True

All the years I was ok (after recovery) I went days without eating so many times cause I just forgot. I never even ate breakfast cause I wasn't hungry and food wasn't on my mind. I relapsed when I started eating healthy and started eating breakfast, thee meals a day and started thinking about 'healthy healthy healthy' and got encouraged on all sides to also lose some weight while I was looking at my food anyway. Was thinking that the hunger I constantly feel while restricting maybe is in my head. Cause I am obsessed now. And while I mentally recovered from the obsession with food I never really learnt how to approach food with a healthy mind. I never learnt what it was my body needs. I don't know how to care for my body. I like to think I know all about nutrition. And I do, but I do not know how to feed myself properly.   I would advise you to visit your doctor. Even a journey towards taking care of your body can sometimes be hard and it isn't a bad thing to have someone help you and take care a bit, make sure you don't relapse.",False,False
