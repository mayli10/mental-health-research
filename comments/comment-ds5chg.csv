I hope you find comfort int he fact that I have been there, 100%. One simple situation and eating something off plan and you break for days, weeks, whatever. its fucking hell on earth. Theres been times before I eat under budget, but I'm laying in bed and just want an apple. just a simple apple right? wrong. everything in the kitchen. then go to mcdonalds and get a large meal. then chocolate. everything but the damn sink.  I don't want to give you damaging advice but typically if I go through a period like your own I will think back onto when my eating habits first became restrictive. foods I used to eat, what I used to do. I start from square 1, before I even recognised what I was doing was disordered. immediately waking up and trying for xxxcal allowance when you've been consuming 5x that a day or more is never going to work. physically your body can't do that. I wish you best of luck with regaining control, and I send you all of my love. I know you're hurting right now but you have to remember this is the other side of disordered eating. you're no less valid because you're binging. it's still all apart of the disorder.",False,False

I don't even know you but I want to punch all of them in the face. Even if they didn't mean any harm, people are such garbage and that's why I'm a damn hermit. I'm sorry. I can relate too well to the ""no off switch"" feeling once I get going. I hope you can hold out. And hopefully things level out very soon. ❤",False,False

The loneliness of eating disorders is truly crippling. I completely understand. The worst is the guilt and the shame. People don’t understand that we have boundaries for a reason, and that even the smallest intrusion can have devastating effects. I find that the guilt and shame eases up in knowing that there are others feeling the same way. Don’t worry about fasting or doing anything upon recovery. And don’t be afraid of the gray area. I tend to fall into those cycles when I spend every day trying to hold myself to strict rules and then end up eating ONE thing and then I’m off the rails. Just restrict a LITTLE, and give in to your urges. Let yourself come down slowly and break the cycle of binging and starving. I’m really sorry about your friends. If this helps, even this post helped me because I feel less alone. Thank you for sharing and I hope you feel better soon❤️",False,False
