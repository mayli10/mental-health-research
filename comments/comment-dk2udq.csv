A keyword search is an okay way to start, that searches fields in a more general way. You can also do a subject search or a title search. If you find a book about eating disorders, you can often scroll to the bottom of the entry and you should see where it lists what subjects the book is categorized as and you can copy that or even sometimes click on it.  Some library online catalogues have a place right there with book descriptions, summaries, reviews, etc. it totally depends on what software your local library system uses. If they don‚Äôt have this (it‚Äôs called a reader advisory feature), you can look the book up in ‚Äúgoodreads‚Äù online or amazon or Barnes and noble to see other people‚Äôs reviews!  I don‚Äôt have any specific recommendations but actually maybe posting a general thread here for recommendations on workbooks and the like might be your best bet! Who would be better to ask than everyone in this group? :)",False,False

You‚Äôre welcome :)  Librarians as a rule in general tend to be awesome, radical, and caring people. Libraries are a great place for harm reduction research because we are trained not to judge anyone based on the books they are borrowing and protection of privacy is a huge part of our professional ethos. I‚Äôm sure there are less than perfect ones out there, but most of us just really want to help people :) always psyched to hook people up with resources! üëª",False,False

I AM a librarian soooo, Library Advice‚Ñ¢Ô∏è here :P  Your local library will give you a card, the only thing you MIGHT need is any document, ID, or email that has your name and an address in the city.   Also!! Look into where you are taking classes: laptops are often available to borrow from university libraries and media centers! It‚Äôs a great resource :) (if you can‚Äôt find if your institution does this, you can PM me if you‚Äôre comfortable and I can try to look and see if there‚Äôs maybe a department that might).   Sorry you‚Äôre dealing with this crap, it seems like the kind of shit where people just don‚Äôt want you to get ahead because of their own issues? :/ crappy, but you‚Äôre so awesome for being dedicated and for figuring out ways to get ahead anyway!! :D",False,False

Yes hopefully itll be fine tomorrow!! You have no idea on what they joke about! The best was when I was 12 and my mom and brother started telling me I was adoted.

Ugh yeah I totally understand the isolation bit and not being able to ask for help because of it.  I hope you wake up on time, don't feel too groggy or tired and get your work done!

My brother set it up ages ago when he was studying computer science so its attached to 2 monitors for some reason and other things I have no idea what they are.

My mom just came in to tell me that she was just joking and I took it all too seriously and she wanted me to cool my jets so to say.  My PC is basically as dead as a dodo. The battery is dead and the whole system is lagging so much it's just unusable.  I'd ask friends or family to help but every since my ed got really bad I've totally isolated myself which is good for avoiding food but not much else.  I've decided just to down some cough syrup at like 6pm and wake up for like 3 to work on it. My mom suggested it so it's what I'm doing with my alarm set super loud.,False,True

It's like you're being held up to different standards than everyone else, almost? Your mom and (24 yikes!) brother are definitely being (atleast slightly) assholish here. It's school work PLUS you're only asking for 3 hours, it must be so fucking annoying!  Is your laptop not functional or does it not have MS Office? Can you get it fixed for a small amount at a local store? Maybe you can get a trial version of MS Office or Office Online? Or download a torrent (it works for a while if you have the key)?  Google Docs is another option and Apache Open Office.  If it's not inconvenient try the MS Word app or something on your phone?  Do you have a friend or acquaintance or cousin or colleague whose laptop or PC you could use for a bit? Or maybe even a computer at work or a previous place you worked at where you still know someone?  It sucks soooo much that you've to deal with this at all and that you have to look for other means to do something important when your old ass brother wants to play video games and your mom is too exhausted to be an actual mother (on top of dealing with an ED and life in general).
