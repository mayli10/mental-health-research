NONE of this is your fault and you are not gross or disgusting. Those men are the gross and disgusting ones. They were in the wrong, clearly you were incapacitated and they took advantage of you.

Please ring a crisis line or take yourself to the emergency room if you’re feeling suicidal, keep safe ❤️",False,False
