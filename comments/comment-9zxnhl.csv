Like he doesn’t get that if I pick the bread, it will be potato bread or some other squishy white bread that I will end up eating (squishing into balls with butter or jam or just by itself) before he even makes a sandwich, OR I get low cal seedy bread he doesn’t like/will only eat if I make toast with butter for him.  Why does he force me to be complicit in the purchase of the evil foods?   I don’t like donuts, but still he asks what kind I want. If I say doesn’t matter to me, I’m not eating them, he get huffy and doesn’t buy any at all. Then complains we don’t have any “fun” snacks.   Anyway, I feel you on the “the bread calls to me”   I have also on occasion just thrown it out. Feels wasteful until I think of all the money I spend on workouts or healthy food to try to counteract the $1.99 wonder bread. If he asks I just say it has some mold on it. But he almost never notices.",False,False
