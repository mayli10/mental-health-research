I absolutely do believe that people are responsible for their actions but also for the consequences of that action. And since I KNOW that some people will be negatively affected by it willingly or unwillingly, and no matter that they are responsible for watching it, I would not put it out.  So we fundamentally disagree. ",False,False

I don't watch her videos, but I respect her. when asked to do a ""what I eat in a day"" video, she said she wouldn't do it because she ""doesn't want anyone to think they have to do what she does""  people make her out to be an actual helldemon for filming her skinny body but for YEARS NOW she's made a point of not encouraging her lifestyle. she's been unwaveringly sweet and nice, full of ""I love yous"" and nice words. never talks about her weight, never makes anyone feel badly about their own.  don't know why anyone hates her. I'm totally not into her content but she's sweet as hell and isn't hurting anyone. if some naive 13 year old feels the need to emulate her, that's not eugenia's fault. and believe me, I have been the naive 13 year old before.",False,False

She was proudly producing the most triggering thinspo/deathspo and couldn't give a crap about who she was influencing with it.
