It was beautiful outside with first January snow, he sold me weed and the chat was nice.   I am sad that he never understood my vantage point, but I ate normally and still hit a low.",False,False

Both mentally and physically. It was a week of SO many binges and SO much restriction. After a month long binge fest over the holidays in which I gained and lost the same 3kg, Iâ€™ve finally dipped below. And yet, I feel more insecure and fatter than ever? I have a lot to work on.",False,False

Iâ€™m slightly nervous because I just fit nicely into some vintage 80â€™s 3/4 size hi rise jeans and I donâ€™t want to eat today without a rigorous workout.   However this entire week Iâ€™ve fasted every other day on EC Stacking and havenâ€™t really been able to hold food down due to diarrhea and stress. So I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m freaking out I know itâ€™s my ED. I downloaded positive affirmations wallpaper and made it my lock screen yesterday to try and help me.   I did something creative with my hair. I lost a lot dreadlocs due stress breakups and homelessness after me and my ex split. Between all that and finally scoring two jobs and a nice room in cozy home... it wasnâ€™t easy hence losing hair happened.  Last night I took all the locs I lost and reattached them to one dreadloc and it made me so happy that I actually did it. It gave me strength back that Iâ€™d thought was gone forever.    I want to believe in my strength and believe I can live a healthy lifestyle without comparing myself. My friends support me I realized Iâ€™ve stopped eating when Iâ€™m alone and they have too so theyâ€™re  trying to get me out more which makes me nervous. But Iâ€™m burning calories so much sometimes my palate gets sore and I become dehydrated almost faint. A bit worried so I think I can do myself some good maybe and eat a small bite if not I wonâ€™t have strength for work or life..,False,False

I miss food.   This disorder is so isolating.

For example, last night at 11pm my heart rate was like 48 standing up, so I decided to eat a complete cookie and some peanut butter. I had already eaten 1000 cals that day which I think is reasonable. Balanced macros and nutrients, too.   There have been a few other times like this where I try to fast, am not feeling hungry or bad at all, but the number on my watch freaks me out so I eat so I don't die.  I'm BMI 23, for heck's sake. I have enough to lose weight without any weird side effects. I really, really want (wanted?) to restrict to 1000 a day because it will allow me to perfectly hit my goal on the day of a big event. Physically and mentally I feel fine. It's just the stupid number on my smartwatch making me eat. It's frustrating.",False,False
