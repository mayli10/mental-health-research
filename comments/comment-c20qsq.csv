Especially deleting my Instagram took such a weight off my shoulder. Social Media IS fake. It's not very imaginative to say it but it is the truth. People post how they want to be seen not how they really are and it's toxic. And it nearly unavoidable to constantly compare yourself to Girls who probably have a completely different body type anyway.   If you want to stay ""connected""; I got a blocker for my facebook feed so I don't see and can still get in contact. with people, if I need to.  But you can't escape it altogether. If you go to Netflix, for example, you'll always see girls in TV shows with perfect toned model bodies, like this is the norm. It's changing of course. There is more awareness, more representative TV shows (shoutout to Broad city and Girls, life-saving).   The TV and Film industry always triggered me far more than social media ever did. I got the impression that this is how the world works and I need to fit in it to live it.  I guess after all we just have to get out more and look at real people and real lives haha",False,False

Reddit is great cuz you can find everything you’d be able to find on social media without the self esteem crash every time you scroll down your feed.",False,False

Those people are struggling, obviously, with some sort of disordered eating/low self esteem, but they're not fighting it or working on it actively. It is possible to combat those negative thoughts and body dysmorphia.   I guarantee that your life will improve if you recover. So who cares what other people are doing? Your only goal should be to make *your* life easier and *your* body healthier.",False,False

Reddit is my connection to the world.     I know for some people they say “oh well I have to stay connected to so-in-so” or something like that, but for me, I didn’t care. I can call the people I care about if I need to and I can’t do that if I get so depressed looking at everyone’s “perfect” lives that I kill myself. And when people start to bug me about it, that’s the response I give them and it shuts them up, because 99% of the time they’re part of the problem of posting that toxic shit *shrug*",False,False
