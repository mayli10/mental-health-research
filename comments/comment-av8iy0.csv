If they wanted to compliment you, they would have said “thin”. That might be why you feel weird about it. Whoever said that is probably just jealous or projecting their own insecurities.  Also fuck that kid who thinks it’s okay to call people fat, even as a joke. ",False,False

That makes no sense!   Scrawny people do come in different shapes and sizes, you can be scrawny in your limbs but have stomach folds, but being able to wrap your pinky and thumb around your wrist makes me think you’re very thin.  People commenting on other people’s sizes or food choices when they eat makes me want to set the world on fire.",False,False
