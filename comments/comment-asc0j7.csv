Last week one around be scared the shit out of me while it was going through my trash because I can’t tell if it was rabid or starving and desperate this winter.   You may have a raccoon leaving tempting food in your driveway. I’ve had raccoons open up my c/s bags and display them across my yard. Maybe they are demons sent to torment people with eating disorders. ,False,False
