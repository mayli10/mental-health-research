It's one of my biggest problems, I think. The way I try and cope is what I call the ""hypocrisy method"" (good for lots of stuff I think)  1. In a similar situation, would you think/do the same stufff you're assuming this person is thinking/doing?  2. In a world of 7+ billion people, do you think that you are SO different that your beliefs/actions will be outliers compared to the normal behaviors of ALL others?  3. Nah, you aren't that special. So if you can love without resentment or obligation, that means other people can (and do) too.",False,False

I don’t have a job right now because previous job experiences left me with crippling anxiety. I’m also a recovering alcoholic and still struggling with eating and staying away from self harm.

I really don’t ask him to as I’m usually rather independent but I can still he just like *really fuckin’ loves me* and WANTS to do it. Blows my WHOLE ASS MIND. This dude is a goddamn saint and I would absolutely be dead without him... Even the little things, like I have a 3L water bottle I *have* to drink fully every day and every night he makes sure it’s always full with fresh filtered water and ice. No matter what his day was like, he does that every night before bed. Fuck.
