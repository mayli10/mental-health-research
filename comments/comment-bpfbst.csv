It was definitely weird as fuck. And she would criticize my dinner choices at like 6-7, if I ordered a burger somewhere she’d say I’d be better off with a salad. Or if I’d be eating a banana she’d tell me they were fattening.",False,False

But that sentence made me snort-laugh and I can’t explain why exactly.",False,False

She unknowingly graced me and my two sisters with various EDs because she would boast about how she lived on jarred jalapeños and wine.   But yea, we just don’t talk about it. It’s been the elephant in the room ever since I was little. My sisters are both in recovery and doing beautifully so I’m happy for them but they always take a turn for the worse when they visit my mom.",False,False

ensiw4b,t3_bpfbst,t3_bpfbst,3cats_in_atrenchcoat,1,2019-05-16 12:56:51,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/bpfbst/ed_from_your_mum_how_do_you_deal_with_it/ensiw4b/,My mother previously had an ED until she was pregnant with me. She's mildly bat shit. She's weirdly supportive of my ED behaviours so long as it's not super obvious. Like when ever she visits town she always suggests going to a yoga or work out class and then drinks and lunch. She never batts an eye at my diet or what I do or don't eat. Asks me diets tips and praises my fasting ect.   It's really hard not to feel like my behaviours are normal and justified.,False,False
