I like being cutesy and silly because it feels safe. I like playing with toys and stuffed animals. I’m also hella scared by/creeped out by anyone having control over me though, like I can’t even roll play like that I just get stressed and mad, so I’m not really sure.   All I ever want with my ED though is for some potential romantic partner to notice and take care of me, so that certainly SOUNDS screwed up and like age issues 🤷🏼‍♀️",False,False

I have control problems aka the ed with a  intense fear of aging and death and regressing seems like a control of not growing up/not aging/going back to a “safe time” where nothing bad has yet happened,False,False

Before I moved out of my parent’s place I would go through phases where I’d sleep with a stuffed animal and I wouldn’t talk or deal with anything for a while. Maybe that’s sort of similar? But I can’t say I’m too familiar with it or have much experience with it. I’m sorry.,False,False
