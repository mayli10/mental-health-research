Have you tried Tahini? Vegan ""cheese"" (not aquafaba) is often made from nuts and fats, so being more generous with that would also help. Basically most dairy or meet imitation products will be fatty.  Oils can be easily added to other foods and will improve their taste, so that might be an easy way for you to up calories and fat without adding more volume. Coconut oil, cocoa butter and similar compliment sweet dishes, most other oils (canola, sunflower, olive, flaxseed) will do better in savory meals. Changing how you prepare meals can add fat calories easily (frying, having pesto instead of a lighter sauce).  Then, of course, avocados and olives.  Depending on what your staple carb source is, for example rice, exchanging that for more fatty choices, soybeans, for example, can also add fat to the diet.  There's also vegan chocolate and ice cream, which is usually made with a lot of oil, mostly coconut, if you want to indulge. And oreos, of course.",False,False

Irregularities in menstrual cycles and lowering of fertility occurs in low fat diets independently of body weight.
