Personally I find it sweet in a way - it shows you value connection. You could approach any of them right before lunch break and ask ""are you heading out to lunch? Mind if I join you?"" If you generally keep to yourself, it'll be a pleasant surprise for them to realize that you want to be friends",False,False

Making friends is definitely something you have to push on your end at the beginning.",False,False

Have they known each other for longer or chat more frequently? Maybe they just think you're not receptive/open to having lunch. It could be obvious that you're somewhat uncomfortable with food - it's subtle but often times people around you can tell without knowing what exactly it's about, just that you probably wouldn't enjoy it",False,False
