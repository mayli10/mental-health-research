I'm really trying, just feels so disheartening after all the stress of making myself eat, I still lose! I know it's only been a week, so hopefully if I carry on everything restores itself like you've said.  I know he cares about me and wants me to be healthy and looking after myself, he's the main reason I'm trying, I couldn't tell him that because I know it's a lot of pressure, but he does care a lot and it helps. You're right in that it's a manipulative liar, anything good I think, there seems to be 10 things telling me why it's bad to gain. I hope it can make things better tho, by putting me in a better place, that's a nice way to think about it thank you.  Thank you so much for the reply, it's really helped, you're very kind.",False,True

And I’m so glad to hear that you’re trying to take care of yourself and gain weight.   In recovery from restriction, you can’t go wrong by eating more. It can take some time though, which is painful as fuck, but you’ve gotta keep eating *as much as you can* and not compensate, to let your metabolism and hormones and bodily processes restore themselves.   Your concern about your loved one leaving because of your weight gain is soooo relatable :( earlier on in my recovery, “your boyfriend will leave you if you get fat” was the #1 thing my brain tried to use to pull me back into restriction. Thing is, eating disorders are manipulative liars, and would do anything they can to convince us to remain unhealthy. Those insecurities probably aren’t yours as much as they’re the eating disorder’s. The person you love sounds like he cares about you a great deal and wishes nothing but health for you – he’s not gonna leave you just because you take care of yourself and gain the weight you need. In fact, recovery can improve your relationship, by putting you in a healthier place.   Better yet – test the theory out in real life! Gain the weight and see what happens. I was afraid of being dumped, but I gained weight anyway, and my boyfriend is still here and he still thinks I’m beautiful. And so I teach my brain that it didn’t have to be worried, and teach myself that I don’t have to listen to all my insecurities.   And, honestly, if anyone were to leave you because of recovery, then good riddance. It’s fucked up to be with someone just because they’re unhealthily thin! They aren’t worth having or loving or keeping around.   All the best. Sending lots of love. &lt;3",False,False
