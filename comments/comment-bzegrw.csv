Maybe a C at my overweight weight. My boobs are so empty-lookimg and small that, since im not underweight, they make my shoulders and chest look wider, and I'm really in balanced due to wide hips, big butt, and big thighs, but NOTHING on top. I can feel my thigh weight flapping when I walk. I feel like if I had boobs I'd at least be able to comfort myself with the idea that I'm the ""optimal"" shape or have ""great assets"" according to normies.... Now I'm just a tit-less fat ass wishing to be anything else, ""cUrVy"" or sticc!    I am not minimizing your suffering, which is completely real and I understand how much it sucks!",False,False

I've been a C/D-cup since I was 16 and have been running consistently for 5 years.
