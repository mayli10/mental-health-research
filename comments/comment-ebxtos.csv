The coverage and public funding for things varies wildly from state to state. With a lot of the southern and midwest states giving very little public funds to support health care systems.,False,False

There is a system in mine. Everyone in my area goes through a specific mental health care system. If you see a doctor in this area they will refer you to this system. If you end up in the e.r. with a mental health crisis you go through this system. And it takes no more than two weeks to see a psychologist 3 weeks max to see a psychiatrist the ones who can prescribe medicine. If you want to privately seek care say going through the yellow pages and choosing someone you can do that as well. I did. When I first started having issues I went to a private psychologist. Took a couple weeks to get in to see her. I had a major break a couple mo ths later. And she referred me to  you guessed it this mental health system in my area. Because they handle the hardest cases in the area. And also get people hooked up with people to help with every day life things. It is partially state funded. Not sure if it gets any federal money.,False,False

My friend tried to get a therapist this summer and the large hospital system she called was so backed up (6 months or so) they were no longer adding new patients to a waiting list. While that is an anecdote, I thought it was well known that mental health care in the US is severely lacking.",False,False

A couple weeks at the most. And I'm not talking about a bad one. If there is one thing about the US healthcare system that works is you dont have to wait forever to get help. I thought you were talking out of pocket with the $240. But without insurance you can see a psychologist for $100 or around that. In the US A lot of doctors charge insurance companies way more then they charge someone without insurance.,False,False

I mean I probably could have found a shitty psychologist w/o a waiting list but most reputable ones seem to have some sort of a waiting list.,False,True
fb84pdv,t3_ebxtos,t3_ebxtos,CloudySideDown,1,2019-12-17 12:08:14,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/ebxtos/sometimes_idk_why_i_even_bother_try_to_get_help/fb84pdv/,In the US you would never wait 2 or 3 months to see a therapist. A couple weeks maybe. And follow up would be the next week for regularly scheduled visits. If you dont have health insurance the out of pocket cost would be around 100 a session or possibly less. 240 out of pocket for one therapy session is just outrageous. Also in the US if you are in medicaid or Medicare because you dont make enough money then there is no co-pay. The US is a nightmare as far as health care and insurance goes. But no one is paying $240 out of pocket for a therapy session after waiting 2 or 3 months to get in.,False,False
