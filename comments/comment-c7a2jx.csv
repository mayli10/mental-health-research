I also have Cafe Mocha which has caffeine. I haven't tried it yet but it's supposed to be chocolate and coffee.,False,True

I've done two soylent only fasts since I discovered it a year ago.  It's great for feeling full w/o being bloated and really works, but fair warning that by day 2 or 3 I got some pretty gnarly diarrhea that took a bit to clear up (sorry lol).  I think something about transitioning from solids to liquids.",False,False

I like adding cinnamon or cocoa powder and vanilla to it but while i got full of it it for like a hour at first i was always hungry shortly after.",False,False

I tried the nutrition shake thing for diabetics (no sugar I think) and it was okay and I liked that it was low fat and didnâ€™t have a ton of calories, but it still had too many carbs for me. Does it come in different flavors? And if so, which one are you trying?",False,False
