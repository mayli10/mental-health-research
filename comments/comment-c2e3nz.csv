Like Iâ€™ll be super adamant about not eating something or only eating it if itâ€™s prepared a specific way and then my dumb ed brain will actually decide itâ€™s okay as soon as it switches to binge mode. ðŸ™ƒ  And yeah Iâ€™m really proud of myself for not purging (almost at 1 month aaa), since Iâ€™ve been trying really hard to stop ever since I threw up blood one time. I have horrible anxiety and that was not a fun few days for me after that incident. ðŸ˜¬  I hope things get better for you soon! And at least itâ€™s kind of comforting to know that someone else is going through a similar thing.",False,True

I suspect it's either the stress of being around my parents or the surveillance of my eating/them pushing their own eating habits onto me. It sucks. I always want to tell them I have strict rules for eating that really mess me up if they're interrupted but I also mess up by myself too occasionally so then I feel like a jackass (like refusing a small cookie one day since it doesn't fit in the calories for the day but then bingeing on a whole loaf of bread the next day lmao)   Glad you aren't purging though, that's great.",False,False
