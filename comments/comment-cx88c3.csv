Yep, can completely relate. It’s been really interesting watching my body change with T though. I was always skeptical about the fat/muscle redistribution but sure enough the fat that used to be on my hips is moving to my tummy. I’m strangely fine with the new bit of stomach fat, I guess I’m just so relieved to have lost the curves. Now I’m constantly conflicted between restricting to lose the fat or eating well to help the muscle grow.",False,False

I've slipped fully into anorexia/orthorexia hardcore over the past month- I had anorexia in high school before I knew I was trans, and I've always had periods of calorie-counting/restricting; it's back worse than ever now but this isn't necessarily....dysphoria-based? Idk.  Also okay do y'all ever struggle to figure out whether to calculate your BMI based on male or female or am I overthinking that???",False,False

Unfortunately, being trans is a major risk factor for having an ED, and it’s certainly a prime reason that mine is so relentless.  For me the trans-related ED stuff is mostly related to trying to erase my breasts/bring out my cheekbones. But it is also a reaction to the emotional stress of my mom’s transphobia, plus my whole family also refusing to respect my identity bc they “don’t want to upset her.”  I’m sorry you’re going through this ED stuff too :/",False,False
