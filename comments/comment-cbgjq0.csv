I used to wake up, strip naked, and exhale all the air in my lungs and cry about the number. Lately I have been drinking a bunch of water before going near the scale and then doing the aforementioned ritual. I find it helps my anxiety a little bit, even if I don't know the exact number when I'm ""empty"", I know that a +0.5lbs is from the water I chugged and not a sign that I gained fat.",False,False

OP, basically my point is that your number is only relevant fleetingly. It may upset you today but the further you get away from the moment in which you weigh yourself, the less it will matter. Your number tomorrow will likely be different. Your number in a week could change by a fraction of a pound or by four kilos. It‚Äôs temporary, and how you feel about it will be temporary too.   Don‚Äôt do it if it‚Äôs gonna really fuck up your day. But if you wanna know, just know that any potential bad feels that come along with knowing, won‚Äôt last forever.",False,False
