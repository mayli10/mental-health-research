I use natural vegetable laxative pills by top care or something like once every few months only when I haven’t pooped in a week or two. Never exceed the dosage on the bottle and don’t use them regularly!!!!!! Please don’t use them a lot. Only use them for what they are made for, when you haven’t pooped in a few weeks and are in pain from constipation!!!",False,False

As close to 1 gallon as you possibly can.   Second, go to Costco and get that massive matcha green tea from Ito En. Slowly sip the first cup of tea. If your stomach isn't rumbling then start a second cup. I would use a new tea bag for every cup. If you finished the second cup of tea and it's been 30 minutes, drink more water. Without fail this works for me everyday and is a much healthier alternative to brutal laxatives. Your body will thank you. It usually takes about 30 minutes to an hour for it to kick in with me after the first cup so make sure you don't have anything important to do within that time frame lol.   If it didn't work today, try it again tomorrow.",False,False

They will fuck up you insides and if you do them too much you could even need a colon bag- there used to be a girl on proEd who had one.  But I seriously like never poop anymore even after going through recovery I have to take fiber supplements and drink sooo much water!,False,False

I got hooked on the stimulate type and ended up downing 50-80 pills a day just to take a poo. I'm now a few months lax free and it took FOREVER and lots of pain to get my bowels to start moving on there own again. Also calories are still absorbed by your body so doing laxatives is pointless. All you are purging is food waste and dehydrating yourself.,False,False

Lax suxxxxxx. If you’re not hooked on it don’t even get on the train. Drink some green tea and a shit ton of water, you’ll feel more refreshed than if you took laxatives. I know that’s an annoying answer but sending you lots of love and I hope you feel better :)",False,False
