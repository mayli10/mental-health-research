My disordered brain has thoughts all the time when YouTubers or bloggers I follow do this like, “well yeah I’m trying to recover but NOT LIKE THAT.” I do appreciate how open Stephanie is about her new body insecurity and poor body image with the weight gain, feels a lot more realistic and relatable than recovery vloggers who try to pretend recovery is all rainbows and butterflies and perfect body positivity in the end.",False,False

Before she gained the weight she was my goal body to a T. I keep thinking about her and it’s really bumming me out that she stopped trying to maintain that and IMMEDIATELY gained 35 pounds, belly, no muscle definition. I know her whole schtick is she’s going to honor all her cravings, then slowly lose some of the weight as her body recalibrates and lets her become less food focused. But wow was that a bummer and makes me feel like i can’t slip up for even a second.   Obviously she’s gorgeous and looks incredible at both weights and my reaction was disordered. Just wanted to see if I was alone thinking this? Also so glad she’s sharing her struggle and raising awareness of what problematic eating can look like for more muscular women.",False,False

I used to follow her but had to stop because she was so triggering so it's amazing to see where is is now.
