Then I would fast the next two days and repeat the cycle. It worked well for me and gave me something to look forward to. The only bad part is when I got off track it fucked me hard.",False,False

Refeeds are for periods after extreme restriction to reintroduce foods to the system with as little discomfort as possible. Binges are the uncontrollable urge to put food in your mouth, often regardless of nutrient profile, last meal time, coupled with an effort of secrecy and the feelings of guilt and shame.   A chest day is going to Mickey D's and getting a frappe instead of a coffee with cream and Splenda.   So, no. Not even a little bit. The only people who think this way are the same people that say they're ""so OCD"" when they set aside a weekend to clean their closets.",False,False
