Like, I do, but in the tiniest portions and I'm genuinely not tempted beyond that. People always ask how I manage to not be twice my weight with food like that available on demand, but eh. I love food, but the eating of it isn't as pleasurable for me as watching others enjoy it.",False,False

I bring bags of cookies to work, and sometimes give them away to panhandlers.   So ... if there are panhandlers in your area that’s always an option.  Be aware of safety, obviously",False,False

I am super into cooking &amp; baking &amp; I recently got into bread making. Let me tell you man I cook &amp; bake to distract myself from my anxiety, depression, &amp; life in general....&amp; the month of October was AWFUL!!! So guess what I gained so much weight because no one wanted to eat my baked goods &amp; I HATE food waste. I gained close to 15 pounds in less than 30 days... needless to say I have found a new hobby. Bullet journaling!! It allows me to express my creative side while also feeds my ocd &amp; I can track everythinggggggg in a very custom &amp; pretty way (: also taught myself how to crochet &amp; I’ve been knitting again. Both are really great distractions!! I really think food based hobbies are like playing with fire, especially if you don’t want to eat what you make.",False,False

I baked for other people. Do you work? Maybe you can bake for people at your work. They loooovee shit like this. For me it's easy not to binge if I bake for others because it's not for me. If I eat it, nobody else will get it and I have to start over, what I absolutely don't want to, no matter how much I love baking.  If you can get over trying your own food (Just a little bit is enough. it's one of the most important things. So many people don't try the things they make and then wonder why it tastes like shit) and know that you won't binge on the stuff, then learn baking. It's so much fun and you can make other people happy :)",False,False
