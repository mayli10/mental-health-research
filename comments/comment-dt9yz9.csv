I was meaning to say that I did small muscle group exercises and bigger ones, so I just cut out my small ones and that’s how I reduced my workout. But I was also saying if you do say, 4 small target exercises and suddenly switched that to one exercise that targets a lot that could be hard.   :) I hope that makes more sense now.",False,False

I decreased my workouts from like 14 sets to 6 and I feel sooo much better about going now. For a bit I was feeling exhausted even thinking about the gym but now I’m excited for my sessions again. I made the change because I wanted to switch my routine and add running on more days (running is sometimes more fun and definitely is  easier to me). With how much I’m restricting now I get too lightheaded from big lifting sessions.   I googled “minimalist weight lifting” and some old school lifters actually really support it! I guess I was looking for some confirmation bias but I really liked this article: https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/simplify/  For me it did help to remove my smaller muscle group workouts because I’m less tired overall at the end now. I already used full body motions as well but if you don’t adding them as a replacement could be challenging. Good luck whatever you do! That’s just one perspective I can offer.,False,False
