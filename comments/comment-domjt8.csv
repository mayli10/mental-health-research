We send people with EDs to the UK for treatment but you have to be on your death bed before our health care system will fund it. There is no services here.,False,False

Feels as though medical professionals don’t give a damn sometimes, and not only when the illness is a mental one",False,False

And it's not only ED awareness but mental health in general. It's frowned upon and seen as nothing more but being spoiled. Not to mention, treatment in hospitals is not the best while private practice therapists are too expensive.   Now, treatment for ED is even worse. I know about only one clinic specialized in ED treatment for children, teens and young adults but the age limit is 26.   I'm 27, have been suffering with ED since I was 17. I have never been diagnosed and I am too scared and lack courage to admit to anyone what has been going on. I have been judged too many times for such bullshit that I don't think I could handle being judged for this, especially because of my age.   Only thing I have left is to either help myself or continue living with my ED as long as I can.   Sorry for the long post and the potential grammar mistakes, English is not my native language.",False,False

Very different. I won't put numbers but I've lost a lot of weight in 3 months (was a normal BMI to start with), nobody sees me eating and I still just get lots of unsolicited comments about how I'm ""being good"" by not eating anything or how I'm ""looking nice and slim"".   Feels like everyone is on a (often failing) diet, all the women in my work talk about diets and weight loss constantly (and recruit for their wee ""Slimming World"" clubs) and think its fine to ask me really invasive questions about what I eat and tell me the syn/ ww points value of it.   Seems like a lot like people still value thinness over mental health - nobody has actually asked if I'm alright which just spurs me on to lose more tbh. I also think people here have a very narrow stereotypical idea of what EDs look like (only eating half an apple ever etc) and don't grasp it can look different on different people.  Sorry this turned into a bit of a rant, idk if it helps!",False,False
