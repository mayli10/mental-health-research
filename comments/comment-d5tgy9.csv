Not due to the weather. I love the autumn and winter weather.. but all I can think about right now is self harm.. it's been a really long time since I've last done that. But my boyfriend's little sister ended up in the hospital because she had cuts on her arms. It reminds me too much about myself and saddened me. I'm just not in the right mindset to be hearing about all this, but I have to be there for him as well..   &amp;#x200B;  He told me when he saw her cuts it reminded him of me.. it saddened him quite a bit, so I don't want him to see cuts on me again, but I don't know. I just want to cut away at all this fat. Shave it all off. I hate this.",False,False

I don't want to sound alarmist, but the idea of you getting blackout drunk while on a date with someone you're not already in a relationship with is...scaring me. I don't care how chill he seems or how close you already are - sexual assaulters are usually known to the victim. Like not to be dark, but a healthy amount of distrust will serve you well when getting to know someone, imo.",False,False

Not you as a child, but just you as a grown person right now. That one inner-self that has been you your entire life. Just hold on to that.   Also, get better at accepting that you will never be able to control how other people react to anything, ever. Never, ever. You can maybe get really good at using the right words, but that is not the same as controlling people's reactions. Project this onto people, in the meaning that nobody knows how you will react. Your reaction is justified to what action was taken against you. Speaking up, and standing my ground was always something I've been capable of, but I never wanted to do it, it was just too scary. I started speaking up more, it was terrifying, and then it just got easier. It'll get easier for you too. Be there for people, speak up for those who don't have a voice. And that includes yourself.",False,False
