They didn't make a huge difference for me, but I've heard people report success with them taking the edge off urges/compulsions in general (i.e. not just alcohol cravings).  So awesome to hear it's helping you!  (total side note just in case the prescribing doctor didn't mention it...but it was recommended I carry a medical alert card or something just in case of a medical emergency since opioid pain meds won't be effective while on naltrexone)",False,False
