Second of all, the human body is wild, it doesn’t want to gain copious amounts of weight any more than you do! Three structured meals a day until your hunger cues come back can really help, and then you just pay attention to what you’re craving and when you’re hungry/full. It’s so scary but it’s helped me so much to remind myself that no food is off limits. When I first started eating like that, I ate so much for like a month and yeah, I gained a bit of weight, but now that my body knows I’m not about to starve it, it drops the excess weight like crazy and it doesn’t binge anymore. I’ve been surprised by the shift in my appetite, and how I can genuinely stop eating cake when my body is done, because I’m simply not obsessed with it anymore. Food doesn’t mean as much as it used to, it’s just food, it’s not good or bad, and I don’t crave it in excess. Your body will repay your the same way, trust it! Calories are bullshit and the number that calculators give you is peanuts compared to what you actually need. Take care of your body by letting it eat and it will take care of you by giving you healthy cues! you have a community of people here loving and supporting you no matter what you decide, you’re not a failure for not doing it and you’re mad brave if you do!! Big love your way 💘",False,False
