Still, I can't believe anyone needs less than 1200 a day. Even women who are shorter than average probably need more than that.",False,False

It's hard to believe that such a low intake is filling, but it sounds like it's enough for you. I suppose that kind of qualifies as healthy weight loss since you don't feel sick? I'm a bit reluctant to say that though. If it does feel that it is catching up to you then you will have to go up to maintenance until you feel better to stay healthy. If you're underweight it might catch up really soon. If you're overweight or at a healthy weight though it might turn out fine.",False,False
