I‚Äôve had to cut out friends who were toxic and triggering, I‚Äôve had to be the ‚Äúweird one‚Äù who always has snacks in my bag. I‚Äôve built a healthy exercise routine focused on strength and health over aesthetics, but I had to finally be honest with myself that I wasn‚Äôt tracking calories to ‚Äúmake sure I was eating enough protein‚Äù. I recently read brain over binge, which I think helped a lot too.   Most of all, though, is finding other things to think about. For a while in my recovery I stayed subbed to proed and consumed a lot of recovery content. But lately, I‚Äôve put my focus on other passions. Thinking less about my ED and more about other things has helped tremendously. ",False,True
