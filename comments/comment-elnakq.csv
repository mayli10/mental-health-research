(3200 in cardio 400 in lifting and 4000 from just living) that’s 2 lbs of fat and if you want to use the 1900 cals your body will hold in glycogen via muscle and liver you’re still over a pound of fat. Which should move the scale",False,True

It’s hard for the body to get to a catabolic state, the body stores nearly 100,000 calories of fat that is way more efficient and effective for energy supply than muscle is. Muscle preservation is an overly used argument considering how hard it is to actually tear off muscle. And that’s not even getting into glycogen storage which most people replenish daily. Even in a 48 hour fast there no reason the body would ever go for muscle unless you are severely under weight",False,True

And calories in VS. calories out doesn’t make a difference when the body is using biological functions differently when in a fasted state.   Besides, exercising can also cause water weight around the muscles as they’re tearing and repairing.  It wouldn’t be any real weight, your body is probably inflamed from the stress of so much exercise.  On top of that, starvation in and of itself is a trauma to the body.",False,False

Calories in vs calories out says otherwise. Also definitely went through my glycogen supply by the second workout so I should have tapped into my fat storage for my 3rd workout,False,True
