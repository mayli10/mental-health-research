Way healthier than a lot of things like booze or drugs, since I could stop and get treatment anytime and have no chemical dependencies. It can be really awful but I would rather have it than not have it. It's like a part of me at this point.",False,False

I might like seeing the number on the scale go down, but I have no energy to celebrate it, and I wish every day I didn’t have to deal with this. I don’t think we should expect anyone to support us slowly killing ourselves or glorify it by comparing it to peoples life choices by saying, “do whatever makes you happy.”",False,False

Like feeling in control of something can be very comforting, seeing the number on the scale go down feels good, feeling accomplished when you finish a fast or stay within your calorie allotments, get compliments from strangers, etc. But I agree a lot of it is shitty. Like, really shitty...",False,False
