They don’t understand that saying that leads to insecurities, depression, and anxiety. They’re an older generation, they can’t understand, they probably think it’s love, but they don’t hate you, nor want you to hurt yourself. At least we can learn from their older generation bullshit of eat/don’t eat shenanigan to teach future kids that fat shaming is mean even if it’s within family.   I’ve been on this boat, I’m a senior in college now and I started working out two years ago. I am now close to being back to my before freshman 15+ weight. I started going to the gym not because they kept telling me I was fat, but because I was no longer confident in myself because of their unfiltered comments. Feel more confident in your body, you only have one. Getting a personal trainer is expensive but it’s worth getting some confidence at the gym. I would 100% recommend it and get revenge by bettering yourself.   I’m sorry if this was too cheesy or if you didn’t need to hear this positivity shit.",False,False
