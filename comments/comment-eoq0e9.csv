A nurse pulled us aside and let us know she was passing food undigested. She passed away not too long after. She was addicted to pain pills and such so I'm not saying this is the same thing. But please be careful. Pay attention to your vitamins and minerals and make sure you are getting enough fluids. ðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œ to you. Feel free to message if you need someone to vent to/yell at :)",False,False
