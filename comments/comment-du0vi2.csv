I just wanted to rant - I didn't really want a therapy session.  Mostly I'm just upset that the post was allowed to remain on the popular subreddit when it's obviously harmful to others. I just thought it was irresponsible of the OP and the mods.   My initial indignation was that a younger girl would see it and think ""hey starving myself is a good way to lose weight"", but it affected me too. The triggering event does seem random and surely I've seen other equally as harmful things, but again, I haven't starved myself in years and that's what did it. So that feels pretty valid to me.",False,True

You sound like you are in pain, and rightfully so, because eating disorders are hell.   I want to say, and what I was semi-implying with my original comment, that the sense I got from your OP was that you weren’t really being honest with yourself and seem to be blaming your relapse on a triggering post. You said “it literally made you relapse,” though you also said that you don’t know why the post made you so mad.   I see that a lot on this sub, and I myself have done it before, where someone blames their relapse or ED behaviour on a shitty incident that happened to them, like a comment someone said or a pic of some person. Of course the shitty incident is important and undoubtably had an effect, but like I know for myself that instead of looking at why the incident made me feel how I did and what I can do about it, I use it as a cop out. When I do that, it’s me not wanting to look at myself or take ownership of my behaviours. Perhaps this resonates with you, perhaps it doesn’t.",False,False

It's that she lost 30lbs because of her ED and blatantly said it and it was like a celebratory post.,False,True
