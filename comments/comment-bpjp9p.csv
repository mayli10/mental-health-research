So far no one has noticed anything (just counselors here now) so I’m going to keep going. The time kids would most likely notice would be me skipping dessert, but I’m pretty sure I’ll just go with ‘a lot of sugar doesn’t make me feel good when I’m running around so unless it’s something i really want i don’t eat it much’",False,False
