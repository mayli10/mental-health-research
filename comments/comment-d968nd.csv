I hate when people who have seen me at my lowest start to tell me I look ""good"" or ""healthier"". Like , STOP. Just tell me what I want to hear or nothing at all. I think if they haven't seen you at your skinniest, they actually mean you look hot. There is a point in being skinny where it's still quite underweight, but passable as looking good. Like some anorexic IG models, they look quite skinny af but not to the point where people are concerned. I think that's a decent pace to be. The only reason I want to look anorexic af is because I feel like it gives me some leeway to binge out and still look skinny, as opposed to being ""thin"" and binging out, and than I'm like ""welp.. now I'm just average and I'm gonna get fat"". Aesthetically, you can get quite skinny without people worrying. Either way, I've started to notice how people treat me based on how skinny I am that day. The other day I was feeling a bit chubbier and a homeless guy called me beautiful, I was flattered but also pissed because I knew that meant that it looked like I had some meat on my bones. It's funny now that I take compliments from men as a means to get skinnier. I don't want guys to hit on me, I want guys to tell me that I'd be hotter if I gained some weight. That's always the best thinspo for me.",False,False

He’s living out a narrative that he’s come up with for himself without actually considering the realities of the people he’s interacting with.   If it helps, this happens to me as well. Compliments feel good for about thirty seconds and then I start to spiral to bit and wish my appearance had just never been brought up at all. Any time my SO tells me I’m beautiful or hot, I start to wonder if that just means I don’t look as sick as I am. His cousin came to stay with us a while back and he said by way of greeting, “you’re looking great!” and I worried it meant I looked “healthier” aka “bigger” than I had the last time I saw him.   It sucks. I’m sure the guy meant what he said. Try not to obsess over it too much if you can.",False,False
