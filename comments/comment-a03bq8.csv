Some people will puke once or skip a day of eating and their heart rate and potassium will be all over the place. Then there's people like me whose bodies are just very good at compensating and can keep on our bullshit a very long time until it all suddenly comes crashing down without warning.,False,False

I've been restricting really low with the occasional b/p session for over a year now and have never had any of the issues that seem to come up a lot.

I’m thinking a lot of the symptoms people have isn’t from the restricting as much as from lack of electrolytes/water.    Some people fast for weeks and only have water and have no issues, because they’re keeping their water and electrolytes up. I find if I don’t drink water I feel sick, and once my electrolytes drop I feel nauseous and light headed, but if I have a glass of water with a bit of salt in it then I feel fine.    You might just be lucky, or if you keep your liquids up (teas, waters) that might be why :)",False,False
