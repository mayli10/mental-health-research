There was no infection that showed.  So I guess its possible that there is something wrong with my kidneys and the electrolytes being out of range are a symptom of that.  That makes sense.   The strangest thing about it all is that the doctor wrote me a letter for the appointment. Where as the previous urine samples I sent in, he just made a call to say he wanted to see me.",False,True

It can lead to big problems if you don't deal with it, but it's very easy to fix.  Blood in urine can be a sign of a kidney infection, or of a more serious kidney illness.  If it's an infection you might just be prescribed antibiotics.  If the doctor thinks you may have kidney damage, they'll refer you to a nephrologist to determine treatment options.",False,False

Keep us updated, if you can. I'll keep you in my thoughts ðŸ’“",False,False
