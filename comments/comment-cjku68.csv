It was so annoying, like my feet would almost itch and then spasm uncontrollably. Usually when I was trying to fall asleep, and it kept waking me up.   Thanks so much for posting, now I know it might be electrolytes! Hope you found the answer you were looking for.",False,False

I feel like it would be harder for that to happen with actually standing -&gt; passing out -&gt; standing up again, but if your perception/memory encoding were playing tricks on you, it's probably not impossible.  Take it easy today and drink plenty of fluids!",False,False

Like, you may have lost consciousness without being aware of it...I've fainted before (for other medical reasons, not ED stuff) and have learned that my memories of what happened, and in what order, are not necessarily accurate.   That said, this incident is something I'd strongly recommend asking a doctor about.",False,False
