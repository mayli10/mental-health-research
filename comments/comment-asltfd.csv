I have been now and it was a lot better than expected. They actually arenâ€™t expecting immediate weight gain or consuming more calories right away, they understand that I need a lot of mental health help first. Iâ€™m looking forward to the future now and hopefully will get better.  Thank you for the good luck wishes! Iâ€™ll try my best.",False,True

Each step will be hard but the first oneâ€™s the hardest. Remember that you deserve it too, just as much as your loved ones!  I canâ€™t predict what will happen for your individual situation but I was not forced inpatient even with stats like yours. Yes they will expect 2000+/day and immediate gains but the gain doesnâ€™t have to be huge, and as long as you try your best to meet the targets itâ€™s not a huge massive big deal if you fall a bit short. Good luck!",False,False
