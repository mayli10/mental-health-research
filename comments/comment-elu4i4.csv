The longest fast ever was [Angus Barbieri’s 392 day long fast](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/fp/tale-angus-barbieri-fasted-year-lost-21-stone/amp/).  He lost 294 pounds, and (to my knowledge, at least) was totally fine.  He was under medical supervision throughout, though, was taking supplements, and they would have stopped if something went wrong.",False,False

You can get your BMR professionally determined, but for virtually all adults, the calories your body needs to keep existing are above 1200.  When you’re trying to lose weight, it’s a little more complicated. Some people fast for weeks on end without side effects because they were already at a high weight to begin with. Someone who’s already severely underweight will see complications from undereating pretty quickly, since they can’t “afford” to lose more weight.  The guideline for weight loss is generally set at 1200 calories/day because when you eat fewer calories than that, it’s very difficult to avoid malnutrition, and you want to harm reduce as much as you can.",False,False

Functions like breathing, heart beating, even THINKING require calories (fun fact your brain uses up like 25% of the calories in your whole body). People who are smaller need less of those calories b/c their bodies literally just take up less energy. So eating less forces your body to find its energy from other areas, like stored fat, muscles, and bones. That’s why so many anorexics have health issues - their bodies doesn’t have enough calories to actually keep bones &amp;  muscles moving, and needs to like “eat them up” to keep basic stuff (digestion, brain function) intact  That was long TL;DR you need more calories so your body doesn’t literally eat itself alive",False,False
