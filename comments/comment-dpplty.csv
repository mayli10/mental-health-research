Food  energy has three (technically 4) options   1. Used to meet energy demands 2. Used to increase body mass if energy demands are met     3. Lost as heat before 1 or 2 are completed.   4. Is excreted before being absorbed (malabsorption diseases, xenical, Bulimia all can do this)   Drugs causing an increase in ones energy demands despite body size would be like mimicking conditions that make your heart &amp; other organs work harder &amp; faster, or disease that cause so much damage (ex.COPD) that your body has an extreme daily energy demand trying to repair.   Increasing body mass is clearly what’s trying to be bypassed.  Drugs causing a greater amount of food energy to be lost as heat would literally cook the inside of your body. Consuming more than a marginal amount of calories over your TDEE would put you at risk from death from malignant hyperthermia   Drugs inducing malabsorption issues would either just be ipecac or Alli made more advanced. Since people already give up alli because they find shitting out dietary fat at random to be do distressing, I don’t think a better version that makes you shit out fat, carbs, and protein  would catch on.    So whoever postulated this i feel is either extremely optimistic or just doesn’t find the idea of any of these consequences being unpleasant . I think processed food engineering elevating to a state where high calorie foods can become low calorie &amp; impossible to fully absorb is more likely",False,False
