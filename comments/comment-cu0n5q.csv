A company can put in the job requirements that you need to be able to lift 100lbs or stand on your feet for 35 hours straight thus weeding out a large pool of applicants. If the applicant says they can perform the functions of the job then you can‚Äôt discriminate against them and say they don‚Äôt ‚Äòlook‚Äô like they would be able to perform the job.   Obviously people discriminate behind closed doors and would choose an applicant that ‚Äòlooks‚Äô the most fit for the position, but openly admitting it is pretty heinous on their part.",False,False

Working at B&amp;N is a fairly active job from what I‚Äôve heard from friends who‚Äôve worked there. Books are heavy af to move around, stocking shelves is tiring, being on your feet all day is tiring. The hiring person DEFINITELY could have phrased it better, but being judged to be physically unable to do a large portion of a job isn‚Äôt discrimination?",False,False

Call corporate and tell them what happened. That is legit discrimination and somebody needs to be held accountable for their actions. It's definitely NOT ok what they said to you!,False,False

They straight up told you they didn't hire you because you're sick. You could sue them for that if you really want to.,False,False

And it sucked cause he seemed impressed that i have 3 years of experience working in a library and then I worked full-time for a year in a hospital and im only 20. And then this happens and it just hurts.   And I sure hope it‚Äôs a blessing. I really do. üíû,False,True

What sort of job were you applying for? I could understand something that requires some physical exertion (even if it‚Äôs minor) to worry about someone being capable of keeping up with it if they‚Äôre sick. If it‚Äôs a desk job though, that seems a little weird.   Most of all, I‚Äôm sorry you had to experience that. I wish you so much luck in recovery and I hope you find the right job for you. Maybe this is a ‚Äúblessing in disguise‚Äù.",False,False
