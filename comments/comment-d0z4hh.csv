I excessively exercise, restrict, count calories, am either juuust UW or borderline UW, and am scared of meals I can't accurately log the calories of.  Me yesterday: almost passes out at a coffee shop, friend who's been through anorexia recovery agrees with me that I look dangerously thin, works on a recovery plan, struggles to try eating Normal Person amounts, finishes the day at like 1800 calories  Me today: ""okay but like I doubt I'm anemic or whatever. I'm like... fine? I probably shouldn't try to gain weight because what if I go to a doctor and they weigh me and tell me my BMI is fine and I don't need treatment?? if I can't get a diagnosis I probably can't get insurance to cover anything??""",False,False
