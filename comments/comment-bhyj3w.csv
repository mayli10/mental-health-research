My BMI is like 27 and I’m an hourglass myself but even tho ppl like barbie make me feel better, I want to be small and take up less space. I don’t want to be big/as big as a future bf and have my thighs swallow his face (lol). So it’s like a bandaid for me to look at ppl like barbie because i know what i really want is to be small and not thicc",False,False
