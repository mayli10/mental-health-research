I think she was mostly assuring herself that it was healthy, and that it couldnt be true that she just hadnt notice how bad it was.    Thanks for your suggestions! Im probably gonna have a talk with her today, probably wont exactly come clean but ill try and clear the air a bit at the very least.",False,True

Because if not, you can say you honestly don't know why she wrote that on there other than your weight loss. If not, you can still blame it on your weight loss.   Oooor... you could use it as a chance to come clean. Idk but your mom should not have reacted the way she did. Like she knows you might have an eating disorder, but is going to compliment your weight loss still? Weird move.",False,False
