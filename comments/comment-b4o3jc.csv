The foodie culture is huge, hardly anyone cooks and they eat a surprising amount of processed/packaged/convenience food along with sugary drinks. The food is also very carb-heavy and a lot of it is fried. It was absolutely delicious and some of my best food memories are from that trip but I’m not surprised that I only managed to lose 3lbs while being more active than I had been in years.

Their clothing sizes are way too small.    Wear xs in western clothes, it's L at Chinese stores I felt horrible shopping there.    Also you could say you have IBS, and ask them not to fry in oils, or you could eat soups.",False,False
