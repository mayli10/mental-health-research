What she said was shitty and insensitive, but if you trust her, take the shitty/insensitive thing she said at face value.   Take some time to cool off and then talk to your friend about why you felt hurt .",False,False

That said, it's complicated bc she's on her own journey learning to accept her body too. There are friends of mine who are visibly bigger than me (I've questioned this multiple times based off of what I'm about to tell you but we at least can't share clothes so that's probably a sign???) they have ridiculously curvy bodies therefore smaller stomachs and insinuate that we're the same size. So, so many times I've caught myself about to say ""wait no we're not... Wait ARE WE FUCK ARE WE"" because I'm shorter than them and less curvy so my fat (in my mind) looks much worse on me than on my beautiful friends. The point of this rant is that our own BS never allows us to realise everyone has a shitload of their own BS too. That said, I'm sure you already know this. Just hope you feel less alone in not knowing how to navigate this.",False,False
