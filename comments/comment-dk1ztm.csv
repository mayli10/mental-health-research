Can't go a whole day without having restrictive thoughts.  Can't seem to be present in life's little moments because I'm so consumed with these thoughts.  Can't run anymore because I hurt my knee &amp; feel the need to over-restrict because I'm under-exercising.  Can't focus on the important decisions in my life because I prioritize my eating disorder.   And so many more....  Reading your post was heartbreaking, not only because it's like looking in the mirror at my own brain, but because it made me realise how I've been so focused on the bad, that I've been neglecting all the good things. So although all this sucks....try to remember, love...  You CAN wake up every day, to a brand new day.  You CAN walk, and will be able to go on long walks again one day, after the rest your fracture needs to heal.  You GET TO have a job with coworkers who like you &amp; invite you to get drinks!  You CAN go to Trader Joe's and maybe (hopefully) find a new granola that is even better! And buy yourself a bouquet of fresh sunflowers while you're there.  You GET TO enjoy the company of a brother - who loves you enough to trust you with sharing his deepest thoughts and feelings. Maybe share yours with him, too.  Start small, with meals that are gentle on the digestive system, like steamed veggies and lean proteins (like eggs). Drink plenty of warm water. Your stomach can heal, your digestive tract can heal, but you must wean yourself off the laxatives.   You can do this. Keep fighting, keep your head up. I'm here for you ~ DM me if you ever need to talk. ♥️ Hugs!!!",False,False
