Ive never discussed how deep it all runs tho.,False,False

Like I had a ton of fun and love spending time with him but I couldn't believe how bad of an influence we had on each other.  I'm going for another visit in September and I'm reeeaally hoping this last trip was just a fluke but I guess I'll find out.   Does your bf know about your ED?,False,True

Basically I restrict when I’m home and let loose when I’m with him. It’s not healthy in the slightest but I’d be obese too if I didn’t. It gets difficult when we spend more than a few days together. I will skip meals sometimes and just have dinner with him when I stay over. One of these days we’re gonna have to talk about it probably idk,False,False

Like they're not doing anything wrooong necessarily but it's still behavior that is hard to deal with while also struggling with something. How do you usually cope?",False,True

I cycle between binging, restricting, and being normal pretty regularly. He’s clinically obese and focuses a lot of our activities around eating and drinking (kinda functioning alcoholic). Most days being around him triggers the ed thoughts and I’ll either indulge and binge drink, or not eat at all to compensate. I love him but it’s a bit exhausting.",False,False

And it’s great to have someone that understands what you are going through. It’s not always perfect.. but no relationship is.,False,False

But she's honestly a super negative person in general (I still adore her tho) but the guy I'm seeing is upbeat and not as sick I guess? Idk how to explain it,False,True

Like we were doing great while in Europe but in the US we binged like crazy. I think in part it was just cuz I was excited to have him try food he hadn't had before (tacos and rootbeer floats lol) so we ate out a lot. And like it wasn't the most healthy if foods so we both fell into our bad habits and it just spiraled from there I guess?   But like literally right now we're texting and I said I felt like I ate too much and he was super supportive and caring and told me not to purge and that it was ok   Ughhh idk I'm just so confused but hearing that you and your spouse are making it work is reassuring! I'm glad you two can support each other!,False,True

And it hurts because I've had to end these relationships for the sake of both of our mental and physical health.   It sucks.",False,False

I get this so hard.. my spouse and I both struggle with similar disordered eating patterns. It’s great when we are on the train... terrible when we fall off the wagon. It’s been almost 13 years.. and we are both vegan and skinny as fuck right now.. we don’t puke or take laxatives, so it’s not as detrimental. We exercise all the time together and have collective  safe foods, plus we are afraid to have food in the fridge. Lol it’s weird. It can work... but it’s hard.",False,False
