Like you're gonna tell me people aren't attracted to super skinny women? *I'm attracted to super skinny women*. It fucks me up lmao cuz I CANNOT take anyone's word for it. I don't believe them. I know what I'm attracted to and I know that's not even kind of uncommon because of the female celebrities men and women are attracted to. They're fuckin skinny.         Also, my fiance's favorite part of my body is my hips and tummy. Aka the places my hip bones and ribs stick out. He does want me to recover and would still be attracted to me at a healthy weight, I was bigger when we met. But he still likes that I am skinny. Not that he can help it, it's just facts.",False,False
