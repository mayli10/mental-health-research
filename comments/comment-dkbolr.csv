We all need to hear this.   The thing that you said that continues to actually shock me every time I hear it is just how ‚Äònormal‚Äô others are about the way they think about food, ie, they don‚Äôt. They just say when hungry or at meal and then stop when appropriate and move on to their next task in life. I always ALWAYS assume that everyone else thinks as much about food as I do. The calories, the exercise, the missing meals so you can have a plain can of tuna, it‚Äôs so consuming.   I am jealous of how free their minds are.",False,False

I think my brother is one of them - he barely eats all week, then on the weekend he gets like, two shopping bags worth of snacks and a takeaway! I'm not judging him either, I just wonder if he realises that him fasting for five days so he can binge for two days is something like what I did when bulimia was the dominant issue with my food. It's not normal yet no one bats an eye lid, not even my brother.    And he's said many times that food doesn't interest him and that's why he doesn't eat (except for if my step mum makes a dinner, and her meals usually come between 400 and 800 calories) and saves it for a pizza on the weekend.   I don't think it's normal.",False,False

I was always underweight as a teenager without an ED, then hit adulthood, gained adult weight, and became unhealthily obsessed with my weight. My ED makes me feel stupid; I'm a student nurse and I should ""know better"" but my brain just kinda goes ""fuck your logic, you can only eat 500cal today because I said so"".  I'm currently doing my mental health unit, and we all had to randomly draw pieces of paper with a mental illness and do a presentation. The whole time I was thinking ""Lord, please don't let me pick the one that says eating disorders"" and the Lord came though, the person right in front of me got it lol. Because I don't really feel like telling my teacher, ""I can't do this because I'm trying to not have an eating disorder and this research assignment is gonna trigger me"". (My assignment was suicide, which I've survived, but I feel more comfortable talking about for some reason). Had to try and keep my mouth shut though when my classmate talked about anorexia. I think I outed myself to another classmate who I now suspect has bulimia.  I really fucking hate this and I wish I was normal.",False,False

Threw up after coming home from a wedding because I was so full from the alcohol and the food. But I made myself throw up. This isn‚Äôt an all the time thing but I know somewhere in my head that it‚Äôs not normal. My husband got upset with me for doing it and I have no ways to rationalize it. I often feel I‚Äôm not bad enough. I don‚Äôt binge enough. I don‚Äôt purge enough. It‚Äôs a weird isolating spot to be in. Thanks for helping me feel seen.,False,False
