Like you said, you donâ€™t want to come off as making fun of it, but also thereâ€™s the chance that itâ€™s like, oh this no big deal, haha.   My suggestion would be to show how the protagonist deals with their eating disorder through their emotions and how it impacts their day to day life as a means of balancing the dark humor. Using humor as a means to cope with or deflect  a serious underlying problem is a pretty common reaction from people who struggling with them, and thatâ€™s a great aspect of how most people seemingly get through their problems to depict.   Sorry for the novel lol. Hope that helpedðŸ˜Š",False,False

Maybe you should establish it as a funny character and then start to sprinkle in how they joke about the disorder and hint at it being a coping mechanism.   If I was the reader I wouldn't take it as making fun of ED's but as a relatable thing, as lots of people tend to cope that way.",False,False
