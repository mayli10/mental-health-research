I feel a lot of disgust when I watch my mother (obese) eat. I feel guilty about finding her so disgusting, but I really can't help but feel sick when I see her eat.   And she has the nerve to tell me to eat healthier when I eat a cookie??  Bitch. I ran 5km today and skipped breakfast and lunch. I can eat the damn cookie. ",False,False

My granma has a lot of health problems exacerbated/caused by being obese and only halfasses any attempts to eat better. Like, I basically starve myself for the fun of it but you can't skip out on dessert so you don't DIE?! ):  I try to remember that our culture swings just as hard in the other direction on disordered eating. She's suffering the same as me, just differently.",False,False

My mom's only overweight because she's pretty health conscious but she still eats whenever she feels like it and my dad and brother are both 6ft tall so being home gets infuriating. Like! My mom asked me to bring her cake and then was like ""why does she always bring baby portions"" because that's how I eat! This is more than I eat!!! Aaaaaa",False,False

We're roughly the same weight but he's about 25cm taller than me. I know he's still growing and needs all this food to prevent him from being underweight (I believe he was told by a doctor he's still at a healthy weight, but barely), but I still get so irrationally angry, because even when I was still growing, I would've gotten so fat if I ate the same amount of food.",False,False

My dad acts like he cares about his body because he does all that ""health"" crap like ACV water and cayenne pepper, but then he goes out to Wendy's or McDonalds every day and gorges on chocolate or ice cream in the evenings. And he still acts all holier-than-thou about his diet. I fucking hate it and I just want to get away from him and his bullshit.",False,False

Lately she has gained even more weight than normal and brings it up every conversation, and yet her new ""health"" kick just means shopping at whole foods and buying expensive organic or obscure high-calorie junk. It is so incredibly frustrating because she does not listen to a single word when I try and gently suggest she look up cico or keto or whatever.   Instead of being irritated though, I'm starting to really worry about the effects on her long term health. There's only so much my brothers and I can do to help her. ",False,False

Sometimes I'm envious... sometimes I might be judgemental, but not angry really... Sometimes I also feel sympathy (which I then worry is a bad type of pity maybe) but really I just...

My mom used to sit on the couch, with an entire pie in one hand and a fork in the other and talk about how I was fat and needed to lose weight when she was the one who was overweight (and then she’d complain about being fat and needing to lose weight). It would always make me so irrationally mad, like if you wanted to lose weight then don’t eat the whole pie? idk I felt bad, but it was also kinda hard to feel bad when she called me fat at the same time. I feel you! ",False,False
