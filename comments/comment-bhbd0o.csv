I know very few women who don‚Äôt have a messed up relationship with food and most of my girlfriends talk about how their mothers are constantly dieting, worrying about their weight, making food rules, but they don‚Äôt have EDs despite all those unhealthy talk about food so it‚Äôs not your mom‚Äôs fault that you have one. You have to have a genetic predisposition to it, otherwise the majority of women would suffer from a fully blown eating disorder.   I used to resent my mother for commenting on my weight or food choices, angry that she doesn‚Äôt realize how much these things hurt me and my relationship with food but I realized in her mind she is trying to spare me the pain she feels when she goes through her binge/restrict cycles. She thinks if she can discourage me from being overweight in the first place, I won‚Äôt be trapped in the same cycle as her where she starves herself to lose a few pounds and then binges and gains it all back. It‚Äôs very exhausting and I can see why she thinks that discouraging me from gaining ‚Äúextra‚Äù weight in the first place would help me. Once I was frustrated and crying asking ‚Äúis my whole life going to be spent losing and gaining the same 20lbs over and over again?‚Äù And she sighed and said yes. In her mind, this is how it is to exist as a woman, she cannot conceptualize a different option.   As an adult, I feel more comfortable calling out my mother on her unhealthy thinking. Like if she tells me ‚Äúoh I ate a 500 calorie muffin so now I have to skip dinner,‚Äù I gently remind her that restricting and compensating only leads to more binges later. That she can enjoy the muffin and still have dinner. Eat half the muffin and count it as a snack. Or if I give her a recipe and she goes ‚Äúoof that is so caloric!‚Äù I say yes it is but it‚Äôs very good so I just eat a smaller portion so I can still enjoy myself without worrying about it. I recently lost weight in a healthy way when I started eating meat again. When my mother asked what meal plan I used I told her honestly ‚ÄúI eat what I wanted. Eating meat again helps me stay fuller for longer. When I don‚Äôt deny myself something I want to eat, I find I eat less of it than if it were forbidden‚Äù lmao she gave me the most ‚Äúsounds fake but okay‚Äù look ever when I told her that.   Challenging my mother‚Äôs thinking in a non-confrontational and compassionate way helps to challenge my own thinking and be more compassionate to myself. Often her comments are echoed in my own mind, and the resonance threatens to make that voice louder. By challenging these thoughts and saying what my healthy self believes aloud, I give more strength to my healthy voice.   It has also helped me be kinder to my mother. Realizing how often she has these thoughts that hurt me inside, makes my heart break for her. Even though she doesn‚Äôt have an eating disorder, it breaks my heart to see her have a bad relationship with something that is vital to our survival.",False,False

Try talking to her calmly and tell her how her comments make you feel, but without blaming her for your actions.",False,False
