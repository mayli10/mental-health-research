Had this happened to me I'd probably have anorexia nervosa rn",False,False

The idea kinda scares me though. I'll dwell on it for a while, I hope I can work up the courage to suggest it. But thank you.",False,True

Can you at least make the suggestion though? It’s worth a shot imo, especially if you really do want to recover.",False,False

The main problem is she wants to deal with everything herself, almost as if she doesn't want anyone knowing that her perfect daughter is seeing any form of specialist. When I was cutting myself a year or two back and she found out a psychologist wasn't even mentioned, she just wanted to deal with the symptoms which also just turned into getting monitored so I wouldn't be able to cut. I do actually want to recover, I really do... But not all at once and this is terrifying me and my mind hasn't caught up with my new eating.",False,True

This is what happens when you combine good intentions with bad education/lack of knowledge (I’m NOT calling your mom stupid in general, it’s just that like most people, she seems not to know much at all about nutrition/healthy eating/etc).  Can you ask her to book you an appointment with a dietitian? And perhaps she can sit in on at least part of your appointment? You might not like what the dietitian has to say, but it’ll at least be better than your mother wantonly shoving food in your face with no idea about what she’s actually doing.",False,False
