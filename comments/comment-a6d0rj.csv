It helped me realize that I can eat healthy and within reason without worrying about calories or just eating junk.  I’d make a serving of oatmeal (fiber and vitamins) , and add some sweetener, nut butter (protein), and hemp seeds (protein and omegas). I used to have such a fear of sugar and the calories, so I would combine sugar with healthy foods. I’d slice up part of a banana, and heat up a little bit of oil (coconut oil was my choice) in a pan. Dab some brown sugar and cinnamon on the banana slices, and cook them until it’s caramelized a bit. It allowed me to face my fear foods (fat and sugar) while making something healthy, filling, and really tasty. ",False,False

I felt so much less worried about calories and more focused on eating healthy things. No thinking, “there’s over 100 cals in this banana”, you think “bananas have so many vitamins and minerals, and they help your digestion.” ",False,False

It’s incredibly difficult, but counting calories has become such a toxic thing for me to do. ",False,True
