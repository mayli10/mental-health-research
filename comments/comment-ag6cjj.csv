Going by your BMI you absolutely should gain weight. Your life probably depends on it &lt;3  I‚Äôm saying that as you gain weight and become physically healthier you will be no less deserving of recovery and support. You 100% deserve support today.

I‚Äôm really really sorry if my phrasing increased your anxiety. Definitely not my intent.

I did not mean to come across as judging your situation or experience &lt;3  My own perspective (for myself) is that weight is one piece of the puzzle, both in diagnosis and recovery. Granted, it‚Äôs a very significant piece and it‚Äôs the one that‚Äôs most easily seen by others and by myself in the mirror.

I know you're trying to be helpful and I really appreciate that, but... erm, I feel like this conclusion also makes me very anxious, and I'm not sure if you understand what I'm referring to.  Because in this situation, it isn't about the 17.5 BMI. It's about like. What if doctors would look at me and think that I have a smaller frame, conclude that I would need to weigh less than most people do *anyway* and then place a diagnostic criteria on me at even less than that?  No doctor has actually said this to me, but I'm describing the scenario: ""[my name], some people are naturally tiny and you're one of them! So you're physically very healthy! You don't need to gain weight at ALL~""  Right now I'm at a BMI of less than 14.5, so no worries *now*, I guess. But this makes me very worried when I think about what I had struggled through in the past.  I'm hesitant to use the word ""Invalidates"" because that would require that I assume that I needed to gain weight in the past.  it makes me feel like, ""B-But I tried so hard... and I thought my weight was *low* and *unhealthy*... is it not?""",False,True
