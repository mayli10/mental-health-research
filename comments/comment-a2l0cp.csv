Like if I said ""with enough practice, you'll be super good at this video game"" wont hurt me at all it someone said it to me but it might hurt someone else if they are trying really hard to be good, they're obsessive about it and it means a lot to them  ",False,False

My partner will do things like make a giant sigh in the middle of me saying something crazy and I'll be like WHAT WHY ARE YOU SIGHING and he'll be like. I had a stitch in my side so I needed to breathe deeper..... AufhHhgH. He means so well but sometimes his lack of body language and subliminal messages drive me crazy because my whole LIFE I've been interpreting messages. ,False,False

Mine once told me that if he had the choice, he'd just not message me at all probably. I was like, excuse me???? But he meant that he just gets tired easily and much rather see me in person and save his energy for that. But damn.  Your dude sounds really sweet, though. If he's willing to take it real slow and try again, that's really good :) You don't have to do that if you don't want it, of course, but it sounds like he meant well and likes you for who you are.

I hope you're able to work together toward physical intimacy if that's what you want. But I also totally understand your reaction and would totally have done the same.,False,False
