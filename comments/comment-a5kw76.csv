It‚Äôs liberating, and saves me so much time! And I realised that when I used to count calories, I would sometimes eat more than I needed to just because I had calories left for the day. Deleting the app has made me so much more in tune with my hunger cues.",False,False

My scale is broken and is never accurate, you gain five pounds by just stepping up higher on the scale. Led to be bingeing because I said ‚Äúwell I already gained all this weight, so fuck it.‚Äù You can do it! ",False,True

I was counting calories way too much and oddly enough, found myself trying to ""save up"" so I could binge-eat later. Or I'd try to limit myself under 1,200 but then I'd try to keep it as close as possible. I'm just glad that I've rid myself of that damn app; now I just need to stop weighing myself 1000x per day.",False,False

That app is toxic in the hands of someone with a disordered mindset like most of us who struggle with restriction around here.
