You made a good first step in telling your friend that there is something you need to open up about. She already knows it's not going to be easy for you.  This sense of urgency, this fear is so REAL. It's difficult to invalidate, even for the mental illness brain. So maybe start with that, talking about the fear, and what is behind it may follow. That's helped me in the past.  You are brave to open up or even to just give yourself the opportunity. Good luck.",False,False
