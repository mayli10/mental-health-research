But buses are 2.00's each way and trains, from where I am, are 3.10 off peak and 4.00 on peak. Peak is like the busy times in the mornings and afternoons. Bikes are good, but I recommend a U lock. It adds up though, especially being broke (I.e. my life) So for me, it usually adds up to like 8 dollars a day if I only take the train. I hope this made sense, I'm rambling.",False,False

I made intern wages, had student loans to start paying off, my tiny apartment was ridiculously expensive, and I was so stressed.  I'd basically live off the free food at work and school, then ration it through the week if was able to take any home. I maybe spent $100/month at the grocery, including alcohol. Then I'd drink on an empty stomach to get drunk easier. When I wasn't with friends or at work or doing schoolwork, I was at the gym.  All in all, it was hard so please take care of yourself.  Meal prepping throughout the week probably helped me a little. And having a strong support system is important too.",False,False
