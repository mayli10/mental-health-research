I haven't even started season3 yet because of this. The actress who plays Nancy is living thinspo and its a bit freaky to see it in a context that isnt even about food or diet. She is very triggering and I lowkey believe that she is suffering herself. I saw red carpet photos of her for the season 3 premiere and she has definitely lost an unhealthy amount of weight.,False,False
