I can’t remember but I think eating disorders do crazy stuff to dopamine (plus I have ADHD and like, no available dopamine without my medication).

At this point I feel like I’ve kind of learned how to trick myself and psych my ED out.   Like, if suddenly it’s not numbers but quantity of food at one time, only hope is snacks. Or maybe lately I’m not scared of sugar - cool! Piece of cake for my food today. Ohhhhh we cant eat food unless it’s cut into tiny pieces? Break out the tiny utensils, folks!
