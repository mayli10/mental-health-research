You smother em w cheese and milk and butter and sugar and salt and pepper and pour in some bacon grease and now you have like your daily worth of calories  from some fucking tiny sand corn ðŸ™ƒ,False,False

I live in Sweden, and meatballs are a bit of a staple here. Now, I stopped eating meatballs at ~14 years old, because they were for sure 80-110 calories per meatball depending on if they were homemade or store bought. No way I was going to add another 360 calories to my pasta for 3 dumb meatballs!  I... don't know what made me look it up, but 7 years later, I find out they're 30 calories per piece, not 110. What. Tides turning, waves crashing, tectonic plates shifting. WHAT.",False,False

MFP has a ton of conflicting information and some of them do have the unit size as one piece.

Sad emoji.  On the other hand, plain boiled potatoes are a mainstay of both my cultural heritage, and my personal menu.  ~400 calories per pound, with some variation depending on the type of potato.  The DNA test also said my 4th-great-grandparent was Japanese, though, so now I have a whole new heritage worth of foods to either adopt as safe, or reject as 'junk food'. ",False,False

When I was in sixth grade our teacher had us track our calories for a day as part of some half-assed nutrition unit. My mom made jiu cai he zi (chive turnovers) for dinner and I watched her cook while adding the calories for the ingredients and dividing by portions. It's basically flour, eggs, chives, seasoning, and a lot of oil. I remember it came to probably over 1000 for what I ate and I freaked out and rounded it down to 700 for my homework because I was so ashamed. I thought I was supposed to be eating 1200 a day, and I must be the only person grossly overeating like this, and if I ever let anyone else find out, they would think I was disgusting too.  It definitely seemed like everything on nutrition websites was geared toward the average white American. Not so much an issue for me anymore though bc I don't live with my family, so I'm not eating any vague homemade meals.  On the daifukuâ€”usually if I had a situation like this I would probably look up a recipe that was most accurate to what I ate and calculate based on that. I can't imagine it would be 280 unless it was enormous. I think it'll probably be between 100-200.",False,False

BUT LEMME TELL YOU. South Africans can't live without red meat, and Brits can't live without full-fat dairy in any form. Borewors and biltong, fatty sausages, plain dry steak.
