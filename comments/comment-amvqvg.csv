I'm going to detail what I ate:  - a slice of bread with half an avocado and swiss cheese (bread used to be a huge trigger but I'm working on it...)  - coffee and a few mini chocolates   - A handful of chocolate chips and banana chips   - salad consisting of cucumber, tomatoes, chickpeas and onions, with vinegar   - A handful of grapes and blueberries    Besides the random chocolate (which has made me the most nauseous), everything was pretty healthy.    I feel so sick to my stomach, it makes me happy. I was about to go to the store and get Nutter Butters or something stupid like that to binge on.    F**k my ED, I should be at work right now, not laying in bed choking myself and obsessing over food. I can't tell if the grogginess is from my new meds, choking myself, or both. ",False,False
