Happy ending, we worked through it and Iâ€™m comfortable with sex again after months of not being able to at all.   You donâ€™t deserve the pain of that! itâ€™s so hard to push through it, but if you know that would cause you emotional pain itâ€™s worth the effort to convince yourself that you ARE worthy of feeling sexual pleasure and of his physical affection. You deserve it, and your size doesnâ€™t determine your worthiness. ",False,False

People change, sometimes for worse, and sometimes for better - no relationship is ever going to be sunshine and rainbows 100% of the time, but it doesn't mean you don't deserve the love and intimacy of your partner, even if you don't feel that way all the time. ""Is that what he wants?"" as /u/jakisaur asked is a very important question here. ",False,False
