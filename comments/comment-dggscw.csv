People don't think it does this but I have read that it decreases mitochondrial efficiency making your body less efficient at burning calories (could be misquoting). I was able to lose on a higher intake and maintain higher as well,False,False

Being in ketosis does not help in weight loss, but because you are consuming no carbs your body won't cling to water (that's why carbs are called carbo-HYDRATES). This gives the illusion of faster weight loss but it's just water weight.",False,False

Ultimately, if keto makes you feel fuller on less food (doesn't work for me, but I know it does for some), then it'll help you lose weight, but you're still losing the weight through a calorie deficit.",False,False
