My sense of humor My parenting skills My smarts How good I am at making up songs about the cats Literally anything that isn‚Äôt food/body related No really fucking ANYTHING that isn‚Äôt food or body related  Not even good comments babe Just no comments ever   Took a learning curve but we‚Äôre both much happier not having these discussions anymore.,False,False

Yesterday he said he was looking at pics of me after I gave birth and noticed how puffy and bloated my face was a few days after, but he misses my chubby arms. Doesn't he realize I'd also have the puffy face at that weight, not just the chubby arms? Now I'm determined to never become the weight I was in the pics, because I'm convinced I'd gain too much in my face.  Another dumb thing he said was already a couple of weeks ago, but I still remember... I was so proud I was able to eat cereal easily, even though it used to be a huge fear food. He pointed out that cereal contains acrylamides (carcinogenic substances). It was the healthiest, most fiber-rich, sugar-free cereal in the store, but it's still giving me cancer üòë",False,False
