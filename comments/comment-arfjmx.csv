I was at a adult and adolescent inpatient unit and everyone was just competing to be the most disordered. If you didn’t get put on a feeding tube you were ignored. There were clear cliques of super underweight girls and the “fatties” in my experience it just fueled my eating disorder even more. Inpatient was the first place I was able to starve myself for more than a day.   Also because I wasn’t underweight or extremely disruptive I felt like my treatment was put on the back burner. My therapist would meet with someone else three times a week and I’d only see her every other week.   But if you’re underweight you might not have a problem with this. You just need to be recovery minded. Try not to socialize too much, the people in inpatients units can be so incredibly toxic. Like don’t talk to those people outside of the hospital, chances are it will hurt both of you. ",False,False

There’s inpatient and residential for overnight stays and then partial hospitalization and intensive outpatient for day/evening programs  I think it depends on what treatment center you go to. I have found really caring clinicians and helpful therapy groups as well as very boring and unhelpful groupwork...it totally depends. The milieu will influence your stay a lot too.   Generally you’ll be expected to eat three meals and three snacks a day. If you’re coming in from heavily restricting they might start you out on a lower meal plan to watch out for refeeding syndrome. Outside of meals, you’ll have therapy groups which are usually things like process groups, DBT/CBT/ACT, art therapy, nutrition, etc. You’ll have a treatment team which includes a therapist, dietitian, and probably a psychiatrist and doctor overseeing you. If you’re in partial, you’ll go home to sleep at night. In IOP you only come in for around 3ish hours a day, a few times a week. ",False,False
