It’s odd because I desperately want help with everything but my ED,False,False

She had no idea until I finally told her that I was going to treatment so I’d have to stop our sessions. Then I started school and haven’t seen her again but that was a few years ago. When I asked her later she said she could tell I low self esteem but had no idea I was so disordered",False,False

I've been seeing a therapist for over a year now. I have spoken briefly about my history of ED's but it's never taken centre. I think he knows if I want to talk about it I will bring it up more.  I mention related stuff most weeks but never go too far in.   BUT I have recently had a massive trigger so I think next week I am going to bring it up.   Hopefully your therapist will go at your pace in the same way mine has.,False,False

I wish you the best of luck.,False,True

I've tried to kind of hint at the anxiety around eating and the fear of gaining weight but he just kind of tells me it's going to be okay and he's proud of me for accomplishing so much. (I was overweight and now am at a healthy weight so from the outside it doesn't look suspicious),False,False

The moment anyone finds out about it everyone will know and will never stop monitoring what I eat and I’ll loose all control entirely",False,False
