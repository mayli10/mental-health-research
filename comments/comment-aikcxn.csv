In that case, you need to get help.  Honestly, I wouldn’t worry too much about your surgeon catching onto any eating issues, because he’ll be concerned about surgery-related complications and poor healing instead. If he asks about your eating, I wouldn’t even be afraid to just be honest about it because a lot of people don’t eat much after wisdom tooth surgery, and he’s probably seen it all.   If you can though, do try to eat something! Like broth, applesauce, etc. Most of the standard post-extraction foods are low calorie, so please don’t worry about that right now (you’re pretty much guaranteed to lose right now anyway). Restriction can always happen later. Right now your mouth has gaping holes in it and needs all the help it can get. I got mine taken out last year and believe me, it’s best to speed along your recovery as much as you can, because pain or infection in that area sucks.",False,False
