f4yxaug,t3_dltpze,t1_f4yj37k,ImDemandingARefund,1,2019-10-23 22:28:48,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/dltpze/why_does_my_brain_not_register_fullness/f4yxaug/,"**Short Answer:**    Self Diagnosis based on how the condition symptomatically presents it self biologically and psychologically.   In case of symptomatic overlap; instead of immediate assumption that it’s both conditions comorbid, determine whether criteria for hunger can be met separately or as an egg (first). If it can; it’s presumed to be both conditions. If it can not;  it’s presumed to be appetite.    ***   **Oh Lawd:**    Hunger and Appetite are both motivational states that exist to drive us to eat.  I find that two main distinctions can help with identifying which is at play —in the case it’s not both.  1) *Hunger should be more predictable than appetite*.   If someone usually eats three times a day at specific times but for some reason they have to break this cycle (*ex, doctor asks you to fast for an early A.M appointment*) most people can predict they’re gonna be feeling very hungry by their usual lunch hour. If someone eats breakfast &amp; lunch in line with their circadian rhythm and the amount/type of food they ate wasn’t very different but they’re thinking about potatoes only a couple hours past noon and your *coincidentally* bored with what you’re doing; there’s a decent chance it’s not genuine hunger.  2) *Being Hungry stems from a physiological need to eat food; accordingly it causes a vast amount of physiological sensations.*  Appetite is a *mental desire* to eat food— thus, it presents itself mostly as psychological  &amp; emotional symptoms. Oral sensations (*ex: “a taste for”, specific cravings, salivating*”) are typically as far as it can go when it comes to creating physical sensations.  As a shortcut I mentally speak to myself like a toddler and ask “Honey do you actually want your tummy filled or do you want your desires fulfilled?” Because I have no other way of actually forcing myself to answer honestly with a freaking ED.   ***    with that said; in most relatively physically healthy people, {especially in those who don’t usually ignore Hunger on a daily basis [*statement supported by anecdotal evidence only*]},  **Hunger** will usually will cause physiological symptoms at *some point* to motivate us to eat. They can count even if they do pass in a relatively short amount of time within reason  **Symptomatology of Hunger: Typical Case**   • Urge to eat occurs gradually  • Hunger pangs (stomach/abdomen).   • Stomach Growling, Gurgling, Rumbling.   • Light headedness, Dizziness, Headaches.   • Symptoms or low blood sugar without another identifiable reason (high refined carb intake counts).   • Urge to eat in a way that a large amount of different foods would result in symptom/sensation relief.    • The urges present are mainly for filling ones stomach.     **Associated with Hunger**    • Cold as fuck out     • Restriction/Caloric Deficit.   • Subpar Fiber Consumption.    • Inadequate protein &amp; fat consumption.      • **It actually goes away after eating a meal**.   • Skipping a meal that usually isn’t missed       • All food has passed into the small intestine.      • Recent physical activity. Especially if cardiovascular - aerobic or in a higher amount than what is common. • Absence of an intense urge to satiate the sensation w/ food that is of an overly-specific type or possesses a highly-specific taste/texture profile.        Aspects of appetite are below. If you find yourself thinking “wait, i feel like I too often get BOTH of these?” Well that’s because hunger often *stimulates* appetite. As said it’s a motivational state meant to drive us to eat, after all. Good^ish? news is appetite can’t really stimulate hunger. So if you get good at identifying your true hunger cues you can just ask yourself if those symptoms are or were present regardless of the appetite symptoms.  ***  **Symptomatology of Appetite: Typical Case**     • Urge to eat occurs rapidly or suddenly    • The identified feelings come unpredictably    • Desire to eat occurred after being presented with an environmental trigger (Ex *smell, mention*).   • Absence of abdominal growling, pain &amp; pangs.   • Hardly noticeable or Absent stomach contractions.   • Salivation, Sweet/Salt/Fat/HighIndulgence Craving    • General Oral symptoms, having “a taste for [thing]”.     • Urge to eat in a way that only a small variety of foods would result in symptom/sensation relief &amp; resistance of specific foods would cause rumination / longing    • The urges present are mainly for fulfilling one’s palate    **Associated**.   • Feeling out of control while eating    • Desire is occurring cuz food tastes good     • Desire to satisfy feels urgent, not patient     • Desire to eat often persist after eating something.   • Desire to go back for “seconds”/extra helping if you ate the type of food you were craving. (Insatiable).   • Despite eating with ones circadian rhythm the feeling triggered for social reasons (happy hour, friend eating)         • Identified feelings are not associated with skipping   common meals, an empty stomach, macronutrient malnourishment, or bouts of physical activity.     • Avoiding impulsive food choice &amp; grazing requires intentionally practicing high constraint &amp; resistance.   • Urge to eat occurs with boredom (neurotypical), and/or with other stimulation seeking symptoms during a task (ADD/ADHD)     • Urge to eat occurs along with certain moods, sets of thoughts, emotions, experiences.      • intense urge to satiate the sensation w/ food that is of an overly-specific type or possesses a highly-specific taste/texture profile.",False,False
