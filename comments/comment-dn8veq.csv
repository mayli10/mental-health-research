But I like to see how much volume the chewed food takes up so that when I purge in the future I can better gauge when most is up.",False,False

For me, it started when they forced me to eat more.  Before I would eat junk food but at a very low calorie intake for the day. For example if I had pizza  i would restrict a couple days.  But now I am forced to eat so i started to do that so I can enjoy it. It sounds kinda like what you are going through.  I think it is important someone knows because of the intense feeling of shame that goes along with chewing and spitting. It can also lead to stomach ulcers as well.",False,False

Like even then if I told him I’d have to stop? It’s like this is a bad option for my teeth (but really I fucked those up in high school. So like whatever?) But it’s a great option compared to eating junk food and not staying within my limit.,False,True

I started chewing and spitting 4 days ago and have done it every day.  The first time I did it, I was hooked. Now I dont even want to do it but it feels like I have to.  I wish I could tell you to stop but I dont know how either",False,False
