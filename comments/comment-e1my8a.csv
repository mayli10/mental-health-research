The most important thing I can tell you is to be honest. The professionals you are about to meet have talked with so many different kinds of people, and have seen many people through different issues surrounding their food. You can trust them- (I know it is hard; really hard and sometimes frustrating) Talk about what your triggers are. This is the one time “talk isn’t cheap”. You may explore things that may make you Uncomfortable or your afraid that your the only one that has ever felt this way. All of that is normal, I promise.- As far as the re-feeding process goes, there will be a dietitian that will help you make different food choices; it may be scary to try the different foods. Just keep talking about why. You are not alone go into tomorrow looking to gain the tools of recovery that they are trying to help you learn. You are brave, and strong! Trust the process- no matter how hard it is day to day over time it can become easier if you want it. (Hugs)",False,False

Idk about you but I personally havent. So by training and the schooling they did, they know more then me so they would able to make the determination of ""sick enough"". And sick enough might mean weekly outpatient visits but not sick enough for inpatient.  But like if your brain is sick and cant make the best decisions maybe it's ok to let someone who knows more then you in an area to make the call? Because you cant help your brain is sick. You can only choose if it's going to get better. Plus if you have any questions on why they are suggesting a certain type of care or treatment plan you can ask then why. Ask them to explain themselves.  And if you dont think it's a good fit you can always say no.",False,False

Be as honest as you can and see what they will do to meet you where you're at. Sometimes they set other goals for you that arent weight related such as getting your period back if you're a female. They may decide you're not as bad for in-patient but will suggest a daily or weekly outpatient program. Hope that helps!,False,False
