I have Hashimoto's, but leaving any form of hypothyroid untreated can easily turn into bad, bad news. That is how people get debilitating brain fog, experience thyroid-related depression (which you may already be suffering from, based on this post), fall asleep while driving, develop neck goiters, and so on. You really don't want to let it get to that point, because it'll just be that much harder to get to the doctor when you feel physically trashed.   And not to scare you, but if you do have Hashimoto's, failing to treat it can lead to serious complications that are sometimes fatal. It is especially bad for your heart, so if you have a restrictive ED, this is not something to play around with.  As far as the needle phobia goes, speak to your doctor about getting a limited amount of a benzodiazepine just for these appointments. You should also be upfront with the staff about your phobia, and ask for accommodations like having someone coach you through with trivia questions/reciting the alphabet backwards/etc, or letting you listen to headphones to block out what's going on.   Personally, while I'm not scared of needles, skin punctures make me pass out, so I have to lie flat with my feet elevated to get blood drawn. If feeling faint is an issue, you should get into this position; you physically can't pass out when you're in it. I also used to put toothpaste up my nose so I wouldn't smell the rubbing alcohol, back when my association with needles -&gt; collapsing was strong enough to make me feel deep dread.",False,False
