I boil a cup of Diet Coke, mix the Jello Powder til it dissolves, then add a cup of cold Diet Coke (or whatever).  I like Diet Coke with black cherry powder or Diet Sprite with lime or orange powder.  the combinations are kinda limitless.  It depends what soda I have on hand and/or what jello flavor.  Fresca does good with lots of them.  Gives it some zing.",False,False

I have lime jello that was brought back from Mexico that Ive kinda wanted to try but I never eat jello and I know how much sugar Mexico uses (which is to much) so I doubt I would even like it.,False,False
