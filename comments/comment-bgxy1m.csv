Whether or not you've been officially dx-ed with an ED doesnt really matter. Just say you struggle with trying to restrict what you eat and that you're concerned that a stimulant that will suppress appetite may make that worse. Your doctor only wants the best for you and perhaps there are other ADHD meds that aren't as likely to cause appetite loss,False,False
