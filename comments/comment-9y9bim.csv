Every time I ‚Äòfeel‚Äô hungry in my stomach I feel tricked by my dietician, even though I am aware that eating more regularly will cause that to happen, it still catches me off guard. I know it is a long term goal/process and it takes baby steps but I still get annoyed at her a long the way! ",False,False

My dietician is amazing. She works at the local psychiatric hospital doing an inpatient program for eating disorders. I feel like she knows exactly what is going on in my brain. I am about to start with a psychologist who specialises in eating disorders too - I think she will help me more with the reasons behind why I restrict etc. I am going to do CBT-E with her and she will work on a team with my dietician and psychiatrist (she has a long wait list but I‚Äôve heard she is worth the wait!) I have found my dietician really helpful for learning about foods, eating more regularly, what nutrients come from food and why they are important and learning about what restriction does to your body. She is invaluable. I ate a mars bar the other week and even though I‚Äôd been restricting a bit more than usual she was still so excited for me that I ate it regardless of what the rest of my diet/intake looked like. I think it helps if you can find somebody who specialises in it and won‚Äôt push you to just ‚Äòeat more‚Äô. ",False,False

I eat 300-500 calories a day so it can be hard to spread that out but I will try to make it work. Or maybe, if I spread it out, it will trigger hunger cues and I will naturally eat more.   Quick question, has the dietician been helpful for you? I will have the  opportunity to find many health care resources in January and I have unsure about hiring a dietician to help me. If you don‚Äôt mind me asking, are they part of your eating disorder treatment? I plan on finding a therapist who can help me with my disorder but I don‚Äôt think they would also help with my meal plans.  ",False,True

I found it hard at first but was more willing to give it a try because she gave me permission to still restrict but just asked me to spread it out a bit more over the day vs. OMAD, whereas everyone else was just like EAT MORE FOOD!
