I told you something in private and not something that you would tell people if you had it... but then you go and tell others?  Pretty shitty.  I get they might have good intentions but at the same time you don't tell others about something like an ED just because.,False,True

I don't get the need to tell other people when it's not to help at all.  Especially without even telling or asking the person with the ED.,False,True

I found out yesterday that my mom told her brother. I was livid. She didn't think I'd care but I did. She apologized profusely but I was just not having it. I'm like well it's great you're sorry but now the entire family is going to know and you can't undo that, thanks so fucking much. I used to be really open about my ED and now I regret telling anyone at all.",False,False

I can’t tell her anything without her telling it to everyone. I feel your pain.  It’s so frustrating because it should be fucking obvious to anyone to just keep it to themselves.,False,False
