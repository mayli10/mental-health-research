But it is not at all reflective of any actual fat gain. I know its so much easier said than done, but please know that the number is bullshit and that maybe you should try and take a break from weigh ins for a little while. Idk all your stats but I would be incredibly surprised if you’re not at a sizeable deficit this week, physics means you have to have lost weight, the scale will just make you feel like shit",False,False

I did eat more today but my workout was more intense then usual as I have 2 intense cardio days in a week I am just scared of the scale going up tomorrow,False,True

One day of eating at maintenance isn’t going to cancel out any of the damage done from weeks of restriction  to feel a little better, try getting some electrolytes in you, basically you’re just looking for sodium (salty foods), potassium (fruits), calcium (dairy), magnesium (green veggies, nuts), and phosphorus (white meat, nuts, dairy)",False,False
