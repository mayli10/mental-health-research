I told myself I wouldn’t get help until I hit the “anorexic BMI” but then I caved and told my therapist what was going on and she was really helpful. She kept telling me that it didn’t matter what I looked like, that I was obviously in distress and that in itself was the problem.   Your problems and feelings are 100% valid regardless of how much weight you lose or what’s happening. If you feel shitty that in itself is enough to warrant help. You are super strong and you can do this! Sending loads of luck and support and love ❤️",False,False

I just walked out of my intake appointment at an eating disorder clinic and they said almost everyone who comes in says they don’t feel sick enough for treatment. I don’t know restrict or purge either, yet my eating disorder almost rules my life. My therapist doesn’t know anything about eating disorders. My nutritionist is making meal plans with me I can’t stick with. I just want this all to be done so badly so I can date and work and do more important things. Yet here I am. Sending you all the hugs. 💕",False,False
