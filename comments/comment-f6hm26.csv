I think many of us, if not all people here, have felt that ourselves to some level and have experienced similar things to what you have shared at some point during our own eating disorders. I think the stigma around eating disorders very often leads to misunderstandings and assumptions of how our problem is supposed to be and what classifies us as eating disordered and needing help. It is a tough battle to overcome your mind and then also tackle other peoples personal views and opinions on your situation as an individual. Especially during your most vulnerable time when you are proceeding with trying to get help for yourself. I think your friend honestly didn't mean any harm by her words. It sounded to me like she was unsure of what to say or didn't completely understand eating disorders or what you have dealt with the last few years.   I bet this experience made you feel completely invalidated and I am truly sorry for you. I know what this is like and it isn't the reassuring response that you were probably hoping for from your friend. Sometimes it is nice to feel like your struggle is seen and someone close to you tells you that they think you should get help or even say that they hear what you are going through and want you to be doing better. People see you one way when in reality there are so many more intricate parts to you as a person that they don't see on a daily basis. Everyone deals with their issues differently and people don't always make it apparent that something is wrong in their life. This doesn't in any way make your problem unimportant or not serious enough to get help! For me personally, I typically present myself to others as being extremely happy and positive. I tend to laugh and hide my internal pain from people outside of myself. I am not at all what I make people believe.   We all focus on this point of finally ""being sick enough"" when for all we know that stage could never be reached from our own personal perspectives. We wouldn't be in our situation probably if our mind would eventually satisfy to our weight or eating and other things about us as people. I think this because I have been both at healthy and unhealthy weights. It didn't matter what the scale said or how my body physically appeared nothing ever felt okay to me. To be totally real with you, everyone will always see you in a different way compared to how others or even yourself may see you. During my worst times with my ed some people saw my illness quite clearly solely from my appearance and others did not realize I had a problem when looking at me physically. This does not at all mean you or I don't have an issue or else we most likely wouldn't be posting or commenting in this reddit community.   Please know that YOU are valid and the way your body looks should not define the seriousness of your eating disorder even though our minds tell us it should. In regards to your comment about bulimia I actually have known someone who has it and even though I have diagnosed anorexia, I see bulimia as being just as serious as my problem and bulimics or anyone with any type of eating disorder are unwell enough to get support! You don't have to reach at certain physical size or health situation because mentally you probably struggle which people don't see and that alone says you should seek professional help. Even on days when you feel like people don't care, just know you are worthy of validation and support. Hope my answer was helpful and please take care",False,False
