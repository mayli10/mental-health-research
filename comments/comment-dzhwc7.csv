Can judge whether or not you’d be comfortable with the people attending.",False,False

The worrying about being inadequate and undeserving of being there is an anxiety. Or at least that’s how it translates to me.   Depression manifests in everyone differently. In my experience, I haven’t met a lot of people with it that are the stereotypical crying-all-day-with-multiple-attempts-and-past-abuse type. They’re just... depressed. Usually lonely and tired. Emptiness seems to be common. Apathy of oneself.   It’s a vulnerable place to be. I highly, highly doubt anyone there is going to judge you or think you’re an over dramatic wannabe. Everyone is there for the same reason. To talk about their depression and be open. To show different experiences and sides of things.",False,False

I just fee like everybody else will be doing much worse than me. People will say how they have *insert something severe* and how the cry nonstop and i will just sit n say ""well i feel empty"". It even sounds like i dont have a mental illness and i am just an edgelord who decided to join in.",False,True

Not all people are built for group therapy and the like. I’m not. I’m on the other side of the spectrum- I want to be worse/better than everyone else so I end up making myself sicker to “win”. Solo therapy is sometimes the way that works best for people.   Nothing wrong with giving it a try, though. Might clear these anxieties when you’re actually around these people and see they’re not judging anyone at all and that it’s a place of comfort and camaraderie. Might even make a friend.",False,False

I am planning to go to other meetings instead which are focused on depression in order to make sure that i will minimize the possability of running into somebody with an ED,False,True
