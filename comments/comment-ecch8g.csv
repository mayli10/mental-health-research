To be fair tho I drink wine 99% of the time so it’s not a huge problem but still.,False,False

Maybe she doesn’t quite realise the extent of what happening for you, tbh it sounds like she cares a lot about you but if you have not openly talked to her she can’t guess what’s going on by magic. I totally get your frustration, I’ve found just being upfront helps and if someone doesn’t like it then they aren’t really my friend anyway.   Like legit no shame if I’m being pushed to eat I’ve got no shame now gently reminding people if they keep on asking that “no, I’ve said no please stop asking me, if I eat that It’s likely to make me vomit”   I’m as nice about it as I can be but well meaning people trying to get me to eat have really ticked me up in the past   All the best to you",False,False
