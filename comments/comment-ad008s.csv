We are all here for you and proud of everything you're doing and have done. It can feel lonely but reaching out can be so helpful. Feel free to DM me anytime just to vent or anything.  Hope I'm not being weird or overbearing, I just feel so much empathy for everyone here and want you to continue to heal!!!  Good luck!!",False,False
