You could be super busy, or experience hunger cues differently, or whatever, you do you!   What I have an issue with is my roommate constantly bringing it up in conversation.

But it‚Äôs also important to consider how non disordered people view food.. my (naturally underweight) partner occasionally snacks (sometimes snacking adding up to 300-400 cals) but don‚Äôt consider that ‚Äúeating‚Äù unless there‚Äôs some kind of protein/takes the shape of a traditional meal.

Like, they'll say 'I haven't eaten since breakfast!' but I've been with them all day, and I know they had 5 free samples while out shopping, ate a few Hershey's kisses when they walked in the left over from a party, grabbed a drink from Starbucks while they were out, and then later ordered a soda before dinner.",False,False

It kind of feels better than straight up lying and being like 'oh idk why I feel sick', because the reason I feel sick is because I didn't eat, but the reason I didn't eat isn't because I 'forgot'.  I also do it when people talk about me being thin (I'm not like crazily thin, pretty normal actually, but most people I work with and am friends with happen to be bigger than me) and they ask why I just say I'm one of those people who forgets to eat when they get super busy, and they know I'm super busy working and doing my math studies they don't really question it. Lol, I'm totally not someone that forgets to eat when busy (I actually stress eat or eat to avoid work sometimes) but it kind of does feel better telling a half-truth and admitting the reason is because I don't eat so they don't have some kind of unrealistic expectation that I'm thin and that I eat a normal amount or whatever.   Idk, just some perspective from someone that does this in case it helps you feel less frustrated about it. She might be obsessive about food if she's talking about it all the time. Hope you're feeling ok though! ",False,False
