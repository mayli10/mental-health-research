Then have a very informal (like, jeans and flannel) reception several months later after the “wow” dies down and I’m not “the bride” anymore.   Thanks for listening; I really appreciate it!

But my closest circle of friends/family now just see it as normal and are understanding. Maybe you can settle for a smaller event? ",False,False

Fiancé and I have gone back and forth a dozen times. It’s deeply important for him to celebrate our relationship with a wedding, with everyone he loves there to witness.   We’re even stressing that it’s an “unplugged event” and people are discouraged on the invites (with a reminder during the ceremony) from taking ANY photos. My family is totally on board. But you can’t make 250 listen and I will 100% end up sobbing before the reception.   There are almost zero issues with our relationship aside from this, but I’m still considering counseling just to help him better understand. Not having a wedding would just break his heart.",False,True

I could never participate in any event that required me to be photographed as the center of attention. Quinceañera? NOPE. Wedding? Fuck that.  I stopped performing and studying musical theatre when I was 13 because of the pictures rather than the stage fright (though random panic attacks also conditioned me). Are you sure you still wanna go on with the wedding OP? Because what’s the point if you’re miserable on what is supposed to be a happy day?,False,False

I can look at my face in the mirror, but that's it. I don't wear makeup and just have my hair in a ponytail so I don't have to look for very long. I also dress very conservatively to hide my body. I haven't see my full body in a mirror or photo in years.  Not long ago I went to a wedding, but thankfully I was only in the big group photo and you can only see my face and shoulders because I am tall and was at the back (only thing being tall is good for).  Can't wait to reach my first GW. The first thing I'm going to do is take a full length photo. It will be nice to see the difference since my last full photo. And hopefully because I've avoided looking at myself I will be happy with the difference.  ",False,False
