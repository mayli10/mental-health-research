My dad also suffers from it. He finds it goes away more when he can put on a few pounds. I take a calcium blocker/blood thinner, usually for people with heart problems, and it helps a lot- doctor prescribed of course.",False,False

I think you’re right, I started getting lanugo, so it most likely is just my body being melodramatic. I’ll definitely look into foot warmers and maybe thicker clothes. With the weather changing and the house being chilly the only time I really feel warm is in the bath or shower, even then it’s not the best. My weight still feels average, though the way my family, SO and friends, hell even random people look at me and talk to me it’s probably not as heavy as I think. Lmao it’s weird. I hope your toes feel better! ❤️",False,True

My toes are purple, occasionally verging into black territory on the tips. My toenails are white, like I've painted them. They've been this way for months and months so I'm assuming they're not going to drop off, just bad circulation.",False,False
