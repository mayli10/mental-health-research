And sorry to rant a bit earlier! It's just that I know how demoralizing it is to be turned away when you finally summon the resolve to seek help.   The stereotype about EDs being hard to treat... it's because a lot of ED specialists (my former shrink included) subscribe to the idea, based in clinical research, that a malnourished brain is basically resistant to talk therapy -- that progress can't be made until the brain itself is adequately fueled. That's why some in the field refuse to accept patients under a certain BMI, because they assume that therapy won't be useful if someone is not medically stable and meeting a minimum weight threshold. I understand this argument intellectually and I know it's based on data, but it seems like a really unhelpful standard to demand that patients *gain weight* before offering them emotional support. I mean, really?!  I really commend you for seeking help and I hope this psychologist in January respects you enough to meet you where you're at right now. Tbh, I think even the action of going through with calling people up, persisting when you run into roadblocks, and moving forward with the intention of exploring therapy is a really positive thing in and of itself. Best wishes to you!  &amp;#x200B;",False,False

I‚Äôm sorry for what you went through with those therapists, at least the ones I was trying to work with were polite.   I‚Äôve made an appointment for mid-January with a psychologist that I‚Äôm tentatively optimistic about; the only problem is that I‚Äôm not actually depressed at all haha, my only problems with mood are when my ED stresses me out. Still, hopefully she‚Äôll let me just sit there and talk to her for an hour a week without trying to force other treatments on me!  I hope you‚Äôve had better luck with therapy since you went through that. I think it‚Äôs so bizarre that there are so many of us who desperately want to try *something* to improve our situations but the people who are supposed to help us refuse to unless it‚Äôs on their terms, when the stereotype is so often that eating disorder sufferers are the hardest to treat. We‚Äôre not hard to treat, we just want to be treated like people instead of illnesses!   ",False,True

I had a psychologist and dietitian who worked closely together. I saw them for two years in my early twenties, when I was struggling with major depressive disorder and EDNOS but was still on the verge of a healthy weight.  I started seeing them both again many years later when I was diagnosed with a chronic GI disease, depressed, and losing weight after a breakup. My intent was actually just to treat the depression, but obviously food was a problem, too. At one point, the therapist tried to bully me into gaining by telling me that ""most clinicians"" would refuse to work with someone of my weight on an outpatient basis for liability reasons.  That therapist ended up dumping me over voicemail when I was 15 minutes late to an appointment because I was stuck in traffic. She invited me to come back ""when I could commit to treatment,"" but otherwise assumed I was just flaking and decided to go ahead and cancel all my sessions. Bitch.  Anyway... I'm sorry I don't have much useful advice to offer. The only thing I can say is that I've had some success finding non-ED therapists who are willing to work with me if I go in claiming depression and anxiety as my primary issues (which isn't totally a lie, it's just that food and weight are how those things manifest). Hoping you've had some better luck since posting.  &amp;#x200B;",False,False

Yeah, it was really awkward, and what made it worse was that over email he had told me he like to do ninety minute sessions the first time he meets with someone so there‚Äôs enough time to get a decent history, etc. So I was stuck there with this clown for an hour and a half üòÇ  Yeah, plus I understand that girls who actually want to get better deserve the spaces in those programs, it‚Äôs not really fair for me to take up a slot when I don‚Äôt really want to even think about ‚Äúgetting better‚Äù yet, I just want to talk.

And you‚Äôre right about how so many people can call themselves therapists without really knowing what they‚Äôre doing (case in point: the first dude I tried to see haha).   My SO added me to the waitlist of one of the specialists he really admired while he was doing all his research but I don‚Äôt think she has an opening until March so I‚Äôm really hoping I can at least find someone to fill the gap between then and now. I suppose the problem is that I‚Äôm not really interested in recovering, but most of these specialists don‚Äôt want to work with you unless you‚Äôre committed, which I can understand.

I'm sorry that happened when you were being brave and seeking help. I'm sorry that you are having so many road blocks despite putting in so much effort.   I totally understand why you want to start slow/on your terms. On one hand, it makes sense that you might have better luck looking into people who don't specialize with Eating Disorders (because your optimal/preferred method wont be in line with the treatment they will want to provide)... but on the other hand I guess you run the risk of making other professionals feel out-of-their-depth...  I deal with a similar issue: I've never felt like any of my therapy has lined up very well to treat any of my actual issues. This has been because I have only ever experienced a miss-match in what kind of effort I put into it vs what kind of helpful effort the therapist have put into it if that makes sense? Like sometimes I am not honest with them but I've also had mostly useless therapists.

I understand it's a huge hurdle to overcome, and it must be really exasperating for you to be trying all these options that don't seem to go anywhere. I think focusing on finding a more general therapist is a good idea, but another thing to think about is if you want to join one of those waiting lists in the mean time. Although waiting for so long sucks, it implies to me that those person's services are more in-demand, hopefully for good reason.

Many are residential so they can focus on weight restoration, but also do intensive group and individual therapy.  And while they require weighing for monitoring, they do it blind so you won't have that information. Also, as for the competition piece, when I was at residential this past May I was concerned about that as well. The patients were there from a wide range of eating disorders and sizes and we all had our own individual meal plans and exchanges. I had no idea what plan so and so was on or what have you. When I went to php it was a little different because they gave each range of calories a city name and were forthcoming with the fact that NYC had less calories than Boston and such.  &amp;#x200B;  I agree that inpatient probably wouldn't be helpful as I would guess that you need more focused treatment and not just a holding space for a few days. As for the one who made promises and then took them back, I think part of this is her ethical and legal responsibility.
