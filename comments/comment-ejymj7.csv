As u/here4thesadmemes explained, there’s a lot of overlap between EDs and OCD, plus many people with OCD can achieve significant improvements in symptoms with help from medication and therapy. Actual changes in brain function have been documented with fMRIs. The place I went to for a mood disorder residential program had another residential program specifically for OCD. So it’s not hopeless or ‘unfixable’ for them either, which your friend seemed to be implying. There’s enough hope to go around :)",False,False

I have mild OCD, and I definitely feel like my eating issues have made it worse. Also, there are lots of things than can help with OCD and make it less debilitating. I don’t think it’s fair for your friend to say that about a group of mental illnesses that have the highest mortality rate of all mental illnesses.  Edit: also the thing your friend said about being able to “fix” your ED is so stupid, like does he not realize that a huge part of many EDs is that your brain tries to sabotage recovery attempts?? There’s a reason people relapse a lot, I feel like eating disorders almost function like addiction and while it’s always possible to recover, it’s still really damn hard.",False,False
