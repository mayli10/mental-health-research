I oscillate between wanting to increase my calories (just to see how high I can apparently go and maintain) or decrease them (to finally drop some more weight). big tw for numbers ahead: I decided for some reason I just need to see my weight drop into the 80s, and now i’m obsessed with the idea. Buttttttt I know if I go there and lose these last 3-5 pounds to get there, I’ll want to maintain there and i KNOW how bad that would be for my body (esp with the extra 3-5 pounds I’d then wanna lose as”buffer” lmao).",False,True
