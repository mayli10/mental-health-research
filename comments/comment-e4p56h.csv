To me, it‚Äôs easier when I don‚Äôt count. I hate feeling so stressed/neurotic and fixated on the number, and it gives me this facade of normality, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just forgetting to eat.‚Äù It‚Äôs more about feeling empty, as long as I keep that up, the days pass in a comforting yet apathetic muddle.",False,False

It was awfully sweet, so I'd better mentally account for it as being 1500 calories and not eat for the rest of the day because I'm an overindulgent fatass. Whereas, if I know that it's exactly 450 calories, I know that I still have 550 to go before my limit, so I'll eat up to that point and then go further because I can mentally reassure myself that, sure, I'm a little above maintenance, but I know exactly how much I am over, so I rationalize.",False,False

And occasionally I try to get into counting, but it never lasts long. I *know* they're what matters for weight loss, but they're too abstract and I don't care. I just look at the bulk/mass of what I eat, think vaguely about the salt/carbs and think about how it might make me hold more water weight (don't actually check sodium or carbs, just sort of think about it), and above all obsess over dayly or hourly changes on the scale.

And I don't think it's very accurate anyway.     The serving size in most sources are quite different to what I eat (always variable) and they seem to often conflict each other and seem ridiculous to me often. So it gets hella confusing.  Also if you cook your own food you know how much variation/uncertainty there can be in the ingredients you use when actually making any recipe. I suppose if one sticks to processed food with labels it would be a little easier. But that doesn't seem healthy.  Hah! look at me talk about healthy while obsessing over loosing weight and targeting a stupid number.  I don't know how people do it.",False,False
