Now I'm in the worst relapse I've ever had and they all know but I'm an adult so they don't care",False,False

They think I'm recovered now and because of that friend I became extremely secretive.",False,False

At this point they know they cannot control me or fix me so they are just supportive of me improving and cutting down on it. ",False,False

My mother snuck downstairs after dinner one night, while I was purging, and used some kind of stick to open the locked bathroom door. I had already finished and was cleaning up, but back then I was not as careful or efficient.  She barged into the bathroom and asked me what the fuck I was doing. I lied obviously, and so she smelled my (freshly swished with mouthwash) breath. Then she lifted up the toilet seat and saw some red stains on the side of the bowl, because I had drank a red crystal light beforehand.   She yelled at me for cheating and wasting her money on expensive drink mix, and then for leaving a mess on the toilet. She said someone who was really sick and not just doing it for attention would’ve cleaned up the toilet better ",False,False

I just said I wasn't feeling well. Don't know if they'd believe me again,  so I've been trying to purge more quietly. I honestly have no idea how I'd react if they found out. ",False,False

I’m just really impressed that you moved across the country that’s some serious dedication.  My parents have never found out my sister knew for awhile and she kind of made me eat but I would cook for both her and I and she didn’t know the calories of things so I would make us both soup and just put like cabbage in mine and meat and other stuff in hers.  And I’d do other things to hide my intake and behaviors.  I wasn’t that embarrassed with her it just was a minor inconvince but she was a teen and understood keeping it from parents.  It’s actually easier to fool family members than you think because if they haven’t been through it on know the signs they won’t pick up on the smaller stuff.,False,False
