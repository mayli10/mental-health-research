You clearly have disordered eating from the low calories you're consuming. But in no way what you're doing is normal. Your brain uses 20% of your total calories, which on a normal intake would equal around 300-500 calories. 1200cals is the bare minimum anyone should eat, and that's to fuel your body just for existing.  Like you said, you can't sustain such a low intake. And don't believe everything that everyone posts. Social media is warped to show the best version of ourselves, so these fasters likely have tough moments, but they're not going to tell you that because they want to encourage people to fast, which isn't appropriate for everyone.  I would encourage you to seek help, and potentially find another dietician who is more competent at their job. The last thing you want is for this behaviour to spiral out of control and have your life stolen by these disorders. No amount of weight loss is worth it.",False,False
