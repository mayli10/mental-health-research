Almost to a t, honestly. I’m very sorry you struggle with this too. I hear you loud and clear and it is not fun. I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy. Your positivity is something I admire!! We can persist! I’m always a PM away if you’re ever drowning too much.",False,True

I was diagnosed last February and still struggle today. I look at pictures pre-diagnosis when I was undergoing severe DKA  (didn't know about it till I was in the ICU) and sometimes wish I had that body again, that sick body with blood sugars over 700 and acidic blood with my organs slowly dying, but god I was the skinniest I had been since post-puberty. I miss that sometimes because that was when people were worried about me being too thin and the goal was to gain weight. I tried to maintain my weight around 105-110 but my body was too hungry. I felt so ashamed for gaining more weight than I was pre-DKA (I was around 120-125 beforehand but am currently 135 last time I checked). I had struggled with EDNOS, almost anorexic, prior to diagnosis and hadn't weighed myself in over two years so counting carbs wasn't too bad, but sometimes I wished I was counting calories instead. The last time I weighed myself at my last endo appointment and I'm still too scared to look at the scale.  It hurt when I gained back my weight, and more, and my family (I am east Asian, so being thicc isn't appreciated) members began poking fun and commenting how big I became. I hated it. My mom still comments on my size sometimes. Or they look at my legs which have gotten fatter and worry that it's swelling due to improper blood glucose management but in reality, it was the weight I gained back. It's hard not to eat between meal times or injection times. It hurt when some of my clothes that fit me earlier no longer fit. I hurts when the shorts cling tighter or when the elastic hugs my waist more than it did before. Sometimes I end up binging and I don't want to take my insulin but I'm too much of a pussy to give myself diabulimia, and that's honestly a blessing in disguise. Or sometimes, I don't want to poke and prod myself, stick needles into the fat I hate so much on my body, so I stay in bed and don't eat so I won't have to. The holiday season this year was hard because I was home away from college and surrounded by delicious, yet high carb, food, meaning more insulin.   It's not easy but I've been getting better. I try my best to lose weight in a healthy way, exercising more to take less insulin. Eating more vegetables, the only thing that is low calorie and low carb, but it's not easy. I can't wait to get back to my dorm, but part of me is glad to go back so I can keep myself busy and not snack.  It's an ongoing struggle. Dealing with disordered eating and chronic disease is not easy, but I have dreams, goals that I want to achieve and to do that I know I have to take care of myself. I am trying my best, and I know I don't have to keep fighting alone. I know what you're going through and I know we can persist. I believe in us.",False,False

I'm type 1, and restricted insulin for almost two decades, and slipped back into it last month, and not only does it not \*work\* after a while -- you have to do it longer to still lose weight, and it never stays off -- but I've also got eye damage to boot.",False,False

I just want to say, please be careful. I had a friend that struggled with the same for a long time and probably still does.
