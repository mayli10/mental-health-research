Even though I don’t plan on recovering any time soon I’m here if you need to talk! I’ve recovered before if you need someone to relate to!,False,False

I’m happy to hear you’re making strides towards better health and taking care of yourself &lt;3 You know what’s best for you and your well being and it makes me happy knowing you’re doing it in a healthier way. You are doing it the best way for your body right now and what your body needs! You have this mapped out and it’s a great strategy for your health - DONT let these people make you doubt what you’re doing. You know what’s strange? People don’t wanna see you do better than them! My own mother (who’s actually very young and not like most moms, she’s more like a sister) got kind of “fake concerned” when she saw me last time, “WOW, ARE YOU STARVING YOURSELF?” so loud on purpose in front of all these people that know me in the lobby of my building which was so entirely embarrassing. I work my ass off, maybe I kind of do “starve myself” in normie terms but don’t throw all my hard work out the window and make me out to be some crazy person in front of all these people. They don’t see me running miles everyday and lifting weights and all my intense workouts. then recently she came by to bring all this food and told my boyfriend to make sure I’m eating. I’m not even anywhere near underweight. I’m 5’4 139 lbs. I was 199 lbs about 10 months ago. She’s trying to lose weight herself (she’s like 5’3 / 150 lbs) after recovering from alcoholism, dealing with her heart failure and all these schizophrenia and other mental meds she’s on, depression and anxiety.. she’s on so so many and they led to fluid retention and weight gain. I helped her make healthier choices and change her lifestyle so she can come off some of the unnecessary ones like blood pressure and depression which was due to her poor diet and inactivity. She’s now a health guru yoga chick after hanging out with me a lot and picking up on my habits, she went from couch potato near her young death in a total zombie state to getting a gym membership and wearing makeup and only eating fresh real food and actually being a real human and a better mom to my baby sisters. She went ice skating with me recently. She used to not even move from the couch to even shower for days or change my poor baby sisters diapers. Standing up for more than a minute used to be like asking the world of this woman. Now she’s up doing things and actually human.  I spoil her completely, buy her facial serums and expensive makeup and exercise stuff and healthy foods/vitamins all the time. However, she plays fake concern a lot and tells my uncle and other relatives I’m starving myself yet she’s picked up on a lot of my habits and is now healthier than she’s ever been. It’s really strange. I think society’s idea of health is so warped. When you’re bigger they secretly want you to stay bigger so you can make them look good. So when you try to lose weight they’re like oh, uh, no you’re fine the way you are! don’t do that! Cause when you’re skinnier than them they panic because the tables have turned and they don’t wanna be bigger than you. Especially in your case, because you went from skinny to gaining a little weight, they know that you can easily go back to your body because you’re fully capable, and they know what you looked like, and they were most likely envious of you and your body! They want you to keep this weight and try to tell you what’s best for you so that you can keep gaining weight and make them look good. It’s so fucked up I know, but this has been proven on so many occasions in my life! My family was so used to me being the little chubby girl to make fun of (I was chubby cause I was neglected and left home alone for weeks on end and had to take care of baby sisters around my psychotic mom on drugs trying to kill us) (she got her kids taken away for these things) and now I’m a thin young woman who’s starting to look better than my mom (which is a big deal in my family cause she was a model in Russia) and I can see in the way she acts it kind of... scares her :/ meanwhile I do so much and give so much to her and she’s always at our house and I take care of her and all her needs! Pay for her classes, bills, groceries, etc....and I’m 20 years old. She’s 39. Bizarre. She even spread a rumor I was on “weight loss pills”. and when I addressed her on it her response was “well, are you?” Like cmon are you serious. You see me work my ass off. What went from being me trying to change my mothers life for the better so she can survive and not die of heart failure has turned into a competition of who looks better in her mind.  Keep doing what you’re doing! You are doing this the healthiest, best way you can. I’m so proud of you for putting you and your health first.  Next time someone says something don’t even respond! Nod and smile, or just say “thanks.” If they keep talking, just say, “my doctor recommended this, thanks.”  Good luck darling I’m praying for you and your health &amp; well being :) 💛",False,False
