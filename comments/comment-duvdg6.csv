There happens to be one in my uni accomodation (which I was using in the room it's in, but noticed the floor was dodgy lino when it was screwing me around, so now I weigh myself thrice: in there, on the firm, thin carpet in the corridor and on the hard stone further down the corridor. Yay three times the brain fuckery!) and yeah so I realise I should just be using it on the stone (but that's in an open space and Im always scared someone will go past) but how do I do the calibration? I think that would help",False,False
