That‚Äôs why I just have to stick to my low cal diet for only one or two more weeks and I‚Äôll be able to maintain!  Thanks so much for ur advice &lt;3",False,True

It might take a little longer to lose five pounds, but it will be easier to get to maintainence after. Good luck!",False,False

You had one bad day, punishing yourself for the next few days isn't going to help. Just try relaxing, make sure to eat a proper amount of food and drink plenty of water.  Please, don't go to extremes just to rectify a bad day. Sometimes it's not the goals that we want to reach that are important, but the journey we take to reach them.  Trust someone who knows, that even if you fall a bit short of your goal, but you try to reach it in a healthy way. That is what truly shows you growth as a person, not some silly goal.",False,False
