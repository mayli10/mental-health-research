Although I get where you're coming from, you can absolutely have a debilitating, diagnosable ED without being underweight. Especially because the girl in the thread didn't even say she had anorexia, which is the only ED with a weight requirement for diagnosis.  My roommate was diagnosed with atypical anorexia at a similar BMI, she was 5'7 and 120lbs. She was around 180lbs less than 6 months earlier and had been eating nothing but iced coffee and a small bowl of dry cereal every day while walking everywhere and working two active jobs. Thankfully, her ED was diagnosed before she became severely underweight and she's now in recovery and maintaining around 135lbs. Is her experience invalid to you because she was never severely underweight and didn't have to do inpatient? Should she not celebrate her progress and be proud of her recovery?",False,False

I do feel a bit compelled to apologize, but I also feel with certainty that this person was making it up so I guess I’ll just live and learn and not do that to someone again",False,True

But I do agree with you that those 'pity porn' type posts can be annoying and disingenuous. It's a complicated thing, ya know, because obv if someone's lying about an ED for karma that's fucked and I'm sure people do that, but we can't go around pretending like we can somehow know a stranger's very complex inner life and mental health issues just from a post on Reddit.",False,False

If healthy people are claiming to be ill, when ill people purport to be ill no one sees it as a big deal- because it wasn’t a big deal to any of those healthy people saying they have it.   I don’t know. I like that it’s all getting destigmatized enough that we’re even having this conversation but the flip side of it seems like a slippery slope we’re heading down where people don’t know the difference between being sad and depressed, eating too much at dinner and binging, forgetting a meal when they’re busy and anorexia. And I really don’t like people using it for karma/attention. I feel like it devalues legitimate experiences. It’s just hard to see it all over reddit all the time- and ofc some of these people are legitimately ill and some are not",False,True
eimoth7,t3_b1m4ir,t3_b1m4ir,3cats_in_atrenchcoat,1,2019-03-15 19:31:47,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/b1m4ir/ed_mental_illness_and_upvotes/eimoth7/,I try hard not to devalue other people's experiences. It can be very frustrating as someone that suffers from a fun mixing pot of mental illnesses to see people who are clearly trying to use it as a pity party or excuse for attention. However Something I recognize is that if someone is going to that length as an attention seeking behaviour that's indicative of an issue unto itself.   In situations like that I try and hold back. Generally calling people out is only going to lead down a bad road. Who knows maybe a person exaggerates their situation or is completely making something up but it's not my place to say. If we foster a culture where that is the response to mental illness it can turn to backlash and devaluing the suffering of those that truly do need support.    That isn't to say I think the behaviour of exploiting mental illness is okay at all. I can completely understand your reaction.,False,False
