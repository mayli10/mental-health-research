One thing that really got me out of the binge-purge-fast cycle was having breakfast, lunch, an afternoon snack, and a dinner each day. That way I wasnâ€™t craving food constantly but also never really planning or thinking about exactly when I would next eat, because it was just matter of fact.",False,False

I just finished setting up my home office so Iâ€™m going to try to work from home more. ðŸ¤žðŸ¤žðŸ¤žðŸ¤žðŸ¤ž hopefully getting away from it helps.,False,True

That seems really unfair. For example, extra weight is bad for joints, so you have to suffer some of the consequences of what could be fixed because of an illness that society probably had a part in causing, and is partially genetic, etc etc . Anyway, seems like a stupid rule to me but I'm not that type of doctor so who knows. Is there a way to get out of the work food stuff? You're not required to eat stuff people bring in - can you set some boundaries?",False,False
