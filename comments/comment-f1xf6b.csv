With occasionally sharp little zaps? Normally it’s on the inside of my lower jaw, like the gum area below the teeth and down to the bottom of my jawline?   I think it’s from jaw tension/teeth grinding, it normally happens when I’m fasting/haven’t eaten for a while. Electrolyte tablets help me (although I think electrolyte powder in water is supposed to be healthier for your stomach, but I really hate gross tasting drinks and lbr my health is pretty low of my risk of priorities)",False,False

Now that I think about it, I also clench/grind my teeth in my sleep (my dentist gave me a mouth guard for that) and on days that I b/p and get that jaw tension, I think it's the combo of the clenching/grinding as well as the b/p that makes that jaw tension happen more painfully",False,False
