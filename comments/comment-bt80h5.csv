I don‚Äôt mean this in a conceited way, but I have a nice face.  I‚Äôve been told 846268 times by old people that I look like Grace Kelly.   But it doesn‚Äôt matter. Because you know what also sucks? Being fat Grace Kelly sucks. Being Grace Kelly but with cankles sucks. Being Grace Kelly with a huge ass sucks.

My eyes really bother me -- deep-set and close together. At my heaviest nobody would have EVER said ""she has such a pretty face, if only she were thinner."" My face does look better now, but honestly I think most of my attractiveness comes from my slender frame. Unfortunately, I'm at an age when losing more weight means looking older in the face, so I've had to start using injectables (lightly, to look natural) in order to combat it.",False,False

We are our harshest critics and so we view ourselves as unattractive and that makes us want to control our bodies since we can‚Äôt control our face (unless you wanna get plastic surgery). someone once told me to forgive myself for having those thoughts. Even if it isn‚Äôt ‚Äúreal‚Äù, those feelings exist and it‚Äôs valid to have them. So even though sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm hideous and have terrible skin and eczema all over my arms, I need to just accept my feelings and treat them as real so I can address them properly.  Also, I have some gorgeous friends who struggle with disordered eating too. They view themselves as so ugly and gross even though they are praised a lot. How we look doesn‚Äôt matter much at the end of the day, it‚Äôs how we feel inside. If we spend time wishing ‚Äúwell if I was pretty I wouldn‚Äôt have an ED‚Äù. We have to accept what we can‚Äôt control, and try to address the underlying causes for our incessant need to control our bodies.",False,False
