But I had a weird moment yesterday when I was walking through a glass tunnel in an airport. I looked at my reflection almost ALL the way through the tunnel. Then I looked at the girl in front of me and she just??? Stared straight in front of her like excuse me but!!! There was so much potential to look at your reflection but she didn't and it totally blew my mind. But I thought that maaaybe she was weird for not looking at her reflection but if what she did is totally normal for most people then consider my mind blown,False,False

But it really hit me just how obsessive I am about it when I was showering yesterday and realised the new shower head is practically a mirror. I think I spent more time looking at myself than I did actually showering.,False,False
