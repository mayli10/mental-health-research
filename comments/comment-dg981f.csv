Or for me Red Lobster is my ultimate safe restaurant bc seafood is rlly healthy and they have a decent amount of low cal options. Almost every restaurant has nutritional value online though !!,False,False

You can also get the low carb cheesecake or strawberries with whipped cream (it's on the side), if you get pressured into doing a b-day dessert.",False,False

I am would maybe recommend a local restaurant that you like and can research the menu for - maybe a nice Italian or Mediterranean place that has good salads, or a tapas-style place where you can control your portions.   On my birthday I went to Bartaco, which has really small tacos that you can get on a lettuce wrap. If there are options like that in your area maybe that could work! Although I totally get the need to be in control/not get carried away, I hope you do enjoy your birthday even if that means a few extra calories!",False,False
