I have a role reversed relationship, so on days where I am sore, look lean and muscular, and fasting I'm happy. However, if I am bloated due to my endometriosis, Depo shots, periods, etc, I start freaking out because I feel like a fat, not masculine, not feminine girl.",False,False

The destructive gender identity crossover is *so fucking real.* Sucks that all of our brains are determined to make all of this weird.  It's pretty twisted - but what if a good way to get a look at one's real gender, if you're ever uncertain, is what you feel more like when you're buzzing on restriction?  I get it. I feel a lot more...like myself, when I'm lean and hungry.",False,False

Then there's how illnesses like TB were completely romanticised and the waifish, subordinate ideal was a thing that was written about and lusted after.   I think, possibly... Don't ask me for sources!",False,False

When I'm ""heavier"" (aka a normal weight) I feel like a gross, unfeminine creature and I can't ever wear things I like. If I eat a ton of food; I feel like a growing teenage boy.   If I restrict, then I feel all light and ""delicate."" About the media thing, there is definitely the ""butterfly anorexic girl"" stereotype. Think Cassie from Skins.",False,False
