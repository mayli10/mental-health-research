Thats why that part of the comment is in there if you look at my other comment about it in another part of the three or in my post history you can see more about it. It was and continues to be a relevant part of my everyday life seeking assistance and treatment for it when its been spread so thin and the necessary lengths needed to go into about what I mean when I use the word assault is much more than what the word assault used to mean. Im not saying that ptsd is invalid, but that it does deserve different treatment. The resources and abilities of these clinics and centers are limited and have not grown or changed to accommodate the change in what societal requirement are for them.",False,True

And honestly? They're just crap. Like I cant imagine one doctor that would give the exact same meal to plan to every patient in an ED clinic, let alone a 15 BMI versus 33 BMI patient.  Also as someone who has PTSD from sexual abuse, I dont appreciate that part of the comment. Sure, someone doesnt get real PTSD from a crowded grocery store, but any event a brain registers as traumatic can cause PTSD and that PTSD is still valid",False,False

Ive been downvoted, upvoted and sent private PM's over this saying I am an exclusive person.  Those are all whatever but it seems to be really hard to get a discussion about the topic on if normal-obese BMI people could have anorexia specifically.   A number of the comments on this post show that the only people who have a strong opinion of it are of the mindset that it is the mental state that determines if someone has anorexia or not. What I want to know is what that effect has on the possible change to people who are the 'typical' anorexic person. Does that invalidate them in some way by watering down the severity of their diagnosis? Does this mean that resources used for the 'typical' anorexic person should be expanded to include the a-typical anorexic person who is not at an unhealthy BMI?   A lot of people have been vocal of the mental state but haven't addressed any other questions that come from that one. It is hard and awkward to answer for sure, but I am curious of the answers people come up with.",False,True

It doesn't sound like anorexia, but, I'm also not an expert.

The OP I was referencing was specifically referencing anorexia and her fears of being at a 500 calorie deficit total during her lowest calorie times at 1200 cal a day with no exercise at that time.

Thats too hard line and im more generally curious. If you had those same thoughts and didn't eat at a calorie deficit maybe even ate over your maintenance or burned calories so that you steadily gained weight, because your thought life didn't change would you still be anorexic?

Im not knowledgeable on the subject and just have more questions in another comment. I still haven't gotten any answers to them although I have asked.

Anorexia is about your mindset, not how much you eat. Like, at my worst I was eating around 500 calories per day, but I was still anorexic at 1200 calories per day and I'm still anorexic now that I'm ready to recover and eating even more. Even if I'm a lot better now, not really experiencing body dysmorphia anymore, I still have those thoughts from time to time that I'm not thin enough or that I don't need to be eating as much as I do. I know they're bullshit now and don't let them effect my behaviour, but the problem is still there. Even if I eventually do manage to get back to a healthy weight the risk of relapsing will still always be there.

I am not anorexic and don't claim to be.

I think its harmful to people who actually are. if you are passionately on the other end of the spectrum with how you feel I really would appreciate hearing about it.

And it is 100% not her personally that is bothersome to me im sure she is wonderful and she seems to have a really sweet personality. But for a recap, I have some really disordered and restrictive habits of my own that I don't want to recognize as unhealthy. This is probably a result of my own fears and emotions coming out sideways from an attack I had a while back. (also might not be that but its caused some traumatic backlash so its my best guess)   I might also have gotten a poor taste in my mouth from that post because it reminds me of when people throw around words that have or are supposed to have a bold meaning and that gets watered down from mis use of the term. this isn't limited to things ED related but more generic. Like when people throw around assault over really trivial things it waters down what I mean when I say I was assaulted. When I say it I mean I was drugged raped and tortured for days in a place with no cell signal or major roads in a state I didn't have anyone in by my employer and long time family friend. However needing to make the distinction in explaining that is sucky. And that distinction is more frequently asked for because of people who are using it for things like they were looked at in an offensive way.

She absolutely had her own reasons for her post and fears absolutely this is true.   My post is over the actions she states about taking don't seem to line up with the actions that someone who suffers from an ED take.   There is no extreme working out, no binging, no purging, no compulsive restrictions on types of food, (there is a restriction of certain types of food to opt to a more balanced diet for carbs protein and vegetables ) no unhealthy levels of calorie restriction, no unhealthy goal weights.  The behavior used to reach a safe weight loss goal over a safe period of time is incredibly healthy and rational for someone who was in an overweight BMI category and wants to move into a normal BMI category.  My only issue is if the behaviors and results of those behaviors are that of a normal person losing weight at a steady consistent safe pace of under a pound a week.   With all that being considered, using set and determined disorders as a description for the person practicing those healthy normal rational behaviors is incorrect.   However, if Anorexia is not a physically determined, behaviorally based disorder. and instead is a disorder based solely on the feelings and not actions of a person. Does that change the definition of someone who is anorexic? Does that change the meaning of anyone who is fasting to being someone who is anorexic if they are fasting for weight loss reasons?

They're all related and can overlap but still, seperate issues. It's good she was aware she might be slipping towards these patterns and is seeking to fix it- many people don't realize it and slip further and further.   With the issue of disordered eating, you can engage in these behaviors at any calorie intake, weight, or mental wellness level. when I was 250+ lbs I averaged about 1900 calories / day. That's a healthy intake, right? Outwardly I seemed fine, and I didn't think it was so big of a deal. I was over-exercising and not eating balanced nutritious meals, obsessing about calorie counts and operating at a huge caloric deficit I felt awful all the time. I became fearful of bread. I became fearful of cookies. I stopped enjoying food and it became the enemy. Disordered eating can be the beginning of an eating disorder- it doesn't have to be but often is. It's the obsession with numbers, with weight, changing your eating habits drastically, and causing mental distress. People experience disorder eating in many different ways. Disordered eating is a problem.   Eating disorders are when disordered eating spirals out of control. They can really only be diagnosed by a doctor, but one can recognize these behaviors in oneself. I developed my eating disorder after I realized my eating habits were interfering with my everyday life. I avoided social outings. I cried in the bathroom of restaurants because they didnt have the calorie information. I started fasting regularly. I didn't go to the gym because I liked it anymore, I went to watch the calories burned on the machine go up and up and up and still only counted half because they obviously over calculate. Eating disorders come in many forms, anorexia, binge eating, EDNOS, orthrexia, etc. Eating Disorders are a problem.   Anorexia is a mental illness with very specific symptoms and thresholds you can google. It is a type of eating disorder that almost always starts off with a form of disordered eating and then gets worse and worse and worse. Anorexia has the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric illness. This is alarming. Anorexia is a problem.   I'd suggest doing some reaearch into the statistics of it all. As someone with an eating disorder, it's very sobering, and these behaviors aren't one-size-fits-all diseases of self vanity- there are wildly varying degrees and factors that manifest themselves into people experiencing disordered eating and eating disorders.",False,False
