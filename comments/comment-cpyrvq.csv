I need to work on asserting that with my own parents and partner as well but it can be so difficult. My partner can be worse than my parents sometimes. I know it's 100000% out of love so it's really hard for me to say no when it comes to food, but it leads to so much anxiety for me later on.

I'm being hypocritical here by telling you not to worry, but at the end of the day, the impact of a few days of eating is not a large one.
