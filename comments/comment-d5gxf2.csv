It will eventually make you eat less 'cause eating will literally be painful so yeah maybe you lose some weight but it's a gatherer for cellulite, liquids and circolatory problems so not worth it. Also the marks on the body, red stripes all over the core all the time.",False,False

I wanna say it helped but I was also working out 7 days a week and eating super clean, so... it was probably that more than anything.  But I also wouldn't wear one all day every day, you really need good circulation in your midsection for digestion/etc.",False,False
