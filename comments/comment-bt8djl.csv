I just remember the news story being a quite popular at the time, not sure what kind of study it was, I probably should’ve looked into it.",False,False

I'm having trouble finding the studies behind the articles when I Google about it. They have the claim that   &gt;A review of studies found no proof that common over-the-counter drugs help with your cough  And a few different ""experts"" who they've quoted, but lack of evidence does not mean they don't work. I'm wondering what the evidence they've looked for is?   I can tell you, when my husband has a persistent cough, and can't sleep because he is coughing so much, a dose of  nyquil stops his cough enough for him to sleep, and maybe it is just the fact it make you drowsy.  I've also taken an expectorant and had better luck coughing up the phlem. Obviously that's not scientific evidence, but again I can't actually find the ""studies""  I think the biggest take away is not to over use them, and don't expect it to be a cure. Just like tylenol can lower your fever, does not mean the virus/bacteria causing the fever is gone. Those things generally need to run their course or (sometimes) be treated with antibiotics. It's the difference between treating symptoms and treating the cause.",False,False

There are 2 types of cough medications readily available otc: suppressants(or antitussives) and expectorant.  The supresent helps reduce the bodies cough reflex, this helps when you need to sleep, or when you're coughing so hard it hurts. The expectorant helps ""loosen up"" congestion in your lungs making it easier to cough up.  When I was a medication aide the nurses I worked with highly preferred the expectorant to the antitussive, but both have their place imo.",False,False
