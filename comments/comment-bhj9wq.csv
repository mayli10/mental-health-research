I read your comment above about still loving him and not wanting to leave. I totally understand that as well. I thought I still ""loved"" my ex up until 1 month before our wedding, when I literally packed a bag and left. I know it is EXTREMELY DIFFICULT to recognize that you're in a toxic relationship when A. you've been in it for so many years, and B. you're in the depths of an eating disorder. It is always difficult to objectively look at your relationship, but ED brain makes it even more difficult. I'm not telling you to do one thing or another, but I do sincerely encourage you to look critically at why exactly you're hanging on to someone who you said you don't think would care about a serious issue you're dealing with. I wish all the best for you, and feel free to DM me if you just want support or someone to talk to.",False,False

I almost feel like he misses when I was skinnier and would ‚Äúdiet‚Äù (restrict to 500-800 daily) so he‚Äôs upset that now I‚Äôve developed a binge ED. (He had no clue about my restricting) which I feel even if he did know he wouldn‚Äôt care and would somewhat encourage the ED. I‚Äôm really sorry that happened to you and I will definitely try to reach out again when I gain the courage.,False,True

I was very into fitness and climbing in particular at that time, so he told me I was overreacting, that it's ***normal*** *for climbers to \*starve themselves\** because the lighter you are the easier it is to climb. But disordered eating runs rampant through the climbing community (athletic community in general). But from that point forward he would just get defensive and downright mean whenever I tried to address it. It was a toxic relationship to begin with (which, deep down, I knew), but that really made me start questioning things. I hope you can either find a way to get through with him (which probably won't happen because he sounds like an ignorant asshole) or dump him ASAP and get yourself the help you need. I know telling anyone is embarrassing and scary, but it will be worth it once you have the support of loved ones, who actually care about your health and well-being.",False,False
