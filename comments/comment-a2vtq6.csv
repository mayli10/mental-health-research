Before thanksgiving I was 117, binged my ass off for a week, came back home and weighed almost 130. Most of the water weight went away the night I came back but I’ve been hovering around 120-122 for the past 2 weeks. I’ve been trying to fast for a couple of days before finals but it’s so fucking hard and I know I shouldn’t be doing this but I was so close to 115 and I fucked it up.   Anyway, water weight sucks, but it’s temporary. Worst case you gained /maybe/ a couple of pounds, although that would require a decent surplus. Just wait it out. ❤️",False,False

It's so much more than people realize (where the heck does it go? Where does it stay?) Which is why you lose SO much weight in the first 3 days of fasting, literally your body is dumping water that it no longer needs for digestion in the lower intestine. I do OMAD fasting and weigh myself at various times a day for fun and I can literally tell when the water is hanging out doing the digesting, then when it leaves my body bc (sorry tmi warning) I know that I have to poop right after all that extra peeing. Like I ate tons of snacks on friday/Saturday, gained like 5 pounds, then just now tonight had a poop and reweighed and I'm back to original weight from Thursday. It's wild! Don't freak out - your body is just doin its thang",False,False

I definitely don’t think I ate 4-5000 a day, but I definitely stuffed more into my mouth than I should’ve.",False,True

I gained 10lbs over thanksgiving! I'm actually now down below where I was. I know you are scared bc the water weight has stuck but I doubt you ate 35,000+ calories extra over the last 14 days. That would be like 4-5000 a day! ",False,False
