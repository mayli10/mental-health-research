In fact it's sort of really important to me that people know that there can be other ways of getting eating disorders. I only ever heard of anorexia and bulimia growing up, completely unaware that EDNOS exists, and... That was my entire life, struggling with something, something that behaved just like anorexia, but without anything having to do with body image, but instead, a fear of scarcity that has just snowballed and snowballed and snowballed into something else.  I definitely want people to be aware that eating disorders aren't all going to start the same, or be the same, or so on, cause it would be way more helpful for people, I think!! :D",False,True
