If you do try it, remind your overreacting brain that that's not maintenance! Your goal is to neither gain nor lose weight. Sometimes you gotta treat your own mind like it's a little kid having a tantrum!",False,False

It's just such a horrifying thought bc my brain is constantly like ""nah that will definitely make you gain, eat less""  Also, you're so sweet, thank you &lt;3",False,True

At least for the time leading up to and including your vacation? It'll give you a break from the restriction and will even make losing weight after the vacation easier, like a fresh start. Plus, you should enjoy the vacation, not torture yourself over every meal thing to lose weight! Starting before will also keep you from bingeing the whole time, which would make you feel terrible too.   I bet you look amazing rn, and at your SW, and you will at your GW too. Please let yourself enjoy your lovely vacation, you deserve it &lt;3",False,False
