I used to be very very jealous and insecure - to the point where he felt like he couldn't have female friends, and he stuck through me during that time, so I definitely feel like he is giving me that emotional support. As much as I can feel frustrated with his forgetfulness, I still know that I can rely on him to be there for me when I need it. He does little things like bring me home treats from the supermarket.   I struggle with binge-eating and he is probably one of the only people in my life who has never called me fat.  Maybe I need to write these things down for those times I feel frustrated. I've also considered that when we are both earning a little bit more to get a maid to do the jobs like cleaning the bathroom etc to take it of me.",False,False

I had been saying for three or four years up until that point that I thought he had adhd and begging for him to get some sort of treatment before he finally capitulated and agreed to have an assessment. He had barely sat his ass down in the specialist’s chair before he had a diagnosis lol. After that it was only a matter of weeks before they had worked out his prescriptions and treatment plan. Just having the confirmation was a really big deal though, because it helped us understand what we were dealing with.   Something that makes the division of labour more fair for is the fact that he works more than I do and makes a LOT more money than I do. So while I do 99% of the home making, he pays for 99% of our lives together. That makes it feel a lot more equitable. So the driving thing is definitely a good start, but I guess it wouldn’t be the worst idea to see if there are any other areas where he could take over responsibility that would make things easier on you.   I identify with a lot of the examples you laid out. On top of everything else I also have to make all his appointments for him, and then remind him about them every day and a few hours beforehand, etc, to make sure he remembers to go. We have our phones set up to track one another, so if I don’t get an alert that he left his office however long before the appointment, I message/call and remind him too. Keeping two people’s schedules instead of just one is tiring but manageable when it’s this important.   I mean I guess my main advice (not that you asked for any) is to make sure you both feel cared for. I think the relationship can survive any amount of inequity as long as both parties feel like the other person is pulling their weight emotionally. He takes care of me financially, obviously, but he’s also very patient and kind with my disorder. I had a breakdown recently about feeling like my weight was going in the wrong direction and that I was losing control, and he calmed me down (not usually something somebody else has the ability to do for me, usually I can only do this by myself) and made me feel very secure that he was in this with me and I didn’t have to figure it out alone and we would be a team on taking this problem on. That was a really big deal for me as, as I’m sure you know, anorexia is a massively isolating disorder and can make you feel like you’re the only person in the void trying to bargain with Ana to let you breathe.",False,False

This is so so interesting to me.  Neither me or my SO are diagnosed - but I am very similar to you in needing the house to be 'show room ready' at all times (I like this term). I do pretty much all of the cooking and cleaning - and I need everything to be in its place. My SO does drive and I don't so I guess he does drive me around which is something.  I would imagine that at times, although it probably reads bad that he isn't contributing to the house duties - that I probably make him feel like he can hardly live in the house.  I immediately put things away and he will apologise to me if he does a project on the dining table because of the mess it makes.   He will usually do something if I directly ask him to do it - and I will only ask him when I know he is at home so he won't forget - i.e. if I message him and ask him to unload the dishwasher he will usually do it. However, if I'm not home, he won't think to feed the cats, and I will have to remind him (unless they do a good job of meowing at him!)  He has his own office which is messy and I usually move the mess he leaves in the house to him.  He doesn't seem to do the life admin sort of things everyone does. Everything seems really hard for him and like it is an effort. Having to do the dishes is a huge ordeal. He doesn't cook except for crappy oven meals, and will often just not eat instead of cooking.   I totally get the reminders thing as well. I constantly remind him of commitments we have.   We probably argue every six months about the cleaning/cooking - with me wanting him to contribute more. I am very tired of this fight and I'm not really sure what the answer is.  I love him, but sometimes I imagine what it would be like to be with someone who is self-motivated and will not just come home and sit on the computer, but clean, go to the gym, that sort of thing.  At the same time he has been better in the past so maybe he could be better in the future - and I'm clearly not the easiest person to live with either..?",False,False

Neither OCD nor ADHD are particularly wired for compromise).    He’s on Ritalin which helps a little bit, but it’s mostly a tool for helping him at work and less effective at general life stuff. His phone is stuffed to the gills with alarms and reminders so he knows when to get up, when to get in the shower, when to get out of the shower, when to go to lunch, etc etc.   I do 99% of the cleaning and cooking, which would suck in any other relationship but I need that control and he just isn’t wired to handle those tasks so it works for us. I’ve given up just expecting him to remember to put things back where they go or finish cleaning up after himself, so I just tell him what he needs to do and keep reminding him when he gets distracted. This level of mental labour would be unacceptable in most relationships but again, compromise.   I’m 100% responsible for organising our hobbies and activities. It’s frustrating when I’ve told him fifteen times which hike we’re doing on Saturday and he still asks again for me to remind him, but I try not to let it bother me because I know he’s not not listening on purpose, and that it’s not that it’s not important to him, it’s that his brain just doesn’t retain information the same way mine does. I try to remember that the fact that he’s asking is what shows he cares.   Sometimes if I remind him to do something enough times (and we’re talking like over the course of a year here, not a few times) he’ll pick it up as a habit (eg we’ve had success with him remembering MOST of the time that laundry goes IN the laundry basket, not on the floor beside it) but mostly I’ve sort of resigned myself to the fact that I’m going to have to pick up after him for pretty much the rest of our lives. Compromise. If my disorder is such that I need my living space to be show-home-ready 24/7, then it’s gonna be mostly my responsibility to keep it that way.   We both just do our best tot work with each other and remember that when one of us is behaving unreasonably, it’s not out of resentment or a lack of respect, it’s usually the disorder taking over. We try to be patient with rich other and mindful of each other’s challenges. As long as each of us can see that the other is trying, that’s usually good enough.",False,False

I pretty much purge my house.    2) I react to calories with excess energy. The more calories the more energy I have. I literally RUN around the house in a manic state cleaning.
