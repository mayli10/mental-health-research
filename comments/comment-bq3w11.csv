I was put on a meal plan to gain weight at first but ended up being tubed for a lot of it bc of the fight I put up about it lmao, it was relatively easy for me to go purge after my hour post-meal waiting period was up by going to the bathroom where the bedrooms were and “showering” and my digestion was goofed enough that I still got most back up. Whenever they weighed me in the morning they’d come to wake me up so that I couldn’t hide anything in my gown, drink water etc but then they made me pee and they only held the door open enough to hear that I was peeing so when I washed my hands I just drank a shitload of water then and no one picked up on it  I was discharged at 65kg and dropped down to 58kg within a couple months without my parents noticing too much, but I did try to recover to some extent. Thoughts about food and being fat etc never really went away sadly and I didn’t find therapy very useful + I didn’t feel like I deserved to waste my parents’ money so I tried to just fake it til I made it hah, it worked in the sense that I was physically ok and stopped hard restricting + purging but over time I’ve slowly started doing questionable stuff again like purging if I go out for dinner, stuff like that.  It was almost 5 years ago that I was in the psych ward and I managed to conquer my depression/suicidal tendencies pretty well but recently I’ve been trying to lose weight and because I’m all about instant gratification I’ve been slipping back into restricting and purging but idk if I’m bothered enough to do anything about it ahah; I tell myself I’ve got it under control but haven’t we all heard that one before   Anyway enjoy the useless musings/rant lmao, take care of urself",False,False
