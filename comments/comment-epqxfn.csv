I often say, did you have breakfast/dinner whatever?? I will tell him that he is being a nut bc he is hungry and kind of refuse to engage with him. And he will storm around, finally eat, and return to normal. 90% of the time he will say, I should have eaten breakfast, you were right. It is annoying as hell, his mom confirmed he was always that way too lol. Unfortunately our toddler is also a hangry beast in the morning who will refuse to eat bc he gets himself all worked up, finally get some oatmeal in him and he is back to his happy self. Tbh for my husband it was eye opening, like ah so that is what I am like. Like yes bro. Personally I feel like nothing I say or do before I have at least one cup of coffee should be held against me bc I am a grade a bitch before that lol.",False,False
