Burnt up my whole throat and nose somehow. Pretty sure i cried.  I purged peanut butter pretty well once though and Iâ€™m still proud. It hurt but not gonna lie I felt kind of accomplished. ,False,False

I'm allergic to peanuts so fortunately PB or foods with it aren't an option (unless I wanna die lol) but other types of nut butter that I can eat are a BITCH to purge and just thick and painful and calorie dense and so hard to get up. I almost never buy it.,False,False
