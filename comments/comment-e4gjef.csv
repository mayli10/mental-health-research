The awesome thing is that you get sharp/edgy/damnass prominent shoulder/arm joints, collarbones, and decolletage really quickly at a ""normal"" BMI.",False,False

I got huge shoulder blades and they look disgusting when I'm underweight but this is the only way I accept the rest of my body. So I pick this as my poison lol.,False,False

Bones definitely became prominent moreso than on any other part of my body, and tbh it's a blessing and a curse bc it actually made my shoulders look broader/more square as time went on, which raised more questions even though I wanted to 'show them off' with strapless tops etc. They started to become quite defined around bmi 21/20. Hope that helps",False,False
