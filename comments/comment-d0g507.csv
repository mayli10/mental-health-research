But I knew I was binge eating because of stress , and then I knew I was gonna try to force myself to throw up but Fail at it everytime .. That saying used to be a trigger for me when I was a teen I binged more , than when I left highschool it was a trigger to Not eat anything but a bag of almonds (1.5oz)  a day for 5 days and work out for 3 hours a day . Now I look back at this saying and cringe , confused on what to do next . Do I give in and let myself binge and fail to make it go away later ? Or do basically not eat at all and try to run 5 miles in 30 minutes?",False,False
