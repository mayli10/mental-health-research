I felt HORRIBLE abt myself. Also, I‚Äôm a grimy G O D and my 5‚Äô6 friends could never eat like that  lmao ",False,False

On the weekend my boyfriend and I were making deep fried pickles and mozza sticks (the whole box of both but an average amount in each) and my roommate came upstairs and said 'There's no way you guys can eat all that' and I knew damn well I could have took down all the pickles and mozza sticks on my own along with our leftover pizza AND I even opened a bag of chips after and knew I could have easily mucked the whole bag (I just don't do that in front of my bf lol)  It's crazy when how much you eat is actually put into perspective, and my roommate eats A LOT of fast food. I know your stress levels with finals coming up though, best of luck!!",False,False

Like mind your own business!! And I definitely notice that there are different reactions to a lower BMI person eating what seems like a lot vs a person with a higher BMI. It‚Äôs kinda upsetting to think about tbh and I wish people would just let others mind their own business irt food :/,False,True

Growing up my family always had dessert before bed. Every single night. So now I always feel like I have to eat something before bed, even if I‚Äôm not hungry at all. It‚Äôs super annoying!   Honestly sometimes I just get in a Mood and I turn into a human garbage disposal. I like to joke that it‚Äôs my superpower üòÖ  And thank you so much!! üíï",False,True

It‚Äôs kind of embarrassing, but it honestly takes so much for me to feel both physically and mentally satisfied. I think the only reason I ‚Äúget away‚Äù with it is because I‚Äôm a low-ish weight, I‚Äôm sure if I was heavy I‚Äôd get nasty comments. ",False,False
