But to answer your question, yes, there are definitely things that I learn in school/my field that help my ED..but it’s the wrong kind of help because I’ve been proED for a little bit to get the weight off from BED. It helped me learn and even devise my own proED hacks; it also makes it very easy for me to know what things might work for weight loss and what others won’t.  I finally lost the weight though after years of trying and felt completely empty, so I literally just started becoming pro-recovery a few days ago, so I’ll have to see where this leads me. I will definitely say it helps me make the right food choices though to help set me up for success.",False,False

My obsession with food has made dietetics an easy career choice; a lot of the info I already knew since I was 16/17.",False,False

It does take a lot of actual work and invested time to create the kinds of things people like us create. I did have to stop and remind myself that I did take my own time to learn the things I know and spent countless hours/days/years experimenting and perfecting methods. I'll be caught up in this thought for a while, but I don't think it will lead to any kind of spiral. Haha",False,False

I've always liked gardening and baking but since my ED ramped up, it's become obsessive with cooking healthy meals, growing whatever produce I can, baking with unprocessed flours, etc etc. And it makes me happy but I know part of it is from the ED",False,False

My whole day today I’ve been lost in this thought. how can I thank something that has/is destroying my life while also creating my life? and should I be thanking my ED and giving it this credit or should I just claim it for myself and as true part of me without any doubt.  I am glad I am not alone,False,True

I grow my own food, cook amazing dishes (not professionally or anything, stay at home wife, here) for my partner and family. I share my garden produce with friends and family, use it in my cooking. Everything. Your post spoke to me and now I'm wondering if it's because of my brain. Like it wouldn't be something I enjoy if it weren't for this. I'm obsessively trying new dishes, searching out new ways to cook old favorites, etc. It takes up so much time in my life and space in my head. I mean I love it, but would I still love it if I was neurotypical?",False,False
