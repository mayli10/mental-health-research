I always experience bigger loses in the first few days of a restrictive period. You see results, you feel good, there is an end in sight. Then you settle into a diet. Your weight fluctuates a bit because of food inside of you and water retention. It feels like you arenâ€™t making progress because the numbers arenâ€™t dropping like they used to. Itâ€™s also more difficult to deprive yourself of food the longer you are hungry. Eating &gt;1000 calories a day feels fine for a week but then youâ€™re just so hungry.   I personally find it harder the less I have left lose as well. Dropping five pounds is a lot more weight to get rid of when someone is for example 110lbs vs 130lbs.",False,False
