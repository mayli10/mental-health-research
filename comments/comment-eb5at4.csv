If the stores would sell their produce cheaper, it would be easier for people to be healthy. But ive seen shopping carts full to the brim of cookies, candy, soda, and anything else that shouldn't be a main diet. And i dont mean like 50 bucks worth. I'm seeing over 100 dollars worth on just junk food alone. My only hope is they are taking whats left and going to an actual grocery store and getting vegetables and fruit and meats.   If youre thinking I'm shaming them for buying it. Thats not my intention. The thing is the government makes it so you are spending more on prepackaged food than anything else. I dont care if you got a package of oreos. Its great if you got them on sale and take advantage. But it's a bit bad when all you see is cookies, pop tarts, sugar coated cereals, candy. The healthiest thing they buy is normally the milk.",False,False

ED’s are fucking brutal and insane and messed up. The best thing at least that I’ve found is being self aware of it, and stopping myself when I can help it. I hate that my eating disorder has made me so judgements of everyone around me.",False,False

They think “chicken is a diet food” and don’t understand that that does not mean eating a plate of diet food. Or “veggies are good” but not when they’re covered in butter and cheese. I think a lot of it is ignorance. Ive seen like every episode of My 600 Lb Life and so many of them honestly dont even KNOW that fast food is bad for them.,False,False

I was a serious food addict and I ballooned to 320 lbs.  Now I stay far away from fast food because I’m scared of it. I don’t want to be that big again or that addicted. I’m still morbidly obese but not 320 lbs.   I don’t think I can judge others anymore because I’ve been in that position of... whatever is triggering their need for fast food.   I think about when they’re going to realize how unhealthy, addictive, and sort of dangerous it is.",False,False

I work in a store with a grocery section. You'd faint if you saw how much junk food people buy with EBT. I get that most of it is because you can buy more junk than healthy with your money. Its fucked up but true. The fast food however you'd think they were going to the electric chair afterwards. Don't feel bad. Just dont tell them that. Lol,False,False

Again, it’s a sick society trying to sell us the idea that excess fat/obesity is “healthy” and “beautiful” to justify consumerist hedonism. It’s just as bad as when skeletal bodies were sold to us as ideal and “beautiful” in the 90s, except that it’s more woke and performative to support obesity.",False,False

We live in a sick culture that legitimately valourizes eating disgusting high caloric, low-nutrient foods in excess. In a way, anorexia/orthorexia can develop in response to this. You’re not wrong or bad for being repulsed by how much fast food people eat. Sure, some people may manage to eat it in moderation but clearly that isn’t really what’s happening when you look at the obesity rates in developed countries. It exists opposite to restriction on the unhealthy spectrum.",False,False
