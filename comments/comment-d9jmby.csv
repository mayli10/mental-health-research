This happened to me on Saturday after 5 consistent low restriction (sub-100 cal) days, even with electrolytes. My therapist actually called my doc Monday to tell her she thought I needed IP because I was so malnourished üò¨I added some salt (and bone broth! Crazy high in protein) and upped my calories back to 500. By yesterday I felt completely different- mentally clear and physically well again. And my team cleared me to stay OP another week, lol.",False,False
