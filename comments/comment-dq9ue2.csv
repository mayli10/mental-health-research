I’m sorry you had to sit through that :( Nobody in my class was like that surprisingly. Everyone listened and there was no misinformation spread. He even talked about orthorexia and the one ED where people want to gain muscle (can’t remember what it’s called).,False,True

Sometimes that ignorance can’t be beaten out of people, let alone be talked out.   People are very misinformed and insensitive about a lot of shit, not just EDs. Be very careful who you show your illness to. It’s a very sensitive topic.   Only talk about them in safe environments and with people who truly love you and that you trust.   I had a group of friends that would make fun of bulimia, not knowing one bit that I was suffering through it. I would just roll my eyes, maybe call them dumb for making fun of ppl, and trying to change the subject. In the end, I wish I didn’t keep my friendship with those ppl for so long bc they were fucked up in other ways too.",False,False

Can't correct anyone because you'll out yourself, so you just gotta suffer in silence...fun.",False,False
