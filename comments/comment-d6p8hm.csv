In whatever social circles you have, either school/work. Fill your time with YOUR LIFE--not worrying about his life or what he's doing. Staying busy is key to a long distance relationship--remember that this is your life and not his. There are good things to be experiencing in the world if you're not busy texting your boyfriend. I'm sorry tho, this sounds super shitty and he's not being great to you. You deserve better.",False,False
