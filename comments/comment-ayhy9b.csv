But it makes me wonder about her, did she realize what she was doing?  I find it kind of perplexing how someone who has such a large sphere of influence spent so long trying to convince everyone she was healthy when it was so obvious that was not the case.  she did some vlog about finding desserts in New York and it made me uncomfortable how obsessed she seemed about it.  Of course I can empathize, and I have been covering my problems up for a quarter of my life at this point but Iâ€™m not famous.  I donâ€™t know if I would feel some heightened level of responsibility to not trigger young fans.  But I guess the most important thing is she has come to terms with it",False,False

I get so triggered by the normalisation of underweight women on Instagram, I couldn't handle that irl. You're not a failure for not achieving a standard which isn't even healthy to achieve, although I really get how it can feel that way ðŸ’• ",False,False
