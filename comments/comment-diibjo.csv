I was so sleepy and I still wanted chocolate Cheerios but I was falling asleep. So I actually went to bed but every few hours I would wake up still craving the damn Cheerios... luckily I was too sleepy to get up and finally it was time to actually get up and I was so happy I made it through the night without continuing my binge lol.,False,False

Then finally manage to fall asleep because who can fall asleep when you’re stomach is in such physical pain after binging for multiple hours and wake up a few hours later wanting cereal.   I will have literally traveled the whole damn world in about 2 hours all from the comfort of my bed room.",False,False
