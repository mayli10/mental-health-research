I’ve been there. Your disease wants you to keep secrets and you don’t know if you can live without it. Outing yourself is very scary. I never told anyone because I knew I couldn’t live without the food and being thin.   I was very sick for a very long time. I still struggle with bulimia but not like before.  I finally just let it all hang out now after I was outed by a few people and so humiliated over it.  It took me a while to get over that but once I did it’s actually quite liberating to just be who I am. I work on a daily basis to not give a shit what other  people think about me while also working on the actual recovery from Bulimia. It does go hand-in-hand.   Venting, both on this forum, and hopefully eventually to people who care about you will take away some of the power that we give bulimia. It’s like a monster hiding under your bed but once you turn on the lights it’s really not that bad. It is what it is and u have nothing to be ashamed about.",False,False
