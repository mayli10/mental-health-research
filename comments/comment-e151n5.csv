When this feeling comes up, I just scold myself a bit and remind myself that *no one* needs to earn the right to eat. We all need to eat, it is a biological necessity. I wouldn't deny food to my pets or my friends. I'm not different from them.  But it shows up in all different ways: Am I allowed to eat X if I haven't exercised? Have I exercised enough to earn X? How should I compensate to make up for X food that I shouldn't have had or did not deserve? How many days should I starve myself to make up for being so fat and disgusting?   And on and on it goes.

We need each other here, you know? :) it‚Äôs the social aspects of this that make things REALLY hard for me, even more than the thoughts and urges. Or at least as much.   Another example from this week (TW maybe). I was at a work thanksgiving event with the very thin coworker that A. Knows about my ED and B. I have a crush on.   He thought the pecan pie I made was too sweet (I agree but it was triggering) and picked out one cookie and one samosa. I did the same. I picked mine to pieces and tried a nibble of each while he ate his samosa and saved the cookie for later (and never ate it apparently). I, of course, was mentally fretting over HIM while he was giving me the side eye as I covered my plate with my napkin. But why would I eat anything when HE barely did, and he is so so thin???

Especially if other people are around, then I always fret about them having what they want and making sure they aren‚Äôt at all hungry.   I was trying to be better last week and had intense reactive hunger and my wife offered me a few bites of her food. And as I ravenously took them (you know when you are so hungry there is that ‚Äúthroat hunger‚Äù? I have been literally starving) I was still apologizing over and over for having what I did. Even knowing she hates my disorder.    How the hell are we supposed to function when our brains scream the EXACT opposite of what reality is telling us???  You ABSOLUTELY deserve to eat. We all deserve that, and we all know it and I‚Äôm sure we are all better at telling each other and can‚Äôt do as well at listening to ourselves. Warm gentle hugs to you üíï",False,False
