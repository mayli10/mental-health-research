I love re-watching the first couple seasons of Friends so I can trigger tf out of myself - Courtney Cox and Jennifer Aniston were SO PERFECT AND THIN.

I love/hate it so much.",False,False

Like yea you eat like shit but that‚Äôs all you eat in an entire day  If you ate that 3 times a day you wouldn‚Äôt still be thin!   He‚Äôs gained like 20 lbs in the last couple years bc I make him lunch and dinner. On nights I‚Äôm out with friends or something he doesn‚Äôt eat dinner until I get back and tell him to eat.

Like when they have a zillion candies for movie night, they‚Äôre only eating one candy out of each bag which doesn‚Äôt amount to a massive amount of food eaten.
