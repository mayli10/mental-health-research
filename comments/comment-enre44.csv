I have been trying to think of it from the perspective you mentioned in point-3 very recently. A problem often that occurs there is when there's little hope one has of things getting better.   I'll try to experiment with the first and second bullet points going forward.,False,True

It is ok to feel whatever I feel, and it’s so much better to face that head on rather than layering shame for feeling jealous on top of feeling jealous. - For me, the ‘because’ of jealousy usually traces back to fear, especially fear that my emotional needs will not be met or even do not *deserve* to be met. So, I directly acknowledge those fears too. - As gently and non judgmentally as I can, I remind myself that good things in someone else’s life do not diminish my life or preclude me from having good things. It’s not a teeter totter where someone going up means I go down. My experience of the goodness of my body, career, relationships, etc. is (or can be) an independent variable. - I use the principles of metta meditation (lovingkindness) to wish the person well. I usually simply think to myself “May you be happy. May you be well. May you be free from suffering.” It’s surprisingly effective, even if my mind sometimes recoils from doing it.   Hope something in there can help reduce the internal turmoil that jealousy can bring! For me it’s very much an ongoing practice. I’m about as likely to stop experiencing jealousy as I am to never again feel anxious or angry, but I think I can learn to let the emotion come and go more peacefully.",False,False
