Was looking through mpa before and afters and there was one where the person ate 800cal for a few months and still looked.... not good. All that suffering for underwhelming results. I’m quite tired of doing this so this time I’m going to try resistance training. And then I can forgive myself for eating a bit more,False,False

Basically, you put your body through hell, you starved it, you restricted it. It did the only thing it knew how to do to save it's own life - it ate, it nourished itself &amp; it did it enough to survive the potential famine it believed it was facing.   I would recommend trying to eat to your body's signals. Failure to do so isn't sustainable in the long run. You either manage it &amp; kill yourself in the process...or you end up with these binge episodes where your body will try &amp; stuff as much in as possible &amp; save it up to keep itself safe, making you miserable.   Rather than starving or bingeing, try eating to what your body asks for in a reasonable manner. It will find the place it is most comfortable, a range of a few pounds in my experience, &amp; stay there effortlessly, happily &amp; most of all *sustainably*.  I know in the moment &amp; with an active disorder all that sounds...laughable. I can only speak from my own experience, but I urge you to give it a try. Accept your body for what it is, a vessel for your brain, your personality, so you can live a full life.   Wishing you all the best :)",False,False
