I was wearing a size 20 in pants (us women’s) and now I’m 165 and wear a size 8 or 6 (vanity sizing is nuts), so I’m still in the overweight range for my height and have a long way to go. But honestly I haven’t been treated all that differently? Tinder boys don’t seem quite as let down when they meet me irl and that’s about it really. Honestly one of my biggest motivating factors in losing weight rn is being so desperate to see what it’s like to not be treated like a fat girl™",False,False
