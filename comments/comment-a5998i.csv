I’ve always considered bananas a nice and healthy snack... then I’ll binge on them and get heart burn and they make me bloated.  I also hate mangoes. I’ve always felt alone about that, it’s nice to see someone else doesn’t like them. It’s a texture and taste problem and they give me a mild allergic reaction. ",False,False

I got the kind that came in the big jug thing and I measured whatever they deemed a serving. Adding the banana is what made it bearable though. I hated it plain.
