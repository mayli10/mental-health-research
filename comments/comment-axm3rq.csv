But they knew I went to see a nutritionist after the comments and was actively trying to gain weight, and did so. I do all the pro-healthy talk and even when discussing my weight restoration I was careful to put the emphasis on health and not aesthetics.   During a separate conversation (initiated by them, after watching something on YouTube about AN) I admitted to them that I was diagnosed with it as a teen. I didn‚Äôt tell them it continued into adulthood, which is not entirely untruthful because as a teen it was more ‚Äúclassic‚Äù eats-only-an-apple-a-day type thing whereas in adulthood it became so much more complex. I don‚Äôt think they would understand the ‚ÄúED brain‚Äú disparity between outward behavior and internal mindset. I don‚Äôt know how much honesty is appropriate tbh, and as I‚Äôm not confident that full disclosure wouldn‚Äôt be harmful I‚Äôm trying to keep things to minimum. For the moment I think it‚Äôs best to focus on projecting the healthy mom role model.",False,False

I work really hard to protect her from the realities of my ED, but LOs have a lot of awareness, and that modelling is critical for them. I still worry, and for that reason, LO is my reason to recover.   We have family meals, and I always clear my plate. We eat a large variety of foods, including treats. We don‚Äôt label food as ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù, and I don‚Äôt engage in power struggles over food with her. I serve dinner. She makes her own choices from those options. I never refuse an offer of food from her. We talk about listening to our bodies. We focus on our physical strength (rather than appearance), and express gratitude for our bodies. We move our bodies together with the purpose of feeling good, rather than to change our shape. It is a conscious choice every day. You can do this, Mama.",False,False

Growing up my mom always bragged about how when she was in her prime she was 80 lbs and was so hyper focused on my weight. I remember once I was looking at her wedding photos and I stated that I liked the dress / if she still had it. She said she does and that she wished I could wear it for my wedding day but that it probably wouldn‚Äôt fit me. When she said that to me I was literally a child. Like I don‚Äôt mean to be resentful towards her or blame my disorder on her bc I know it‚Äôs my own mentality and am able to control how much words effect me to an extent, however I feel like she did play a huge role in it and has always made me subconsciously want to be 80 lbs as well. Flash forward a couple years (I‚Äôm 19 currently), I‚Äôm finally under 100 which I originally thought was my goal weight but like I‚Äôm coming to the realization with Ed‚Äôs there‚Äôs really no ‚Äúgoal weight.‚Äù Like once you hit it a new one is automatically created and it‚Äôs a never ending cycle ",False,False

Mine are in high school/middle school now and I can‚Äôt tell you how terrifying it was to hear them randomly comment on my weight (they didn‚Äôt mince their words either)  My daughter and I wear the same size now and I wouldn‚Äôt want her to think she shouldn‚Äôt get any bigger bc mom isn‚Äôt, she should get bigger and I should get bigger too. We sit at the table together for meals and since then I‚Äôve made a point of clearing my plate, I can only hope I‚Äôm projecting the role model I want to be. Good luck.",False,False

More what I meant was dont feel like you need to get too big to counteract it. When my mum finally 'recovered' she kept her weight at the lowest end of healthy because that was the size she felt happiest at. I don't want you to stress yourself out by trying to get too big because that could cause a replapse later on!  You're doing great already! ,False,False

I grew up with a mum who had a ED and was very underweight and openly missed meals/refused to eat/purged. Really messed with me for a long time. Especially as a girl, you look up to your mother as an example of what you should be and kids learn young.   HOWEVER that doesn't mean you need to push yourself to get to big. Just make sure whenever you talk about food or your body keep the ED out of it. Dont mention needing to diet or hating how you look in front of them, and definitely don't show them restricted eating.   When I saw my mum complain about her body, watch her refuse to eat anything, and use the word weight like a swear word. Taught me that thin will never be thin enough and not eating is normal.
