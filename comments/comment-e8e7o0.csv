Think about you potentially eating 500 cal of cake, and compare it to you eating 500 calories of potatoes, beans and vegetables. What is going to regulate ghrelin and leptin better, and keep you full? I hope this made sense.",False,False

I did OMAD for about a month before a vacation and loved it.

I‚Äôve been thinking about doing OMAD again but it‚Äôs so ducking hard when I wake up wanting to stuff the first food I see in my mouth. I know it gets easier but ugh.
