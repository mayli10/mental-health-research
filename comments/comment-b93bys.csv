All the food I’m eating has given me so much energy and I look... nice, for once.  I think my relationship with food might be slowly recovering",False,False

I need to lose a pound a week. And Im sure I miss some calories I don't count, because like everyone misses calories sometimes so having that exercise wiggle room just is great to have. Honestly once I hit 120 I think it'll be coolio. ",False,True
