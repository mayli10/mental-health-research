It's so easier to think logically after a binge when I'm not obsessively trying to do math about my body. Accept that it happened and move on with my life while fighting the itch to immediately go weigh myself every few hours. I've been weighing only about once per week, and even then, on days where I know I feel a little slimmer / less bloated.    I want to believe a lot of bad things about myself. Stepping on the scale and seeing the numbers go up (especially when I know they will because I've over eaten) confirms those bad things. Solidifies my low self esteem and perpetuates disordered behavior. I have to step back from it.    And just fuck this disorder in general. Op, at some point for us, binging may have allowed us to cope with something nasty. Please just know that you're not alone. I'm wishing the best for you. ",False,False

And all my life, celebrating meant eating food I liked. So yea, I also binged every damn time. Even planned to make sure I was alone so I could sit on the couch just inhaling a full table of crap. For me what helped was by promising myself clothes, makeup and other non-food rewards.",False,False

Try to remember that those binges aren't your fault, your body has overridden your control because it senses that you're dying. That's kinda comforting in a way, it means it's looking out for you and trying to keep you safe. I know that's not what you want to hear, you want to be able to get down there and stay down there, but sometimes that's not possible, and at least you can know it's not your fault or because you're weak or undisciplined.",False,False
