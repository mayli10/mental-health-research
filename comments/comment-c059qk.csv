Sometimes people will say things to you because they know that you’ll feel crap about yourself as a result, it makes them feel superior and better about themselves. I had a friend who used to say stuff like that to me all the time and it used to really bother me.  It can be toxic for you. And even if what she said is the truth, she won’t be able to remain on that diet for long, she’s unwell.  As for you now feeling shit about yourself, forget it. Put it out of your mind. You need to focused on you and not what others are doing. Your health comes first, both mental and physical, living on a bit of bread will only lead to misery in the end.  Try not to linger on what other people say.",False,False

Also, you aren’t with her 24/7, you don’t know for sure what else she’s consuming throughout the week. Don’t beat yourself up about her eating habits, you’re your own person and her boasting about eating a piece of toast as an energy source doesn’t seem like something to aspire to do",False,False
