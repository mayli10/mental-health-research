(Not saying it‚Äôs you)  I know tall people and all heights struggle with ED but I feel like people like us under  5‚Äô5 gain a single pound and it shows more since we‚Äôre so short. But as a plus, losing 5 also makes a huge change. My sides looked smaller and my love handles weren‚Äôt as massive. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre having a crappy time OP. Me too. At least our dudes still love us and are with us.",False,False

That honestly sounds so hurtful of him to say :( like I would have a talk with him about how what he says makes you feel bad about yourself and that he should refrain from making comments like that because that's fucked up!  I'm also short and I really understand that insecurity. I feel like if I were taller I would look so much thinner :(,False,True
