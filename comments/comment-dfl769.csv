I live in Canada so that really doesn’t help.  3) There’s so many food-related holidays going on, Halloween, thanksgiving, Christmas, maybe New Years,  valentines, Easter. Wayyy too much stress going on there.  4) Something about cold and winter just makes me want to eat more and hibernate, it’s harder to exercise, I don’t think that’s just me, might be though.  5) I reached my lowest weight in fall 2 years ago, now I’ve gained back to almost my highest, so fuck me.  Just. Fuck.",False,False

In my mind, winter time is the time used to prepare my summer body. So this creates pressure to look a certain way by a certain deadline.   Also, sometimes I feel so cold and I get chills. More so than the average person, because at times people around me feel fine and I’m there freezing.",False,False

I experienced some trauma many years ago in the fall and winter and actually just had a breakthrough in therapy that linked my yearly downward spiral to that trauma, because before that it didn’t even cross my mind.   As soon as the seasons change it’s like something inside me snaps and I become an entirely different person.  I have some serious anxiety which the fall REALLY exacerbates and the lack of sun throws me into seasonal depression.  The first couple years of my kid’s life I wasn’t affected as badly by the seasons because I think I was busy being a mom but he’s old enough now that he has more independence, lo and behold here I am in a severe spiral and relapse (not that I was ever fully recovered, just more stable).  TLDR fall and winter fuck me up and so far this is the worst in years :(",False,False

Maybe it’s because of nostalgia of “back to school” which is also when my checkups would be, so I was always really bad around then. Fall just makes me restless in general, I want to run off into a misty field in the darkness and storm of a rainfall and just not stop.",False,False
