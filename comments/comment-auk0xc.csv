But because I have EDNOS, I can never tell if I'm just denying it or moving through another phase of the disorder. There's the whole binge/restrict hell, and then sometimes I'm eating ""normally"" or overeating but not exactly binging. While I'm aware that I'm still sick, it's as if I'm on sleep mode or something. I just go through a period of mild misery while occasionally dipping into restricting more or binging more. This can last for months. Last summer I was primarily restricting and lost 17 pounds. Fall comes around and I'm in that weird limbo where I gain back up to my normal weight and hate myself everyday, but it's not as...active? Now I'm back to restricting all over again.   &amp;#x200B;  It's this long back and forth, wax and wane, tedious nonsense. ",False,False
