There’s this YouTuber, Kate Noel, who just put out a podcast called “Take The Cake”, and she has a really soothing energy about her, so I’m excited for more episodes of that. The one I was listening to the other day was Russell Brand’s podcast where he was interviewing this body positivity activist named Megan Jayne Crabbe. It was interesting, but I feel like I wasn’t that impacted. But that’s partly why I listen to this stuff—because I know how hard it is to crawl out of my mindset, so I figure the more alternative voices I let in, the better. Lmk if you find any good ones!",False,True
