I've seen it really help people. I had about a dozen rounds over the summer and it didn't work for my treatment resistant depression. It actually really messed me up (well the whole 5 month hospitalization did)   You seem to be tolerating it a lot better than me so that makes me think it will be helpful for you!,False,False

Not a lot of psychs are trained or very familiar with ECT, and it's usually always a last ditch effort after many treatment failures. Another newer option for depression is TMS- transcranial magnetic stimulation, uses magnets to stimulate brain cells. ",False,False
