You sound a lot like me when I started losing weight a year ago. I was very obese at the time and also just wanted to look average. Now I'm lurking around in ED hell.  Please talk to someone. No matter how low the numbers on the scale are, you'll never believe it's enough.",False,False

I have like a “safe” +/-5lb window where I feel most comfortable but my ED never stopped once I hit it. I was in “recovery” for a year or so and never weighed myself or acted on behaviors but as soon as a nursing student said my weight (my medical records have a note and pop up in my chart in computers not to say my weight) and it all came back. I was out of the window.   Essentially that goal of “everything will be perfect once I hit x” is not a thing. Life doesn’t magically fall into place once you’ve hit that number.,False,False

So, no one online can diagnose you, however it does sound like you're heading down a risky &amp; dangerous road. Please tell a trusted adult IRL about these habits &amp; your concerns.  Some tips if you struggle talking about it out loud could be: write a letter, send a text or e-mail, tell a close friend first &amp; have them go with you to talk with an adult.
