It shocked me...I know I've been losing weight but I haven't been able to weigh myself for a few weeks. None of my clothes fit anymore but I thought I looked pretty much the same. I thought I still looked kinda pudgy.  I look ill. My knees look like huge knobs in the middle of my legs and my thighs look frail and bowed. My bra and shirt are hanging off my body.  Ten minutes later I'm looking down at myself and feeling tubby again. But I can't shake that image. Honestly it has me freaked out. *Is that what other people see when they look at me?*,False,False

I'm new here, to the sub and also reddit. I am happy I've found a relatable place. I've been struggling with ED since a young age, having short spans of recovery time. This last was my longest recovery time of almost two years, but have recently relapsed due to the many reasons that would cause someone to relapse. I dont really like to discuss my diagnosis, though will talk about symptoms. I like to say that ED has multiple personalities each one having one or more things in common with the others. ED is still ED regardless of the names of the other personalities. That helps me relate to others under ED's spell.   I'm glad to be here :)",False,False

The tortillas are sweet and you get the pizza taste and gooey cheese.   For a while this was a life saver because i can't bring myself to eat normal pizza anymore. Idk why. There's just a mental block that prevents me from enjoying it and whenever i eat it i feel frustrated and like im forcing myself to bite down and swallow like im a 5 year old again being forced to eat beans, so i just see it as a waste.  Then i had the idea to use pancake mix instead of tortillas and god i love it  I go easy on the water and make them super fluffy and omg.
