What I do know though, is that people here care about you. I care about you. Suicide is a permanent situation to a temporary problem and trust me, I have been there. Hell, I‚Äôm still there some days. Sometimes multiple times a day. I was there all last week, drinking every single day and I came really close to ending my own life. I have exactly 0 friends irl (been through a breakup and all my friends left with him) and live with neglective parents and a violent younger sister with severe autism. I wish I could be of more help, but I‚Äôll try to give you a run-down of what‚Äôs been helping me. Loneliness is a killer. Humans crave contact and need other people to talk to. Please find people to talk to. I‚Äôm more than happy to chat with you about absolutely anything (mental illness related or just a chat) so please DM me whenever you feel lonely! I‚Äôd also recommend finding Kik chats with other ED people (though beware of creeps) because although there‚Äôs lots of inactive ones, there‚Äôs also some gems. The site myproana.com has a subforum for making friends that I‚Äôve found really helpful (again, watch out for creeps). Just chatting to people in group chats I found on there has cheered me up and changed my whole perspective so much, although it can‚Äôt replace having friends irl I feel so much less alone. Keep busy and distract yourself too, I know it seems clich√© but it really does help. If you need help with this I‚Äôm more than happy to lend a hand, hit me up and we can play some crappy online game like town of Salem or cards against humanity lol. I‚Äôd recommend the typical things like therapy and all that but I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard it all before. I hope you feel better soon and again, I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre feeling like this *hugs* üíñ",False,False
