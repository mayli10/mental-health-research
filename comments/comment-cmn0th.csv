One time I mentioned to her I was feeling groggy and low energy, and she recommended I eat a little snack with some protein in it (she says she usually goes for cottage cheese).  And maybe I‚Äôm projecting, because tracking what you eat and being calorie conscious and opting for healthy snacks  and knowing about nutrition aren‚Äôt inherently BAD things, or exclusively ED behaviors buuuuuut all these things together remind me a lot of the things I do.  And after we kinda bonded over MFP and ‚Äúwow I really like to track my calories too!‚Äù she seemed to be more comfortable talking about these things with me, whereas I don‚Äôt believe she talks to our coworkers about this stuff.
