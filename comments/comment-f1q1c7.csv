I’m going to get fat. I’m ugly. I’m disgusting. I’m weak. I hate myself. I can’t do this. I’m so pathetic, just pathetic, a weak pig.' It went on for more than 10 minutes.  Many of the parents had walked into the programme frustrated and angry at their child’s seeming refusal to eat. When they heard the recording and the sheer amount of 'noise' that their children endured, their anger dissipated.""  I know it can add to the already overwhelming guilt when you also worry about how your disorder affects your loved ones, but it can sometimes help to remember you deserve comfort and compassion, especially when it's hardest to see that clearly and to give them to yourself. This stuff gets so hard with the constant inner dialogue, and I'm so glad your boyfriend comforted you through such a painful spiral ♥️",False,False
