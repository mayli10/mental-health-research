Like I’m not going to pretend I’ve never put my foot in my mouth but sometimes it’s astonishing how insensitive people are. ,False,False

She made it a point to make comments on everything, from ""I haven't eaten all day, I just *forgot* to!"" to ""I'm so happy the skirt I got a week ago is now super loose on me!"" to eating a small bag of chips and exclaiming, ""I'm going to get *so* fat!""  This ""friend"" also decided to tell a bunch of our mutual friends/acquaintances/literally anyone that would listen about my ED, even after I asked her multiple times not to.  I cut ties with her. She wasn't getting that her comments made me feel like absolute shit (or she just didn't care), and I got tired of being forgiving.",False,False
