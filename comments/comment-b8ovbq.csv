My puppy is my best friend and has saved me from a lot. Some people hate on Cesar milan but I got a lot from him about the importance of rules, schedule, discipline, exercise etc. My biggest piece of advice is to talk to your puppy! Mine has a big vocabulary now and is super smart and loves to hear me talk to her. I think it makes her more in tune with how I’m feeling and what to expect.",False,False

Cleaning up Loki's cage and changing Bosco's litter box is how I start my day, and without them I honestly wouldn't get out of bed. They give me a reason to stay out of the hospital.   &amp;#x200B;  When dealing with any sort of mental illness, you have to look for strength to keep living in any and all things.
