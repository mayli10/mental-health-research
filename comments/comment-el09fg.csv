You build a routine and healthy foods to stick to at least 80% of the time. You know what foods are high in calories and you know when you aren't eating enough. You'll know your losing weight when you stick to your plan just by looking at your body. I've got bad body dysmorphia but i can still tell when my stomach is bigger or smaller. Some people have used this method of losing weight: figure out how many calories a healthy weight of your height eats every day and eat that and stick to that. You'll slowly but surely lose weight without really having to focus so much on food. For me that number is 1800 if I'm moderately active and 1700 if i don't go to the gym. Im really short though.,False,False

And you don't sound crazy. You've really explained the difference in a way I haven't heard from other people.  My boyfriend doesn't understand why I want to lose weight. He is now so aware of my eating disorder that I have no chance of restricting anyways.  I really do want to be healthy and active for myself. Because I know how good it feels to feel strong. ED just gave me weakness.  Unfortunately I've missed my eating disorder so very much recently. I'm in online support groups but they are never as honest as this sub. It feels like they are suffering but just throw empty platitudes at you.,False,True

And I don't have the answers really, because I personally have not found that ""sweet spot"" of being healthy but still losing. I just can't, the impulses are too strong once I start...  I know it's possible, I know some have done it. I think the most important thing is to make it a *priority* but not an obsession??? If that makes sense. And also to remind yourself you aren't doing this because you want to only lose weight, but because you want to be active, fit, happy, healthy, etc. Losing weight isn't the defining factor of if you love yourself, you're doing it *because* you love yourself. And it's not just about weight-loss, but strength/health gained????  &amp;#x200B;  Do I sound crazy? Wish I had better advice :(",False,False
