The reason he hasn't got a girlfriend his own age is because women with 40 years of life experience are more likely to avoid toxic men. His attraction to you was based on his belief that he could control you, which is probably why he's lashing out and trying to make you feel bad when you disagree with him. It's a reminder that you are your own independent person, and that threatens his perceived authority. I'm sorry if this sounds harsh, but you say yourself that he is abusive. It's hard to leave an abusive relationship - that's the nature of them - but you would be better off without this emotional leech in your life. If you can, if it's safe for you to do so, reach out to a friend, family member, colleague, or a local charity or group dedicated to helping victims of domestic abuse.",False,False

Being with him was so up and down. He blamed me for his ptsd and I think was trying to get me pregnant. I was almost a year clean before I met him. He would throw literal tantrums and would threaten harm on himself to get me to stay. I tried to get him into therapy but he refused. He made both of us go on a diet when only he is obese. When I dumped him was the biggest relief. It took me a while to block him, I tried to be friends. He would apologize, insult and then try to get sex out of me. At one point I considered marrying him. I feel disgusted with myself.   I'm still in therapy but my ed isn't getting better.  I want things to be better for you ðŸŒ·",False,False
