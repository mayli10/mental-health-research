I have ADHD, but psychiatrists haven‚Äôt wanted to medicate me because it‚Äôs not incredibly disruptive, and they don‚Äôt want me to abuse it. I really don‚Äôt plan on using Vyvanse long term. Ideally just until I get my shit together and graduate. Despite my addictive personality, I‚Äôm not one to necessarily abuse meds (like taking more than a recommended dose). I really do plan on using it responsibly (to a degree), and I‚Äôll definitely keep what you‚Äôve said in mind.",False,True

You‚Äôll feel yourself building a tolerance to the side effects very quickly. Initially you might even forget that you need nourishment, and then the next day you‚Äôll be surprised at how fast your body settles into the medication so that it can actually work as a psychiatric drug rather than a full on appetite suppressant.   Its *extremely* easy to underestimate the power of these drugs, because you can very easily overdose without realizing it (especially if you are intending to use it off label).   Years ago I was even given Phentermine (actually as an appetite suppressant), via an endocrinologist and Vyvanse/or Adderall per a psychiatrist at the same time. My heart stopped (briefly, but I was hospitalized), when I was 19 because of an unwitting overdose due to that medical oversight. Youll most likely be very tempted to take extra pills when you start to feel those side effects fading (I still do today, especially when I don‚Äôt want to deal with that pain my condition causes with hunger). Realistically, you‚Äôre most likely looking at a maximum of a weeks ‚Äúbenefits,‚Äù to a serious loss of hunger before you notice it decrease significantly or completely disappear. I hope it helps you in the way it‚Äôs intended to.",False,False
