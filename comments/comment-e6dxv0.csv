My mom didnâ€™t openly restrict and I donâ€™t think she did secretly but her stocking the home only with healthy food made treats really alluring to me and I would binge later. I absolutely feel like if my mom skipped meals it would have effected my disorder a lot and probably intensified it.   Sorry to hear that your mom suffered like that :c,False,False

She's never eaten Thanksgiving dinner with us. Depending on where she was in her cycle, she'd either have a small serving of yogurt and fruit while we eat or she'd eat nothing and binge on cake and ice cream and cookies and boxes of chocolate at 3am that night.   I never consciously thought ""oh, my mom's very obviously tortured eating habits are a great idea, I should do that"" but like... Here I am, following her lead",False,False

Just in my personal experience of course; ymmv. These past two years I've been eating *omad* most days of the week, with ***no*** **mad** on the other daysâ€¦ and I've never in my long life felt so good. ðŸ˜Š",False,False
