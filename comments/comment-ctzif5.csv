If it makes you feel any better though my dr (general physician but she has also done my pap &amp; bc etc) always includes a paper on healthy food habits &amp; exercise/weight loss etc and I've always fluctuated in normal BMI range. I do understand though every time I see that paper I feel rage. You're doing great trying to take care of yourself ❤️,False,False
