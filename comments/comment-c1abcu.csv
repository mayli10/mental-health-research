Once I've had 10 cans over 2 days (ive fasted on second day) and i felt nothing like the sort!?? Although I did get reaaaally sick the day after and it lasted for over 2 weeks it was terrible,False,False

We have free health care in my country but in other countries insulin is SO expensive and being diagnosed can ruin your life financially, which is probably not best for you especially with your current situation (but even if you do get it for free itâ€™s a pain in the ass to remember to take your tablets every day)  Sending positivity",False,False

Iâ€™m not even counting the calories, like I drink white monster because I donâ€™t like the taste of the other ones but since Iâ€™m the only one at that one grocery store buying the white monsters they donâ€™t refill it as much so there were none left so I had to buy the regular ones like the green one or assault n stuff ...  But worry not Iâ€™m never doing this again ha ha all that caffeine and sugar on an empty stomach was terrible, even now itâ€™s currently 6pm and I feel like shit     Iâ€™m glad Iâ€™m not actually addicted to sugar so Iâ€™m usually nice to Mr.Pancreas  Or maybe thatâ€™s because of that I felt so bad  Who knows   Thanks for worrying though ðŸ’š",False,True

By drinking 6 cans of monster thatâ€™s already 276 calories. Although thatâ€™s not a lot, you need to also consider youâ€™re drinking 66grams of sugar which is WAY over the recommended amount. Sugar also adds additional ~4 calories per gram. If youâ€™re not doing exercise, youâ€™re going to be eating over 500 calories   If your calorie goal is &lt;600 then this might be â€˜okayâ€™ but itâ€™s incredibly unhealthy. Youâ€™re going to damage your pancreas and your teeth. There are much more â€˜fillingâ€™ ways to eat to reach your calories amount without just drinking shitty energy drinks. Your pancreas will thank you in the future",False,False
