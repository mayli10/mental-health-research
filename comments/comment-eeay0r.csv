My bf constantly is talking about how much he loves my body and how “small/tiny” I am and how he preferred small boobs too!! He takes it even further though and puts down other body types in a really fatphobic sense saying things like “big boobs just mean the girl is overweight” and it really fuels the Ed fire that keeps me the size I am. Like it really validated/justified my whole ass eating disorder. Thin privilege and fatphobia are real as fuck it’s no wonder were out here desperately trying to control our weight.,False,False
