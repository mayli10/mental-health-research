When I have to have tough conversations with my spouse, sometimes I find it helpful to write out all of my thoughts in a stream of consciousness, and then use that to help me bring down the emotional intensity and compose a more organized explanation of my feelings.  Or, if you think it might be easier for him to digest on his own (no pun intended), you could compose an explanation in writing and let him read it privately.",False,False

Reading that analogy completely opened my eyes to how messed up it is. I just dont know how to bring up that I'm having an issue with it without triggering him or something.,False,True

Let's use an analogy to look at it with a little more distance:  Let's say that, instead of eating disorders, you and your boyfriend had both had Type 2 Diabetes.  Your boyfriend's T2D was diagnosed several years before yours, advanced more quickly, and he had a foot amputated.  When speaking about your own T2D, he minimized your symptoms, dismissed your suffering, and told you that, because you still had both your feet, your T2D was just starting and not a valid case of diabetes.  The attitude is the same, only the details are different.  It's not an appropriate way to interact with your partner.",False,False

But yeah, I agree that its kinda gross to do anyways",False,True

He's doing it on purpose.  No one who has or had an ED is going to ""innocently"" jiggle or pinch someone else's body, especially someone they know has ED, without knowing exactly what they are doing.  Toxic af.",False,False
