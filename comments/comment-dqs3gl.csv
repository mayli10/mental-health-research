With a narcissist, when they see something they don't like about themselves in someone else, it's a really big offense and it's the other person's fault. I would say try not to take her comments to heart, but that's just not possible because I've tried with my own mom. I wish you luck, self-care, and time out of the house.",False,False

Bulimia and other eating disorders are definitely real and absolutely nothing to do with being lazy. I don't know what she's thinking but parents show worry in really strange ways and sometimes they try to do what they think is best in very bad ways. What she's doing is entirely wrong and I hope you'll be able to get help with your situation. Wish I could give you a hug ‚ù§Ô∏è,False,False
