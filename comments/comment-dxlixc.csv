I am unfamiliar with how limiting your carbohydrates so stringently influences insulin (not a major topic in animal/livestock nutrition), but what i can tell you is that eating a diet that is consistently high in fat influences reproductive ability. In sows (thats a female pig) fed a diet high in fat (DDGS was a component of the diet, incrementally increasing between trial groups) had ooyctes that were not viable, as there was increased lipid deposition. Lipid molecules were literally replacing carbohydrate based molecules in the oocyte. Carbohydrates are easily broken down for cellular respiration and cellular function, so it makes sense why there would need ot be a high concentration in oocytes (although sperms are basically 100% genetic information and therefore protein, ejaculate is basically a high concentration of carbohydrates which the sperm are able to use as energy sources for mobilization... oh the joys of animal breeding and reproductive science!)",False,False
