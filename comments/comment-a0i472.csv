My recent wedding has permanently changed my viewpoint of one of my old very close friends, and this is just making me more reluctant to seek them out.",False,True

It's so frustrating!! Not to mention one friend (friend A) has been the cause behind BOTH my recovery roadbumps. Last time she triggered my anxiety intwo multiple panic attacks that lead to me AN flaring, and this time with this. URGH.  I am so so lucky, in that I have my (very recent!) husband, and my best friend, both who are bloody phenomenal.    Thank you &lt;3 ",False,True

All of my friends are like me, with various illnesses, and a lot of the times it seems like because now I'm weight restored, all my illnesses and invisible. They seem to forget that I am still really sick, and don't give me the same allowances/understanding as I do them.",False,True

I’m 34 and fortunately, the friends I have are supportive even if they don’t get it.  I did know this one bulimic woman who was kinda hyper competitive about everything but I just ignore her if I run into her these days.  Don’t let this person ruin your recovery. You deserve to enjoy food &amp; love yourself.",False,False
