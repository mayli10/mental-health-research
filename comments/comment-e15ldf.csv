I am hoping that you will be safe and take your time recovering, not because I want you to spend your entire life recovering, but because rushing yourself can be a quick set up for a relapse.  Do what you are comfortable as long as you continue to recover.  You have a long journey ahead of you, but you are already taking a giant step in the right direction!  I'm proud of you :)",False,False

Letting go of something that you‚Äôve seen the good sides of (comfort and belonging are good things, even if here they might come from something bad) is so so hard but I think you‚Äôre making the right choice. Even though part of me screams ‚Äúcome back‚Äù...that‚Äôs a very selfish part of me. I respect you so much. And am honestly really impressed. The fact that you can admit that the ed is attractive and still choose recovery (and a much much much fuller life!) is so cool. I‚Äôm saving your post :)",False,False

It‚Äôs not healthy for me to look at. We love you girl the introspection it takes to recognize unhealthy things for you and removing them from your life is an incredible skill,False,False

I'm always so thrilled when people say they're leaving this sub--not because I don't want them as a part of the community anymore, but because they are choosing recovery. Like holy shit, acknowledging where you are and CHOOSING to change your lifestyle to begin recovery is one of the hardest things ever. Seriously, congrats on that! No matter the ups and downs to come in the future, just know that we're thinking of you every step of the way. We'll miss you, but go live your life without this freaking ED!!!",False,False
