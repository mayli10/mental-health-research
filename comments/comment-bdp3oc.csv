I hope you're better, just sharing few thoughts to help move forward.   1. Families are sometimes triggers - i.e. they just rub us the wrong way, they're close and seen as less sensitive. I guess working on our own stress response could be one answer, working on non-destructive and more assertive responses could be another answer.  2. Other than ED - if you have anxiety, depression, trauma - those should be addressed as they prevent you from being your best self.  3. Things YOU can do yourself: Working on relaxation, de-escalation and not doing the FIRST thought in your mind - tho it may make perfect sense in the moment - you felt bad afterwards. Perhaps a short list of pros and cons.   Unfortunately the world around us is not going to change soon enough, stay hopeful and progressive - make sure you are working towards a good health.
