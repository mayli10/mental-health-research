I mean what kind of parent tells their child that they look fat at a healthy weight? A good parent wouldnt bring up appearance and maybe if you were hypothetically really overweight they would make sure you were getting nutrition and helping you find exercise and good stress management habits. Her words sound super insecure to me and she just sounds like someone you shouldnt pay too much mind to. I know it hurts though.,False,False

I want to keep losing but my mom is threatening to take me to the doctor if I don't stop dieting. I wish I could keep losing tho because I still feel so fat while she keeps telling me I look malnourished,False,False
