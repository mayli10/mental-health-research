Oatmeal/cereal, applesauce, maybe some good soups with meats, protein shakes. A baked/mashed potato (if you have a sweet potato add cinnamon it's real good) Smoothies,  if you're not into making them then bolthouse and naked both make good ones with convenient calorie counts. Yogurts, the chobani flips are especialy tasty, and filling (I think). String cheese. Avocados are lovely,  scrambled eggs.  That's all I can think of right now",False,False
