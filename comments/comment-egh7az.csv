Also stress? I get hella anxious when my brain gets enough energy to start ramping up the anxiety thoughts. When that happens I will not eat because my racing crazy brain is back and food is the last thing I’m worried about. It kinda makes sense that depression would work the same, right? Idk. I probs need to try Zoloft or whatever again to get the anxiety in check so I can actually be a person/ have a chance at recovery but I also don’t want to have to take it/ don’t want to have to recover sooooo.... 🤦‍♀️🤡🤦‍♀️",False,False
