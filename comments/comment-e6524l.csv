I’m not used to going to the doc unless I’ve dislocated something or am unconscious but my head hurts pretty bad so you’re right it could be a mild concussion,False,True

I fainted more when I was overweight than I do now.   Check your electrolytes. Also go to a doctor about your head. You might have a mild concussion!   You're not a fake. Take care of yourself &lt;3,False,False
