I went to the restroom and came back and the girl I was with was at the buffet, clearly trying to hurry before I came back. Like, I don't give a fuck about what you're eating or how much, so don't worry about me either. ",False,False

My ex has weight issues and is way more disordered than me. I lost weight unintentionally and just decided to maintain it. He kept saying I need to eat and gain weight and I‚Äôm skinny blah blah blah. I straight up showed him my body and said do I look too thin?? And he was like ‚Äúwell the number you weigh is just crazy to me‚Äù and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúam I too skinny answer?‚Äù And he was like no. You look good. My girlfriends and mom understand too. But other family? They all want me to gain weight but talk trash about anyone in the fam that has gained. Smh. Sabotagers.,False,False

It feels weird to cross that boundary. The woman in the corner shop across from the office commented on my weight loss in a concerned older-Indian-lady way. That was a new low,False,False
