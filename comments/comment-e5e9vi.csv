Their comments will have less weight (haha) to them if you are secure within yourself. This is easier said than done obviously but it's not impossible. You can start small by just avoiding insulting yourself (if that's something you do) and move up to saying one positive thing about yourself per day ect ect. It will take a minute but faking it til you make it works in this scenario. I really like the ig user @ paigespath . She promotes body acceptance and fitness for the purposes of feeling good. She isnt a ""recovery"" influencer but I suspect she comes from a disordered past. I know this is all super tough and frustrating but if you choose to put in the work tword self love and self acceptance it will pay off. I been telling myself latley that I have 2 options,  either I choose to recover or I choose to hate my fucking life. Lmao I went on a lil rant there but i hope you get what I'm saying. Best of luck sis!!",False,False
