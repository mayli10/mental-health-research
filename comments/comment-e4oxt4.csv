It shows how absolutely normalized violence is to you and how much you've internalized it as being your fault and common, when it's neither. &lt;3  I can see from your response that perhaps you're feeling threatened by a conversation about abuse, which is my sign to not push it any further. I'll leave you with some domestic violence resources in case you ever do reach a point where you want to seek help, though that is ultimately your decision.  I wish you all the best and please feel free to message me if you ever need someone to talk to. I hope, as another commenter wrote, that one day you are able to recognize that you aren't abusive, you don't deserve this, it's not your fault, and it's not okay. Sending you love.  https://www.thehotline.org/  https://www.loveisrespect.org/",False,False

I realize it can take a while to come to terms with this kind of thing, but when you are finally able to accept that you didn‚Äôt deserve any of it, I hope you can get the help and support you need. üíï",False,False

My dads a man and he has control over the family - my mum doesn‚Äôt make decisions for the family. I think being a bitch is my fault and I deserve punishment for that. He‚Äôs only ever strangled me once and I deserved that. I sometimes hit my head against the walls (it‚Äôs not legitimate self harm but I like punishing myself) and that breaks the house and he gets angry. He also gets angry when I purge. It‚Äôs my fault. This isn‚Äôt an abusive relationship - I‚Äôm hiding the horrible things I do because I‚Äôm ashamed of them. If anything I am the abuser here haha. Even my sister agrees it was my fault he tried to strangle me. And he does promise to change but I‚Äôm preventing him from changing things. It really feels like my fault.   Also when people are stressed they do things they regret. I once told my dad I was suicidal when I was stressed and he told me to just do it he didn‚Äôt care. He didn‚Äôt mean that he was just stressed out. I‚Äôm not supposed to tell him that kind of stuff anyway. My mum yells at me when I do. I‚Äôm 17 and an adult too old for this.   I‚Äôm not minimising anything - honestly I‚Äôm maximising it. I don‚Äôt get kicked or raped every day and he‚Äôs never sexually abused me. He‚Äôs never killed me. It‚Äôs not a big deal - he only loses his temper a couple of times a year when I make him.   Thank you so much for your help.,False,True

You're not being dramatic at all; this sounds very scary and painful and also confusing. I do have to be honest - some of your statements involve a lot of minimizing and rationalizing, which are common responses to abuse. It's kind of like a coping mechanism - ""It wasn't that bad, they didn't mean it"" - because coming to terms that it's abuse can be exceedingly painful. It's also a way to feel as if you have control over the abuse - ""If it's my fault, I can prevent it from happening again.""  No one ever provokes abuse. You didn't put him in a situation that caused him to abuse you; he chose to harm you. That is on him, not you. I also don't think you are abusive. In any sort of relationship, two people can engage in unhealthy behaviors, but in an abusive relationship one person uses more severe and more frequent violence and they have more control. That person sounds like your dad.  The threats are abusive too, in addition to the physical violence.  Maybe these readings will help.  https://www.thehotline.org/is-this-abuse/  This describes the cycle of abuse, which includes apologies and promises to change - which is what your dad has been doing.  http://envisioncounsellingcentre.com/innerpage/resources/partner-abuse/cycle-of-abuse/  And if he ever, ever puts pressure on your neck, please seek medical attention. I'm going to share some information about strangulation here because it's a huge risk factor for death.  https://www.thehotline.org/2016/03/15/the-dangers-of-strangulation/  You deserve to be safe and happy, and this is far from safe.

No amount of testosterone would make someone do this is they were already willing to be violent and harmful.

Kicking or strangling your child is on a completely different level. I‚Äôm not saying you didn‚Äôt do anything wrong, because it sounds like you didn‚Äôt act the greatest, but a mature adult would be able to deal with that without violence. Kindness and love, in my opinion, is an essential part of being a parent. Children shouldn‚Äôt need to earn basic kindness and love from their parents - it‚Äôs the parents‚Äô job to give it. And even if you don‚Äôt believe your parents should love you or treat you with basic respect, violence is so far below that and is NEVER okay.",False,False

I should specify that he isn't normally violent - about every year or so he cracks. I don't think I can blame him for this - if anything, we both need to accept what we did wrong and make up like adults. In my view, kindness and love isn't something that comes automatically, it's something you work for. But I could be wrong.
