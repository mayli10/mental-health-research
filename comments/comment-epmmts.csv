I hate how heavy food is in every way. Like when you go out to eat and the plate is too heavy with food i dont want it because i dont wanna put that much weight in my stomach and if i eat any i purge.  Its gone from trying to be skinny to trying to eat as little as i can without being hungry or full,False,False
