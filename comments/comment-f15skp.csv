If anything, it shows envy of you and your body because, really, wouldn't we all love to look like runway models while eating like My 600lb Life participants (not saying that's what you do). It sounds like another way of saying ""I wish I had your metabolism"", ""you're lucky to have your cake and eat it too"", etc. It's a compliment, it conveys that they'd like to have that as well and are jealous, it's not a negative statement on your behaviors. That being said, you have a right to feel how you feel about that statement, but do realize that your feelings are probably skewed by placing an undue negative connotation on that comment. In CBT they say that what you think is what you feel, so if you interpret something negatively you will feel negative about the situation/yourself, even if the comment was meant as something positive. So maybe try to interpret those comments from the viewpoint of the people making them instead of seeing them through your negative ED-fueled bias. And of course you should always just tell your parents that you feel uncomfortable with remarks about your eating/body and would prefer them not to do that anymore.",False,False
