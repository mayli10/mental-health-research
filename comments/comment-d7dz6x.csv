I‚Äôm the same whenever I go back to my parents‚Äô. They provide a lot of my Binge staples(tm) and their internet is essentially non-existent so I‚Äôm bored out of mind and end up bored eating.   What helps me is if I bring over safe foods I can default to instead and literally hide the Bad Stuff behind other foods and find lots of stuff to distract myself. I started epilating my legs instead of shaving and it takes like 2+ hours, take baths for at least an hour, find games on my DS that suck me in, the usual books and TV shows I don‚Äôt want to get up from. I‚Äôll do face masks I can‚Äôt move my face in, paint my nails 15 times in one day... lots of ‚Äúself-care‚Äù shit. Look up super low-calorie recipes that take a long time to make so I‚Äôm doing something and making something that‚Äôs safe. I‚Äôll go outside and sunbathe, or go for a walk/run. In general, I‚Äôll try to get out of the house as much as possible. I volunteer a lot in between working, so that keeps me from eating in general.   Also I c&amp;s a lot &lt;_&lt;",False,False
