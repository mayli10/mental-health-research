It‚Äôs not hard to try and not talk about weight or food but in this context what she said does seem a lot more baffling. I hope she didn‚Äôt seriously trigger you.,False,False

Sure she should never have said something like that to an ED-sufferer, but she didn‚Äôt know, and she also didn‚Äôt say to not eat at all just to not ‚Äúgo overboard‚Äù, which to me sounds like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt binge.‚Äù",False,False
