I find the further and faster I go, the more I want to eat and sleep in a way that helps improve my times (as if I'm a real athlete :\\\\\\\\ lol). It is hard not to punish myself for skipping a run (or three, as I did this week, purely because it's cold) but I'm working on it.  Also sorry about your injury, they're really the worst! But food will help heal it and you'll be back to running in no time.",False,False

I love running so much and when I restrict too severely my runs are just slow frustrating suffer-fests. I swear my lung capacity is massively reduced...or at least thatâ€™s how it feels.   (But then I got injured...aaaand cue the voice telling me if that Iâ€™m not running then I shouldnâ€™t need food. Gah.),False,False
