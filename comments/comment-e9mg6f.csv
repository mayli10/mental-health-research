Sorry I must have worded it weird. I was eating my whole advent calendar silently when he said you'll be going out tomorrow to by a new one and I was like no and he was like yea you will and maybe you won't eat that one if you can have some self control.

Otherwise, what he said sounds really fucked up. I don't think him agreeing with you on you statement is necessarily THAT bad, like ""I have no self control lol."" And him just being like ""yeah..."" dismissively. That's just kind of ignorance to the situation and when you're constantly (not saying this is the case tho it might be) trying to comfort someone who continuously disparages themselves it can become frustrating and tiresome (it really takes the effort of both parties to feel better.)  The part I CANT defend him on is the fact that he actually liked re-stated it and kind of agreed?? It goes beyond being tired of comforting someone in vain, it takes it to a level of actively being a dick. Maybe you could try and initiate a conversation about it and see if that's the problem, him being tired of it, I really doubt he actually feels what he said...and if he does you should drop him lol.",False,False

Like if you had a little baggy of chocolates or whatever that isn’t even an above average serving. I’m not saying he was being ~nice~ but like he’s her boyfriend of a year, people who love each other say shit to one one another all the time. It’s probably just about opening a day by day calender early. Sometimes they have toys instead of chocolate or fun jokes or IDK I LIKE OPENING STUFF.

I would definitely talk to him. If he’s a good guy he will understand and be more careful and if he’s not then you can move on and you know he’s not right for you.

Then you’ll be in a good spot to say something like “I was already feeling pretty down on myself and guilty for eating so much chocolate, so hearing from someone I care about that you didn’t expect me to even have the self control not to buy a second calendar really doubled down the way I was already mad at/feeling about myself.

Like everything you said makes so much sense. I guess part of me is worried that if I tell him he'll leave me because he would think I have an ED and he's said early on that he doesn't want to be in a relationship with someone with an ED because he had a bad experience with a previous gf. Which is fine if that's what he wants but it also means I think it's hard to tell him he's being triggering. I think that's my own abandonment thing happening too though. I'll work through it.
