Nothing I did the last 17 months is working. 1200 calories, IF, and my willpower aren't working. I have also tried to do at least one or the other unsuccessfully. This week I gave up and raised my goal to 1400 calories and cut the IF to 13 hours. Valentines day went through the window, but today I did better. Im hoping one thing will lead to the other to lose the 4 pounds I don't really need.",False,False

I'm literally in this exact same boat right now. Legit made a post a few days ago complaining about PMS and how it's making me eat everything. Update: period still isn't here, and I'm still legitimately ravenous all the fucking time. I'm not talking small pangs after a few hours of no eating: I'll be in the middle of a fucking plate and my stomach will be growling. I had some ribs for lunch today (which normally means I'm beyond good for the rest of the day) and I was honest to God STARVING like 30 mins later.   I honestly don't know what to do. I'm sitting here probably 2000 calories in for the day and I'm starving, so I refuse to leave my bedroom until tomorrow. Last night, I fell asleep with my stomach grumbling. I'm about to McFreakin lose it. Don't know why my body is doing this shit, I'm a fat ass compared to everyone here. You've got plenty of damn calories to live off, ugh",False,False

I couldnt imagine living with my uw tdee for the rest of my life, but now its easy. It took about 3 months of forcing myself to eat at maintenance until my appetite changed tho. I dont crave the same food I craved before and I feel full sooner into a meal. Im debating with myself if I should continue losing or just maintain and call it recovery.",False,False

How long exactly will depend on a lot factors but you just gotta get past the initial hurdle of your body going OMG WE'RE DYING (because lbh it is), and your body will eventually adjust and calm the fuck down.  thats what happened to me about 4 kgs ago (my original UGW lol), basically you just keep moving the goal post...",False,False

I always thought it was my body going into ""survival mode"" after a certain amount of time being hungry.
