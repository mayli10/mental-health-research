I never thought I had much influence on him and i was surprised my ed behaviour influenced him so much. I showed him how to count calories and track his weight but I never expected him to cut down to a few hundred calories like I did. I think he saw the way i thought about my own body and thought that I applied that to him as well, which i didn't intend.   The relapse is really consuming me right now. I need to try and do better for both of us and i don't want him to end up like me.",False,False

I have seen a lot of messed up shit on eating disorder forums but this one is on a whole 'nother level. This is awful.
