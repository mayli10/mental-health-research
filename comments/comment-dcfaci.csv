Then there is stuff that‚Äôs intended to be skintight (bodycon stuff) and a large looks TINY.,False,False

Either the same item is being sourced from two different factories, one or both of which is cutting off-standard, or the items are coming from a single factory with poor quality control. Unfortunately, this is par for the course with any brands whose clothing is manufactured overseas (which, at the average person's price point, is all of them). The cheaper the brand, the more likely this is to happen, but no brand is immune.   From an ED perspective, it's especially enraging.",False,False
