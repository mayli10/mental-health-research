I was aware of this but never really felt concious about it. One day i decided to lose a bit of weight. Not really for appearance reasons but more for physical performance and to be a bit fitter.   At first i went down to 1100 calories. I actually thought this was a healthy amount at the time since i barely knew anything about weight loss. Did this for about a month when one day i went for lunch with one of my friends. I ate ALOT that day (like even by normal people standards) and felt guilty about going way over limit.  This is where it gets bad. The day after i went down to 500 a day. I fluctuated between calorie limits for the next 4 months or so, ranging from 900 a day to 300 a day. I started to exercise more but never really over did it. It was always a healthy amount. Weight came off like crazy. My periods stopped and my body was crumbling.   Since late december i've been in recovery with the help of a dietician and a psycologist. In early jan i was hospitalised for a few days and although it was more a precautionary thing it pretty much made me wake up and realise that this isn't healthy and that i needed to change. Since then i have been given a meal plan that i do my best to follow and can proudly say that i can now eat 1600 calories a day without guilt and am ok with gaining a bit of weight, something i never would have dreamed of a couple months ago.  I still have a fair way to go with recovery (stopping habit of calories counting, being more comfortable with eating more than 1600 etc) i'm confident that i can overcome this. I set myself a goal to be able to eat a slice of cake in my birthday that is in a couple weeks and i don't think thats gonna happen :( maybe we can aim for a bit of chocolate on easter.  Sorry for the long text lol",False,False

Obvious cw for eating disorders, also reference to sexual assault. I’m going to go cry, I think, and have some sleep.  —  I was a tiny kid. My dad called me his Air Plant. Took my calories from somewhere, but it must have been thin air. I ate bites at a time. I was healthy, if a bit spacey and neurotic for a child. I was fine.  I was a gymnast for five years before repetitive stress injuries and growing too tall put an end to that dream. I wanted to be good, but I knew I didn’t have the right body type to be the best, and I was scared of not being good enough. I regret quitting.  I started my period before anyone I knew at 10. I began swimming obsessively. I ate mostly toast, in horrifying amounts. My weight was not disproportionate to my height, but to me it felt unbelievably massive. In hindsight, my body was not outside of normal ranges for a girl hitting puberty. All I could see was that everything was changing, and the space that I took up was so much more vast than the space to which I felt entitled to occupy. I wanted to go back to being an air plant. I wanted to go back to being a tiny gymnast. I wanted to go back to being a kid who couldn’t wear any pants but leggings because nothing else stayed up. I wanted to go back to not being different from the boys, not being looked at like I was on sale. I didn’t want to exist like this. I wasn’t ready.  In middle school, a switch flipped. At the beginning of eighth grade, I was exercising compulsively and still subsisting on toast in unhealthy quantities. I still looked OK, as long as you didn’t look too closely. In eighth grade, I learned how to purge by throwing up. The first time was after school lunch; I had eaten three apple slices; the panic was blinding. I went for weeks on end measuring daily intake in raisins. I blacked out at school pretty often; I wasn’t allowed to run with the rest of my gym class anymore because they were afraid of the stress on my heart. I entered intensive outpatient at 14 years old, with a BMI around 16. I stayed in that program for months. It was hell.  I started high school without gaining significant weight. I stood out, and not in a good way. I looked *sick*. People knew that I had just disappeared at the end of the last year, and I heard the rumors. I wanted people to stop staring. I wished no one could see me. I still was not allowed to participate in gym class. In four years of high school, I would eat lunch in the lunchroom exactly once, and that would not be until my senior year. For all of freshman year, my mother came to school at lunchtime every day with a packed lunch and we sat in an empty room in the office as I cried so hard I felt like I might throw up. Every bite of carefully meal-planned food was agonizing. I was scared. I started self harming again. I didn’t know what was happening to me. What started out as me being in control had turned into me being completely powerless, and I didn’t know what I had done to cause it, but I knew I had to have deserved it. I wanted to die.   Weight restoration took months. I made it back to the border of underweight and healthy BMI before relapsing hard. This cycle was repeated several times. At 16, I experienced significant sexual trauma. A few weeks later, I attempted suicide and was was involuntarily committed. They didn’t care I had a “history” of anorexia at the hospital, because it wasn’t seen as relevant, and I lost about 10 pounds in 2 weeks inpatient. I continued to cycle through relapse and recovery for two more years. It was painful for everyone. I hated myself for gaining in recovery, and I hated myself for ripping apart my family in relapse.   I graduated. I left for college at a healthy weight. I self-destructed. I was scared and overwhelmed and alone. I stopped eating almost entirely. In the few photos from that fall, I look barely alive. My eyes are the worst—completely flat. I was referred out to a specialist by the student health canter. They said that if I got sicker, I would have to go home. I was a liability to the college. I gained a pound to appease the doctor, then gained two pounds, and then stopped coming to my appointments and dropped another five. Everything was meaningless.   When I came home for winter break at 18, I weighed less than I had at 14 when I was first diagnosed. My parents were devastated. I knew I had to get better. Just before Christmas, I was a pallbearer in my uncle’s funeral, and we had to pause twice on the way down the  aisle with his coffin because I was so dizzy I couldn’t see. If I were religious, maybe that would be meaningful. My older brother couldn’t look at me. My father rocked me like a little kid in his lap after the burial as we both cried. I wished I could die without hurting anyone, without leaving behind that much pain. I just wanted it to end.  It didn’t end. I am 22 and I am still trapped. I thought I was doing better last summer, but it was just the backswing. Anorexia was just winding up. I don’t know what it’s like to just exist. I’m relapsing again. I won’t see my family until May. I have a couple months before the big consequences, the ones of hurting people who love me, are real. In eight years, the thing that has remained most consistent has been the overwhelming terror of being too much and not enough, always, at the same time. I don’t know how to escape that and I’m so afraid I’ll feel like I’m suffocating in it for the rest of my life.",False,False

Got even worse in college and I don’t know what I weighed but I was probably obese. But I had a stint in high school where I decided to stop being the chubby kid and lose weight.

Buuuut being the impatient perfectionist, I decided well if I can lose weight on 1200 cals, surely I could do 1000 cals. Then it just started going lower and lower. Until it wasn’t sustainable - so I gave up. I never really thought much about it and told myself whatever, I liked food too much. Fast forward to after college and a few months into my first post-college job, I randomly decided to go on keto. I think my perfectionist traits(?) added with how keto is about numbers and macros just pushed me into disordered eating. Suddenly I had food that I wouldn’t even look at at the store. I had to weigh everything and count every dumb macro and log it. Got to the point where I just meal prepped the same meal for myself everyday for months. Then I went from making elaborate meals to just “I guess salt and pepper will do” and my food list just started becoming smaller. I started to not eat food that I didn’t make myself.

I think they saw me being vegetarian as wanting to be different and have special treatment and any form of individuality was not okay. They didn’t call me by my preferred name, didn’t let me part my hair a certain way, we also had ALL our possessions taken from us and they provided us with our clothes and we all dressed the same. It was really fucked up, we were basically free labor for the family that owned the farm the center was on - they had us laying irrigation pipes in the fields/clearing boulders out and taking care of the animals. I tried to communicate with my parents the shit I was experiencing, but they read all our letters and if we said anything bad they never got sent, they also withheld letters from my family from me. When I finally earned the privilege to call my parents on the phone after 2 months and broke down in tears, they hung up for me because crying was “a form of manipulation”.

I was around 9-11 at the time, and according to my mom, I wasn't even chubby.  But I started restricting myself anyway.  I couldn't handle it.  My mom would spend all week trying to fix the damage my grandmother (mostly her, anyway) caused, and by the time I went back to see my grandmother on the weekend I would feel *slightly* better.  But then it started again.  She would have me weigh myself constantly.  One night I caught her changing the sensitivity of the scale so it looked like I gained five, ten, twenty pounds overnight.  I was a fucking *kid.*  I didn't know any better.  I started middle school and I got braces in seventh grade.   I was 13.  I lost a *lot* of weight.  I finally felt confident.  Was I too skinny?  Yes, but...I finally loved my body, so was it really that bad?  Once I got my braces off I gained a little weight back, I could tell, but because of my grandmother my mother had to get rid of the scale in the house because I was constantly checking it.  Fast forward to now.  I'm 18 and in college.  I started dating a guy, and I love him deeply, but because of our lack of time with college and the lack of healthy establishments to partake in, I started eating fast food.  And a lot of it.  At first I noticed my thighs getting a tiny bit...bigger.  He gave me confience, told me it was okay, and it reasurred me even though my weight was CONSTANTLY on my mind.  It got worse.  I gained 10, 20, 30 pounds...and when I went to the doctors I saw the weight I gained.  The ACTUAL number.  And I got scared.  I was terrified.  I was insecure and I felt like I was back at my grandmother's house.    I started working out to burn the calories I consumed.  I was still gaining weight.  I didn't understand.  Maybe it was muscle, maybe it was water weight, I don't know, but I didn't care.  My boyfriend became worried when I started eating much less...but now I am losing weight.  I have control.  I can finally control my weight again.    I shouldn't feel proud, I shouldn't feel happy, I shouldn't get on the scale multiple times a day because it isn't healthy.  But I can't stop and the awful memories fuel me to lose more weight.  My boyfriend asked me what I am going to do once I reach my goal weight.  I honestly don't know what to tell him.  I don't even know what will happen.  Will I be able to stop?  I don't know.  I really don't.    Sorry for such a long post, wow.  I didn't realize it would be this bad.

While I was in “treatment” I developed a lot of specific food aversions and coped with being forced to eat meat by combining food in weird ways (like dipping my turkey sandwich in yogurt to mask the taste of meat, something the counselors there noticed and stopped me from doing which only made my food anxiety a million times worse). They punished us by making us run sprints in the freezing cold, sometimes I would be disobedient on purpose hoping the punishment would slow my weight gain.

I really don’t know how or why it started, my therapists all seemed to think it was due to something traumatic that happened when I was little. I’m currently investigating it with psychedelic therapy, but I don’t have the answers yet.  ",False,False

It was the first time I'd ever seen anything related to EDs outside of what we learned in health class. The account would post their daily intake, body checks, etc. At this point I was pretty unhappy with my body and remember thinking ""HM interesting"". It sounds dumb as fuck but I had never really realized that not eating = being thinner. For the next few days I skipped breakfast and lunch, just as an experiment. And then one day I woke up with visible hip bones and it was all downhill from there :^) Back then I didn't track calories, I didn't weigh myself, I didn't obsess over food. It was as easy and simple as just not eating. It helped that I had a pretty toxic friend group and my two best friends also suffered from disordered eating. That was...five years ago? Four? It's not easy anymore lmao rip",False,False

I never had a weight issue as a kid, never was chubby or stickly .. nothing to bring any attention to myself in any particular light.   The first time I REALLY recall an issue starting was in 9th grade in biology. I was sitting next to a friend of mine and he legit turns to me and says “omg what is that scar on your leg it looks like something bit you bad”. And he wasn’t being mean or anything ... I look down and realize when I was sitting my thigh was dimpling on the side (cellulite) so it looked like weird holes. I was mortified. I just said like wtf that’s just how legs look and shrugged it off .. but I was never the same after 😂😭",False,False
