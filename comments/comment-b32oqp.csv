One of the teachers that knows about it sometimes comes up to me *in front of my friends and other people* and says things like ""how are you going with eating? Are you doing alright?"" And things like that. She is genuinely trying to be helpful and i appreciate that but really it does the opposite and embarasses me. I just want her to back off and leave it to me. I've got it under control and if i lose that control there are other people in my life who can help me deal with that.",False,False

Someone who is on my football team asked me why i only go to training one day a week (they train twice a week, but i only go once because of my ED and i'm not suppose to be excersising much in recovery) and i told them it's because of a 'personal reason'. I mean it is but i probably would have told him if we were alone and not in class because i'm embarrassed about it.  The annoying thing is that he kept pushing and going ""just tell me, i'm curious now"" and stuff like that.  A couple of teachers at school know about my ED and when we pass each other i feel awkward knowing that they know i have an ED. Idk it just makes me uncomfortable.",False,False
