Considering how quickly you started bleeding there might even be existing damage to the stomach that you aggravated. Whenever you next see your doctor you should mention that you threw up blood (you can say you were really sick for a week or something if you don't want to admit to purging) and want to get your stomach checked out. They will likely start with a CT scan and then move on to an endoscopy test if they don't find anything.,False,False
