I always tell myself I'll just b/p once and then get right onto it!! 2 hours later I'm a swollen red-eyed mess and the last thing I wanna do is study. I need at least an hour to recover mentally.",False,False

It's easy to ignore it when you're busy with something that takes all of your complete attention but studying is on a whole other level. And trying to b/p in the midst is fucking brutal, while I'm at it.",False,True

For some reason, I can barely stomach the idea of food before class and in the middle of it but I immediately feel like I'm legit *starving* as soon as I'm back to my own quarters and faced with the reality that I'm probably about to pull an all nighter or something.",False,True

Its like my brain goes, ""ÿou know you wont be able to get it done if you binge right now and once youve started you cant do shit about it so just do it"" and I go full fuck it mode and I binge. Sometimes I dont even feel like binging but do it anyway because the stress of uni is so much. I'm failing classes, its great. Love this disorder.",False,False
