Specifically as it relates to panic attacks, I was having so many every day last year and I didn't know why. The simple suggestion of my therapist to write down *everything* I was thinking when they happened saved me. So many of the things I was worried about were related to the same concepts (not trusting my family, being scared of things I couldn't control, worrying about what people were thinking about me etc. etc.) but I never would have been able to recognize those patterns if I didn't have a literal record of them going over weeks. Even if you think you're worried or set off by ""nothing,"" after a while you will start to see that it's *something* you just have to be able to identify it.",False,False

There is no magic bullet or quick fix. I am Sean I am 35 and I started in anorexia and moved into bulimia and now I am somewhere in between.   First thing I would advise you to do is stop and catch your thoughts. It happened. We can’t change that, but we can work on future behavior.   The thing about the binge/purge cycle is that it comes from a very subconscious place. (So do you have anyone you can discuss it with it friend, family member or health care professional.) The why, the where and the when. How were you feeling in the run up to the binge, during the binge and after the binge? Mentally and physically.   You said above you have a binge fast cycle. After long periods of restricting or fasting your body is in a lot of times a hypertension state. The subconscious over rules your conscious mind and cries out for food intake. In a lot of cases.   Always remember we are hard wired to consume certain foods in priority due to evolutionary tendencies. Sugars, Fats, caffeine’s etc our body craves them like a drug. Some foods can be dynamite and can trigger or sustain a binge purge cycle.       Also, taste is a very powerful sense when it comes to memory. Tasting certain foods can evoke this memory. Resulting in a feeling of comfort and contentment. This is fleeting and regret and shame can cause the purge mechanism to be invoked.  You need to look at a lot of things. For now, take away the shame. It happened and let your thoughts settle if you want I am here, and we can chat. Don’t think positive or negative, good or bad just understanding this.",False,False
