I've been going around here probably contrariwise to the rules saying that the golden rule is to eat for nutrient density. Counting macros MAY be useful, but if it causes you to become anxious, don't bother counting. This sort of rule is naturally going to steer you towards things like eggs, meat, fish, cheese, liver, and nonstarchy vegetables. The calories per gram is high but you don't need to eat much to feel full because it's all protein and fat, not carbohydrate (which for some people has an orexigenic (makes you eat more) effect).  __Given that you are currently UW, I cannot condone fasting like I usually cautiously do.__ Most of the benefits of fasting in blowing out the cobwebs can be derived simply by ensuring that what you eat is all high in nutrients and unprocessed.  The weight, if you are worried about it, is secondary. Right now you should want to focus on proper nutrition, so eat to satiety. On this kind of diet, if you are insulin resistant, that will rapidly clear. Your weight will probably rise on this kind of diet. If that is something you want, it is good.",False,False
