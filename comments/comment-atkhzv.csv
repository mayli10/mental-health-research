I won't be too specific about amounts as to not hinder your recovery  Breakfast I eat egg whites and guac, lunch I eat some type of soup with tofu in it that I make on sunday and portion into 5 parts for the weekday, dinner lately i'm eating vegan tacos with vegan chicken and a huge salad. I also eat fruits and nut butter throughout the day if I'm hungry. I bring fruit to work and have peanut butter at my desk.",False,False

Between 500-600 calories for the meal (I was hungry in recovery XD) but it can easily be halved/ingredients substituted. This made 3 servings for me  3/4 cup of rice 1 tbsp olive oil 1 chopped tomato 1 sliced pepper 2 handfuls of kale 1 can of chickpeas 1 can of coconut milk (where most of the calories came from!) Curry powder, garlic powder, onion powder, maple syrup, and coconut aminos to taste. I added a TON of curry powder, at least 3 tbsp but probably a lot more. I think I started with 1 tbsp of coconut aminos and maple syrup each, and kept adjusting until I liked the taste.   So fry the vegetables in olive oil, start heating up the coconut milk and chickpeas together in another pot, and cook the rice separately. Mix together the vegetables and chickpeas, add a butt load of seasonings, heat until it’s cooked and serve with rice!  If you don’t feel comfortable with the calories, you could use water instead of oil, or a milk substitute for the coconut milk. But I thought this was really delicious the way it was!",False,False

I’m sure rice would be pretty good in them, too! I also make a lot of wraps - wraps, hummus, cheese, and meat. When I was recovering, I made roasted chickpea wraps and chickpea curry with rice, which was SOOO good. I could give you the recipe if you’re interested, lol. I think there’s a meal prep subreddit too",False,False
