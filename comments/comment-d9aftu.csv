This is not the same as this guy doesnt offer his food to people but watching it just sets something off in me.  Theres a guy at work and on his break he gets out a buffet and thats not an exaggeration. Everyday without fail he eats a tub of ben and Jerry's and a pack of waffles and will have something different on the side each day like a sandwich or fried chicken or something.  Its so triggering because hes so skinny.. and he eats it everyday. Where as if I have more than my designated 150cal lunch, I gain 10lbs ðŸ™ƒ",False,False
