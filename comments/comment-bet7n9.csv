I restrict sodium pretty heavily, it's probably my second biggest concern besides calories themselves, and I did eat a lot more than usual yesterday but not beyond the normal people guidelines. Rationally I know that I'm holding onto water from that, but 8 pounds??  Same with the BM tbh and I haven't noticed a change with that any time recently  I weigh myself every morning and after every run. Often other times too, and I jot everything down but I only add the early morning ones to MFP so I can see a graph that's all the same time &amp; always before morning coffee",False,True

How frequently do you weigh yourself?   My scale didn’t move for three days but I realized my bowels hadn’t either for over a week. I shit you not, pun intended, once I dealt with that I was down three pounds. Depending on what you’ve eaten, maybe retaining water? Assuming you’re female, where are you in your cycle? That can effect water retention as well.",False,False
