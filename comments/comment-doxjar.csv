I just got out of my own stoner rut and started a WFPBD in an effort to redefine my relationship with food after battling an ED for about 10 years. Those two changes have made a huge difference and honestly, eating isn't a mental chore anymore bc I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that what I'm eating is good for me (yay!). But it's physically difficult to eat enough, bc like you,  I struggle to feel hungry as well and my body will literally not let me eat certain foods, or eat more ""safe"" food past a certain point (even if I'm not close to my caloric requirements, yikes).   Not super helpful, I know, but I think that it's just going to take time to ""stretch"" your stomach so that it can tolerate more food, and to reestablish the hunger signals that have been off balance/silenced for so long. I totally understand how frustrating it is bc I'm in the same boat - you make an effort to change and the residual effects of the ED influence your ability to properly carry out those changes, even though you really *want* to.   I'm not quite sure what types of foods you have aversions to (sorry if my suggestions are way off!!), but in the meantime, maybe try things that are tame in flavor and smell, but still nutrient dense, like sweet potatoes, quinoa, or eggs? Sendin' good vibes your way and hope everything works out!!!",False,False
