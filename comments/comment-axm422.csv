Œ≤-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate are the names of the ketones that your body uses for fuel when it is burning fat.  One of the waste products of burning that fat is acetone, and that's what causes the smell.  Adding more dietary fat would just be providing more of the same fuel that's causing the smell in the first place.  It wouldn't make the smell any worse, but it wouldn't decrease it either.",False,False

I thought it was being sick, but I think its ketosis, which is both triggering and reassuring? Also tmi but I think ketosis changes all body secretion smells, my breath/mouth smelt/taste different when I'm deep into a restrictive period.  Much more tmi: might not be ketosis but of my ex girlfriends which have had EDs I've noticed they taste different too when they're relapsing or recovering. I dont know if that's ketosis, or just what they were eating, though.  ",False,False
