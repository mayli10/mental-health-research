I stopped strict calorie counting a few years ago and it‚Äôs been so freeing. Obviously I still have issues but it makes eating have so much less anxiety around it, I binge far less, and it just makes me feel so much more normal. I probably actually eat less a lot of days than I would if I were counting up",False,False

It's a goal to aim for and it's something I'm definitely going to try hard for very soon.  That and I really want to stop weighing myself all the damn time.

I always come back the same weight and it‚Äôs so incredible. My body doesn‚Äôt gain. I sound like a spoilt brat but I guess I just need to be on vacay in Tulum and I‚Äôll be fine.  Also I‚Äôve been single for a while and whenever I have a bf, I do not binge &amp; purge as much. I can honestly say that when I go through break ups I get so much anxiety and get so depressed not only because I‚Äôm losing my best friend and boyfriend but because I‚Äôm losing that thing that stops me from hurting myself.    It sucks that having a man in my life is the only thing that semi helps me. It‚Äôs so counter intuitive though because having an eating disorder or the disordered brain has hindered all my relationships and makes me so depressed when I think about two guys that I would‚Äôve liked to have ended up with.
