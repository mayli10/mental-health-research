I remember one time my dog carried it off üòÖ  This thread has only just now made me recognise some of my mom's behaviour around eating as being secretive/hoarding and that makes me so sad.

I would sneak food away into my room or even outside at one point because I was afraid of judgement if I was seen eating it.

I'm not in the US but the high school/college sports circuit there seems INSANE. The stress they put kids under to perform just for the jollies of has-been adult coaches always looked sick to me. I wondered if all the kids doing it were just as motivated to succeed but obviously not, they just had no power to say no.  This is why I'm so frustrated when people talk about the health impact of gaining weight as if it's the most important or worst thing in the world. There are loads of health complications associated with athletics and dieting too, and this is just an example. The fact that one is reviled when it might actually be more helpful for an individual at that moment in time where the other is celebrated even if it's ruining their life is sickening.   I hope you can work through those scars eventually. We're always here to help. :(",False,True

Won state for track. For basketball. For Cross Country. The girl's program was unbeatable and we were held to a CRAZY high standard which looking back I'm like... this was public school. But it was a cult. If you wanted to get a scholarship and play sports in college, it was almost guaranteed, but you had to fight for your spot.   &amp;#x200B;  So, remember school lunches? A corn dog, shitty fruit cup, and a half pint of milk, that's it? My high school was tiny so there was only one entree item- if you didn't like it tough luck, should have brought your lunch. But I was on the free lunch program, I was too poor to bring my lunch in every day.  It wasn't just sports that was strict, the whole school was. We had 30 minutes for four grades to get through the lunch line, sit down and eat. After 30 minutes you're hustled back out and you can NOT take any food out with you or you will get detention. So if you were a little late to the cafeteria and banished to the back of the line, you might only have 2 or 3 minutes to sit down and eat lunch. I was in athletics, and had no choice but to eat the meager lunch options.   &amp;#x200B;  Athletics meant 5:00am running + strength and conditioning, mon-fri. Staying once school let out until 6:30pm for sports practice and punishment if the team didn't reach certain thresholds (didn't get enough rebounds during a game for basketball, cross country team came in second at a meet, etc. really hard thresholds to meet- we always had to run 2 miles punishment after practice almost everyday). Looking back this was incredibly fucked up to put a bunch of 14-18 year olds through. So many girls I went to high school with have developed EDs because of being screamed at if weigh-ins showed big fluctuations, or being too exhausted to run an 7 minute mile after week after week of hardcore conditioning. I remember gaining 10lbs once because I was so hungry I was constantly binging at home, and the coaches made everyone gather round when I was getting weighed and told them this is what a bad athlete looks like- if you're gaining weight you're not working hard enough. I wanted to quit so bad but my parents wanted me to get a full athletic scholarship and refused. This was the same for many girls. We cried in the locker room together because we felt trapped and this was the only way to pay for college.   &amp;#x200B;  I quit my senior year after screaming matches with my mom. Parents started being concerned, but you can't fight results like they have, undefeated at everything. It's still happening and I try to tell people but everyone's like ""oh, that's just how high school athletics is, you were too weak to hack it, huh :)"" Anyway I didn't get an athletic scholarship, but I still am dealing with the emotional issues of gaining any weight, destroying my poor fucking joints as a teen, and the fear of feeling trapped. Hooray :)",False,False

My first instinct is to say I don't think it affected me but obviously it did... I do understand that a lot of what my mother did/said to me was because she was panicking herself and just trying to protect me from going through what she went through, but still.   I remember asking her for dessert one time when we were getting lunch at a cafe and she got angry so I dropped it, said it was okay and I didn't want it, etc. Then later I was excitedly taking about baking and asked her if she thought I could run a bakery one day and she said ""No, because you'd just eat it all,"" with a judgemental expression.

I'm SO sorry you had to go through a childhood with that monster. She was obviously just projecting onto you because she had power for the first time in her life, but it's a lot harder to be sure of that when you're a literal child :/ That sounds like a nightmare.

There was only one time when I wouldn't eat what I was given and they forced me to sit there until I did. It was literally inedible to my child palette (it was like... lentil soup) so I think after a couple of hours of me just sitting sadly looking at this plate they let me leave LOL.  I can definitely relate to your sudden freedom of living alone and realising that you're in complete control of everything in your kitchen. I went the opposite way for a while (lots of uncontrolled binging) and then kind of veered into restricting.   Thank you for sharing this, it was really interesting to read, especially about your parents guilt tripping you into eating the food they bought for you. That's a huge one. Like on the one hand I understand feeling upset if your kid doesn't want something you got specially for them, but on the other hand isn't it great that they understand themselves well enough to say no? I'm sorry you had to deal with that. :(",False,True

Cool times rofl. She also told me at 12 WHILE I WAS IN THE SHOWER that no one would love me because I was ugly and fat (I was actually heathy/underweight for a child but she was a big lady so she probably hated me for being a skinny kid) so yeah I can pretty much narrow my ED beginnings to her.,False,False

She absolutely was teaching you to basically hide/hoard your food...? Parents who fuck with their children's natural inclination to eat and teach them to be scared about food availability make me so angry. Why tf did she only give you 10 minutes??

And there was also a weird pressure to eat the sweets they bought for me. It was like a guilt trip if I didn‚Äôt eat them bc they bought them for me and I like sweets so why am I not eating them??
