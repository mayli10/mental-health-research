I finally updated my wardrobe, but have already sold many of my new things because I know I’ll never feel worthy of wearing them, even though they fit. I finally dropped the small amount of weight I needed to be able to venture outside - I have PCOS &amp; weight loss is so fucking slow even with mid-restriction - but now it’s too hot &amp; humid to go for the hours-long walks I used to enjoy so I guess I’ll just be stuck inside until autumn.",False,False
