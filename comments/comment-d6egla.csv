Ask to meet up and do stuff. Message them. Send them a funny pic you saw or something you think is interesting. Don't get worried you're annoying them because I promise you they'll be just as happy to talk to someone as you are. Your best friend is definitely out there somewhere, you just have to find them!",False,False

I don’t feel like I can’t make friends I just can’t, whatever opportunities I get I do really really try but I’m always the persons ‘friend’ for no more than a day before they forget I exist and I very rarely have the opportunity to even make friends so it’s a very rare occurrence.",False,True

You *definitely* shouldn't open up to her. You'll only feel worse and embarassed about being emotionally vulnerable in front of someone who doesn't really respect you and doesn't deserve to see that part of you.  Why do you feel like you can't make new friends?",False,False

I know I should but in the past she has told me while drunk that I’m a horrible selfish piece of shit because I ‘project’ all my issues onto her (I opened about my suicidal thoughts and behaviour) and make her feel like she can’t talk about her issues so since then I haven’t told her anything personal really, I know I need new friends but she’s the only friend I have and all my attempts at making new friends failed miserably",False,True

You feel a dissonance between the disordered side of your life and the person you present to the world. you just want somebody to see the real you and realise that you're suffering. Maybe you should try opening up and talking to her about it honestly?,False,False
