I would think that just not purging completely would be a much more significant factor in weight gain.",False,False

And to be fair, it would be incredibly hard to study because of ethical considerations. The first year I had bulimia, I lost a fuck ton of weight. Now on year 8, I gained back most of my weight over time. Feels real bad.",False,False

I also lost 2lbs between Sunday morning and Monday night bc my b/p lead to a water fast during Monday day time but realistically my binge even if I retained 50% should’ve given me a 2lb gain",False,False

Im very pro science but this is sketchy to me. Like how else would severe b/p people be skinny a lot of the time if it was true???,False,False

With good intentions, because they're trying to stop people from purging, but it's absolute horseshit. Almost no calorie absorption happens in the stomach - your stomach is a place to break down food into its constituent parts before it moves to the small intestine, and *that's* where calories and nutrients are absorbed. If you're purging whole food items, the calories you might have already absorbed from them is marginal at best.   A lot of bulimics are normal or overweight because they either eat normally/overeat between b/p cycles or they don't actually purge their entire binge (either because they physically can't or they're not trying to). But you don't 'automatically' or 'immediately' absorb 50% of the calories from what you eat.",False,False

Saying that you can absorb calories in your stomach is as absurd as the “you absorb the calories in food-scented lotion through your skin” thing.   While you may not get every single bite up, what you do get up won’t be absorbed.",False,False
