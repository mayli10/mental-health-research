I know how stressful and upsetting this is for you. Your mother cares about you and wants you to be well and happy. But when you're struggling, it's a mother's instinct to help you. You might consider the option of opening up to her if you have a close relationship. She may be able to support through your journey to get better.  If that is too scary, I would just tell her that you think you overdid things are currently trying to gain some weight back. That will be easier than trying to hide yourself and also prevents you from needing divulge everything. Since it's still very new to you, I know it will be extremely difficult to speak about just yet",False,False

I sadly cant relate bc when i got to my lowest weight i was living with my parents n they did not care for my chopstick legs. Yet i hope that you will figure out what to do, in your case i would blame everything on stress or insomnia, but its your choice what to do.",False,False
