Or did you just graduate, meaning you recently lost eligibility for college-administered healthcare and now you're also losing your private insurance? If it's the latter, I'm so sorry.  But if by chance you are still in college, please reach out to your school about getting on their insurance...they'll be harassing you about it anyway as soon as they figure out you've lost your private insurance.",False,False

Unfortunately, it won’t renew on August 1st because my mom got fired from her job (and I had insurance through her, but since the insurance was provided through her job, now neither of us have insurance). Open enrollment for insurance isn’t until October, and I don’t know whether the new insurance my mom will get will even cover treatment.   Thanks for telling me that. I really feel like such a burden on everyone. It’s hard not to when I’m literally told I’m too much of a liability.",False,True

I hope you can somehow see someone else cos that Dr sounds like they shouldn't even be qualified to see patients with that attitude! I have no idea how health insurance works (I'm from the UK) but won't it be renewed on 1st Aug? Keep pushing to get help!! And keep asking the rest of your team!! You are NOT a liability, you just want to get the help you need!",False,False
