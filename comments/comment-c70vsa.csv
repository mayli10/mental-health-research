My BMI is probably around the same as yours but I still feel like my thighs are literally the size of couches.  Don't be scared to gain muscle though. It can't make you look bigger unless you dedicate your life to becoming some kind of professional bodybuilder, and even then you wouldn't loot fat, just ripped. So go for it :)",False,False

You’re definitely too underweight to be getting any bigger since there’s minimal fat on your body. It’s likely that the muscle you get from toning will burn that layer of fat and make you look slimmer. Be careful if you’re going to tone though, since you’re underweight it’s really easy to start burning muscle if you don’t up your intake a bit.  Ik how you feel, I had the same problem when I reached 17 bmi :/ stay safe pls, you’re probably not as big as you think you are",False,False
