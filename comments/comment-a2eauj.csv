I eat fairly low carb on a regulae basis and I tried a juice cleanse a few months ago. I ended up really sick because with my low carb intake (I'm ortho and carbs are one of my ffs), I ended up with reactive hypoglycemia. It was terrible: headache, nausea. 10/10 do not recommend. And hypoglycemia can be dangerous if you dont deal with it right.   Just wanted to throw that out there. ",False,False

You can proceed on to whatever you want after that second meal, you're the boss: a ""healthy fast/Cleanse/Diet Plan/Ed Behaviour/Recovery/Etc""   sorry if this makes no sense, I'm pretty manic tonight if you can't tell LOL  but it sounded like this binge was kinda a ""pre-plan last hurrah"", so I thought you might want to try working with your inclinations instead of fighting with them all... just give yourself some wiggle room and patience.
