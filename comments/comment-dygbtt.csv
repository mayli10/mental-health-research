The best advice I can give is any pain you feel from trimming calories is fat melting off. Think of (reasonable) discomfort as a sign of progress. It’s going to be hard af but that’s why you should start now. Get a pizza every other day instead of everyday. You want to get your brain away from words like “die” when you think about your mistakes/ nutrition. Human brains are easily addicted to extreme emotion. (Reasonable hunger) pain is progress,False,False
