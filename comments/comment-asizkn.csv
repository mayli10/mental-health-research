Then, a couple months ago my bf and I got reusable smoothie cups from this cute place by our house. You can bring the cups in and get smoothies in them and they give you like 50¢ off for not using a styrofoam cup. It’s sort of a healthy hippie yuppie place and they have nutrition info for all their smoothies. Even though the giant smoothie I get is like 430 calories, I feel happy when I have one.   Normally in the past with smoothie places, I’d just pass and make my own at home for less cals (and less taste). They even use a scoop of SHERBET in with the fruit and there’s PEANUT BUTTER and whey protein powder and my brain is still fine with it. Idk why this place is different. I think the vibe of the place and the environmentally friendly cup and that it’s something my boyfriend go out and do together. My bf is ok with me having it for dinner and it doesn’t cause a fight. But I’m soooo happy to have a safe food that has actual nutritional value lmao.  ",False,False

Those little fuckers are 220 calories per 1.5 oz packet. But damn if I don't wolf down two of them and not blink an eye for some fuckin reason.
