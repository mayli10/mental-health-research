Believe me, I‚Äôve fallen into a bad situation before because a guy was so hot and knew all the ways to get me to melt conversation-wise. Ended up humiliated (not in the fun way) and feeling like a joke.  Please please PLEASE be careful in the fetish world. There are a sickening number of guys who specifically target submissive females. Not because they are actually into real BDSM, in reality they haven‚Äôt a fucking clue what it‚Äôs all really about, but because they think we‚Äôre ‚Äúeasy targets‚Äù.  Mentioning he thought you were chubbier than expected is so scummy!!! It‚Äôs so manipulative. If he thinks that is a good way to exercise ‚Äúdominance‚Äù then he is BAD NEWS and not someone you want to play with, no matter how hot he is.  Please be careful! ‚ô•Ô∏è And if you ever want to talk feel free to PM me. I‚Äôm by no stretch an expert but I can at least relate üòÖ",False,False

I'm trying to give him the benefit of doubt because two were face pictures and the one where you see the body is quite dark, although my arms were visibly fat lol.    And yes, I'm not only more aware of red flags now, but also a little angry instead of shocked/annoyed like a few hours before, so honestly I just sent him a sarcastic/playful message and didn't react to the idea of meeting up, and he immediatly answered something in the way of 'I think this would work out well' etc., so I kind of shrugged it off too (yes, I'm a little bitter about it), but this took away all his magic and now I don't really care that much anymore because it feels like I kind of switched the positions. I will survive that too.    You are a great human DoggyDish :)",False,True

They expect women to fall over them so when that doesn't happen they may pull out tools like negging to get the response they were expecting originally. It's up to you and your read on him. I would see how he reacts to a conversation on boundaries. See if he tries to push or negotiate a boundary like ""no comments on my body."" My concern is that he made a comment like that after already seeing pics of you at a higher weight.  It's a pretty safe bet that a girl whose lost some weight will be self conscious about her weight and appearance, so that makes me feel like it was a targeted neg and not like, a genuine but insensitive comment.   I don't think it'll hurt to give him another chance. But since you've already gotten one red flag I would say be hyper vigilant for more. Like, there are guys out there who you will have a mutual attraction with who also won't make comments like that so give this guy a chance but keep in mind there will be other hot guys if this one gives off another red flag",False,False

Yes, that's what I thought too he might me doing. Althought he is a pretty attractive person himself and wouldn't 'need' to neg me to get me to want him, and also I said something about I do already find him quite sympathetic when we were talking so he might have concluded I liked him. I can't stop being quite sarcastic and bratty when engaging with someone dominant in a bdsm-situation because I feel like I want to test them first, so he probably wants to (in his way) set who has the saying in our situation. Would work wonderfully if it wasn't for that comment and I really fell for him before because otherwise, he's well behaved and nice.  I hate degrading stuff for that reason. I think I already mentioned that. I couldn't really deal with actual humilitiation at all, even further because of ED stuff (althought I also kind of want to 'be normal' and not let that affect as I'm trying to accept my body now as I'm learning to lose slowly in a healthier manner).   I don't know..do you not think there is a way to either talk to him about it or show that it's not something he could hurt me with (he saw pictures of me before and I was at a higher weight on one, so I thought about responding something like 'oh really, and this while you saw just pictures of me from being even chubbier than now!'). I really rally want him and would feel bad not playing it with the person I always dreamt of, but on the other side, having to do certain poses and all that to look slimmer is just so tiring mentally.",False,True

Negging is when someone subtly insults you but makes it sound like a compliment. It's to undermine your self confidence and make you crave his approval.  He wants you to feel bad about yourself so you'll go back to him desperate for his approval. There's also an element of "" you're too ugly to get anyone else so you have to sleep with me! I'm your only option!""  He probably did this because he interpreted you saying you needed to think about it as a refusal.  Guys usually go to negging when they think a girl is on the fence and need a push into their arms.  Also, as someone whose also into fetish play, please be very careful. I highly recommend you don't engage in any degradation or humiliation play. That is very dangerous for people dealing with things like an eating disorder. I'm a dimmer and I personally never engage with degrading play until I've played with someone for months and months. You cannot safely engage with that play with a stranger. I'm not sure if you are even interested in degrading talk/actions but if you are I recommend exploring the other elements you are interested in first. Not with this guy though. He sucks.",False,False
