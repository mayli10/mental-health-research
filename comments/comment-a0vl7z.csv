Some days dysmorphia creeps up outta nowhere, but it's pretty pointless as I know I was thin a few hours ago.  But my figure is still a reason (even though a smaller one) of my ed. My prefered body shape for myself is unhealthily skinny.  The main reasons though have always been control and the feeling of being clean and pure. ",False,False

You're approval matters to me haha. I'm hella straight passing mostly because my partner is a cis white dude and I'm a female and tho I like playing with masculinity I GREATLY enjoy expressing femme characteristics. I do love me some flannel tho. I'm basically a lipstick pansexual. I'm working on getting both my POC community ties and queer community ties lol.    Worst part is my PCP was a black immigrant just like me. I was so MAD. SMH. Like ugh the fucking discrimination in our own communities sometimes is fucking whack. ,False,True

There are times where I'll be doing something and I get overwhelmed with panic about some part of my body actually being really fat, be it my face or my legs or my butt or whatever and I have to go look at my reflection to remind myself what I actually look like. And sometimes I look at my reflection and still can't decide whether I look fat or not... but on another level I know I'm not disfigured or morbidly obese and at my LW I actually remember feeling pretty good about my body. I still wanted to lose more but I was aware that I already had a decent body most of the time. So who knows.  I also had the weirdest experience once, of having my roommate who I had perceived as being MUCH thinner than me, offer me some old clothes that were too small for her because I seemed smaller than her. Really through me for a loop. Not sure which one of us was right even because I was too embarrassed to take the clothes.",False,False

Sorry my #clinicianbrain is turning on. I identify as a sexually queer POC cis female. I'm studying to become a therapist and I currently work in mental health (while also having my own mental health shit 😅 woo!) but I've always wanted to work with POC people and Queerfolks and idk maybe use my awful powers of queerpassing and mental health experience to help out the community. But because I straightpass so much I have very few queer friends and no trans friends so I never know who to fucking ask this shit.  So thanks for being so cool and honest.   Real feels on treatment denying people access to surgery. My clinician brain understands some of the rational but I also know that healthcare in America is FUCKED UP. So lots of hugs and support to you! ,False,True

It is like a trump speech.  I'm sorry you have to experience  gender dysmorphia with so much pain and suffering. Any hope of getting on hormones in the future?

I did have BD when I was younger but not so much now that I'm older. I probably got initially triggered after my summer cruise because I was eating 5 meals a day and I gained HELLA weight and started dieting. I shouldn't have started dieting after my summer vacation trip. The real ED relapse happened after the weigh in at the doctor. I  bought a scale and started counting CALoRiEs and the fucking stupid disorder took over from there. God I just want to put this demon back to sleep. ,False,True

I don’t know if it’s helpful at all but the key to me is not counting calories and tracking.

I'm driven more by the number on the scale and how much, as a person, I don't like myself.  I'm fine with how I look. I'm thin and well within a healthy BMI range, but I'm not a low weight and I hurt those around me without meaning to. And I end up not eating, or bingeing, and all I really care about is how not good I am, or how much weight i lose.  A lot of this subreddit deals with body dysmorphia  and I dont really fit into that, and that's part of the reason  I've never posted here before.

I honestly have no idea if I have dysmorphia and I'm not really sure how to figure out if I do... Sometimes after fasting I can put on a fitted shirt/dress and in my mirror I think I look nice, thin even. But then when I see pictures or look in another mirror later I feel huge - and I usually just figure I am because I've drank water or who knows.  I can tell my face is thinner compared to 30 lbs ago but I still feel like my cheeks are too fat. My arms look thinner i pictures now sometimes, but not always. My clothes were feeling looser last year when I first relapsed into hardcore restricting but now the same clothes feel ridiculously tight and I've only gained back about 10 lbs (only hahaha fml).

My body issues, ironically, are not things I’m capable of altering through losing weight, but being able to control one thing about my appearance, being able to control what I put in my body, being able to control whether I exercise or not... There’s a sense of security in it that I’m very unwilling to let go of, and it’s a contradiction, because the disorder is very much in control over me, but I’m still mentally operating under that illusion.  My body is kind of an abstraction to me a lot of the time, but being able to see a number on the scale and knowing I can manipulate it is just my terribly maladaptive way of coping with the fact that I can never really know what’s going to happen to me. And it’s crazy sometimes to think that I’ve gotten so sick over the years from AN, while I’ve never looked at myself in the mirror and thought anything other then “eh”, but that’s just how it is sometimes, I guess.",False,False
