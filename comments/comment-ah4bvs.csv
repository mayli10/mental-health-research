If they hear a heavy weight looking at a skinny body they just don't care. I think they only will start to care when my lies doesn't mach my body anymore. I'm such a selfish bitch, a horrible human being. But I feel like I can stop lying.",False,False

This month has been hard, as last January was really traumatic and it is hard to not be reminded.   I have to go out into rush hour now for my practicum info session. This is the kinda day where I'd drink with breakfast, normally... but I'm restricting so I don't wanna.   Weed is legal where I am, so I guess I should stop at a store to get myself some sativa at some point today. Take the edge off :p ",False,False

She doesn't know what you're going through, that much is very clear. If she's a close friend of yours, I would urge you to talk to her. It sounds like she has her own preconceptions about ED's and recovery, and she might be interested in learning the truth - I would, if I were her and a friend of mine was suffering like that. I really don't think she doesn't care about you, she just doesn't know, which is understandable. There's a lot of taboo and false information about ED's (and all mental health issues imo), so it's not her fault. If she reacts negatively or hurts you after you open up, she's not worth your time and agony.",False,False

So, the other day I retweeted a post saying that before and after photos can be triggering to those in recovery and to be mindful. I agree because itâ€™s true imo plus a lot of the ones that go viral on twitter literally turn out to be some scam for some disordered diet. I know thereâ€™s a difference between disordered eaters and folks suffering from EDs but that doesnâ€™t change the fact that I donâ€™t like looking at progress photos for that reason.    She goes on to say thatâ€™s being selfish and policing fat people. She talked about how fat people have to look at folks recovering from anorexia talk about how much gaining weight scares them/hate it and she feels that should be criticized. She even went on to say that ed recovery is fatphobic because it emphasizes how youâ€™re supposedly not fat/donâ€™t need to gain weight to recover. I was baffled because this girl has never had an eating disorder nor has never been in treatment for one so idk where she got that idea ???   But yea. Every since that rant it feels like every time I state something simple she has a rebuttal for it and I just donâ€™t get it. Maybe Iâ€™m being sensitive but idk. I donâ€™t like her assumption that point out something is triggering for a center group of people is policing others. No one said you canâ€™t celebrate your weight loss??? They just asked for some mindfulness is all?     I mean I could be totally wrong. I could be missing something but idk I just donâ€™t trust her rant because sheâ€™s never had an eating disorder and isnâ€™t fat. So itâ€™s not like sheâ€™s speaking from any experience.    But it just sucks because I feel like I shouldnâ€™t talk about my issues with her or the rest of my friend group anymore because they donâ€™t care and donâ€™t want to educate themselves on how they can be supportive? I just really feel like starving the death because they donâ€™t care which I know is dumb but ugh. ",False,False
