Like, I \*know\* intellectually that weight fluctuates in very nonlinear ways, but the visceral experience of the scale not doing what I expect is still very upsetting. I start freaking out about what to do.....change intake? exercise? water? electrolytes? whaatttt toooo dooooooo??? But I think the main thing to do is just, wait.  &amp;#x200B;  Like, over the past week, the scale went up (grrrr) when it should theoretically have gone down. But over the past month, the overall scale trend actually basically matches up with my math. I think my brain somehow discounts it when the scale goes as expected and hyper-remembers when the scale stalls.",False,False

There's really no way you could have gained 4 lbs with that intake.  I'd say just don't restrict any further and wait at least 24 hours before weighing yourself again",False,False
