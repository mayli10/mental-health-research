Figuring that you can work out more to increase caloric deficit isn’t going to help and will definitely be demoralizing.  Multiple “experts” have written about it.

If its something you're planning on doing over time I'd think about swapping out for some veg/fruit/etc every couple of days or so (or replacing a pint with them for them in your day).  Vitamins and fiber are pretty nonexistent in halo top, and you need those no matter how little or what you're eating.  Source: I had little to no fiber for like 2 weeks straight and my stomach still hasn't fully recovered like weeks later. It's like having overdosed on laxative without having taken the lax.",False,False

Restricting will reduce CO, so you will need to restrict a lot more than you think.  A lot of people use CICO to figure that they can create a deficit by exercising more. Exercise will make you healthier, but if you increase your exercise, you will be building muscle. Fat is very efficient for energy storage; 1# of fat has more calories than you need to build 1# of muscle. Exercise will cause weight *gain* which will work against your deficit in terms of weight loss.  Exercise is good, building muscle is good, but expecting to lose *weight* with exercise will be demoralizing.  Muscle does have double the TDEE of fat (fat is very efficient), so in the long run exercise is good for weight loss, but its results will be very slow.",False,False
