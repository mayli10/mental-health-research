I'm Korean so I've been eating kabocha all my life and it's one of my favorite veggies. I legit eat like two pounds of it at once.   https://imgur.com/a/65wd1MY (from korean official food database).

Buttercup squash is popular here because you can cut it more easily, and those are about 90kcal per 100g and about the same as a potato.   If it's a small, hard kind like this [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabocha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabocha) it's lower cal due to its higher fiber content (or so I think). ",False,False
