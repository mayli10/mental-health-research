First, targeting stomach fat is bullshit and totally impossible. Your best option is a little thing called Body Recomposition, which basically requires switching your exercise type from cardio to weights and eating a higher protein diet. It's important to not overdo cardio or calorie restriction during this period (Idk if you're down for that tho since ur in this sub).  Focus on main compound lifts in the strength-hypertrophy rep ranges (3-12) instead of ""muscular endurance"". If you're dying to do some ab isolation, which is largely useless but may have some benefit, your best bet would be weighted crunches or hanging knee raises.",False,False

I can confirm that exercise helps! I never used to do much, just 30 minutes of cardio and an hour of light yoga daily, but I think that definitely contributed to my smaller stomach.",False,False

I have read that belly fat is the last thing to go, so try not to become too discouraged (easier said than done, I know). I'm down to almost half the weight I used to be and I have this giant pooch. I think it's a combination of loose skin and then just residual belly fat. Unfortunately, you probably will always have the loose skin but I like to obsessively scroll through r/progresspics and just see kind of what people's belly skin looks like that have similar stats to me.   As someone else mentioned, core exercises can help tighten your muscles as well. But being in a similar position I would really stress that your stomach may never be ""flat and perfect"" since you were once at a high weight, but that is okay! There is only so much we can do without skin removal surgery and I personally have never looked at someone's belly that lost a ton of weight and thought ""ew it's not PERFECTLY FLAT"" it's more like 'wow i can't believe they lost all that weight!' like loose skin is totes normal.   That said, if your brain is disordered I know there's nothing I can say to help...just hopefully you can see that other people are probably not focused on your stomach as much as you are as they don't look through the distorted lens.",False,False

I googled around for “belly fat” and “visceral fat” and this is my advice:  -reduce sugar, processed carbs, and alcohol* -make sure you’re getting enough protein  -eat more fiber -exercise regularly (combination of cardio and strength)  Also, give it time and don’t beat yourself up too much. Genetics play a large role in where your body stores fat, and targeted fat loss is difficult.   * I’d honestly cut alcohol altogether if possible. This seems to be a big culprit for a lot of my guy friends/family. Also, soda. Don’t stress about healthy carbs from whole fruit and veg though.",False,False

It is common in eating disorders and with people who have lost a lot of weight.,False,False

And as much as it may be hard to do dont severe restrict like no eating more than 750 under what you are supposed to eat for maintenance. And eat more protien. Lean meats are great like chicken breast and fish. Pork loin can be a great choice it's definitely lean and gives variety.,False,False
