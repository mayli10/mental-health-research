I just have a hard time talking about it but would like to talk to you about it (either right then or later when you are ready.. that way he knows to maybe check in later"" if you want to talk about it do it.. its nice to have one person who knows and can check on you a bit... at least for me it does.  Hope this helps.. sending love ðŸ’•",False,False
