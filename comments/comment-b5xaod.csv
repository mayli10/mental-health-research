I had a lot of weight to lose, however. My intake has stayed the same throughout the loss, which I know accounts for some of the slowed rate of loss (since my TDEE keeps getting lower the less I weigh.)  I have been having pretty consistent plateaus for months now ever since reaching BMI 17.5ish. I am at 17.2 now and have not gone any lower for the past two weeks. I do get a loss of anywhere between .3 - .8 of a pound here and there every two weeks or so, but it is very slow at this point.  I am typically very sedentary. All online calculators calculate my TDEE to be around 1500 because of this. I do ab exercises but they aren't always every day or high-intensity, so I do not factor them into my total expenditure.   I use a scale to weigh out everything besides the 35-calorie a cup popcorn I eat once a day, which I use a measuring cup to measure out. If it is a prepackaged item like a rice cake, a package of tuna, a protein bar, etc., then I go off of what the nutrition label reads. Like I said before, I do count spices, artificial sweeteners, pickles, other ""zero-calorie"" food items as around 5 calories each. I do not count diet drinks (or my water enhancers until I had this thought today that they could be playing into my slow loss lately). I also do not count sugar-free gum and do chew it quite a bit to get my mind off food, but I make sure to chew it until I have burned the calories in it. I think that covers everything..? Thanks for taking the time to see what the issue is, it's obviously stressing me out and I really appreciate any insight.",False,True

A few questions   How long have you been at a deficit before you plateaued?   How long has it been since youâ€™ve seen no movement on the scale?   Are you exercising? If so, what kind?   What have you used to calculate your tdee to determine the deficit you need?   Do you weigh your food using a scale? Or eyeball it? Or go off packages? Measuring cups?   Les get to the bottom of this ! ",False,False

Idk. I just miss the more consistent losses I had at a higher BMI I guess.",False,True
