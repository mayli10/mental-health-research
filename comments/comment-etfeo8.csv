It’s such a drastic difference. I know how he is, but I’ve only known him as he is now. It’s mind-blowing to see him as a cute, sane, normal person as a vegan. And I feel like it’s been agreed upon that he went insane when he stopped being vegan.   I know a lot of my shock is probably coming from my own demons that deal with restricting, but still. It’s insane for me to see right now, when I’m stuck in this place between wanting to be vegan and wanting to not restrict anything.",False,True
