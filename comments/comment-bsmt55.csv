I can sense something similar happening in my love life right now and it’s actually really terrifying but i feel like complete ass about myself i can’t seem to stop... wallowing?  i hope you have a support system that can be there for you during this time",False,False

As much as he may have loved you for genuine, real reasons, your ed is not something that can be banished by somebody else's love; recovery has got to come from within. So while these feelings may just motivate you to restrict more, I really hope you can see this as a challenge to get better. I say 'challenge' because we all know it's fucking difficult, but it's worth trying - not for him, but for yourself &lt;3",False,False

You should try to be your best self. I’m very mentally ill and it wasn’t my time to accept love.,False,True

It’s just heartbreaking to look back and realize that he loved me and found me beautiful. It was 100% genuine and I rejected him multiple times. He’s lovely and I miss him. I’m going to cope by getting thinner.,False,True

Yeah I know, so profound and not cliche at all.   I’ve heard the counter argument about how loving yourself first is bullshit. And I agreed with it for a while. But now I’m not so sure. The idea was basically that many people cannot love themselves even after a lifetime of trying to, and that they shouldn’t deprive themselves of love because of lack of self-love. And it makes sense, right?  But also I don’t see how I can love someone fully when I’m so focused on my insecurities and issues. It’s all consuming and overwhelming and I’m constantly going back and forth from body checking to breaking the mirror in disgust. Oh and of course being scared of swallowing a stray calorie. How can I love someone when calories are afoot?   Idk there must be a balance in the middle we can’t quite achieve just yet. Just the right amount of self-hatred and self-love. Just enough self-love that we don’t allow our insecurities to hinder relationships. Wish I had an answer, but sounds like you and me can hella relate.",False,False

I'm terrified of this happening to me... I keep my feelings about myself mostly hidden because I'm terrified of I'm honest I'll become intolerable and get abandoned.,False,False
