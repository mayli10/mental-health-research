So today I finally woke up with a flat stomach again, and my weight was back down like 3 pounds.  I track everything so I know I didn't ""really"" gain 3-4 pounds...  I think my body trusts me now that I will feed it.  I don't want to go IOP or day after graduation so I decided to suck it the fuck up.  I was scared to eat maintenance because of that initial ""weight gain"", because I like where I am now.  I didn't want to suck it up that I'd just have to accept gaining a couple pounds.  I don't actually have to gain weight, it was just water weight, and I can eat now.  I am by no means recovered from my relapse but I am much much better.  Doesn't take me 4 hours agonizing to pick something to eat now.  I sort of just trust that my body knows what to do with the food.  It is really shitty at times though.  The bloat will make you not want to eat which will just perpetuate the cycle...",False,False

You have no idea how much I needed to hear this, it was very comforting. I was considering going back to fasting just to reduce the bloat and comfort myself, but this gave me motivation to try to keep going. ",False,True

It normally takes me like 4-5 days.  Go you for eating maintenance, it’s literally the best thing you can do to calm down an ED.",False,False
