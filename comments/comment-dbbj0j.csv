And look at how guys at r/fitness and r/xxfitness do cuts. It’s a short term thing meant to shed a small amount of fat, then you maintain and after that if wished go on a bulk to gain more muscle mass. There’s also calorie cycling where people cut 2 weeks, maintain 2, and repeat up to 24 weeks I think. The MATADOR study found this type of weight loss to be first of all more effective (compared to no maintenance weeks in between) and longer lasting (they did a 6 month check up and more of the cyclers had kept the weight off).  I’m also reading Laurie Christine King’s the Badass Guide to Fat loss, gaining and maintaining. After a long period of restricting calories she recommends reverse dieting (lifting calories very slowly up to maintenance) of at least three to four months to figure out our new maintenance and then maintaining three to four months before going on a new cut. This all gives thyroid function, hormones and metabolism time to normalize. She thinks maintenance should be where we spend most of our time, since it gives us energy to work out and grow muscle mass, making our TDEE higher naturally. It has been really eye opening to me.",False,False

And like 4 months is the absolute maximum recommended in fitness communities because our metabolism starts slowing down from being too long in a steep deficit? I thought it was normal to lose weight for a year or a year and a half, because that’s what I see on progress pic subs. So I felt like a weak bitch when I’ve been going on 10 months in a deficit and feel like shit.",False,False
