Like jogging. It really gets things moving around down there and soon enough everything comes out. It comes out violently. But I always feel so much better after. Idk if that will help you, if your disorder involves caffeine abuse or overexercising please DO NOT follow this advice.   Good luck",False,False

It‚Äôs literally suuuuuuuuch a struggle, I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre dealing with it too. I find when I go closer to maintenance I usually have a bm within ~24 hours. Good for you for staying away from lax though, I‚Äôve used senna when I‚Äôm super constipated but I‚Äôm also afraid I‚Äôll use it too much if I‚Äôm not careful. I definitely don‚Äôt recommend getting anything or having it around because it‚Äôs tempting. ",False,False
