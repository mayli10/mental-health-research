Well, it has been 4 years for me without any improvement. I only saw improvement when I restricted from gluten, dairy, sugar and fruit. The problem was that I couldn't get enough calories in me on that ""diet"". So eating like that is not for me.  I've definitely had a low fat percentage for many, many years, so if that's true then it makes perfect sense.  I can't take birth control due to a few reasons I don't wanna get into, so I can't try that unfortunately.",False,True

It calmed down after about six months? Close to a year? I don’t remember too clearly. It was more like my body wasn’t used to processing so much food, so it just shoved all my oil out through my dumbass face.   I’ve read studies that there is a big link between body fat percentages and puberty being delayed when it’s too low; but I’m not sure how much “kicks” back in once you’ve gotten it back up after a few years.   I personally get boobs once I gain enough weight. I almost completely lose them when I hit low enough. So gaining, itself might help you in that aspect.   Otherwise, birth control helps a little bit, and worst-case scenario, I’m sure there’s a form of hormonal therapy that can be effective.",False,False

My guess is your hormones have always been a little wack and the introduction of more fat/carbs just started transporting them ""correctly"". That's what happened with me. In recovery I adjusted birth control (nuva ring has been great for my skin) got a prescription from my derm (mine was cystic so I had to) and a very simple skincare routine, made a point to do cardio and sweat, started wearing sunscreen religiously and ate a lot of nutritious foods (low sugar), and just WAITED. The waiting sucked most.I   But my hormones readjusted and eventually the acne went away. My skin's the best it's been since I was 12.  It's likely not just the food but a bunch of other factors. My advice is focus on that stuff first.",False,False
