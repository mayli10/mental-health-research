I want to point out how similar our usernames are though!!  I was bulimic for about a year, maybe. But it would involve me planning to eat a pint of b&amp;jâ€™s and then throwing it up.

There are a bunch of different eating disorders that have a bunch of different symptoms, they're not all going to manifest the same way in every person.  Your struggle is your struggle, and you not bingeing doesn't make your experiences with ED any less real. It's different from other people's, sure, but my experience with ED is different from other people's, too!  Eating disorders are eating disorders. Regardless of how similar or different our struggles with them are, we're all in this together.",False,False

I feel like I only binge because I went through bouts of very severe bulimia. Part of that is eating a lot then purging it. Luckily it is not as bad as it used to be for me. But I still overexercise if I eat too much. Restriction without binging is the best feeling in the world for me. I feel more a fraud for even binging at all.",False,False

I never binged, purged less than a handful of time because I was (and still am) extremely afraid of the effect on my health.

Whether or not 100% of them actually binge idk. Or if some are like me and barely went over their limit and their brain has convinced them it's a binge. I have seen people question whether or not they've binged as well. I can't say what classifies as binging. Or where that line is between just a little ""overeating"" and binging. I'm sure there are a million different opinions on that.   I sometimes feel like my struggle isn't real enough because I don't fit all the ED stereotypes or because I can't relate to everyone.

Sure I eat over my limit sometimes, but it's definitely not a binge. Even though my ED brain loves to tell me it is. I restrict and over exercise. No two people's struggles are the same. Similar, sure. Never the same. We all have different behaviors, different triggers, different safe/fear foods (if any at all .. I don't actually have any fear foods.
