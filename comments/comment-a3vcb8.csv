My math class was the same weighting thing on the final so good luck!!! You're gonna kill it &lt;3 Maybe just avoid weighing in until the final is over cause you can always stress after but can't afford to get distracted before you know?,False,True

I couldnâ€™t stop restricting entirely, but I did have to consciously give myself pep talks lol. Like, yo, you can always lose the weight, but you canâ€™t re-take these exams. So for the next few weeks just try to fuel yourself. Look forward to losing the weight once youâ€™re finished.   I was mostly able to eat more than I had been, and didnâ€™t gain much weight, but the whole thing is just so frustrating. I wish this shit didnâ€™t occupy so much brain space. ",False,False

It unsurprisingly caused me to be foggy and unfocused. Then now that all my finals are over, I canâ€™t stop having binges because Iâ€™m sad that I didnâ€™t eat properly during exam week to do my best.  I literally found every way to lose in this situation (except lose weight apparently). Any restricting I did was negated by my sadness binges.

I've a math final next week, and if I don't score at least a 60% on it I'll have to retake the class despite having a 97% all semester (online class, using mathway, shhh). So I've been stress eating.
