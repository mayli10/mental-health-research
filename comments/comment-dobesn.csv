Not look after it in appearance terms, necessarily. Just in health terms. And that means not being morbidly obese, not binge drinking, not taking drugs, exercising, eating decent food most of the time etc. If you respect your body, then you look after it. Of course I love body positivity in theory, but definitely don’t enact it because I fuckin starve myself. And weirdly my preference in body type is curvy/cuddly/a little extra weight. I don’t starve myself to be skinny, I starve to disappear, you know? I hate myself as a person as much as I hate my body. But yeah body positivity has for sure become really skewed. You deserve to love yourself no matter you size or health status, but part of self love is looking after your mind and body.",False,False

Even if I recover, I’ll always roll my eyes when HAES is brought up. I feel bad about my feelings towards it but no matter what I do I’ll never believe it.

I told her I disagree with it fundamentally because they promote a sedentary lifestyle and eating however much of whatever you want even if it's just as unhealthy as eating nothing (only on the other side of the spectrum). I think it's fine to remind girls that everyone is built differently and you don't have to be an XS, size 0-2 but if you are obese you are not healthy period.",False,False

You can change obesity. It might be harder for some people, and it is also still doable. And honestly I dislike the feminist movement a lot of the time. Maybe I just hate the extremists who hate all men, or something, but I have never wanted to become a feminist, or anything close to it. I dislike the HAES movement because people take it way too far. No it’s not healthy to be 600lbs. Nor is it healthy to be 80lbs. And people in that movement tend to shame people who aren’t a size 14 and up, and it’s really upsetting.   Anyways, I feel like I rambled a bit, sorry! I also hope this didn’t come off as rude or anything.",False,False

Like in order to be “perfect feminists” we have to be totally woke to body culture and completely accepting of every facet of every woman while battling a deadly mental health disorder that creates distortions in this area.   I also think a lot of BOPO/HAES whatever oversimplifies eating disorders as a vanity issue when that’s quite simply not true. It largely ignores biological factors and brain chemistry that drive eating disorders. It feeds the notion that eating disorders are the love child of diet culture and pervasive thin media, which is a whole lotta bullshit.",False,False

I just watched it recently and it kind of changed my attitudes.  Besides just being a really good show, bigger bodies exist in it without a negative lens.  There is even an episode where the main character goes to a pool party for big girls and it honestly made me tear up a little. It was just so cool and their bodies are just there, existing, not for the male gaze or for judgment, and they are having a great time.  All that said, I still want my own body to be skinny lol but I'm definitely a little less judgmental of other women's bodies after watching all the episodes (not that I cared too much about other people's bodies, but the thoughts were still there).  I realize it's still technically fucked up - it's kind of like saying, ""oh I'm pro-choice but I would NEVER have an abortion"" because it implies some kind of superiority, but it's better than being repulsed by fat bodied people.",False,False

I consider myself overweight but definitely not morbidly obese and I can tell the effects carrying this extra weight around the last four months of recovery (lol i binged into the sun after) has had on me.
