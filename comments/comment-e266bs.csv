So more bang for the cals if you get the largest but a whole banana in a small size is creamer than large! I used to work at a biggby and I would make my own drinks and only use bananas instead of the tonic for myself. I don't trust baristas lol so I never drink/eat anything I don't make myself,False,False

I saw that on some Google searches that the banana makes it way looser, but I'd be down  My favorite Frapp is the Java Chip, so I was planning on getting a Mocha Frapp with almond milk and their skinny mocha sauce instead of the reg sugar one.
