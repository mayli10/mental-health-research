It definitely won't bother me if I don't get the exact perfect amount of each ingredient for every meal I make. I just like to know that I'm making healthy choices. It took a lot for me to figure out that the problem with the meal plan I talked about before that I was having was that a lot of the stuff I added to it the other night to get the calories up actually accounted for a lot of the same nutrients that the multivitamin I put in the plan already had a lot of. When I removed the multivitamin I just needed vitamin D and a couple other vitamins and minerals. It turned out that the meal replacement shake I had in my plan would give the perfect amount of each one I needed to reach 100% DV without going over the max for anything else, so I figured I could just drink two. It also put my daily calories exactly where I wanted them (1650). Like exactly the right amount. I'm very satisfied with my work. :)",False,True

It only seems to help if I'm already exhausted and ready for bed, but just can't fall asleep. Well, even then it doesn't always help, but a few times I think it helped a little.",False,True

I have a degree in exercise science and nutrition and the other day I gleefully spent 2 hours calculating my exact caloric expenditure for common activities based on the estimated metabolic constant and currently established MET rating for the different activities.   I track my entire days intake on paper and then hand calculate the AMDR for my macros and very very tightly organize and control those ranges. I take pleasure in meal planning and then calculating out the nutrition of serving sizes using food scales.   Last night I did all my meal planning for the week and shopping list and right now I'm in the process of creating recipes and meals on MFP using the food label panel. Ugh.   My therapist the other day told me that there is a strong correlation between eating disorders and OCD and that sometimes eating disorders replace other OCD behaviors or that other OCD behaviors replace eating disorder behavior because unless you treat the underlying obsessive-compulsive process you aren't really recovering. I was diagnosed with OCD after having my daughter and when I look back to my childhood I can begin to see a distinct pattern of OCD-type behaviors that I didn't even recognize as being OCD behaviors,False,False

I'm not sure if building a tolerance to melatonin is a thing. Its never worked for me though tbh.  And I did focus on health at the very beginning but it honestly held me back a lot. After relapsing a few times doing it that way, I gave in and decided to go a more typical recovery route and allow myself to have 'unhealthy' foods daily. I planned for desserts and things like baked goods for breakfast or pancakes and white bread etc. and honestly, I hardly are vegetables because they would make me really full. When I was still in the early phases I probably ate was more junk than the average person. Its good to incorporate as many fear foods as you can at the start to get to the point where you are comfortable eating anything without being triggered. I even quit being vegetarian and I don't regret it for a second. But once I was stable and not engaging in behaviours for quite a while, I slowly started to crave healthier things naturally. I started eating fruits and vegetables again and my diet now is very balanced. I love eating healthy but I also love eating everything else. ",False,False

Also, did you focus on being healthy when you would make meal plans? I don't really know if this is something I should eventually stop or if it's a good thing that I should keep on doing forever.",False,True

I've been stable in recovery for quite a while now and I don't know when really the meal planning faded but I don't meal plan at all now aside from what I have to do to make a grocery list. Still get crazy excited about food though.  Also just wanted to mention, melatonin is not like normal sleep aids. It won't make you drowsy and put you to sleep. You have to take it and get in bed in a dark room for it to work. ",False,False

I will spend 5 hours creating shopping lists and meal plans, and get so enthusiastic that I won't sleep, I can't wait to be doing it, so I'll sit up from trying to sleep and start calorie counting and making different meal plans at certain calorie levels, I'll even make a whole week's plan for all my food.  The difference for me is that I always, 100% after all my hard work don't follow anything. Yeah, thanks DenverTheLastDionosau, but I'm not really in the mood for only 150 calories today hun.",False,False
