It sounds harsh but I have made a game out of it- I literally make sure I eat a wide variety of foods in front of them (even if I’m stealthily c/sing the shit food), I accept almost all offers of food and I have learned to just make very normal sounding comebacks.   “Oh wow you’re eating a lot”  “Oh yea- I worked out last night and I’m famished!”  “You eat like a bird”   “Not always, but I’m not super hungry today, I had a big bowl of oatmeal with flax seeds (or whatever) this morning and I’m still a bit full!”   Also, I have gastrointestinal issues and I blame a majority of my fucked it eating on this. My co-workers haven’t figured out that almost two years of restriction and purging caused all of my digestive issues!",False,False
