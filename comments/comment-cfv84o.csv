OMAD some pitiful meal of veggies or soup then binge vodka or wine for dinner and the rest of the foreseeable night, don’t even bother counting those calories because I don’t want to think about it. Suffer the liquor shits like mad the next day, almost like taking laxatives and I don’t gain weight (as far as I can tell, I’m sure it’s mostly water weight but whatever). What a wild ride. Feels awful, but I sadly love being drunk because it keeps my mind off of my nagging ED, and for some reason it doesn’t count in my mind. God forbid I just restrict and eat normally (in that regard).",False,False
