You have to do it weekly but its worth it.  Eyelash extentions can pull out uiur natural lashes. I want to try them too but im scared. I might try rapidlash serum instead MAC masccara is great - non wayerproof tends to coat tp the ends more than waterproof.   Nails: nail envy original is amazing. Plus seche vite top coat.  I like OPI bubbld bath for natural colour. If you have pronounced ridges, i use a 4 way buffer and use the file part to smooth, then the smoother to repolish the surface. The file part is supposed to be for shaping the nail but my way works well.   Microdermabrasion can cause unecen skin tecture. Try a derma roller , and an acid peel once a month.    My goals:  Deal with hyperpigmentation.  Lose weight and firm up (back to size 00)   Get rid of cellulite   Keep growing hair (its boob length)  Id also love to fix two splits in my labia caused byva clit ring sitting on it .
