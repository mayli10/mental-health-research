My therapist knows I hate ultimatums (she mentioned that when she told me) but it might be a good idea to see if we can compromise or something. I just wish we could treat the actual underlying problem -- my issues with authority and being told what to do clearly aren't doing me any favors and if we could get past that I might be able to do what they're asking, you know?",False,True

I really relate to what youâ€™re saying and I know Iâ€™d feel similarly confused in your position. I think itâ€™d be really good to have a more in-depth discussion about it with your team and see if thereâ€™s compromises or rationales that could assist with both/either sideâ€™s understanding? I know Iâ€™ve been told in the past that therapy wouldnâ€™t be helpful for me unless I could commit to weight gain because my brain was too starved to be able to engage with it, do you think maybe that could be the reason behind their wanting you to gain a bit? Iâ€™m really sorry youâ€™ve been put between what is essentially a rock and a hard place.",False,False

Since they can't force me into inpatient (as far as I know, anyway -- they've said they can't make me do anything though), basically I just won't have a treatment team anymore and I'll be on my own.  I never wanted to see the dietitian; my therapist made me start working with her. I'd be happy just doing therapy and working on the other things that are really affecting my life.",False,True
