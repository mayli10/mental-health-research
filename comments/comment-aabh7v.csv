I just avoid take out all together. I found it easier to ask if my friends would like to come over and I’ll cook for them. At least then i know whats in it and all that. My friends have never complained about the food and I get to usually choose something to cook I feel moderately okay with eating for that night. Avoids canceling all of the time and them getting hurt about it and saves money and calories if you plan well. It’s saved me tons of stress.,False,False

Ive personally canceled my xmas get together with my two bffs twice this month already... We all have times where we feel more vulnerable and sad and it's okay, we're only human.  Hang in there, you can do it, we know it and so do you deep down inside because you are a beautiful, strong and limitless!  Tomorrow is another day, another day to start fresh and positive!! You got this! ♥️♥️",False,False
