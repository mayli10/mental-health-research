I'm overweight and so so so soooooo close to being normal.  But I know once I do get to normal I'll want to go lower as I binge back all my weight loss.  Then I'll read more of those subreddits and hate myself again.  It's a never ending cycle!,False,False

Intelligent people who are largely comfortable with themselves don't care if their friend or colleague is fat. They care if they are happy. I'm not a fat acceptance kinda gal exactly, but there are plenty of smart, successful people who struggle(d) with weight like Oprah and Roger Ebert and Jefferey Steingarten and Marlon Brando and Luciano Pavarotti and Roger Moore and Judy Garland and Queen Latifah and Gabriel Iglesias and Guillermo del Toro and  Donna Karan. I know I'm listing celebrity types but I'm going for familiarity. But almost all those people have kinda had to apologize for their weight at some point. Fuck that. In the 1800s or before they would just be famous successful people who happened to be big.",False,False
