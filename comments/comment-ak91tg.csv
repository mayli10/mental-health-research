And the days that I don't do cardio are fucking rough. Even when bulking, they're fucking rough. I always keep some sugarfree jello and shirataki noodles on hand to get through them. ",False,False

I have to be careful though because sometimes it does make me feel bad if I take it without at least a little food, I feel shaky &amp; faint like I’m having a blood sugar crash",False,True

I take modafanil which is supposed to be very similar and is also supposed to suppress appetite but if I don’t eat on it I feel sick??  It was the same when I used to smoke, it didn’t work as an appetite suppressant for me because if I smoked on an empty stomach I felt sooo ill.m",False,False
