A bunch of my friends texted me and told me that only like 20 people showed up (small school) and it was awful so I made a good decision not wasting my money. I’m saving this comment though so I can look back on it next year if needed. Thank you so much though. This kind of made me realize that I’m the only one that cares that I’ve gained 10 pounds since the last time they saw me (I go to a vocational school so I’ve only seen them for a couple of school events this year) and they probably wouldn’t notice anyways. Thank you so much , honestly",False,True

Please go OP, these dances may seem silly and unimportant but they’re a big part of growing up and hitting milestones. A lot of the people there will fall out of your life and you won’t remember anything about them once you’re thirty, until you flip back through some photos and remember how much fun you had with them. If you get there and it’s miserable, you can leave. But think of all the memories you’ll miss out on if you don’t try!",False,False

All of your classmates will be there, and, trust me, they'll be too drunk to ever care about your weight. In fact, nobody really cares about it. They're there to drink, to dance and to have fun with everyone, as the prom is basically a goodbye party. Nobody is going to say ANYTHING about your weight gain. Nobody. I promise that. Now imagine this: you'll buy yourself a gorgeous dress, you put on some makeup, you do your nails, you style your hair, you wear some beautiful heels. You take pictures with ur classmates and, for the rest of the night, u party and dance with them, having a really good time!! You've been with them for such a long time, and, before you say that you hate them all, I am sure that you get along with at least oen of them. Do it for that person. Go there to have fun with them. Prom night is NOT about your weight, it's about having a fun farewell party with your ex-classmates. Please, go there. At least for an hour. If you went there and you hated it, then you can go home, but I am here to tell you that you won't.  Hear me out: YOU WILL LOOK GORGEOUS!! Trust me!! Years and years will pass, and one day, you'll look back at this day and you'll be grateful that you went, that you didn't deny yourself a night of fun. This piece of advice comes from a girl in a similar situation with you: yes. I gained weight. Literally one hour ago I was crying my eyes out because I realized that I gained too much. I hate my body. Will it prevent me from going to prom, for buying a nice ass dress and for getting my nails done? Fuck no. I'll take pictures like there's no tomorrow and I'll dance with my classmates. Prom is about having fun, not about your or my weight!! Of course, if I would have been skinnier, I would have looked better. Binging happens. But that doesn't mean that you and I can't look great, despite our weight gain, and, honey, we will ;). As to end my message: please go to prom. please don't deny yourself having fun. Just for one night, throw away all of your bad thoughts about yourself. I will repeat myself: nobody is going to prom to check out other people's weight gain. Not a single moment will a thought about your weight cross their mind. They'll just acknowledge how good you look for 1 second then they will go and take some pictures with that girl that's just called them. Oh, and they'll go inside afterwards because the party is about to start. They'll eat something, the music will start playing, they will get drunk and nobody is ever going to care about your weight. I am with you girl. I feel you on a deep deep level. I gained weight. I hate my body. Yet I will go to prom and I will have fun. I'm just going to lose this gained weight afterwards and get to my LW again, because I can't stand the sight of myself in the mirror. But i will go to prom. And I urge you to do so too. Both of us can do this! I hope you will consider my piece of advice and go to prom looking amazing to have a great night, because that's what's going to happen. I promise you. :)",False,False
