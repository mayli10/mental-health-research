Then, once they’re honest and open with each other, they can help each other grow.  If he’s good for you, then he might be taken aback— but if he really cares for you he’ll at least try to understand and help you through it. If not, then he’s not the right one. Either way, he should know.   I know how it feels to want to keep up an image of yourself to your SO so they won’t be disgusted or abandon you, but keeping that image for too long will only drag both of you down. Good luck! Opening up is hella hard, but you can get through this.",False,False
