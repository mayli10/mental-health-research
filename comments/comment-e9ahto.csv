The difference was he had been there the whole time when it started, and it really affected our relationship horribly. He didn’t force me to get help or anything like that, just tried to talk to me and ask for any support I needed as well and assuring I had been getting the help I needed. He didn’t rush me into recovery, but instead was patient until he could she the results the first time around. I hope that your partner doesn’t try and force you into change, maybe be assuring them that it’s a very personal process and you need to choose recovery for yourself might help. Maybe being honest about things that trigger you and how they might be able to help could make things easier for you both. Best of luck :)",False,False

My boyfriend started out as an internet friend, we met in a game. I was very honest because he didn't judge and I didn't expect to ever meet irl. (6 years together now)  He didn't handle it well at first, trying to ""help"" by pushing me to eat more. It took time to figure things out. (an embarrassingly long time, with weight gain and alcoholism)  It will probably be easier to get him to respect your space if you can compromise. For me that was setting a minimum calorie goal. It was hard and took a lot of working up to, but he trusted me. I think it helped heal my mind and ease me into recovery. I can see my body more realistically now and am mostly okay with it.",False,False
