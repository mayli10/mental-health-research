I didn’t know what the process for auditions would be, and I was scared of making a fool of myself.  I’m now 24 and I really really regret that decision! I still wish sometimes that I had kept acting — and plus it would have been good for me, I would have made friends, I would have put myself out there.  I don’t have any specific advice, I just want to say that I hope you go for it. Taking risks will only make you braver over time. Not taking risks will only make you more scared.  I believe in you and I hope you do it!",False,False
