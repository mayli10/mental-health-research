Try to address what is causing the craving. Figure out patterns and do what you can to resolve the issue.  2.Eat consistently (this is the major thing that helped me) have 3 nautritionally adequate meals a day that you have at relatively the same time, don't skip or give yourself a reason to succumb to chaos and eventually a binge. Stability works.  3.Eat healthy fats and protein with every meal. Cliche, but over time it makes a difference in what you crave (not carbs) as your body relies on a different method of getting/sustaining energy (aka not a quick bump of carbs and sugar to give you and energy boost, rather, sustained energy)  4.Be mindful of what you're eating/craving. Figure out what element of it you're craving and ease yourself into healthier alternatives (I would eat pounds of candy, slowly turned it into dried fruit/nuts, then raw fruit, then eventually sweet potato/beets, and now I crave veggies and have less intense cravings)  This is the stuff that worked for me, but take it with a grain of salt as I'm coming from a binge/restrict and BN background. It's a process, not a quick fix, but be kind to yourself and have patience with your body. Even if you binge, treat yourself to a healthy, balanced diet regardless. It may be more calories but in the long run it's better than malnutrition from an unbalanced diet. I'd lose hair when I used to binge because of malnutrition. Easing into healthy eating helped with bith cravings and physical/dental health.",False,False
