As you can probably guess from the fact that I was actively seeking that kind of content out, I was already dealing with anorexia and body dysmorphia. I used to read and re-read some of the longer threads like old favorite books. I was partial to Gemma Ward and Cara Delevingne, because they had (at the time) gone through a significant weight gain. Watching them slip from objects of idealization to ridicule was at once intoxicating and terrifying. It reinforced that if I gained weight I would not just become plain but objectively offensive. As if in an ideal world people who looked like that would not exist. I have to say that I still read it, though I have never had an account. I wish that those who were interested in signing up could, but that no other child would have to read things the things that I did.  There is a thread called ‚ÄúSG hate‚Äù and I guess you could categorize this post as such, but I can only hope that the owners/moderators of SG at some point become aware of the damage that their website does to people.",False,False

Way more unbearable that MPA or basically any other actual ED space I've been near.

If you own a domain, you can post anything you want as long as it's not breaking the law (e.g., posting CP). Like, it's highly unusual for the actual owner of CDN services to deny service. It happened with the Daily Stormer and 8Chan (at least for now), but that was in reaction to massive public outcry....Cloudflare must've decided it was ultimately better for business to take them down.
