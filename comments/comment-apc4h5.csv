Feel free to ignore it but hopefully it can offer a new perspectice or at least make you feel less alone.  -         Its so hard with parents sometimes because even if in a messed up way their opinions and criticisms are well-intended they dont understand how much it can fuck us up.    Even we dont realise how much it can fuck us up. It has taken me years and so, so much research and thought work and both internal and external validation plus medication to even recognize, let alone undo some of the negative ingrained thought processes i have. And its still a work in progress.         For example, my mum is an extremely critical and negative person, with pretty unpredictable reactions. As much as i dont blame her and appreciate her raising me, her irrarionality makes it hard to spend time around her without regressing back to a mindset i work hard to escape.          The habits that affected me the most growing up and into adulthood, imho is:    1. Like your mother, anything you say or do they can find a way to critisize and pick at, without taking the time to understand and listen to your actual needs. (E.g. gain weight - youre fat, go out and dont eat - why arent you eating enough. dating guys? Dont be a ho! Single? Where is your husband? )              *how they may mean it: the criticism may be a way of keeping you from falling too far either way, keeping you ""in line"" so to speak. Collectivist east-asian cultures in particular value blending in with the community over standing out and taken to the extreme some parents do this to discourage you from being **too** anything. Even if it doesnt make sense.*         How it actually feels: literally everything you do is wrong, failure seems inescapable and discouraging rather than a normal part of life and how anyone learns anything, completing tasks can feel overwhelming and when things dont work out your personal inadequacies are to blame.     2. Minimizing your emotions but not their own.  (E.g shouting, turning everything into a lecture, silent treatment, telling you off and accusing you of being oversensitive if you cry, their problems are disasters but if you have any it is because you are ungrateful because others have it worse.)         *how they might mean it: i think this is partly just an inability to control their emotions and something thats passed down from their parents, and partly their way of ""toughening"" you up, which in a way can kind of work because tbh no one has ever come close to making me feel as much like shit as a mom-diss, but often can just make you super closed off and like you and your thoughts and feelings have no value.*        How it really be: probs dont need to even explain this one because obviously its pretty apparant how awful this is. Personally it gave me incredibly low self-esteem and a bit of social anxiety, but it also make me seek understanding which has given me pretty good emotional intelligence as a result.         3. Referring to  reactions as permanent and unquestionable traits, including positive ones. (E.g. if you received good grades in school its because you are inherently smart, not because you worked hard, and if someone wrongs them once, they didnt just do a bad thing they *are* a bad person.        *this is actually really common and i think most people do it to some extent, its only recently come out via scientific studies what a negative impact it can have when raising a child, and maintaining relationships. Some parents do it worse than others and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy and confirmation bias thing where they see patterns that arent there and cant handle it when things arent consistent with their world view*       How we see it: it makes it feel like we have unchangable, inherent traits or issues with our personalities that we cant change, patterns that we will always fall back on and that will always come up in any argument because its ""who we are"". Actually its just who we are *so far*, because thats how we have reacted to the situations weve been in, the only thing tying us to it, is our belief that it is real. That makes it comfortable because its what we know so yes we will naturally tend towards it because our brains want to be ""efficient"". However theres no actual reason why we cant make new decisions which become new patterns. I think you and your sister probably know this, as do most our age, but a lot of parents seem to still be stuck on this mind set.   If you always watched looney toons as a kid because there wasnt much else on tv, you dont get told well into adulthood that you innately are a bugs bunny fan, and have the connection highlighted in every decision you make, so how come if you were overweight as a child because every family event revolved around food and relatives only knew how to express their love through feeding you, people often say you *are* a fat child, or a fat person, who has just ""never been able to control themselves""?                     I know this is a lot of text, but i hope some of it can at least help you ""rationalize"" (because our feelings alone arent valid, right?) away some of these shitty thoughts and comments. It has helped me a bit.",False,False
