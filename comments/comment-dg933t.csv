On typical Fridays I allow myself bubble tea and dessert. Sure, I don’t eat the rest of the day, but it makes me feel like hey, I’ve got this. And I will allow myself other treats now and again too...and try my hardest to keep them down.",False,False

I dont eat anything else the rest of the day, so I suppose I'm just living on whatever calories my body doesnt manage to expel, as well as 2 bowls of oatmeal on weekends.",False,False

Partially to make a good, healthy impression, and partially because although restriction gives me a sense of control, allowing myself not to count also makes me feel like I have some fucked up control over my ED as well.  My favorite treats are the ones where I don't have to feel guilty after though. Like yesterday I &gt;!measured an acceptable portion of lasagna for dinner, and had a side of baby bok choy in miso and homemade mashed cauliflower for a combined 400 calories. The meal was super big in volume compared to the calories, and I got to have lasagna with real pasta.!&lt;",False,False
