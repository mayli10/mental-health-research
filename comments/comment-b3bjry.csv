That is how many calories are required to create the red blood cells you lost but that 650 is spread over two months so like 11 cals a day lol which is two pickles worth, def not worth it to donate if youâ€™re feeling unwell ",False,False

If you do pass out, theyâ€™re not going to let you leave until youâ€™ve eaten something which could be very stressful for you depending on your disorder- they are very pushy for good reason. I would tread very carefully. ",False,False

Your body doesn't ramp up production of RBCs that much to make a big difference in metabolic rate. You may lose a little water weight tho (that you'll regain within a day).,False,False
eiypyso,t3_b3bjry,t3_b3bjry,3cats_in_atrenchcoat,1,2019-03-20 10:38:08,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/b3bjry/donating_blood_to_lose_weight/eiypyso/,Be super careful with that. It's very dangerous to donate blood if you are restricting heavily or at a very low weight. If you have any problems with light headedness or blood pressure do do not consider donating blood.    I may also be incorrect here but I think I remember that is doesn't quite burn 650 calories in the way people think. Because blood production is normally counted into the basal metabolic rate. It takes the body 4-8 weeks to regrow all the red blood cells so that caloric effort is spread out over that period.  I could however be incorrect on this. I just think it's interesting to think about. ,False,False

Odds are they won't let you if you're underweight however it's a very physically stressful process and could really hurt you if you aren't healthy enough.,False,False
