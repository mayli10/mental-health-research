Self deprecating language can make others view you that way. I have ADD. When I go shopping I do the same thing. I think it is just that the stores have gotten better with distracted marketing. Look around. Everybody in the store looks (or sometimes they are) to be on drugs. Most people are just hiding it. I'm so bad...if somebody calls me I'll meander around looking while talking on the phone... Suddenly I have to tell them... Hey, can I call you back? If I don't hurry and get my stuff I'll never go home. I already know I can't hold a phone conversation and read labels too, plus I  get distracted by the Alzheimer's granny fighting over pork loin with the scooter man , screaming kids, weirdos staring at me, some of them trying to talk to me asking stupid questions like, ""You gotsa boyfriend? Can I lick your feet? Wherebouts you live?"" Etc.   I try to go shopping when it is quiet.",False,False
