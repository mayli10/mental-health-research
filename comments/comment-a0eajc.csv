I hate it but somehow it reduces my eating a lot.   Every single time something enters my stomach, I feel pain. I don't even restrict that much that I lost the ability to eat. I do eat every day! It's just that I tend to eat OMAD only and I kinda binge, but not really. And I am so ecstatic about food that I just eat so quickly and I guess that's why.   But recently, I started having pain the day after. Like whenever I eat 400+ kcal, I have intense stomach pain the morning after.   You might want to look at side problems that are actually mot related to the food. I actually had stomach acidity due to stress at work and personal life, and it made my life hell. Don't eat? Stomach pain. Eat? Stomach pain. ðŸ™ƒ",False,False

It might be worth cutting out certain foods and seeing if thereâ€™s any improvement (I know thatâ€™s scary when if youâ€™re already restricting but could end up being very helpful in the long run if it means you can eat without being in pain)",False,False

But I guess it could also just be that your body isnâ€™t very used or eating if you donâ€™t eat enough?  Hope you find a solution, that sounds sucky!!",False,False
