I was severely anorexic a few years ago. Once I began eating again, I couldn’t stop. Now I’m heavier than I’ve ever been in my life. I miss feeling thin and light. I miss my tiny wrists and my collar bones. I miss everything.  But I lost my mind trying to be thin. Literally and figuratively.   Not eating is not the answer. Binging is not the answer. Extreme anything is never the answer. It only harms. You feel good for a time it never lasts. And the harm we do to our bodies is dangerous and can have lasting consequences.   I don’t know what to say to help you with the binging and not eating. I’m in the same damn boat and have no answers. I’m 31 and still struggling with a problem most often associated with teenage girls. How pathetic is that? I just want you to know that you’re not the only one that feels this way. I hope you find your way through the day. Then the week. Then the month. Then the year. Then through life.",False,False

It’s not about the number, it’s about the disorder. Sending you love and support ❤️",False,False
