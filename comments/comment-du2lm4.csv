For many it's a reflection of how they view themselves and projecting all these unhealthy thoughts and control onto us. I remember my mom hiding the butter from me and pointing out any small weight gain very young. Asian moms yo. That shit can fuck you up for life.,False,False

When I'm restricting/malnourished etc etc. my mam tells me that I look like shit and I need to eat more food.  So I started to eat more food. And literally today she said to me ""why are you eating pizza"" in a condescending way and im like.. bitch its because I'm hungry. Just let me eat what I want without making me feel guilty.",False,False

They want you to be healthy, but they don't check their own behaviour. Either they can't be bothered or refuse to accept that they're being problematic. It's something you have to remember not to take to heart. Society treats women like garbage and the average person can't even begin to fathom that it has effected them in any way.",False,False
