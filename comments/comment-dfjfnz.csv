I can relate from experience - I've been having the same issues since my early teens and even after more than a decade of various meds and doctors, nothing is helping. I mentioned that I was thinking about hysterectomy to my family and they were decidedly against it, but in the end, I will do what my doctor and I will agree is best. It's seriously such a trip to finally see someone successfully dealing with the same problem, although I do not wish these issues on anybody.

You have obviously gone through tougher things than me  Please don't think I was trying to one up you! We've both had struggles and are different people; which means to me, that both of our troubles are  tough as fuck.  I will say, I've been told and have read that the only way to 100%- diagnose someone with endo is a laparoscopic exam. Legit surgery, because the endo adhesions will not show on an ultrasound, vaginal or otherwise. But it deffo does sound like you have all the symptoms! Please bring it ip to your doc. You shouldn't have to suffer more than necessary!  But oof I do not envy the iud placement or removals. I had a saline ultrasound once where they put a catheter thru my cervix while I was awake and I almost passed out. You're a trooper, like woah!  All that plus the ADHD..my heart goes out to you. My Hubs has it and I remember his struggles before he had meds. But he didn't have all the other health issues like you. And I'm sorry it took so long for someone to take your pain seriously. It's so insane how long it takes doctors to listen to us.   But that's why we talk about it. The more of us that speak out, the easier it will be for future generations. ❤",False,True

Getting my IUD (twice, I’m on my second one now, only had the first for 1.5 years bc I’m a fkn idiot) was the most painful thing I’ve ever experienced and I baffled my OBGYN both times with my body reactions. However, it put all of the other shitty things to rest for the most part. I’ll still get tenderness, hormonal acne, sometimes some moodiness but I don’t have to deal with all of that bs anymore. Huge change.   Also I got diagnosed with ADHD last year and getting on medication turned my life around so much.   I have chronic back pain and only a few years ago I started getting treatments (like massage) for it, and was diagnosed with non severe scoliosis and chronic back pain. It was finally taken seriously and it’s been helpful to get treatment.   It really is quite incredible what our bodies and minds can endure.

Every aspect of your physical and mental health is valid and deserves all the proper attention you need!  I know your pain. The only time of my life I wanted to go to sleep and never wake up is when my depression levels and my bleeding levels came at a head at the same time. I did not know how to cope, but I hung on for my Husband and because I still had hope something would come of all the suffering. And maybe this is it. Maybe I went thru this to help someone navigate this shit. And I'm ok with that. If I can shorten the suffering time for even one person, it's fuckin worth it.

Yeah, haha, it’s not fun as we both know!!    So far I’ve been to a couple ob/gyn’s to discuss the issues.  I thought it may have been a thyroid issue due to them running in my family, but no dice there.  Surprisingly my blood tests don’t show anemia.  I’ve had an ultrasound recently as well as multiple pap smears (my first came back abnormal so the second ob/gyn i visited wanted to do another.)  I had actually gotten the nexplanon implant to try regulate it, that didn’t work so they put me on the pill which worked for about a week and stopped.  So far the general consensus is “oh you’re recovering from your ED!” (i had explained that 2 years prior I had lost 30-40 pounds in a year and had actually lost my period during that time.)  or “It’s the nexplanon!” which I highly doubt as this has been ongoing since before the nexplanon was in.  My insurance hasn’t said anything about why it wasnt covered, and honestly neither the hospital nor the insurance has given me an itemized bill, but I know that I had the same tests run less than a year ago so my assumption is that’s why the didn’t cover it.  They also didn’t cover my ultrasound test either.  (But I ended up paying it anyways.)

He is literally a robotic surgery instructor and has done sooo many surgeries I felt safe with him.

I had the same issue for years...no one could tell me for sure the cause. I had every test and ultrasound you could get.   I finally had a reproductive endocrinologist who said it was an issue with my pituitary gland not sending the right signals to my brain. And I asked ""oh wow, my first real diagnosis! How do we fix that?"" And he just frowned and said if he knew, he would take me with him to Stockholm when collected the nobel prize. AKA there is no known cure. The medical community hasn't figured it out...or maybe they don't bother trying because birth control is so good at masking the symptoms.  My options were birth control forever and that just made the migraines and anxiety worse. Or a fertility drug that *might* work but was not covered by insurance and was so expensive. I didn't like the idea of being on any drug until menopause. A hysterectomy was the surefire ""cure"" that would give me my life back asap.  I asked the endocrinologist if weight gain could have caused this and he said only if I were 150lbs overweight. And I'm only 20 lbs overweight. :(  As for your insurance issue..did they say why it was not covered? Maybe they marked it as fertility or something? I know a lot of plans do not cover for that. If so you can ask the doctor to change the diagnosis and resubmit the claim. It never hurts to ask!  Let me know if you're comfortable with telling me and maybe I can think of something?
