I *know* that my anorexia has literally 0 to do with how much I weigh - it's a manifested behavior from so many other problems and traumas and pent up shit. So why do I have to gain weight to be considered recovered? I want everything *else* to go away, for fucks sake",False,False

I promise I’m not saying this in the context of being rebellious against weight restoring in general   Being prescribed medications not proven to actually help anorexics mentally recover while knowing weight gain was one of the most common side effect and no alternatives were offered. The feelings of helplessness that came along with the treatment weight gain was scarring enough and exacerbated mental symptoms in yet prescribing this was a great idea for some reason.  I can’t prove it based on exactly what was said but I feel pretty sure one doctor low key implied I shouldn’t restart taking my ADHD once I got sent home because it medicating my ADHD wasn’t necessary.,False,False

The whole reason I developed bulimia was because of anorexia; thus, whenever the bulimia gets better, I start to restrict again and get all weird with food.   But this fucker, my psychiatrist at IP, simply smiled at me when I told her this, and asked me sarcastically “why did you tell on yourself?” Nearly laughing while doing so. And literally nothing happened after I told her I was trying to restrict. I continued to do so until I was deemed “fit to be discharged.”",False,False

One thing that always majorly pissed me off was that I’d get about 40 minutes of therapy a week... while everyone with anorexia got around two hours a day. wat. The other person who was on the ward for a non-ED issue had exactly the same problem as me. We were just locked in our rooms and basically left to rot, we got no help. Three months of this shit made my mental state *worse*, not better.",False,False
