You deserve to be happy and healthy, and that extra support may make the difference for you being successful in your recovery journey. Let us know if you decide to book an appointment, I am proud of you either way for reaching out for help!",False,False

I knew if I posted here I'd get replies, I don't want to post something and for it to end up in the void.   I appreciate your concern and your framing does shift the lens on this a little.    It'll be extremely embarassing to book a proper session after all the hassle i've caused but I should probably do it, yeah. idk if I WILL, but I'm certainly considering it",False,True

I think making an appointment and making it a priority to go to it will be very helpful in your recovery for both your eating disorder and sobriety. I know it seems like a huge pain to make the appointment, but they can best help you if you make an appointment and can see the same therapist for future appointments. Using the drop in for emergencies is great, but if they haven't been meeting with you it really hurts their ability to know what you sre going through and guide you to meet your goals. And therapy is great to vent, but that's not the only purpose of therapy. You aren't going to recover just from venting. I'm hoping you take this as I have meant it, I am just concerned. I mean no offense or judgment.",False,False

The last appointment I booked, i hadn't slept in some days and then finally when the appointment was coming up, I straight up KO'd. Like an hour before hand. I fairly regularly miss lectures because of my poor sleep. Plus, the drop-ins are just better- they work when I need to speak to someone. Planned sessions wouldn't work as well because I might turn up and have not much to say, or not want to talk at that time. when I was in actual therapy, that happened A LOT.  This sobriety session is partly to  see if going off everything helps the sleep issues. I've seen doctors about it before, I know what causes it, there's nothing i can really do about it.  I'm really thinking about booking an appointment but I don't want to waste anyone's time.",False,True
