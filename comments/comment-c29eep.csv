Relapsed around November of 2018 when my husband moved out. So now I‚Äôm sans my career (quit a couple months prior cause I‚Äôm an idiot), living with my mom, and without the love of my life. And my dumb bitch brain decides that the best coping mechanism I have is to starve myself, you know, just to bring some spice into the depression I was already in. And here I am, 35 pounds lighter :)   Everything is still in shambles and I still wanna die but at least I‚Äôm skinnier.",False,False

I don‚Äôt have kids but the pattern you describe is really relatable. For me it was a chronic illness diagnosis that I never dealt with, some weight gain related to it not long ago, then an acute illness that also resulted in rapid weight loss that‚Äôs been a little too satisfying.",False,True

I almost doubled my weight in pregnancy but afterwards the kilos just dropped off effortlessly, and seeing the rapid weight loss just got its hooks back into me I guess, the restriction addiction just kicked in and I didn‚Äôt want to stop once I‚Äôd gotten to a natural healthy weight.  The most recent one I don‚Äôt even know really. It snuck up on me. Sometimes I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs even happening as it‚Äôs been so insidious this time. I have a couple theories, main one is working on spiritual growth and introspection seems to imply that I‚Äôd only ever healed superficially, never addressed the root cause and until I heal my soul I won‚Äôt sustain a healed body.

I gotta recover man this isn't life, this is tortured existence!  Anyway, went on the recovery train for a while, got into intuitive eating briefly and weight lifting, but the muscle I started putting on rapidly scared the shit out of me and I panicked. Counting calories again and this time it's obsessive.  A few weeks of binging while I got used to eating less again and now I haven't binged in a while. Losing weight and intoxicated by it.

I ate intuitively and was slightly overweight but happy with myself. In January 2018 my new years resolution was to get healthier, so I began eating better and exercising more often. A series of multiple traumatic events in April of that year led me to completely spiral, and I became underweight by the end of the year through restricting and overexercising (occasional bp too)   And now I'm flipflopping around the low end of healthy bmi and uw constantly and bping a lot :// dragged back to the b.s.",False,False

I had just accepted being fat but I found weightlifting and was getting strong. Felt good about that so I stopped restricting and binging. Well, about 2 years later I ended up with undiagnosed celiac disease. It took them almost a year of tests and misdiagnosis to figure it out and because I was literally starving my body due to malabsorption I lost 150 pounds. The rapid weight loss made me feel like shit, but then I felt like I couldn't gain any of the weight back again and I started spiraling again.",False,False
