I really appreciate the love we feel here and it's so great.

I hope it doesn't come across as too disorganized.  First of all, I'm really proud of you for holding a job. I understand that feeling of being 'trapped' in bed whenever I'm not at work. I'm also a job hopper myself. But I'm learning that employers don't care as much these days if you change jobs frequently. What matters most is that you're clearly an intelligent person and a fast learner, which makes you a desirable and valuable employee.   I'm sorry you're having difficulty accessing counseling resources. I also understand the feeling of knowing I need therapy but not having the energy to pursue it. Is there a trusted friend or loved one who can help you set it up so it's less of a drain on you? If not, feel free to PM me. If starting therapy (either in person or via phone/internet) is something you want to do, I'm familiar with the system and might be able to help you out.  Lastly, I'm sorry you're struggling. I'm in a binge phase right now too and it sucks. I know the feeling of frustration and helplessness all too well. Remember that at any given second, you're one second away from feeling a little better. I hope the good vibes from this sub lift your spirits even a little. And I promise that little by little, things will get better. Feel free to post any time. We care about you. You matter. 💕",False,False

For me, I can get really obsessive about something but if it’s a healthy thing it can help. But I get you with the tired thing. I’ve been there. It’s so hard to get into what you love when you’re exhausted.   Have you talked to someone about medication? If you’re on medication it may be the wrong dose.   If you’re in America (where healthcare is expensive) you might want to look into what is required to receive disability services. Then you can get Medicaid and see a psychiatrist. I know two people who are on disability for mental  health and it works well for them.   That’s cool about the Astronomy. I studied Ancient Astronomy.

It is incredibly stressful and draining, and it makes me question why the fuck I picked this career. Tax forms are boring as hell. I go through cycles of being so stressed I barely eat anything all day, to emotionally binging hard because I'm sad and stressed and sick of the work. I really really wish I had an easy fix I could tell you, but this far the only thing I've found to help a bit is to make sure you take time for yourself at night, and to maybe put up a white board somewhere at home to write down your goals. The former, taking time for yourself, will help with the stress and dealing with how boring the day can get. If theres a show you love, make time to watch an episode a night. Take a bath. A walk with a pet. Listen to music while doing absolutely nothing for a little while. I know it doesn't sound like much, but making sure to take back a piece of your day selfishly for yourself can really help break the mental cycle. Likewise, it can really help with motivation to have your goals or your future plans written down somewhere that you can see them every day. For me, it keeps me accountable.
