The Daily from the New York Times, AC 360 (Anderson Cooper) from CNN, CBC Front Burner (but I’m Canadian so I understand if you’re not into that one) and for my favourite humour one, If I Were You by Jake and Amir formerly of College Humour. They run an entire podcast network called HeadGum that is full of good humour podcasts, definitely worth checking it out to see if you find one you’ll be interested in! ",False,False
