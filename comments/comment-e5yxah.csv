It helps in recovery a lot to understand that all food is good food in moderation and being overweight isn’t inherently bad. People can be healthy at a wide range of weights— my natural set point out of treatment was one BMI point into the overweight range. Skinny doesn’t automatically equal good, either. You don’t need to be thin to be healthy.   I think your body is your business and yours alone, however, and they have no place commenting on it. But I do think it’s harmful to you to talk down on others for their own eating habits and bodies.",False,False

There certainly is a double standard. If you criticize overweight people you should be more body positive but if someone is underweight body positivity just doesn't exist I guess.",False,False

I didn't like it whenever someone comment I need to eat more or when they try to feed me with high calorie food.   You might share with them about your disordered eating if you havent, and tell them you are okay  and if you wanna eat more you will.",False,False
