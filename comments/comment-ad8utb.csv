It's about a couple seriously messed up teenagers with a couple mentions of disordered eating. While it's not *about* eating disorders by any means, it hits the same spot (for me at least).",False,False

It wasn’t specifically about EDs, but one of the girls was anorexic.  Thin is an obvious one. You need to subscribe to HBO to watch it on Hulu but I’m pretty sure it’s on YouTube as well.  Amy is on Netflix. It’s about Amy Winehouse— obviously the focus is more on her alcoholism and drug addiction, but there are a few mentions of her bulimia as well.  There are some episodes of Intervention on Hulu. My fave ED one (Emily) wasn’t among them last time I checked, and I can’t remember for sure which ones they do have, but I’d recommend Salina (it’s one of the eps split between two people which is kind of annoying, but I liked her portion), Amy W. I think and Amy P. There are a few others but I can’t remember their names. The episode on Asa was another good one but I don’t remember ever seeing it on Hulu.",False,False
