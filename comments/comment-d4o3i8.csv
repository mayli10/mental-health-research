It seems next to impossible to balance both- committing to an eating disorder and a relationship isn’t something that really *works*.   Yet it’s hard to be happy without an ED to obsess over. So much of my confidence in myself is based on how much weight I lose or how thin I am. Which effects my relationship, too, so I feel the need to commit more to my ED. But then, obviously, that gets Unhealthy and that drags down the relationship just as much.   Sure would be nice if my brain could comprehend *normal* dieting. (^:",False,True

I’ve all but abandoned peach because I felt out of place since I was “recovering.”  But in all honesty, I deeply miss entertaining myself by coming up with new fucked-up food plans and self destructing while being accountable to no one but myself.  But now I have a boyfriend who knows about my ED and is, like, a normal person who worries about me and enjoys eating and drinking.  And I feel so stuck.  I’ve gained up to a healthy weight and on one hand I keep telling myself I’m going to go back to heavy restricting and maybe he won’t notice.  (lmao.)  but honestly I’ve gotten so used to feeling normal and “enjoying food” and having energy that idk if I even have the willpower anymore, especially when I know I’ll be hurting him if I do it.",False,False
