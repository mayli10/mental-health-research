My dentist said that brushing your teeth after something acidic like soda (or vomit I’d assume) can damage the enamel because it’s weaker after the acid and then you’re coming in with the physical abrasion of a toothbrush. I’d recommend brushing first and a good flouride mouthwash after.,False,False

I don't know if brushing would help though. It seems like that's just clearing off the plaque and stuff so the acid can hit the enamel easier... This is all uneducated conjecture, of course.",False,False

That can actually worsen the damage to your teeth.  I don't know about brushing before though but I don't think it would help.  What you're protecting your teeth from when brushing normally isn't stomach acid, it's food stuff.  I don't see why brushing before purging would necessarily protect your teeth better and I couldn't find anything on google.  Colgate has some stuff about it on their [website](https://www.colgate.com/en-us/oral-health/conditions/anorexia-bulimia/bulimia) if you're interested.  Mouth wash and toothpaste with flouride are both reccomended.",False,False
