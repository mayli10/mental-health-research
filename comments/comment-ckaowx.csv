Maybe I've misunderstood what I've been reading, I'm not a professional after all. I binge when I'm socially anxious, stressed or bored I guess. Thanks, will check that book out.",False,True

Can you find some research studies, or other references, that that med helps? Isn't that ""just"" paxil? If you are bingeing because you're anxious that really might help. I'm sorry you feel hopeless.",False,False
