It‚Äôs worked to the point that people know not to bring up weight around me lest the get The Speech, little do they know that I‚Äôm worse than any of them üòÇ",False,False

I had a friend grill me on exactly what I eat at every meal (she was trying to lose weight so it wasn‚Äôt malicious) but I was water fasting at the time so I had to make something up on the spot. It was stressful and embarrassing because my sister (who knows about my ED) was there too. Ever since then, I try to seem as bored and uninterested as possible when people bring up dieting and weight loss in hopes that they‚Äôll drop it. ",False,True

I can‚Äôt personally relate but I know a few women that are in the same boat as you. They just can‚Äôt seem to lose their pregnancy weight no matter what they do. Try to hang in there ‚ù§Ô∏è it‚Äôll be even more satisfying when you reach your goals since you‚Äôve struggled so much for them :) ,False,True

I have never shared about my disordered eating habits either so it's not malicious on their end or anything, but it just so wildly uncomfortable when people talk to me about their diet and weightloss.

I'm still trying to lose the last bit of baby weight and I'm so close, but it's taken a year to do it. (FYI, breastfeeding does not always make you lose weight) so when I hear someone who is not only 20 years younger than me lose the baby weight like 5 days after giving birth, I just want to scream. I work so hard to get it off and keep it off, and when someone is beating me to their goal weight, I get so mad and jealous. And. I want  to punch them in the face. But I just lie and say ""These things take time"" to the other moms who are still working on it. Sorry for the rant. It's hard to have an eating disorder and hide it from everybody. I guess we all know how that feels. Keep your chin up, everyones got their own battles right? ",False,False
