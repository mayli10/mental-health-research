I'm so happy to think about the sweet relationship you two obviously have and how lucky I am to even have this to complain about. A couple months ago no one gave a shit that I was starving and spiraling. Now at least I have some outside perspective? I'm trying to think of this as a good thing..it's difficult.  Thanks for relating and reaching out through the screen, you anonymous mouse in Dublin, you :)",False,True

My bf tried to put my scale on top of the kitchen counters (which I can’t reach) and tried to « bargain » with me about how if I promise to say out loud that I love myself every morning I can have it back. Typing this out makes me feel like such a piece of shit, we got together way before my ED started I can’t believe I’m letting these pointless food issues/obsessions ruin the best relationship in my life.",False,False
