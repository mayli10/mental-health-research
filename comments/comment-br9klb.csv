I was a runner/lifter in high school and continued through most of undergrad. I used to love how I felt after workouts because of my swollen muscles and the water retention literally makes your muscles look and feel bigger. Then my body image and ed got worse and now I haaaaate it,False,False

I just got back into running (well intermittently with walking because holy shit my old ankle injuries) but I feel so conflicted. I'm proud of myself for running...but I swear I look bigger afterwards. I know it's prolly water swelling in my muscles and shit, but it fucks with my head.   Imma just keep pushing- best of luck to ya too!",False,False

I used to be able to do weight workouts every day in highschool but I doubt I could do them nowadays without feeling lightheaded.   If your mood feels worse that might also be fatigue from having an ED for a long time. Exercise purging used to feel more or less okay to me but once again, nowadays it's more of a chore that I have to listen to podcasts to get through.",False,False
