I wouldn't say I binged but I definitely ate more than normal. Never gained from it, it always faded once I was healthy again. I'd say it probably had something to do with dehydration. Stay hydrated and eat what your body asks for, it knows what it needs right now. Hope you feel better soon! ",False,False
