I'm not too strict about times though, some meals take me 30 minutes and others 90. In fact, OMAD had probably let me enjoy food more and worry less. It certainly has halted the binge/restrict cycle for me as well.   Only black coffee for me! I'm pretty sure (read: my ED brain is picky af) that the milk will spike your insulin levels, making you even more hungry and miserable. I don't even put stevia in my coffee. Somedays, i add a pinch of sea salt in the grounds, or cinnamon. It really helps cut the bitterness. I also take caffeine pills haha but I have ADHD so I don't know what they would do to you   Also, fruit is wonderful but it can mess pretty bad with your blood sugar. When I get home and feel like I absolutely NEED to eat something, I have a tsp of natural PB. Lots of healthy fats and proteins to balance out the carbs, plus it fills you up surprisingly well.   Hope this helps! OMAD works well for me but it's not for everyone. Please stay safe and try to get as much nutrition in as you can. Your body and brain deserve it ðŸ’–",False,False

Also do you drink black coffee when you study or you put in milk too. Iâ€™m struggling with school and calorie restriction. I donâ€™t eat breakfast but I have a piece of fruit and then when I get home I binge on junk or whatever and eating so much gives me such bad brain fog. ,False,False

Studying? Caffeinate. Class time? Caffeinate!    It also raises your blood pressure if you're prone to fainting like I am. ,False,False

This let's me sit still long enough to study. I also do OMAD 650-1000 calories which has been working great for me so far.   Trick for me is to only have plain water and coffee when I'm studying. I find that brain fog is worst when I eat a low cal breakfast/lunch vs no breakfast and lunch.   That being said, the best way to focus is to have proper nutrition and mental health care rip ",False,False

Have a snack before classes or when you need to study. Also exercise is great for getting the brain working, so eating slightly higher (my limit was usually 800 on non gym days and 1000 when I was doing high intensity workouts) and going for a couple of short walks throughout the day might help too",False,False
