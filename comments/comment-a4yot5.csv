If you're asking for special accommodation, like having a single for a medical reason, then you would probably need to go through disabilities services at your school (or something equivalent, but every school has a different process) but if you just want to move to another room, i would suggest putting in a room change request form (either with your RA or online, however your school does it) and then sending an email to the RD of your building saying that you put in the request, but would like a sped up process if possible because your roommate is impeding on your mental health and eating disorder recovery. they may ask for a meeting with you, and you can be as honest or as not honest with them as you want, but they won't be able to consult another department or other students to fact check you. from my experience, RDs are amazing people and they have all been trained to deal with these types of situations. you should feel reassured that your privacy will be respected in this situation, and you don't need to disclose anything that you're not comfortable with. the only reason why i would be honest about ed recovery is because if you're vague and they air on the side of caution, they have to report to university police if they think you're going to harm yourself/others, which might just cause a whole lot of attention you don't want. ed recovery to them is a lot less serious than feeling suicidal or engaging in active self harm.   but yeah, filing the request and sending your RD an email may be the best/least confrontational way to do this? i hope this helps!",False,False
