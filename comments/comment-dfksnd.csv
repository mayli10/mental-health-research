But you might keep precracked/uncooked eggs in a gatorade bottle or something. Then just pour a little in a cup and heat in the morning,False,False

I didn’t think caffeine pills were that cheap! I’m still pretty much under scrutiny when it comes to what I get with the $40 I’m set to use so I dunno if they would take kindly to me trying to get any.  My situation is unorthodox and even more so at the moment so I’m with close relatives who I don’t really know until some things calm down and I should hopefully get to move back in with another family member and their home which  I’m more comfortable in and used too.  I never thought about drizzling oil on any microwaved things, that would be a good way to fill calories! Liquid measures scare me but I should probably get better at working with those.",False,True

Anyways, my recommendations are:   Canned beans or meat for protein (lentils, tuna, chicken)  Caffeine pills since you say you need some (\~$2 for a bottle of like 100 200mg pills, from recollection)  Bread for carbs if no microwave. Can mix in potato if you can microwave.  And then could lightly drizzle like a tablespoon of olive oil for healthy fats in your diet.",False,False

I’m not really allowed to cook but tuna and tofu are my go to proteins when I’m cutting costs. I like tofu as it comes luckily. I can work down a $1 can of beans over the course of 3ish days depending on how much I use so it’s helpful.  I have a tub of steel cult oats that I need to get around to using but they seem so high calorie compared to their nutrition content to me.   I love sweet potatoes and recently started eating potatoes again but I sort of have the same issue as I do with the oats. I definitely keep an eye on what’s on sale and what’s in season. The chain grocery store that gets frequented does have a membership card but their coupons never seem to be for anything I would get (some things when on sale are cheaper but everything else costs more)  Really appreciate the tips!,False,True

Chickpeas and black beans can rehydrate in a slow cooker overnight and are a great staple for recipes.  Tofu- pretty cheap, high in protein, easy to prepare a lot of different ways. Look up how to marinate and bake tofu, doesn't require a lot of oil!  Sweet potatoes- I make buddha bowls with them (baked and cubed), but sweet potatoes are pretty cheap and can be used in various forms for recipes  Oats- overnight oats, hot oatmeal, homemade granola, and much more! Get the old-fashioned oats, only a few dollars for a tub of them.  Fruits- keep an eye on what fruits (and veggies) are on sale! Changes on a weekly basis, usually.  Extra tips: if you get those newspaper flyers for your local grocery store, actually take the time to look at those! I have a chain store that does membership cards and reward points, and I get some really good deals.",False,False
