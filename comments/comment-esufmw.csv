It‚Äôs not the first time I‚Äôve had issues with my kidneys before, like stones and infections (I‚Äôve had this disorder on and off for 12 years) so I guess I‚Äôm just not that concerned? Maybe I should be aha. I‚Äôve never gone to the dr for one before and they usually go away on their own. I had back pain and a fever all day, I finally gave in and took some Advil and I feel a bit better, sweaty from the fever though aha.   My wife is home and I told her I felt like I had a fever but she works really long hours and doesn‚Äôt know that I‚Äôm relapsing, so she just kinda said she was sorry and that she was going to take a nap. (I don‚Äôt nap, ever, if I can help it, so I‚Äôm on my own for a bit I guess) and I really don‚Äôt want to worry her anyways or god forbid she takes me to the drs.   a) I‚Äôm an immigrant and don‚Äôt have insurance rn  b) they‚Äôd bodyslam me into a treatment program for sure.   When she wakes up we‚Äôll probably cuddle and watch a movie or play sims or something :) thank you for your loving words and concern",False,True

I know it‚Äôs my own fault. I know it‚Äôs my Ed‚Äôs fault too. But I just can‚Äôt bring myself to change any of it. I‚Äôm just kind of stuck and miserable.",False,True

I had one and it was really awful, my right kidney has never fully recovered from it. Do you have a strong pain in one or both the sides of your back? Do you have a fever? If you're alone, please call someone you trust and let them help, you don't deserve to be cold and in pain ‚ô•Ô∏è",False,False

I do this to myself as well: putting too much on my own plate (excuse the food-related pun) and then I‚Äôm exhausted, can‚Äôt get up, don‚Äôt feed myself properly, find new things to hate myself for, etc. but you know what? It is important to treat yourself nicely. I can be the small things. It can be every now and then. It doesn‚Äôt have to be food. You can even just take a nice long warm bath/shower. Or buy yourself flowers. I feel like many of us find various ways of SH and justify it with being active/productive. But our bodies cannot endure it and when they go on strike, we see it as a personal failure. You‚Äôre not alone in this. I might not know you, but I understand. Be kind to yourself and take care!",False,False
