I’ll eat a foot long subway sandwich bc it makes me super full. Bread (360), turkey (120), cheese (50 bc I have them cut them in half so I only use 2 triangles for the whole footling), plus lots of veggies (30??). So like 580-600 calories. It’s literally the only thing I’m not scared to eat that’s that high cal bc i actually get rly full from it  Fast food of the same or even double calories barely makes me full and then I’m hungry again in like an hour so maybe I’ll try a bite of my fiancé’s if he ends up trying it but def wouldn’t get it myself",False,False

It was coming out both ends. Do not recommend.   If you’ve ever had Popeye’s chicken tenders, you’ve had the sandwich. Except the sandwich has these weird chucks of breading that’s dried out and gross and tastes like you soaked a cornflake in vegetable oil, let it sit in the sun for a month, then ate it.",False,False
