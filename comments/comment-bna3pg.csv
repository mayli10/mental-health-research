To gain a pound  you would have had to eat an excess of 3500 calories on top of your TDEE. But 890 is a clear deficit for anyone. Sometimes bodies don't reflect changes immediately. It's probably just water weight.,False,False

You might not be having good bowel movements or you may be retaining water. It’s impossible to gain actual fat when restricting that low! Try eating fiber/using a natural laxative and drink more water.,False,False
