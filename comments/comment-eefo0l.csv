That being said, a part of you wants to recover and in order to nurture that flame, believe in the people on your support team such as your dietitian, family and or friends and doctors. None of the people supporting you would want to give you bad advice to hurt your recovery. As long as you keep putting one foot in front of the other, recovery will be attainable. And everyone falls. It's about getting up and keeping on going. Hope these motivational words also help!",False,False

I’ll stop one form of destruction only to pick another back up, bouncing from ED to SH to alcohol to pills...round and round we go.   Trying to ‘just stop it’ never works for me. After all, every behavior started for real reasons. For me, so far I’m having the best outcomes when I..  **(a)** Have a sufficient (healthy) substitute to fill the void left by the harmful behavior.   **(b)** Work to address whatever underlying fears, misconceptions, hurts, unmet needs, etc. that are driving the harmful behavior(s)   That’s rough that winter break is messing with accessing your usual support resources. (It’s a tragicomedy that this time of year hits us with ‘Uh, usual resources won’t be available aaaand here’s an extra helping of stressful situations!’) I hope you’ll be able to get through the break and that they’ll have good help to offer when next you see them.",False,False

Dont do all of there at once (start small and work your way up). See how you feel after putting yourself in one of these uncomfortable scenarios. And in doing so, if you dont like the results of this experiment, you have the comfort of having ed in your ""back pocket"" to return to. If you do like the results if the experiment, you can keep going!Hope that makes some sense and helps!",False,False
