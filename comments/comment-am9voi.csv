And even longer if they have a refrigeration source. Kudos to you. I know that it's hard to feel too great about it because it was binge food and eating disorders tend to fuck with our heads like that but give yourself a clap on the back with this one; you just filled a potentionally starving stomach tonight!,False,False

That is an awesome thing you did. You also dis yourself a favor. We all want to binge sometimes (yes, and we all know we are fucking up, but are still compelled to do it)  but you likely gave this young girl and children enough to eat for a few days (provided they ration a bit). That is inspiring, OP! ♡",False,False
