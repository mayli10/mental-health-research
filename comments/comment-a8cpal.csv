So, sit him down, say ""please dont interrupt me, I'll tell you when I have said everything I need to say"" and let him know how you interpreted his comment, and the emotions you felt. Tell him ""logically I know you meant ABC, but emotionally I heard XYZ."" Then, tell him a more helpful way to make his comment in the future. Also, make sure you apologize for the way you acted. Dont say it in a manipulative way, and dont apologize for the emotions you felt. Just say, ""I'm sorry how I reacted to what you said. I'll try to stay more calm next time and let you know right away that the way you said that was upsetting.""   Of course, this is just my own advice/ opinion, and maybe with your bf, this approach wouldn't work. I hope it was helpful either way",False,False

Please talk to him and explain that you rationally understand what he meant, but that your first reaction was to something else... At least that's what happens to me. Don't let the ed take this away from you, speak up even the shame wants you to keep silent.  I am projecting like crazy sorry but I do think you should talk to him even if it seem redundant... Don't let things fester. Good luck.",False,False

I think we all have comments from SOs that set us off, especially because we feel more vulnerable with people we care about. My trigger for date nights is ""do you want to split an appetizer"" because obviously that means he wants it and for the 23434th time, NO I DON'T but I don't want to disappoint him, and then I'm flooded with food anxiety. Sends me into an emotional fit and it always ends in me being an asshole for the rest of the night because I'm crazy too, you know?",False,False
