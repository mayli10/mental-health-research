AVRT is the base for both those previous books and they both explain what they got from it and how they adapted it to their methods for stopping binge eating, but idk, I still liked more the AVRT concepts.   You can get an online copy of Brain Over Binge on libgen. Never Binge Again is free on their website (too lazy to hyperlink ðŸ˜…, you can just google it). The AVRT crash course is pretty short and you can take it on their website (again, just google it lol). Also, both the first two have podcasts.",False,False
