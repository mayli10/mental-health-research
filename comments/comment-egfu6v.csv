I mostly do it for the satiation since I have BED.  For water weight any carbs that you can cut helps definitley. You might also want to look into vegan keto ( there's a sub if you're interested). Not necesarily for your whole diet, but might be good to throw a few low-carb meals into your week. I'm not an expert, but I'd say there's a benefit to eating less carb-heavy foods even if you don't go full keto. You'll still hold some water, but less than if you ate something super carb heavy.  I've heard fasting helps a ton for water weight too, but that's a whole other level that I am nowhere near being on yet. Even with keto I still get hangry every 8 or so hours.",False,False

I wonder if there could be a nice middle-ground, like eating just enough carbs so that you won't gain water weight (or at least very little) if you slip up but also restricting carbs enough to reap the benefits without going into ketosis.

I haven't had issues with that but I also ate a ton of veggies so I tink that was enough fiber to keep things moving. I stopped keto for the holidays and feel like shit rn, but back when I was doing really well I felt great once I got through the sugar withdrawal period. If you're curious, my typical day of eating looked like this:  meal 1:  3 eggs with hot sauce and parmesan cheese, black coffee  Meal 2:   either skip, eat some fat (aka butter on a spoon), or if I'm really hungry something like celery and ranch  &amp;#x200B;  Meal 3:  Fish, a cup or so of broccoli, 2 tbsps. olive oil, 2 cups of broth  &amp;#x200B;  If I was still hungry after that I'd usually drink a fruity tea and that was it.
