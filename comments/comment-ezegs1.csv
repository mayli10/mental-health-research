It's a weird spot of being not short or tall.   Black and white describes it exactly.    I want the extreme results from my scale everyday. I'm so focused on that number and wanting it low even though at my current weight my body distributes fat very well at the current number. I'm only losing if I can see that number tick down quickly. I'm also only this extreme with myself and pushing myself this hard.  I need to stop weighing myself and i think it would help me see my body, not the numbers. its so hard :c",False,True

I understand it's a part of the disorder, this mentality of seeing the world and ourselves as just ""black or white"". I'm working on it by accepting some ambiguity in other aspects of my life. I can rationally think ""she is a good person, but she has this really bad habit that I hate"" and not go directly to ""she is a bad person and I hate her"" (not the habit). So why I can't do the same to myself? It's what I'm figuring out",False,False
