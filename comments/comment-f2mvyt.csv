I don’t think it has really changed my brain too much long term. Although it has conditioned me to feel the effects when I take my other meds/vitamins even without it!  I have a lot of improvement in concentration, which is hella important for uni. However, it greatly stifles my creativity when doing art. I also have a lowered appetite, which is good in terms of a lower net intake. However, it means I’m less likely to eat in moderation when I do. It’s a ‘take some lose some’ situation, at least that’s how it feels. :)  Recovery wise, I’m mainly focusing on underlying issues behind ED behaviour rather than the ED itself if that makes sense? Past troubling happenings/trauma, etc. I am still pretty disordered, but these days I have my rational mind to tell me when things aren’t healthy so I don’t go too far anymore. Still disordered, but I try not to let it get too bad.  I did see a nutritionist for a while actually. He really helped me out, he gave me healthy but balanced food guides. He was very factual and focused strictly on nutritional requirements (whole grains, vitamins, minerals, vegetables, etc), which helped me so much. It was very grounding, like a reality check. :)  I’m happy to help! it’s such a personal topic IRL, many people are ashamed of ED behaviours. I think there’s also a fear of ‘passing it on’ to others . Also, many ED behaviours seem normal thanks to those influencers that set unbalanced food standards.",False,False

How much of an improvement do you feel has occurred due to taking the prescription, do you think you could give some sort of rating/10 of everything before vs. after starting Vyvanse? How would you describe where you are in the ‘recovery process’ (or not)?  Really appreciate your sharing of your experience. I honestly have no clue where else I could ask these sorts of questions, I simply don’t know anyone who has dealt with any of this stuff IRL! I’m personally rather open to discussing this kind of stuff but I quickly realised that most people have nothing to say on the topic (like mostly my guy friends) or perhaps it’s too sensitive for them to say much (at first I was confused why my female friends had nothing to say because I’m certain many women are plagued by fucked up body image/diet culture...I think I saw a statistic about 80% of women deal with disordered eating to some degree, but someone pointed out that it‘s probably just a highly personal thing for someone to easily talk about).",False,True

To try and make sure they aren’t giving it to someone who abuses anything.  I did an short Disordered Eating workbook for about a month or two with a psychologist about 6 months after starting Vyvanse, when things were ‘Visibly Bad’.  I honestly have no long term plan, because I somewhat recently changed psychiatrists. I’m just seeing where things take me for now.  I began taking it in December 2017, I took it everyday until these past two weeks. Though when I get my new script, I plan on taking it strictly on uni days. ☺️",False,False

Is it a drug test for all ‘illegal’ drugs to see if you’re ‘some sort of drug addict’, or just say, other stimulants like meth or cocaine?  I am also curious how long you had done counselling (if ever?) before you started taking medications for ED specifically, and if there is a long-term plan for when you are meant to stop using Vyvanse?  How long have you been taking it? Do you prefer being on it or off, given some of the pros and cons you mentioned above?",False,True

She overprescribed in general.  Yes for me it was a big issue, my brain kept going and going. Didn’t feel tired despite needing the rest.  I need the drug test because my new psychiatrist needs permission to prescribe vyvanse, as it’s a highly regulated substance (in my country at least).  No problem!

I've mostly found I'm a bit more tired and a little bit weaker, but it's not insurmountable by any means. Since I used it to form better food habits, I also largely don't have a difference in appetite or eating behaviors",False,False

Was the logic of the psychiatrist that you’d lose weight and be less self-conscious? That would be surprising to me from a ‘recovery’ perspective, but I suppose it wouldn’t be so crazy from a psychiatrist who is not trying to treat eating disorders, per se.   As for the sleep - does it become a problem when you *are* taking Vyvanse? (Personally I can have really bad insomnia from time to time).  And lastly - why do you need a drug test to get a new one? I have not heard of that before.  Thanks again!",False,True

I have been procrastinating this, so I’m currently not taking it. Coming off it, due to the above circumstances, hasn’t been as bad as I expected. Appetite has been roughly the same, and I sleep a lot easier. Less anxiety as well.  My psychiatrist put me on it because I was self conscious of my weight/body.",False,False

I've mostly gone off of it whenever I lost medical coverage or got too depressed to keep up my prescription, and gotten back on it when I was about to fail my schoolwork/performing terribly at work. No difficulties getting off of it and I've never found it to be habit forming, but everyone is completely different when it comes to psychiatric drugs.
