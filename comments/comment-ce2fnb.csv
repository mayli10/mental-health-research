I thought this summer would be great but it’s been the second worst, only after when I was an actual depressed/suicidal wreck.

Like just making my space cleaner puts me in a better place mentally. I guess I feel that when I have a clean room to go to, I feel like I'm in control of my life. I just blast music and go to town with the scrubbing. I also typically end up dancing to some songs, and I would never dance in public or even in front of anyone, ever. Idk, makes me feel free and in control at the same time.",False,False
