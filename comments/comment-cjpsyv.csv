Doing out the numbers and reminding myself it's just water helps me personally to stay on track, because then I don't get stuck in the mindset that ""I've already ruined the weekend, might as well throw the whole life away"" you know? But for that I have to see the *proof* in the numbers, I can't just say to myself that the scale is lying. Otherwise yeah, I let everything go too, and then have to dig deeper into the dark to get back down faster.",False,False

HOWEVER i think this is because i got too lenient with eating. The times i went back to my diet after a binge, its gone back down in a day or two. But that mindset for more than a week fucked my whole plan up.",False,False

That's 18.5 tablespoons of olive oil every day, or 6.5 Big Macs.   Currently in the same boat, but 10 pounds up in a weekend. I promise you it's just water.",False,False
