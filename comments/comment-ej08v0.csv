He invented it, and then the guy who started Kodak liked it so much, he used it as the calendar everyone who worked for him had to stick to, and that's the calendar Kodak ran on for like 60 years, until the late 80s.",False,False

Like, I too find it very easy to get sucked into thinking things like, ""I screwed up the first day of the year/month/week/day, so that rest of the year/month/week/day is a total writeoff and I should just binge/beat myself up/not do anything constructive"". But something that really helps me (... ehh, depending on my mindset at the time) is to switch it to future-focused instead. Like, ""If I start now, then by this time next year/month/week/day, it will be a clean 365/31/7 days/24 hours, regardless of what the date/time was before."" I keep reminding myself, ""this time will pass either way,"" and it makes me recognise that there are things I can still do even if I feel something is ""ruined"". And that stopping destructive behaviour early is still better than continuing it - sure, it may have been better if I hadn't binged at all, but stopping a binge at 2000 calories is much much more manageable for me in the longterm than a 5000+ calorie binge, even though my brain conflated everything as equally bad.  I really appreciate this post and your sentiment. Thank you for sharing it and good luck with the beginning of your Fixed Year!",False,False

If I wasn‚Äôt able to refocus my reset mentality on today I would have been in a breakdown about yesterday laying such a terrible foundation for the year that it would have been a self-fulfilling self-sabotage prophecy.   I definitely do think more ‚Äúnormies‚Äù would benefit from the mentality you advise though. There‚Äôs no reason for non-pathological people to focus so detrimentally on symbolism.
