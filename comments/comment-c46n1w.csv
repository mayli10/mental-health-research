I‚Äôm near-fanatical when it comes to preparation and ingredients.. and my vegetable garden is to fucking die for! I love food, but not in the binge-on-Oreos way. I love **good** food. I love spending all day making an amazing meal. I love feeding my family and friends. I love the connection to the Earth I have from growing and sourcing my ingredients. I love puttering around the kitchen. I love teaching my daughter about really *really* good food. I feel great. Once in a while, my daughter and I will put on a movie and eat a bag of pizza rolls. But it feels like a special occasion and it‚Äôs something we do together, maybe once every couple of months. Even our snack food is amazing, like homemade hummus with basil from my garden and warm roti fresh off the griddle! (Thanks Costco, lol.) I eat one meal a day, of whatever and however much I want. Usually it‚Äôs a meal I lovingly and painstakingly puttered over for hours. Fuck I love food so much. I do not crave junk; it‚Äôs fucking gross to me now. If I want mac n cheese, I will plan my whole day around it and make it myself with a sharp white cheddar and Gouda beschamel and smoked paprika sprinkled over a toasted panko top crust... Mmmm!!! Maybe about twice a year, lol. Anyway, the moral of the story is that I replaced one type of food obsession with another, and it‚Äôs really working for me.",False,False

I'm a pretty inconsolable person Nothing really makes me happy when I'm feeling down.

I remember hearing someone describe comfort food as a ""warm hug from inside"" once and it really is for me. It's almost like I have to be obsessive about food in a different way to avoid binging on that edible love.",False,False
