Even though you got it back you are probably at increased risk of osteoporosis (weak bones). If you feel safe doing so you may want to ask your doctor about having a bone scan done because there are medications that (when combined with eating more) can help repair your bones.,False,False

I dont know what your age is, but if you lost your period while you were under 18 then this could v negatively impact your chances of getting pregnant/ if getting pregnant at all. So its a good thing u got it back, not being able to get pregnant can ruin a longterm love relationship",False,False
