Idk what you would call those kinds of shoes. They definitely looked big though because they were thick. I finally got new boots though because they made my feet way too warm, didn't stop my feet from getting wet, and they got super gross from the fuzzy inner lining. (Which wasn't even removable so it was hard to wash.) I got a pair of faux leather Steve Madden boots and they have been perfect for me so far. They're not advertised as winter boots, but they keep my feet at a normal temperature even in cold weather, they are water resistant so walking through snow or slush doesn't make my feet wet, and they're easy to clean because of the materials they're made of. They also don't look so fat as winter boots.",False,False
