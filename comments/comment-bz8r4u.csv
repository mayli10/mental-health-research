Yeah I saw you deleted your reply to my post before I got the chance to reply. There isn't a reason to delete what you say. I can totally relate to you. I'm disappointed in myself, but this appears to be a safe community where we can share and let our thoughts out so they don't get all bottled up inside. I usually write in a journal because I like the act of actually writing vs. typing, but it was nice to also feel like I'm getting something off my chest by sharing to people instead of a notebook no one will ever see. I'm not a professional, but you can PM me to vent. I know stress is what brought my ED back too",False,False

I don't think you're asking for tips on how to restrict, just asking for a definition, right?  Unfortunately this is one of those ""flammable/inflammable"" things where the meaning can be the opposite or the same depending on who's using it.  The gist is that for one, you are eating at a deficit but only a slight one, e.g. your maintenance is 1500 so you're eating at 1200. For the other, you are restricting your calorie intake by a lot, e.g. only eating 300-500 calories. But it's confusing terminology.  One problem is people's distinctions of what is a ""high"" or a ""low"" restriction rely completely on their own context, e.g. one person might consider 800 calories to be a lot, while another would consider it very little. The other problem is that people can't agree on which one is ""high restriction"" and which one is ""low restriction"".  Some people say, ""Well, I'm only restricting a little bit under my maintenance, so it's a low restriction,"" while others say ""I'm restricting to a very small number of calories, so it's a low restriction."" Others say ""I am highly restricting my calories right now, so it's a high restriction,"" while others say ""I'm restricting but my calorie count is still pretty high, so it's a high restriction."" (Some say ""My deficit - the difference between my maintenance calories and my consumed calories - is high/low, so it's a high/low restriction"" but in the end it means the same thing.)  You can see the confusion!  It relies a lot on context to understand what an individual is talking about. For what it's worth, I believe the ""If the consumed calorie count is high, it's a high restriction, if the consumed calorie count is low, it's a low restriction"" definition is slightly more common, but it's honestly about a 50/50 split.  TL;DR: either way during a restriction you are still eating under your maintenance calories, ""high/low"" restriction just refers to how far under your maintenance you are. Which is subjective anyway.",False,False

Since Saturday I‚Äôve been in the worst mood because of the pettiest goddamn thing - my boyfriend posted a few photos of him and his friends, including a cute picture of himself with this girl he had a thing with last year, where she kissed him (she said she wasn‚Äôt ready for a relationship afterwards, which doesn‚Äôt feel that conclusive). It‚Äôs a small thing! But over the past 2 weeks I had been increasingly thrown off by everything to do with her because I didn‚Äôt realize they were still friends - good enough friends to message regularly and post the goddamn picture (someone commented ‚Äúthis is the CUTEST‚Äù; like no one comments that on my ugly fat photos). I met his friends (from out of town) on Memorial Day weekend and she was honestly pretty rude to me and the rest of his friends pretty much ignored me when I stopped by the apartment to pick up my stuff, which was upsetting because we have really great friends in our own city and we get along so well with each others‚Äô friends. I was so uncomfortable, feeling as if I was the outsider and the second priority. Then photo and being blindsided by their friendship.

I never want to be the controlling type, but sure, it will just continue to feel great that he‚Äôs friends with this girl who he liked and who‚Äôs only had brief rude/ignoring interactions with me.
