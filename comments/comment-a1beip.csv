My suggestion would be to call up a pharmacy in the state your moving to and ask them if they sell it over the counter or if it’s prescription only. If you tell them you’re moving from a state where it’s over the counter they’ll probably just assume you don’t have a prescription because you’ve never needed one.",False,True

I also just straight up don’t trust online retailers to sell a legitimate pharmaceutical product. I’m  actually posting this from the parking lot of the first pharmacy across the state-line, with my legitimately purchased bronkaid in the seat next to me. This was a bit of an ‘emergency’ trip (I only had 3 pills left), but thankfully my work requires me to visit this state once a month, and even reimburses my mileage! I’ll just have to plan ahead and pick some up whenever I come here.",False,True

That could be a felony in your state.  There are other appetite suppressants you can get legally.  They may not be as effective as Bronkaid, but if you use a few in combination, you will make it through. ",False,False
