Even skinny friends who were my role-model before a drastical weight loss then suddenly became someone who could lose a bit of weight, I felt like I was losing my mind all the time, and sometimes I still do this. Or when someone says ""oh I only have 15 min to eat my lunch"" like... I don't get it, it's a perfect opportunity to NOT EAT LUNCH like wtf",False,False

It kind of fuels me when other people eat high cal though so sometimes I’ll encourage it?   I’m not sure if it’s to make me feel like I accomplished more by not eating or to make sure they aren’t starving themselves like me.   I am *sick* :(,False,False

I have gotten to the point where I walk past someone and then LOOK BACK at them, like oh very subtle of me, to try to better see how skinny they are. If they are skinnier than me I go two ways: either it works as a massive trigger, or I'm depressed the rest of the day.   So yeah, I don't know what to say other than I feel you on this one",False,False
