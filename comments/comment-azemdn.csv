But one day I told myself ""I don't have the Calories to eat 3 meals a day anymore. It's either no dinner or exercise + dinner"", and I forced myself to do it, but it's getting easier/better almost every time now.  And yeah, I feel you &gt;.&lt; my boyfriend is 6'0 and 200+ lbs, and I literally am so envious of those 1000+ Calorie meals he has. I feel kind of bad, because every time we go out to eat, he'll get a full meal + drinks, and I just order water and sip and stare at him/go on my phone. Rip",False,False

I can’t get out of bed most days even when not low restriction, I just don‘t really move at all lol :D But I started a new job in retail and am running around on my feet and lifting stuff 3x/week for 4 hours, which is (for someone as sedentary as a corpse) a lot more than usual! Maybe I will build up some stamina to do fun exercise this summer too :) I‘m also 5‘2 so I know how frustrating it feels when other people have TDEE‘s in the 2400s and you just sit there and watch them eat 1000 calories for one meal lol!

My sedentary TDEE isn't anywhere close to 1800! If I followed advice on r/1200isplenty, the scale would take months to move. I've incorporated a full hour of vigorous exercise a day, and it's honestly been helping me so much. If I didn't exercise, I'd only eat 700. But supplementing with exercise (without exercise purging) has been helping me so much with my health in general, and yes, also losing weight. It's magnificent.",False,False

Higher restriction is the smartest thing to do (although 1000 is not even high, non-ed people eat so much more to lose weight if you think about it!) ",False,True

That's why my intake is at 1000 Cals/day with an 1800 TDEE. Though I suspect my deficit is closer to 1000 right now because of accidental undereating and a higher TDEE.  I can't keep up &lt;500 Cals/day for that long though..primarily because I get to the point where I'm so weak that I can't move.
