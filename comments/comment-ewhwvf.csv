It has NOTHING to do with you, and everything to do with him. I know it hurts, it’s going to hurt. Just take it day by day and remember you were okay before him and you will be okay after him. You deserve so much better.   Don’t compare yourself to her either. Block and move on, don’t look at social media stuff, don’t intentionally hurt yourself over this. The best form of revenge is happiness.   Seriously, fuck that dude. I’m so sorry. Please reach out if you need to talk, unfortunately, I’ve been there.",False,False

I know it's really painful and hard to not take personally, but it sounds like he just wanted to hurt someone and you were someone he knew he could inflict a lot of pain upon. It's not because she's better or because you're inferior. It takes a lot of strength to leave people like that and I'm proud of you.",False,False

None of us can see ourselves the way others do. It's super hard to ever internalise, I sure as heck know I haven't, but I promise you you're not too big.",False,False
