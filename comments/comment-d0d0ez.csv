Oil (and oil-based products like salad dressing, pesto, etc), liquid calories other than unsweetened almond/flax milk and smoothies I‚Äôve made myself, and super processed and/or sugary things (somehow I‚Äôm okay with stuff made from scratch or organic stuff even if it‚Äôs not necessarily any healthier than the regular versions ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) all make me cringe and I generally avoid those things, but I *think* that‚Äôs a just a me thing rather than a purely ED thing. Or maybe I‚Äôm just kidding myself idk.  During my first bout of anorexia though pretty much everything was a fear food. Towards the end I think pretty much the only things I‚Äôd eat were veg, egg whites, fat free dairy, and brown rice with soy sauce. Most other things were off limits, especially anything that contained more than a gram or two of fat.",False,False

Sometimes I can't even do the 5-10 calories Crystal light packets. On labor day I decided to drink cause my dad told me he got light alcoholic beverages, but when I checked the box they were the regular kind. That has really triggered me this week...  French fries are another one. Mostly cause I can't control myself from bingeing on them so I just avoid them.  I've gotten over a few fear foods by only buying the amount that's reasonable to eat and not like, a whole box of pasta",False,False
