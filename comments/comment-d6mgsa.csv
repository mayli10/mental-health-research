She would get me shirts that ""fit tightly"" and I hated it. I thought I looked fatter, but she kept telling me it was fine.  I have a Significant Other who also says things like I look fine or whatever.. both of those people were/are biased, I believe.   And right now i'm definitely the fat shit that I see in the mirror, if I can even look at myself.",False,False

I have struggled with it for years and my primary symptom is just literally not being able to tell what I look like. My body looks like sheer fat incoherence in the mirror. I have wasted so many hours taking selfies in the vain hope of seeing myself.   I‚Äôm sorry you experience this too. It‚Äôs really awful.,False,False

I'm always trying to find people who I think look like me (same measurements or weight or height) but I literally cannot tell. I have like 7000 pictures taken on a timer but they all look different so that's no use. And then I take classes at the gym and am always 100% the fattest in the room/weirdly proportioned compared to everyone else so I can't tell there either. Is that BDD?   I tried to tell my mom once and she said ""no you can't have that, that's only for really buff/fit people"" ... Thanks Mom, I'm too fat to not know what I look like.",False,False
