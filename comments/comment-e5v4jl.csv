I realize that my brain can give me really enjoyable moments and really bad ones even thought both ultimately don't matter. But you know when your brain makes you feel happy you like it. And your really can't feel joy without experiencing sadness so I try to feel good when ever I can because if I'm going to be alive that's what I want to do with the majority of my time. But also I love to hate on things it can be enjoyable too.,False,False

It sounds like everyone did their jobs right and while it feels like an invasion of privacy itâ€™s really the school trying to protect OP. Because OP deserves to get better and be helped, as does everyone hereðŸ˜Š",False,False

I think itâ€™s a pretty dang brave question to ask honestly.   I lived a huge chunk of my life fueled by self-loathing and motivated by fear. Now, I fully believe all my â€˜maladaptiveâ€™ stuff started because it worked - it might be unhealthy but it got me through the day. The catch is that eventually it stopped working so well, and the consequences started mounting so high that the former net benefit was eliminated. It was only at the point when my life was mostly destroyed that I was willing to see if it might be possible to live differently. To live in something other than constant agony.   For me itâ€™s taking help from therapy (DBT) and a lot of practice and a lot of time. Itâ€™s the slow process of starting to catch the thousand times a day that I view things in harsh ways or talk to myself cruelly. Itâ€™s turning my mind away from rumination. Itâ€™s talking to myself differently. Itâ€™s taking different actions. Itâ€™s starting to understand that I have some really flawed core beliefs about myself. Itâ€™s accepting that challenging those is going to cause immense upheaval.    Letting go of hating myself is my hardest undertaking ever, but itâ€™s also the only thing Iâ€™ve found that has a good shot at giving me a contented useful life.",False,False

You find something else to hate, if I were in your situation I DEFINITELY would have tried to fight back, verbally, physically etc. I would have done anything angry/violent like just so the convo wouldnâ€™t happen at all. You seem more submissive to these scenarios though, and I honestly canâ€™t say the latter is any better.   Maybe think of it as a sign to get help? Or at the very least recognize that some people are worried for you, and thatâ€™s okay. you shouldnâ€™t have to NOT eat around them, Iâ€™m sure they would love to see you eating, they want to see you healthy.",False,False
