My mind is fucked up. I am consumed by this illness. Day and night all I think about is how to keep losing and how much I hate myself but Iâ€™m still not ill enough???  They should know how some eds can be competitive in nature as well. Oh so Iâ€™m not skinny enough right now? Okay Iâ€™m gonna lose another 20lbs and see what happens then? Will I be skinny enough then? As specialists, they should know all this. I shouldnâ€™t have to beg to get help to live a normal life.  I am SO done. Thereâ€™s no way I can help myself. They can fuck off with their â€˜readingâ€™ suggestions. A book wonâ€™t cure me. I need professional help and I need it ASAP. Iâ€™m tired of this bullcrap disease. ",False,True

I had the same news today - I have at least a 6 month wait. If I continue restricting/losing at the same rate for 6 more months my BMI will be around 11. They actually worked this out on the phone with me whilst telling me they couldnâ€™t do anything else.   Obviously now Iâ€™m determined that Iâ€™ll lose as much as possible before I get to see someone. This sucks. ,False,False
