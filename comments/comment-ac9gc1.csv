I know that a mother wants to help, but if she is not trusting you, even if you are underage, its not worth talking with her. I am 30 btw. Your mother should help you with your pace. she should have gotten help or get help if youre really at the edge of your ED, dying, purging whatever, but not like this.   i hope you get the help you need. Stay safe and good luck.",False,False
