The bingeing is caused by the restriction - yr body is just doing what it needs to do to survive. You're probably familiar with the Minnesota Starvation Experiment. Go read up on it again, because you're not disgusting or fake or fat for this. You're not.  Try not to weigh yourself for a few days. The weight will be way off because of water weight, especially if the binge contained a significant amount of carbs. 1 gram of carbs = 2-3 grams of water weight. If half of the 8000 calories came from carbs, that's 1000 grams of carbs and 2000-3000 grams of water stored. That's 2 to 3 kg or approximately 4 to 7 lbs alone. Just from water, not actual weight gained.   Drink lots of water, try to take care of yourself. &lt;3 I hope you feel better soon.",False,False

Around Christmas time she got pneumonia which developed into a lung infection, so got put into a coma to help her. Then on New Year's Eve she got so so much worse and went into cardiac arrest. She wasn't breathing for a bit but we didn't know if it was long enough to do any damage to her brain, took them weeks to do a scan and she's now in a vegetative state, unable to move or speak and we don't know if she can understand us or not.   Since then I don't know how to feel because she's not dead but she's not alive? I haven't cried a lot, only a couple of times including today, but I'm pretty sure that's at least part of the reason for my relapse. I'm not sure if I should wish her a happy birthday on Facebook or not because she won't see it but you know. She lives a while away so I cant go and see her but I'm not sure I could handle it again anyway. I feel selfish for thinking that.   I hadn't seen her for 3 years before she got ill even though she kept messaging me saying that she missed me. She never met my partner, who I've been with for 3 and a half years now. I have so much guilt and I never got to tell her anything, in the hospital I tried but all I could manage was whispering ""sorry"" and then crying. I don't even know if she heard.",False,False
