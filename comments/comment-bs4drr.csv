Everyday is a new day, from tomorrow try to drink more water, buy yourself a cute bottle and get chugging, what this will do is help get rid of any water retention you might have, helping you be less bloated. Plus fills your tummy so you will feel less of an urge to eat. Its totally socially acceptable so no one will see it as strange.   Eat with your parents but remember you don’t need to finish the whole plate, eSpiCally if you know in your heart its going to trigger a purge, its way better to risk seeming rude by saying “I’ve had enough to eat now” or “ just give me half an omlette” or “i want porridge and fruit instead of bacon and eggs” than it is to risk damaging your body by being polite and eating whatever.   Food is amazing, its just freaking beautiful and it can be hard to say no, i get it, you are going to have to start being more disciplined with the amount and type of food you put in yourself so that you don’t get all the negative thoughts and purging stuff happening hun.   Everytime you do it ot will get easyer. You are very strong, who else but a very strong person would have the balls to have an ed? It takes an iron will babe! Purging is not natural! So take that same energy and use it before the fact, if your desperate enough to make yourself ill, be desperate enough to say “I’ve had enough” or “no i don’t want secconds”   a lot of the extra weight you feel like you are carrying is poop and water i can almost guarantee it  Drink more water, go for a little walk if you can  Take a deep breath, the good thing about knowing you are feeling out of control is that you yourself can turn it arround!   All the best to you",False,False
