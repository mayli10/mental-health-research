I'm actually losing weight by eating 1000 cal under my TDEE regularly which is like, normal, but I'm so obsessive about it and I eat n' yeet whenever I feel bad about myself. My binges are only about 1000 cal compared to whatever the DSM says, like 2000+ at once, so by brain thinks I'm not doing ""enough"" in either direction. I feel like the only aspect of an eating disorder I have is the fact that I just hate food and I hate my body, and there's not enough ""physical"" manifestations. It's like I don't belong here, like it's unfair or something.",False,False
