It annoys me that they ignore things like BED and bulimia and such, too, which involve eating and purging. But nope, unless you're a skeleton, you must be fine. It's not like those sickly girls you see were just fine and then boom, horribly thin. Other than basic ignorance, I think my mom would just like to see me get down to that very skinny point, so she felt the need to lash out at me for unintentionally making her examine the part of her that was thrilled by my weight loss, regardless of how I went about it.",False,False

I stopped telling most of my supposed ‚Äúclose‚Äù friends anything in regards to my life that could be perceived as negative (and therefore interesting). They only wanted information so that they could then discuss and spread it to everyone even peripherally in the friend group. Fuck that. I realized it‚Äôs cause their lives are so mind numbingly predictable, boring and safe, that anything and everything is fodder for gossip. My awful shitshow of a life is REAL for me, and not for anyone‚Äôs entertainment. It‚Äôs super frustrating especially cause I‚Äôm pretty jealous of their normal, humdrum lives.  Ugh. I hate people.",False,False

Who knows? You might have just started an insight in her that leads her to understand the issue?  I remember being really ignorant as a teenager to almost EVERYTHING and I surely said something stupid the first time I heard about anything outside of my own experience.  When things were explained to me I understood and cared pretty quickly.  Now that I developed an ED (BED), I can't believe still how powerful the urges are... it's crazytown.  It has helped me understand a lot of people who are their fighting demons that are destructive.  I am SO sorry you didn't get any emotional support from her.  I wish I had some GREAT support to give you now.  I'll tell you this, I really understand!  I bet we all do!  Good luck to you.  I had candy for breakfast :)",False,False

I'm sorry OP. She clearly knows well enough that ""being skinny"" isn't all an eating disorder is about if she asked about your meal and the puking. What a fuckwit.   I'm so tempted to carry around a brochure that explains how many eating disorders exist, how they can each affect the person with them, and proper etiquette for encountering a person with an ED because of people like this. But in general WHY MUST PEOPLE COMMENT ON ANOTHER PERSONS FOOD and WEIGHT?? Like, ever? It's so rude and weird to me that anyone would, without being asked, comment on someone else's meal.

I remember years ago when I had rapidly lost about 60 pounds, and it went from healthy to extreme, where I'd exercise at least 8 hours straight each day and eat less than 500 calories. My mom has always been very, very concerned with everyone's weight. She's never been overtly cruel, but I was chubby in high school, and she often made little comments that she believed weren't hurtful. I was afraid to tell her what was going on with me.  &amp;#x200B;  Eventually I collapsed after a work out, and I decided to tell my mom that I was worried I'd developed an eating disorder after two months of this behavior getting worse and worse. Her response? ""But I see you eat all the time."" Said very snidely and defensively.   &amp;#x200B;  Also, even though in this case I was referring to anorexia and a form of bulimia, are people really that ignorant about eating disorders? They think only anorexia exists? It's so simplistic and obtuse. I wish I'd never told her.",False,False
