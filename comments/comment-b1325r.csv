Like afaik bread doesn't have added sugar there, etc.",False,False

There are a lot of bigger people here too. Generally the clothing sizes aren't too different from the us either, you'll probably only have to buy 1 size bigger. Like if you wear an S, in europe that would be an M. Or for vanity sizing, a US size S would be L in europe. Congratulations on your master's programm btw :)",False,False

Every time I travel to Europe (or to a very walkable city like NYC) I eat without restriction and don't gain. You'll probably be the same unless you're binging every single day!,False,False

I don't know where in the states you're from but for me moving here wasn't as scary as I thought. Yes people are on average smaller but they aren't all models! And I think people judge less here (at least they seem to mind their own buisness). And most places people walk a lot, AND lots of fun healthy food! So it's easy to maintain (or lose). ",False,False

I hope that eases your mind a bit ðŸ’•   as for fearing you will gain weight, it is possible ofcourse, but I think youll note portion sizes here are a LOT smaller, unhealthy food isnt pushed as much as it is in the states, plus like you said, cycling is our main form of transport thus youll be working out a bit every day.   if you ever want to chat, feel free to message me. I hope youll have a blast studying here, its a wonderful country if you can look past the rain lol. ",False,False
