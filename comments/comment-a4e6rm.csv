I’m still eating normally. I’ve put on a fair amount of weight but ya know what it’s actually sitting p well with me. I kept telling myself I’d go back to restricting after finals finished but it’s still going okay. Well idk the point of this but. Good luck for your finals and I hope this all goes well even after they’re finished :) ",False,False

I think it's wonderful that you can do this for yourself. Your brain will be working a lot better with fuel! As for the feelings of being invalid, you're definitely not alone in that.   Good luck on your finals! ",False,False
