I used to be one. Saw all the tricks too. Trust no food industry. I haven't been to a restaurant or coffee place since my disorder started. I've worked in the food and beverage industry.

I won't say it happens ""regularly"", but the sugar-free syrups are placed among the regular ones, and the only difference is the pump part is black on the sugar-free. If it's busy, and the bar people are up to their eyeballs in drink orders, it's very easy to either not notice ""skinny"" or ""SF syrup"" on the drink sticker, or accidentally pump the regular stuff. This is why I stopped with the syrup drinks all together... :\\ sorry.",False,False
