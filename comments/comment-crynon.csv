I worked at McDonaldâ€™s for 8 years and itâ€™s a very active job if youâ€™re willing to work hard- look forward to rocking an excellent daily step count while you earn!   All the nutritional information for the food is readily available so itâ€™s easy to pick low-calorie options for your break too. I ate 3 chicken selects (360 calories) every day for the entire 8 years and when I finally left my staff thought I would probably just have to quit eating too, since none of them had ever seen me eat anything else ðŸ˜‚  (Cons: the uniform sizes always used to come up quite small, and you *will* go home smelling of cooking oil every day lol)",False,False
