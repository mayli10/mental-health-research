The body is made of mostly water!!! The digestive system just expels the “waste water”  Well anyways, I hope you feel better about yourself, it pains me to hear people suffer from this sort of confusion, I’ve been there. ✌️",False,False

PERIOD ⚫️ Don’t let it get you down, the body retains water regardless of what you drink or pass.  It’s caused by Fasting. (Literally) The body retains water in more ways, it retains water in your organs not just your digestive system.   Don’t worry about it, you’ll be fine it would take days to actually “Gain fat”. Just imagine how weird (Absurd asf) it would be if a baby could double in size in ONE week. NOTHING GROWS THAT FAST!!!  Seriously, you’re alright 😅 so ease up on yourself!! xx 😉",False,False
