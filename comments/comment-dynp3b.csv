I used to work for a pet store while working two other jobs and also going to college. I over did it on caffeine and my manager found me at 8am, shaking and jittering, sat on the floor, squeeze cuddling the biggest bunny in the store for comfort.   Water. Drink the water.  I actually ended up swinging by the doctor on the way home (after my boss told me to take the day off - the amazing guy even called college for me). Docs check up went ok but I have epilepsy so it was sort of important.   But take care. Caffeine can fuck you up. Water that shit down, if you can then carbs help (even vegetable based ones) and try to lay down and rest that heart with controlled breathing",False,False

Maybe some mixed nuts or beans, something with protein. The bread will soak up the acid (from the coffee and energy drink), the water will rehydrate you from the sugar and caffeine, and the protein will help you function better. Milk will also help your stomach.",False,False
