I stock up on a case at Vitamin Shoppe every week, lol. Favorites: the new Frose Rose flavor (itâ€™s seriously amazing), Cotton Candy, Cherry Blade Lemonade, and Champagne. Rainbow Unicorn is also very good but Iâ€™ve gotten it so often that Iâ€™m a bit sick of it now.",False,False

The lemon drop is great if you like lemonade because it just tastes like that to me. And the unicorn is hard to describe for me but both lack the carbonated water fizz that comes with most energy drinks.  The cheapest place Iâ€™ve found them in store has been Winco if that helps ðŸ¤—,False,False

I donâ€™t like the flavor as much as white Monster but the energy boost is no joke - *one* can got me through 10 hours of cramming before an exam last week.

I might just be sensitive to caffeine tho.)  also, hope u feel better ðŸ’•",False,False
