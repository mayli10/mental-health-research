Sadly society treats poorly overweight people, and is quite possible sometimes she feels down, and you just wished on her love and happiness and that is adorable.    I feel somehow the same when I see other people with self harm wounds and scars. I just want to hug them and tell them that they are amazing and worthy of love and happiness.    It is kind to wish others the love and compassion that we crave or wish for ourselves, to not feel the pain that we have felt.",False,False
