If you can, try to get protein in, at least 60g a day if you can. That’s gonna be important for your overall health.",False,False

A sudden 3 lb drop could be from water or glycogen if you didn't have carbs, or going to the bathroom if your colon isn't regular. If you're worried, I honestly think it's ok to just calculate your TDEE, and just meet it every day for a few days. That way if you gain or don't gain \*weight\*, you'll get a sense of your body's weight fluctuation patterns but you know you're not losing vital fat and muscle at that point and that you're also not suddenly blowing up. And then you can increase your calories as much as you're comfortable with. But that minimum base is key.  Enjoy that milkshake :).  &amp;#x200B;  And I'm just curious, how tall are you?",False,False

Changing habits or plans can be scary and since it’s obvious you’re not interested in gaining a ton of weight at once, taking it slow and making peace with being being healthier is more sustainable than taking a big step, getting scared, and taking a step backwards to try to fix it.   Good luck &lt;3",False,False

So that’s all I meant by it. It would surprise you many people don’t realize that (like think about how many people say they lost 10lb in the first week of their diet or gained 10 lb in a couple days...it’s impossible for almost anyone to lose that much fat in that short of a time but a lot of people really don’t seem to get that?)",False,False

Gaining weight is not the same as gaining fat, just keep that in mind—if you drink a glass of water, you’ll “gain” a lb. Like let’s say stomach is used to being empty and you eat like 5 lb of tomatoes in a day. You’ll “gain” a few lb temporarily, but that’s only 400 calories so you would actually be losing more vital fat and muscle and organs and stuff. I know it’s hard and scary, but if you want to gain weight or just not keep losing you’re gonna have to calculate your TDEE and stay above it and just trust it. We’re all rooting for you though, hope you can take care of yourself ❤️",False,False
