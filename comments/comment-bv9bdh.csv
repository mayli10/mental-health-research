I was afraid of inpatient too and one of the reasons I was willing to do it at all was the fear of forced inpatient. In retrospect, I’m not sure how much of that fear was a real possibility and how much was a reflection of my ED fear of not being in control. When I sought help for subsequent relapses I found the health services to be compassionate and there to help, they weren’t “out to get me” like I’d been so sure of the first time.  It’s brave of you to seek help! I hope it works out for you, good luck 🙏🏽",False,False
