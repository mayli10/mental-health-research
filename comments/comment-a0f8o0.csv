I always do bare minimum 1000 when in a difficult period of my semester, and pre track my food to make sure that I don‚Äôt get binge-y (which I sometimes do when I‚Äôm stressed tf out). It‚Äôs not worth it for me, personally, to fuck up my semester and potentially my GPA for the sake of a few hundred calories a day.",False,False

In general, during the periods where I've been eating more, I notice my brain ~actually fuckin works~ so I really hope you can up your cals like you want, even if it's just to 1000. Baby steps. And it cuts down a lot on the misery when you can function. ",False,False

I didn‚Äôt start low restricting until this semester - probably not coincidentally, since this is by far my lowest commitment semester yet (I‚Äôm in my final year, so I am taking fewer classes than previous years and also winding down my extracurricular commitments). I‚Äôm also cooking for myself for the first time since college started so I have more control over my intake.  Admittedly, my workload has been increasing lately because of applying to jobs and just end-of-semester essays in general. The excessive amounts of caffeine that I consume to deal with it has suppressed my appetite and I just have less time to eat/cook in general so tbh I think being busier makes me restrict lower, which isn‚Äôt great :/  I‚Äôd like to be kinder to myself too.

I ALWAYS upped my intake to 1200-maintenance during finals, every semester. If you aren‚Äôt going to a competitive grad school, the difference between an A and a C is negligible in your future usually. However failing even one class means losing thousands of dollars, extra stress later on, and potentially delaying graduation, which is lost income later. I dunno about you, but to me it was never worth the risk.   Besides, with all the stress, restricting hard would have only made me binge later haha.",False,False
