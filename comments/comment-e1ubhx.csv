Only carrots and mandarin oranges, lol. wtf. Went grocery shopping and bought myself some new slippers and a face mask for thanksgiving. Then I bought 3 different nut milks, a coconut yogurt, more freakin oranges, vegan gf brownie bites and protein bars, pickles and I found an interesting ""soda"" that has 5 different flavors and is zero calorie but also has probiotics...I got the ginger kind. Kinda excited to see what it's like. Oh, and 1 frozen meal that is rice noodles and veggies with tempeh. And I also bought 2 heads of broccoli. lol. The end. Took a couple sleeping pills and I'm done for the day. Cried a lot but at least I'm down from this morning so I have that. Kinda want to throw the brownie bites and protein bars away.

I have never posted in this subreddit but I am kind of at a breaking point. I recently had a baby and had been doing pretty well for a long time. I weighed a little more than I preferred when I got pregnant but I was feeling okay about it. Gained exactly the recommended 25 lbs during pregnancy. After the baby was born I easily returned to my pre-pregnant weight and lost a couple extra pounds from breastfeeding. All in all I should be feeling GREAT.   But I live with my husband’s parents right now and the way they eat is triggering me like I never would have imagined. They eat sooo much. I’m talking 4 large meals a day plus constant snacking. His mother gets up several times a night to eat, which is something I have always done (except I would not actually eat, just stand in the kitchen.) I don’t know, I have never really been one to care about anyone’s eating habits but my own. But whenever I think about them eating I feel physically sick and want to never eat again. I’m still breastfeeding so I can’t restrict. Probably a good thing. Ugh, I have not told anyone this and I feel like the shittiest person alive. The end.",False,False
