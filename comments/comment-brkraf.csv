There are so many problems with it I cant even recall them all. Ignore the hell out it! anytime you see someone talking BMI think big red warning sign!     The main thing I remember about BMI is that it does not take into account bone density which can have something like a 30% variance in people. ""Big boned"" isnt a real thing what they actually mean is dense bones, ever meet someone who has a broken bone every other month, they do not have dense bones.      There is a way to find bone density and figure it into your health but, the health industry is very slowly coming around to this now because you have to use a special float tank and do a lot of other math.     One of the biggest things they are finding out about weight and health is that it all comes down to your gut bacteria, maybe start there with some research and see if you cant find food you can binge on like fruits, vegetables, and and other home made items.      Im not sure what country you're in but, if its the USA I firmly believe our food is wrecking our gut bacteria. Pasta ingredients should be water, flour, olive oil or egg, flour, olive oil and not a list of like this: (taken from kroger item info): Semolina (Wheat), Durum Wheat Flour, Vitamins/Minerals: Vitamin B3  (Niacin), Iron (Ferrous Sulfate), Vitamin B1 (Thiamine Mononitrate),  Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin), Folic Acid.",False,False

My daily struggle is... *night before* ""okay I'll fast til lunch time, no breakfast, and I'll restrict to 1200"" *wake up at 7am starving* I'll eat one piece of toast so i don't binge on snacks on work.  *goes to work and there's a meeting and the supplier buys everyone Costa* ""fuck""  *eats planned lunch* yay get back on track   *someone brings in cake and I eat it* ""fuck, why I can't I say no to people?   *gets home* my mum: oh I cooked pancakes and saved some for you."" well fuck, can't say no again""  Then I eat dinner. Then fucking binge on leftover easter chocolate.  I literally have no self control and I can't say no to people, so I don't even successfully restrict so do i even have an ED? I feel shit all the time, especially cos I'm going to the gym/doing sport like 4-5 times a week and I'm not seeing any results at all.",False,False
