It is a bulk fiber, so it also draws water toward the stool in order to allow for a smoother bowel movement.   I haven't had any personal experience with it, but i've heard good things about psyllium husk. Just make sure you drink a lotta water! I think 64oz will be good, but read up the label on the Metamucil container if you grt it.    Fiber can actually do the exact opposite of what it's supposed to do (that is, make easier bowel movements) if you dont get enough of that sweet, sweet H2O",False,False

Basically it means that you're very dehydrated and constipated. In my experience, Miralax with lots of water is the most effective solution. Despite the name, Miralax is not a true laxative because it does not artificially stimulate the colon. Rather, it works as a fibrous gel that incorporates with your stool to keep everything hydrated and moving smoothly.  Hope you feel better soon!",False,False

For me the fiber supplements upset my stomach so I can't take them. I've got to eat the fiber, but I discovered that if I'm just eating meat and veggies, even if it's high fiber veggies, I get severely constipated. Rabbit poops, and even worse. There's got to be some real carby foods in there. Doesn't have to be bread or pasta. Could be potatoes. ",False,False
