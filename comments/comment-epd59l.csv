I feel immense satisfaction in sticking to a certain calorie limit and working it off, it makes my anxiety go away and my depression is almost non-existent.   When I am around 400/500 calories I feel superior and I go to bed so happy! I can do things and be around people with ease. My feelings are numb and motivation is high.  If I go a bit up when I feel intense hunger to prevent a binge (up to 1200 is ok) and make sure I work it off I am still ok, perhaps just a bit more emotional in the evening.  But when I binge or eat over my limit I‚Äôm a mess, even if I burn it off. I instantly get emotional and my motivation goes down the drain. When I spent a few months ‚Äúrecovering‚Äù I was in such a bad limbo and I eventually couldn‚Äôt deal with my emotions anymore so I relapsed.",False,False

If I am restricting, then I am in charge of my body and pain/distress that I feel, like putting up a shield so that when other people want to hurt me it doesn‚Äôt really matter to me because I am in charge of my pain and all I am really interested in is my weight and food and exercise. My ED is my safe bubble.",False,False

I have raging ADD that wonderfully contrasts against my perfectionistic tendencies. My life is a dumpster fire but when I eat less than 500 cals a day and burn everything off walking my dogs?
