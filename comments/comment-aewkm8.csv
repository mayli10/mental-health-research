I'm glad you've been doing so well in recovery! You're doing hard work with few resources. I'm about to cancel my gym membership (it's the hella cheap PF membership, but I never go and I'm too broke to justify a $10/mo subscription that I'm not even using), but someone on another sub just recommended me [darebee.com](https://darebee.com), which I'd never heard of. Definitely planning to summon up motivation to work out at home. I wish you so much health and self-love. &lt;3",False,False
