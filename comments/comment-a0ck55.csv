Like, instead of eating the whole thing by yourself, share it with him all cuddled up for a movie? Or, since you're working for recovery, find a sundae topping you're ok with and have a build your own sundae date at home featuring the halo top. It's only a ""sad anorexic"" food if you eat it when you're sad and relapsing, make it a joyous thing to share with a loved one and you'll have as much power over the food as you would if you were relapsing.

The people in your life are probably more useful about it than the people in mine.   My family is EXTREMELY controlling, and will use any excuse to tell me what to do (I’m fucking 26 and this is still the case). I would never dream of giving them any ammo that could be used at any point to tell me what I should and shouldn’t be getting up to.   My boyfriend, while more well meaning, also leans towards being controlling. He’s very insecure in his own intellect (he’s got a mental disability) and often feels like I’m always calling the shots in our relationship (even though he’s usually begging me to be the one to call the shots because I’m just straight up more equipped to do so), so any chance where he can tell me what to do, he jumps on it with very little accounting for nuance.   My therapist is the only person who I trust to actually be helpful with that sort of thing in pure way.",False,False

My anorexic ass is a sneaky bitch and if I don't tell the people closest to me my old tricks I *will* get up to them.   It is technically food policing I guess but it's not unwanted or unwarranted and it's only because I'm psychologically incapable of safely doing it to myself. ,False,True
