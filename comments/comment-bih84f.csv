Eating small but calorie dense foods (e.g. PB) will help you keep up your intake lots. Good luck :).",False,False

Once it was out in the open, talking was so so easy.  If nobody knows, write a letter. (I did this when telling my therapist about being sexually abused) I physically could not say what I needed to say out loud. So I wrote her a letter and asked her to wait until after I left the building to read it. Then, at the next session, your therapist will bring it up, and hopefully it will be much easier to talk about.  Good luck with that",False,False

Because you’re tall you probably have a super high TDEE so maybe you’re underestimating it? I think a recommended amount of gain is 1-2 pounds per week. A pound = 3500 calories, so try and eat 500-1000 over your TDEE per day. You could also have an overactive thyroid - my cousin had that and she was eating thousands of calories per day but still losing, so maybe get your thyroid checked. Best of luck to you!",False,False
