And even the worst of being ""found out"" doesnt actually sway me. I dont even know what I'm trying to achieve ofbits control or thinness or even to be sick but I'm also not ready to stop yet either. But I also dont want you to think that your words of caution are going unheard either because I truly appreciate them I think I need to figure out what I'm doing and why. I am just scared of people knowing what an idiot im being.",False,True

It is. I've always felt that way. It was a strange, dissonant experience when I realized that my habits had degraded to the point of fitting any diagnostic criteria that has ever existed. Because it still felt like I was just a weirdo with unhealthy habits. Even when shit became life-threatening serious, it always felt a little banal, silly, and embarrassing.  I also carried an indefinite cavalier certainty that I could ""stop at any time, if I wanted to"". If you do too, stop now. If you can't stop, please acknowledge that problem instead of just going ""I'll stop...tomorrow"".  The sooner you try to fight this, the easier it might be.",False,False

Its more just that I cant get over how stupid everyone would think I was for being an adult who knows better but still getting into this with the complete knowledge that I'm inviting this into my life on purpose despite that. I hope this makes sense.,False,True

I think its less that I'm worried about being diagnosed, but for how stupid everyone woukd think I was for it. It feels more like if I were to be diagnosed with skin cancer after purposely standing naked under the sun for 12 hours a day.  Like anyone hearing that would just be like, well obviously you got cancer you dumb shit thats what the sun does.",False,True

If you look through posts on this sub, many are about this exact type of thinking. Also, adults can and do develop these disorders, it’s not only teenage girls. No one is exempt.   If you feel you have a problem that’s affecting your quality of life, then you most likely do, so don’t let this type of thinking prevent you from seeking help if you want to. Doctors/mental health professionals will take you seriously. I know this sucks, but you’re not alone.",False,False

You might not meet the diagnostic criteria now, but this is a slippery slope. You wouldn't say ""oh i don't have real cancer, it's only stage 1"", you would try to fix it before it gets worse.  I think you're right on the nose when you say you're purposely invalidating yourself. That's what mental illnesses do, they try to convince you that it's somehow your fault and you're not really sick, you're just failing in some way. If you can, try to work through that feeling. I don't know whether you feel you need to get professional help at this point, but if you do  that wouldn't hurt. But even if not, I urge you to sit with these feelings and examine them, try to figure out how to steer yourself in the right direction.",False,False
