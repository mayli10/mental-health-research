People like him are worthless and deserve to rot in hell, tbh. I'm so sorry that you had to go through that BS and I hope justice is served. You have every right to be upset.",False,False

You’re not fat, and you’re not used up. Not at all. You are grieving and that is ok. You survived terrible things. But you *did* survive. You’re strong. Everything your garbage ex said is a lie and he is pathetic and a complete fucking waste of air and space. Absolutely find a therapist to help you navigate your new and better life, and consider a police report about the car as mentioned above. I’m sorry about your cat, but you kept your friend safe as best you could, which is great and shows you’re a caring person. I am enraged on your behalf, I hope your ex gets all the horror he deserves, what a fucking total degenerate. If you want, know that you deserve to eat. We want you to be here.",False,False

Hugs if you want them.   First, congrats on getting out. You are badass for that.  Second, please find a therapist. I don't suggest this for anything ED related (though if you want to pursue that, great). Coming out of an abusive relationship is fucking hard, and you won't realize how much you've been through until you're well past it.   Third, seriously consider filing a police report, minimally for your car. It will give you a paper trail if your piece of shit ex won't fuck off. It will also help if you file an insurance claim to get your car fixed, or if you decide to sue your ex for the cost of repairing it. (I know that sounds like too much right now;  I suggest it for later on, should you decide to pursue that.)  Finally, your ex is a stupid piece of shit who is absolutely, objectively wrong. You deserve so much better. ",False,False
