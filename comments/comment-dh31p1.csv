I didn't want to waste any more youth on being 'average' weight. So I decided to really go the distance to get skinny and 'hot' before i missed out on knowing what it was like to fit that beauty standard. Now that I'm older I sway between not caring because what's the point I'm already old and useless and wanting to be skinny to make up for being 'old'. I'm not even that old lol,False,False

I think your feelings are pretty common and there is a lot to explore on this topic. I've heard so many people (almost always other women) say ""she would be so beautiful if she just lost the weight"" about women with really pretty faces who happen to be overweight. I do think it's one of those nasty comments that comes from a place of jealousy, like ""she's naturally beautiful and I'm not and she's WASTING it!"" Wasting what??",False,False

I wasn’t a person to them, especially the boys. When I lost weight, people suddenly noticed me. It’s like I began to exist. People complemented me more and said that I was beautiful. One person said “huh didn’t know you were a rare beauty hidden being the fat. Good job on losing the weight” the worst part is that no one cares about my other attributes. Only that i got into society’s beauty mold. I became very afraid of losing my newly gained humanity and then I got the Ed. I never saw myself with dysphasia. I just feared becoming invisible again because I learned to like the attention. It’s like everyone who ever ignored me and treated me like I wasn’t worth being alive finally saw me. And a sick part of my brain wanted them to eat their words so I stoped eating mine I guess.",False,False

All the guys I ended up falling for simply wanted sex. They valued my body but would never have me as an actual person, never acknowledged my existence outside of the sheets. When I gained weight it definitely sent me on a journey of self discovery, and learning how to put forth my real worth in the world, but it was the loneliest and most depressing time for me. Now I am losing weight again and all the people that I begged validation from have popped back up in my life, and it only reinforces my feelings of having no value other than my body and appearance.",False,False
