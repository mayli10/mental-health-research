My SO told me the other day that I'm the smallest girl he's been with - and the biggest weighted like over twice my weight. He concluded that he didn't care about a girls weight as long as ""she wore it well"", i.e. curvy. This totally effs me up because now I know it won't matter if I'm tiny since he still finds fat girls attractive. On top of it all my body dysmorphia already wants to take my body in like three different directions so...",False,False

My husband has expressed appreciation for such a wide range of body types...which would be awesome if I knew WHAT TO DO with that information! We have conversations that go around in circles where I ask him how he likes me best/is most attracted to me, and he says “I like you any way because I love you”. WHICH IS VERY SWEET AND ALSO EXTREMELY UNHELPFUL. 🙃🙃🙃",False,False

My S/O has a history of being with thin girls (including one that suffered from an ED so automatically it’s a competition) and has admitted that he prefers small perky breast and basically thinner in general but says he loves my body and that I’m bigger than his past lovers and it irritates me to no end.,False,False
