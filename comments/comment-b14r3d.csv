It's not only fucking disgusting, but it makes you feel like ass. I've had four colonoscopies and I always get really bloated from the sheer amount of fluids you have to drink. Between that, and all the artificial flavors,  and the gross unsatisfying shits that keep you staggering out of bed and to the bathroom all night... it's a disappointing experience, as far as laxatives go.   Ulcerative colitis, on the other hand. Now that's a purifying experience.",False,False

Imagine taking this and having literally nothing in your system. It'd be like a clean slate for your intestines. And then only eating fruits and veg after?
