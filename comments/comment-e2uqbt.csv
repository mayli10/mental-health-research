I honestly restrict so much better without fasting. Like I’ll tell myself I’m gonna fast for 24 hours, do that, then end up eating like 700-1200 calories when I can eat again.

But then on the flip side, I start questioning if I even have a problem when I rarely even fast? Like other people be fasting all the time and I’m not. And the fasting subs make me think I don’t have a problem too because they’re doing a lot of disordered stuff, but seem okay with it?
