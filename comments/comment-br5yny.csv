I can not determine if I’m fat or skinny or something in between because how I see myself changes EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. It’s frigging exhausting. I’ve been very heavy and painfully thin and I can’t tell the difference in how I feel at any of those weights, and I hate that I can’t trust my own eyes.",False,False

From a fellow neurology obsessed person, yes. Y'all know the feeling when you start restricting and on the second day, you already think you just *feel* thinner? How we perceive ourselves is largely based on our history and our feeling towards ourselves.  When I was in the middle between healthy &amp; overweight at ~150 pounds, I felt great, I felt skinny, all that. Thought I genuinely was. Then at 115, I felt the fattest I'd ever been. Self perception made THE difference.  It's not the pictures or the mirrors or your eyes that are lying. Your cameras, your reflections and your eyes are still perfectly intact. But your brain has the ability to twist your visual reality into what it believes you *should* see; and if you've suffered from an ED long enough, it's reasonable that your brain is used to thinking you are things you're not.  So yes, body dysmorphia is real, and it's a bitch.",False,False

I went to a new yoga class this weekend and the whole thing was done in front of this massive wall of mirrors (which was hell, thank you very much) and I found myself checking out the other people. I wasn't even the biggest person there but I felt like they all looked good for their weight and all wore it well, whereas I looked lumpy and disgusting. I can't even tell if that's true or I just have much higher standards for myself than everyone else.",False,False

My brother is red-green color blind, and can’t see red, green, or purple. If i held up a purple crayon and hid the label, he would say with 100% certainty that it is blue. We see it as purple, but he can’t and never will. I can tell him a hundred times that it’s purple, but it won’t make him see anything different than he already does.   People tell me that I’m skinny, but I don’t see it, and never will. What I see is not what actually is.",False,False

I always *think* I’m seeing objective reality but it’s absolutely not the case. I wonder what would happen to me if I remembered that my eyes are lying 24/7. Probably have a breakdown tbh,False,False

Our brains, especially when processing the 5 senses, are extremely complex and far from direct and objective representations of reality. Our visual processing center is not like a camera. Google optical illusions and look at examples of how just a pattern can make our brains see 2 different things at the same time, or think that something is moving when it isn't, etc. Of course these are all the simplest examples of how we can mess with our brains' ability to process visual reality. But they can indicate how body dysmorphia can definitely affect how you perceive yourself and your body.",False,False
