I would consider upping your calories too, 1200 is a moderate/large deficit for anyone who isn’t bed bound, even at very low weights.",False,False

I’ve had my fair share of psuedo-recoveries.  The ones I felt best were when I was eating at least close to maintenance daily.  And I didn’t workout regularly.  I was very underweight but had almost NO symptoms I normally get with heavy restriction which was crazy to me.    My guess is it’s all the working out at a decent deficit.  Ease up on the workout or increase your intake and you will notice a drastic difference.  You can reduce the symptoms while still under your TDEE.  If you’re able to from a control standpoint, I think it’s totally worth it.",False,False
