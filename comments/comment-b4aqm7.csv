I can assure you that the benefits of the meds outweigh the cons. I feel SO MUCH better than I used to. My weight fluctuates anyway, so I don’t know if the meds did anything to help/hurt.   Factors that impacted my weight after meds:  1. I felt so much better and happier that i went out more and was social. Of course, these events had food, but I was with friends and people again!  2. I could get off the couch and out of the house again. Going more place and having more energy to cook and/or get food.   I was also a nicer, more patient person after meds. I can’t recommend them enough!",False,False

Abilify is generally one of the antipsychotics that doesn't increase  your appetite much, at least what I hear and see from my patients.",False,False

As someone who is on antidepressants and has been for over a year, they do not cause you to gain weight.  What causes you to gain weight is the appetite increase.    Let me explain because that sounds terrifying.  Before I started my medication, my low moods caused me to have a lack of hunger.  Now that my hormones are more balanced, I have a bit more hunger, but it isn't like you are going to feel constantly hungry or your antidepressants have 1000 calories in them!  You should be just fine, okay?  Make sure you take your medication regularly!    I promise that it will not cause you to gain a bunch of weight.    Side note: This is from my personal experience, which seems to be decently common amongst people.",False,False

I just stare at food longingly :(   Hey, if it helps you at all- I still lost weight after starting prozac. A lot of weight gain from antidepressants is from regaining your appetite after being depressed. I've also seen people start having more like sugar cravings, so they eat more. From what I know, most antidepressants don't affect your metabolism, just your appetite. And even then, it depends on the person and drug. I didn't notice anything appetite related after starting, I just logged my food and made sure to have a deficit still. ",False,False

CICO still applies, it just may be slightly harder to follow than normal, and I think that level of difficulty varies with each person. I never experienced the hunger spikes that are said to come with antidepressants and I'm on my third variety at this point.   What I'm trying to say is: don't sweat it, you're gonna be great :)",False,False

Go for  a walk (include a doggo if you have one!), maybe make yourself do something else that will help take your mind off of the cravings.  I know how it feels to have so many cravings ugh these just help me a little, but even I mess up from time to time. ",False,False
