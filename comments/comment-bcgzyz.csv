I can related to the feelings in your post so much.  One thing really stuck out to me though- about wanting to engineer the perfect body.  Do you really think you could? I know I couldn‚Äôt. I look at my thinspo all the time and still see things I could and would change if that were my body.  Also to the same point- who are you engineering this beautiful body for? Because if it‚Äôs for anyone other than you, bb you gotta love yourself first. Which, I know, is a rich thing to say in a sub and on a post where we don‚Äôt like ourselves.  Idk you but I feel like you are gorgeous inside and out doll. Sending you love cuz god knows I have tons to share and none for me lol.   You got this.",False,False
