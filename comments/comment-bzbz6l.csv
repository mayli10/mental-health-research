To avoid b/p I start doing my nails. The alcohol in polish remover as well as wet nail polish is NOT a good formula for purging. Plus taking the time to do my nails focuses my attn. on my nails and not on the nagging thought to binge.",False,False

I need to tell myself that I'm capable of resisting these urges.  2) accepting that this might be a signal from my body craving food and instead of b/p'ing on a bunch of junk food planning a whole healthy meal (and not seeing only the option of b/p or restricting)  Problem with 1) is that I actually don't believe that I'm capable of that, and problem with 2) is that I might want to purge that healthy meal, or even binge after. Hmmm..",False,True
