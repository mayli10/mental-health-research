And at 5'9"", even if you DID have a slower or damaged metabolism the likelihood of it being anywhere near below 1200 is pretty much impossible, just by virtue of keeping your body running!",False,False

I'll admit it IS hard somedays, it certainly can come with more guilt in the short term - but I know that the lack of binges that comes with restricting that but higher makes for much less severe guilt in the long run. I do recommend weighing a little less at first! Maybe once every week? The fluctuations seem much more minor day to day with high restriction in my experience, but it does take a bit of time to settle into that. An odd offer, but with such similar stats and restriction goals etc if you at all want to message for a chat or more advice or anything at all, please feel free to drop a message! ❤️",False,False

It would take a long, long, long time to gain weight just by eating that little bit more a day.  Once you factor in thermogenesis from eating and the fact you're gonna have more energy, you'll likely even out.   The best part is, though, you're likely to feel loads better by having more energy in your body, and feel less restricted because you have more choice to eat without feeling forced to go 'all or nothing'.",False,False
