Haven't in a while, but recently relapsed so I've been finding support in this community again.  Because I drink so much water and try to purge before anything gets too digested, it's more like a soupy version of whatever it was before, rather than actual vomit with the smell &amp; texture. If it's been an hour or so I get really grossed out and prefer not to purge to protect my teeth and sanity.",False,False

I threw up involuntarily a few times this summer and I definitely didn‚Äôt enjoy it, cause you feel gross before, during, and after and you can‚Äôt control it.   With purging there‚Äôs not that element of surprise so there‚Äôs nothing to fear and it usually doesn‚Äôt taste as bad cause there‚Äôs not much stomach acid. Also I‚Äôm sure I found it a little gross at first but I‚Äôve definitely done some vile shit over the years that‚Äôs made it impossible for a normal purge in my own bathroom to phase me at all.",False,False

Purging for 5 years, I never had any dental problems. I‚Äôve never even had a cavity. I am still in shock, bc I never correctly cleaned my teeth after an episode (apparently, brushing your teeth after is TERRIBLE, but that‚Äôs what I did, then mouthwash after). Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever purge again, never feel the need to binge anymore, I just never feel hungry at all. Regardless, I‚Äôm lucky my teeth were not affected by this.
