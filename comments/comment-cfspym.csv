For levels 1-3 you needed a staff to check off your toilet before you flushed (so, pretty much always, as level 4s were usually a few weeks from discharge). If you flushed before doing so youâ€™d get dropped to level 1 bathrooms for 24 hrs meaning staff had to be in the bathroom with you while you used the toilet and showered. It happens, whatever. But when they dropped people over automatic flush toilets it was some cruel bullshit.",False,False

I was in a gas station bathroom once and glad I was only doing ~Normal~ stuff because as soon as I pulled my pants up, oh my god. The thing was a literal geyser. It blew water up OUT OF THE TOILET a solid 12 inches and continued this volcano performance for a whole two minutes. Seriously, I started timing it after a good fifteen or twenty seconds because I was just in awe. So, in short, that day could've gone very differently for me.",False,False
