When describing the same symptoms, I received a different diagnosis from an outpatient provider (MDD, GAD), hospital psychiatrist (Bipolar II), and residential facility psychiatrist (BPD). Which one is true? I dunno...aspects of all of them fit, but not spot-on and not as a full explanation.   But the good thing for me is those diagnoses eventually each led to piece of a solution. Guiding med selection. Guiding the type of therapy. So I don’t put dx on a pedestal anymore, but it has helped in the end.   Hope this diagnosis proves helpful to you!",False,False
