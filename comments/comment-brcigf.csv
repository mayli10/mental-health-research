I have to literally force myself to put down food between bites. Like usually I would eat it all without stopping. But lately to work on it, every couple of bites I put my food/fork down, take a few drinks of water, and do something for a couple minutes (unless its warm food) to slow myself down so I really enjoy it, because when I eat it all super fast I get panicked like, ""i just wasted all my calories without tasting the food!!!!"" And that can trigger a b/p cause i eat more to ""not waste"" and taste the food but everytime i go back for more i eat faster and faster  The whole process is so gross but I've been b/ping WAY less often by sitting down, putting my phone down, maybe have classical music playing, take a few bites, drink water, check phone, put it down, repeat. Even that is a little disordered, kind of like counting bites, because it's a pattern and ritual around eating, BUT since it helps me to not b/p as much, I'll take it, ya know?  Anyways, you're not alone &lt;3 I hope someone in this thread can give advice to help you eat in a way you're more happy with",False,False

I know mindful eating is supposed to be good practice in general, but it's hard to eat mindfully when your mind is disordered.  It's almost like I'm trying to shove in the food before I have a chance to think about it.",False,True
