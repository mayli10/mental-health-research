Long story short, I've had BED and been overweight for 8 years, finally sought real help in November, and my team and I focused on getting my bingeing down. Guess what? It worked. Not all the way..I still binge, but it was so much better than before treatment. The problem? I spent so much time focusing on the bingeing part of my ED that I completely neglected to restrictive side. The restrictive side wasn't a problem before, as I was bingeing all the time anyway. But now that my bingeing has stopped and I want to lose more weight because of it, my daily intake hasn't increased. And now I'm started to get more and more restrictive instead of having straight BED. I don't even want to stop it because I spent al my life fat and with BED and praying for ana to one day take me that I just want to enjoy being skinny once. Overall, I've gotten so my healthier mentally. But it pisses me off because people think I got worse just because my weight has changed and I am in a smaller body. And I just think, ""If they weren't concerned when I wanted to kill myself at a 29 BMI due to BED, then they don't get to be concerned for me now.""  Shoot questions at me if you like.",False,False
