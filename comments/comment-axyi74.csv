Pretends me from analyzing my skin and picking everything possible - focusing on one part of myself that I'm allowed to pick.

In the past I've been able to calm it down to my feet (ikik nasty, but I actually can't help it), which is a little better cause people never see them - Consciously grabbing something to fidget with I have a free hand (otherwise I'll mindlessly go pick)   A lot of these can be applied to picking your nails (which I do too), and is more common for those of you who don't torture your skin like me",False,False
