At least the 3 mos old? They wouldnt be able to understand what you are saying so no damage to their psyche. And your husband could help out with your 4 y/o. You could try to find a psychologist who can accommodate your schedule. Mine did that. The only time I had was 6 pm wednesdays, so that's when our sessions were. Idk if either of those suggestions help. But your children deserve a healthy mom, especially during this difficult time, but also, always, at all times. And you deserve to be happy, just for yourself",False,False

I know i need to start taking my health more seriously so i can be there for the little ones. it‚Äôs just so fucking hard. i feel so alone in dealing with all this, having a child with cancer is stressful enough, plus having a young infant as well means there is so much pressure on me (SO works full time). I need to make some time for self care and therapy. I can‚Äôt afford to get back to the point of hospitalisation, they need me too much.  thank you for your kind words ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",False,True

I understand it‚Äôs so hard to find time for yourself in the midst of all this but you HAVE to prioritize yourself first. There‚Äôs a reason they tell you in planes to put the oxygen mask on yourself first before anyone else. You cannot help anyone else if you can‚Äôt breathe. Please increase your therapy and psych appointments and support system because you‚Äôre going through a hard time and need + deserve all the support in the world.

I‚Äôm glad that a psych has been helpful in the past and I completely understand how hard it would be to fit in the time to see one at the moment. I just want you to know that you‚Äôre not a failure, even if you feel like one, and it‚Äôs not whinging to let it all out sometimes. It‚Äôs hard to keep everything to yourself and it can be hard to reach out when you feel like you have to be the strong one. I hope that you might find the time to even just call a free helpline service when you have a little moment. You‚Äôre an amazing fighter! ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False

It sounds like an incredibly stressful time and it‚Äôs horrible that your ED is torturing you on top of everything else. Do you have access to any psychologists? Perhaps talking with a professional might help alleviate some stress for you. You are so strong, I really hope you‚Äôre able to find some peace from this horrible disorder. I hope your little girl is doing well in treatment too. X",False,False
