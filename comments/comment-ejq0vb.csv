There was a part at a banquet where the characters give speeches and then have to ""eat their words"", because the things they said in their speech become their food. So like literally they would stand up and say ""Steak pie with plum pudding"" or something and sit down and then eat that. My fat little ass used to fantasize about that ability allllllll the time lmao...  The giant cookie from Honey I Shrunk the Kids looked sooooo good even though I knew it must've been stale and gross as hell. Maybe it tastes better to tiny tastebuds  Fry Bits from Steven Universe üò≠ I know those aren't exactly fictional but I don't wanna make effort  Like ALL the food from Harry Potter as a kid  Also I either saw a movie or misremembered a real thing I ate as a child but it stuck with me... it was like... a shell of crispy sugary marzipan shaped like a green cauliflower that you broke into with a spoon and inside it was filled with sweet vanilla whipped cream and you would dip the shells of marzipan into it. I literally have dreams about it (I think it MAY have been a princess cake that my baby brain just like... totally warped)  Also, on behalf of my SO and apparently everyone who saw that movie, Creme de la Creme a la Edgar from the Aristocats.",False,False
