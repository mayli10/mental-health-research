I've been inpatient twice, in residential 4 times, and in php/iop for a total of 8 months in the past year.   My first time inpatient, I went to a PHP for an evaluation to get their thoughts. They started me in residential, but after 3 days my vital signs were bad and I passed out, so I was stepped up from resi to inpatient. That time I was there for about two weeks. Once my vitals were better because I was eating and drinking better, they created a discharge plan that included a step down for residential, which was what I needed at that time.  I'd ask your outpatient team what their recommendation is. Be very honest with them about how you feel. They might have a lower level of care that will still get you the care you need in mind that they can refer you to. That being said, if you think inpatient will help you I think you should go. While there, my biggest piece of advice is to put your blinders on and don't let other people's struggles become yours. A lot of people in inpatient care have some really unhealthy habits and it's easy for the eating disorder to get into that competitive mindset and mirror them. Don't let it. Take care of you",False,False

I took a medical leave of absence from school/work to go to treatment and it was the best decision of my life because it saved me. Not every treatment program is the same though and there are definitely some shitty ones out there (research programs to get a better idea about the one you're planning to attend). Luckily for me, I attended some great treatment programs throughout my time in inpatient, PHP, and IOP although I had to do multiple stints (relapses can be a bitch)  I wish you all the best",False,False
