There’s only been one person who has ever suspected anything, maybe because seeing this person would trigger restriction for me, and I would *never* eat around them. In a sick way, I kind of enjoyed the suspicion at first and how they were always trying to coax me into having some of their food. But as we got closer and they got a little more up front about it, I totally panicked and shut it down as fast as I could. Sometimes I feel like I want people to know, I *want* them to worry, but I know that’s just disordered thinking. When it comes down to it, I would be mortified if anyone actually knew.  I’m so sorry about your boyfriend, OP. I would be freaked out too :( He might have forgotten or actually not looked it up, you could always ask and kind of come clean if you trust him... Or just keep it to yourself and see if he mentions it, and decide what to do then. Sending love.",False,False
