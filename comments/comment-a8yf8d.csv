There will be people form it who will surely come to defend it but eating that little was not healthy for me and I‚Äôm a short, young, inactive, female. I went from overweight to underweight in 1.5 months. The affects on someone taller, or a male, would be even greater.   I think that nobody should eat that little a day unless they are severely obese and need to lose weight immediately for their life. Or if you do it alternate days or something. I guess everyone‚Äôs bodies are unique but for me 1200 calories is definitely an eating disorder. ",False,False
