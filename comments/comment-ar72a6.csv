My brother constantly bullied me for my weight, as a kid he would always call me fatty in front of his friends to try and humiliate me. He‚Äôs 4 years older. As we got older he would call me a fat bitch whenever we were arguing. When I was 10 he found my diet log and diary where I described how much I hated my body and how fat I was and he blackmailed me with it threatening to tell our mom.   Last year he told me there was no point using dating apps unless I started hitting the gym and I got really upset and ran upstairs. He said to my mom ‚Äòwell someone has to say it to her‚Äô  As a kid my mom was really strict on me food wise and especially with sweets. She told me every time I ate chocolate it would add another lump to my tummy. Once she looked me up and down when I was ten and turned to my aunt and said ‚ÄòI‚Äôm putting her on a diet‚Äô. She used to constantly make remarks about my weight and my ‚Äòbelly‚Äô and would make me feel bad when we went clothes shopping about how it was so hard to find clothes that fit me cos of my belly and cos I was too big. As an adult she would have no difficulty telling me ‚Äògod you have an awful belly in that outfit‚Äô or ‚Äòyour ass looks huge in that‚Äô.   I remember aged 11 a neighbour asked if I had been dieting and that I had lost weight. Also at 11 a friend‚Äôs mom told me that I had lost weight and to keep up the good work. At 16 when I was bulimic, my best friend‚Äôs dad creepily looked me up and down and told me ‚Äòyou are looking very well‚Äô.  At 14 I had a friend admit he told other friends I would look so much better if I lost weight and he said ‚Äòsorry but it‚Äôs true‚Äô. He used to make comments if he thought I was eating too much. I remember once saying ‚Äòoh I‚Äôm so obsessed with kinder eggs lately‚Äô and he said ‚Äòdon‚Äôt you think you could choose to be obsessed with something a bit healthier?‚Äô In front of all our friends. Same friend who three years told me he was there for me and I didn‚Äôt need to lose any weight at all when he found out I was bulimic.   I got in a fight with a friend of a friend once, at around 13/14. He had his friend go and post ‚Äòfat‚Äô and ‚Äòyou‚Äôre fat‚Äô on my bebo wall about fifty times over.   A few years ago I overheard my parents discussing how much weight I had put on, that I must be eating chocolate and that I would never get a boyfriend at my size.   The list goes on and on.
