For yike one, I would consider saving up money and buying a mini fridge that you can keep stocked with your own foods. I dont know if that could be an option for you, but something like that may help",False,False

I've noticed he used to get the regular margarine and now has been getting the light version. It's a small thing but I'm noticing it..   Yike2: yeah, I should for sure. He's been really kind and lovely and I know he tries really hard but y'know, one Ana is unique from the next. I feel like there's more that I need to do to try to accept his compliments and deal with my dysmorphia. Because like... he's not doing anything wrong. He's doing lots right, and I'm responding negatively because that's how I'm wired right now. ",False,True

Its uncomfortable, but the best way to help him is to at least know how to act around him. Maybe even come up with a ""safe word"" that he can slip into conversation that will let you know that what you're doing is triggering him so you can stop and or make sure not to do it around him. Theres only so much that can be done but maybe that could help. As to yike 2: send your bf resources on how to help a person with an ED. and tell him the things you think could help. It wont be linear, but if you say ""I think xyz could help when I'm feeling like this"" he could utilize that. And if it ends up not helping, be honest!!  In short, complete and brutal honesty, while painful, will hopefully be your best tool when navigating these waters.  I hope I was helpful, good luck!!!",False,False
