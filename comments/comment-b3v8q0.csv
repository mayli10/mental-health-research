For snacks I absolutely love air popped popcorn (and add any spices you want on top) super low cal and good! For meals, if I can’t get myself to eat well during finals/studying I usually go for a Greek yogurt and some grapes or other fruit, which is very filling and still keeps it under 200 calories.
