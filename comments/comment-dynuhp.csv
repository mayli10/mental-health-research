Like it's so exciting to see the scale go down and if I were naturally skinny I'd miss out on that excitement. I'm glad I'm not alone lol",False,False

I grew up fat and didn't think I'd ever be skinny but eventually I lost a lot of weight and could actually see what I fuckin look like under the fat,False,False

I love lifting weights and eating so I'd be hella good at bulking, plus it's still satisfying to get stronger and get dat ass. Losing weight is really satisfying too though but I could do without being so exhausted and weak all the time",False,False

Oh, youâ€™re naturally skinny? Well i havenâ€™t eaten in 3 days, bitch, so who really deserves their skinniness?",False,False

I have been overweight or obese my whole life. The few times I did lose weight people noticed and cheered me on and it was rush. Seeing what I look like as not overweight (like, even a healthy weight) would be so cool. I'm currently about 20lbs down from my heaviest, but at 5'2"" it makes a decent difference in other people's eyes. I can't really see much difference.  This mindset makes me feel a bit better.",False,False

Being heavy means you have more muscle just from having to carry around all the extra weight everywhere, so youâ€™re naturally pretty toned under the layer of fat. Iâ€™ve seen progress pics of girls that have lost bunches of weight and their legs &amp; ass look amazing even if they didnâ€™t exercise at all, possibly from the muscle building up over years of being overweight",False,False
