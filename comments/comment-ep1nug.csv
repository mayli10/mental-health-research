You are correct that violence was not an appropriate response to the situation.  To responded to your point here, I think that if a woman were to take away her bfs autonomy by means of force (unless I misunderstood, he literally held her in place for half an hour), slapping her in response would be understandable. Certainly not the correct thing to do, but it wouldn't take a monster to do it.",False,False

He probably meant well and two years of being together with a bulimic can feel heavy on people. I know because I am bulimic too and my bf knows, we dealt with it since the beginning and I'd kinda understand him, if the same thing happened to us.  To see our beloved fall back in their bullshit over and over again stirs up mixed feelings like powerlessness, anger, sadness... Like ""you fucking crybaby get up on your fucking feet and snap out of it!!!"". God knows how many times I thought it myself about me, my bf would be totally right to do the same. We get mad. We all do. Means you still care about each other. You need to apologize both and promise not to repeat it. Like you should make a point of not ever again purging with him present, therefore not binging either. He should promise never to use force to restrict you ever again and to help you out of your destructive behaviours in an emotionally healthy way. You should clarify this immediately in order not to dig a rift between you two. Get close, maybe hug, talk about it, make a good cry, be honest with each other. Wishing you best.",False,False

So, responding in kind maybe isn’t great but it’s very understandable. Being restrained can be extremely traumatic (which is why schools and hospitals try to keep it as a last resort). Our instinct is to getoutgetoutgetout.   As an internet stranger I can’t know whether he’s a healthy and safe person for you or not ofc. But my own experience has been that when people who care about us see us hurting ourselves it can be very scary for them, and fear often gets expressed as anger. If he’s willing to listen, continuing to explain to him how being forced to stop isn’t a path to sustainable recovery. Choosing for oneself is so critical. Plus, being blocked from the action without having any healthy substitute can actually increase the desire to do the action!   For myself and my SO we’ve got a short script for when I want support working through distress - so he doesn’t feel powerless and I’m being supported in ways that are actually helpful for me. (But that also arose out of a lottt of time in therapy.) Hoping the two of you can finds way forward that’s healthy for both of you. &lt;3 If it’s an option, going to therapy together even just a few times can be a good way to work through intense stuff since the therapist can guide the conversation and facilitate understanding each other.",False,False

Again I don't want to sound mean or anything but this is a really serious thing :( please consider therapy and recovery if you're not already in it,False,False

It was a defense mechanism to being held by the wrists and restrained. That isn't okay. I get he wanted to keep you from your self destructive behavior, but he has no right to physically restrain you.",False,False
