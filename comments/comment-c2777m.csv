I am 5‚Äô8‚Äù, I was 100 pounds, I struggled with anorexia (technically binge purge subtype but I never purged physically, I binged and restricted) on and off since I was 12 but this time it was the worst. I was underweight for 3 years, pretty consistently, but it quickly turned into a raging binge/restrict cycle for about a year (most miserable year of my entire life). After my best friend died, I sought help, I was outpatient, saw the doctors once a week, learned about nutrition, got therapy, ate 3500+ calories a day for a month (more like 5000....), then lowered to 3000, then 2500, then no calorie minimum after 3 months. I learned where this all stemmed from, I made the decision to let go of that, I got my period back, I stopped weekly treatment after the first month since I was doing super well, I then went bi weekly for a month, then once a month, sometimes twice a month, from Feb-June. I gained ~35 pounds in 2 months (lol no joke, it was horrifying) but then didn‚Äôt gain anything after that. I gained super quick and my weight stabilized pretty quickly. I only recently found out what my weight was, and it didn‚Äôt really faze me, I was just happy that it hasn‚Äôt changed in a few months, this means that my body is likely happy and working again. I recently got cleared for exercise (WHICH IS AMAZING BECAUSE I LOVE BIKING AND THE ELLIPTICAL), I am no longer out patient but I‚Äôm required to go back in 3 months to see if my weight is the same, but so far it‚Äôs been stable for 5 months.   All in all, the whole process took about half a year to get to this place, but I would say it became easier after the first 2 months. The first 2 months are the hardest but once you gain the weight and no longer feel the need to overeat, your mind starts thinking of things besides food and things start to get much better. Then maybe 4 months in, one day i woke up and realized I didn‚Äôt think about food when I first opened my eyes, and that was a good morning.",False,True

I held my best friend as he died. I realized that I have the option to live, I have the option to not be in a hospital bed, he didn‚Äôt though, cancer won.   I decided to start obsessing about other things. I decided to start measuring my life goals, since life is too short to not think about it. I started counting my blessings in life. I started obsessing about my well-being and living a normal, healthy life, I started obsessing about my work and school and family and loved ones instead.   Our personalities don‚Äôt fade. But what we channel them into can change, only if we want them to. I just decided to let go one day, and I did everything I could to.  It wasn‚Äôt instant.... don‚Äôt get me wrong. It wasn‚Äôt easy either, it was actually quite horrible. But once I gained weight and stopped thinking about food, I realized I had started to think about so much else, so much more of my life, good shit started happening to me, I got better at my job, I got a raise, got better at grad school, I started dating again, I had plans almost every night, I would start eating with people instead of alone and make it about connecting to others instead of stuffing my face.   Life just changed as soon as my headspace freed up. Life is still not perfect, obviously. I lost my best friend, trauma that I can‚Äôt unsee, ever. I struggle every day with other things, question whether I‚Äôm good enough at my job, what I‚Äôll do after I get my degree, where my relationships are going, if my family is okay, etc. etc. but they‚Äôre no longer about food is all. Which trust me, is much better. Because the former impacts the life around you and the latter impacts the life within you.",False,True
