That's the type of people that come here and post here. Like if you go to a sub on cars, that's the only type of stuff you'll see there. We all have some goal, and we gravitate towards people or places that align with those goals. This subreddit is one of those places that's acceptance of us and like-minded people are here.   If I go to a fitness subreddit, people may not be as understanding or compensation for my eating habits.",False,False
