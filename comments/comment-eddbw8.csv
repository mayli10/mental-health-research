My fertile week/ovulation is my lowest weights of the month. Then the hunger and bloating therefore weight goes up a few pounds either a day or so before my period starts,usually lasting until it's almost over.  I've been tracking for years. Hormones have a GIANT effect on hunger/bloating/weight.  My rhr has consistent patterns as well. Probably temp too but I don't track that.  This pattern really helps to eliminate some of the anxiety I have over weight. If it increases a few lbs I know it's going to go back down.",False,False

It seems crazy but -7 in a week = -2(ish) per week for a month which makes much more sense! My body just releases it all at once somehow,False,True

If it does, it‚Äôs within the weight loss if that makes sense. I consider these wooshes to be my ‚Äúactual‚Äù weight loss. Like the weight I lose on them is actually lost.
