It's 45 calories a cup (about 215 grams on my food scale). A cup of that and a tablespoon of cocoa powder + your choice of zero calorie sweetener is 55 calories and a nice little way to get some dietary fat in. I loved making hot cocoa with coconut milk but ran out and haven't been able to get any more.  Almond milk is another option too! I can't use it so dunno how that would convert out. When I'm trying to find the calories of the amount of coconut milk I got on my food scale I take 240/215 and then multiply the result of that by the grams on the scale to figure out how many mls of liquid I used to tell my calorie logger app to get the calories.  Also for those that can have coffee, adding coconut milk or almond milk is still a pretty low cal booster. I've made hot cocoa coffee for about 22 calories using a tablespoon of cocoa powder and a little bit of coconut milk.",False,False

But I get super dark coffee that I brew super strong. It also tastes a bit chocolatey to me already.   But if you like that, you should try putting unsweetened dark chocolate in fat free (or full fat, hell, idk your life and shit) plain greek yogurt. High protein chocolate pudding.
