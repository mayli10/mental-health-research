Mayonnaise is on mcchickens so like I know it's actually an OK tasting sauce. And ranch has gotten on my buffalo chicken wraps a few times and it's good.   But I haven't had them enough to really like or want them, and I DONT LIKE THEM because I don't -want- to like them. I mean, right now when I go to a veggie tray, it's just me and the veggies. I don't want to have to sit there and fight with myself over ranch. ",False,False

I hardly ever eat out because I like to make and weigh my own food, but literally I will get upset over a slice of pizza I havenâ€™t even eaten yet because if itâ€™s not The Best Slice of Pizza on Earth (tm) then it was a waste because I never get to eat pizza and now Iâ€™ve spent all these calories so I canâ€™t spend them on food I know Iâ€™ll like and the day is ruined and so is my life ðŸ™ƒ",False,False
