I developed a complex about it years later, stuff they'd put in my head. I keep stand-alone journals to help me get over stuff I'm going through now.  That person you're freaking out and getting upset over could be anyone, anywhere doing anything. They can be people who know you IRL who pretend to live overseas and they find out too much about you and follow you around. I think they can be any gender or age and masquerade as 13-14yrs old.  It could be a metaphor for something else and they've dressed up an assault, crime or animal sacrifice. It could be a sick joke that has nothing to do with eating disorders. They dumb themselves on purpose to obscure their offline identities. Social media gives you infinite license to be manipulative, even in the pro-ED world.  I get angry with the offline world as well for advocating pro-ED stuff and being sneaky about it. I think it's really mainstream but they can cover it up and make it look happy/positive. They just won't let it appear overtly disordered. It masquerades as status anxiety.  If eating disorders are really common, whatever the majority prefer has a lot of influence and it can distort normalcy so they can behave abnormally. Pro-ED isn't what it was 20yrs ago. It gets swept under the carpet which is how these pro-ED sites emerge. The modern world is crazier and more enabled imo. It's repressed.   No one talks about how they're feeling and what's going on in their heads and how they feel about their bodies. ED sufferers like that woman who was interviewed on Oprah still exist.
