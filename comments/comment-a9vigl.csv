She must not be ‚Äúobsessed‚Äù or ‚Äúoverly concerned‚Äù with it. Or at least not visibly so. She mustn‚Äôt always order salads or freak out when she doesn‚Äôt make it to the gym. Watching her eat a cheeseburger‚Äîor better yet, a steak‚Äîeven oddly enthralls him.   I think men exist in this lucky sliver of human existence where beauty standards are largely negatively swayed towards women before even touching men, where media places men in a position where they could be any magnitude of unattractive and still attract a Megan Fox or Mila Kunis (and before they turned 30), all while existing in bodies that simply require more food. I think it's that ignorant belief we all hold (or maybe just me) that others can do what we do because *we* can do it, but I may be wrong. Furthering the speculation, I think that's the space where this ignorance to pressure sits. Men aren't subjected to the same standards and expectations so they don't have to make the same efforts. Again, though, I could be wrong and I'm largely taking shots in the dark.   &gt;&gt;I disagree with the inevitable conclusions that may come from an article like this one [...]  I fear that this will inevitably be used as fuel against all thin women who show off their high calorie meals, like a witch hunt (or a thin bitch hunt I guess..) or another reason to doubt or maliciously question women rather than worry for them, if that makes sense, although I don't know what 'thin'means in this context.
