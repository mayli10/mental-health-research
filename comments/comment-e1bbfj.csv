I had a stressful night with my boss who micromanaged the fuck out of people... I ended up not eating despite being hungry. Ed is my coping mechanism. Makes me feel weak and I know if I ate more Iâ€™d have more energy. But if Iâ€™m upset and hungry and eat, I just feel upset and itâ€™s way worse. So I starve",False,False
