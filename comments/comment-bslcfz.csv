But also hard feel you on Halo Top's ""servings"" kind of freaking me out. I know their target audience is volume eaters, but the way they push it in their marketing and packaging is just... too much, for me. Three pops at once as a recommended serving? Entire pints that literally tell me not to stop until I finish it? I'm not trying to redirect my BED onto lower calorie foods, I'm trying to stop fucking binging.  I mean, I won't, and I'll still eat Halo Top, but it's such late stage capitalism.",False,False

When I bought them I got a $2 off coupon for 2 boxes of them but like that's 8 dollars for something I may binge all of in one night so... no more for me )-:,False,False
