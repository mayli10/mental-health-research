I know how change of plans can completely derail me for a bit. I bet cleaning is a great way to recharge! Put on some music, maybe have a nice iced tea, and just try to go with the flow while you‚Äôre doing it :)  I‚Äôm off this weekend but I‚Äôve got a crazy week ahead (preparing for a cross country move at the end of the month) so I‚Äôm trying to take it easy but also really enjoy the last bits of living here while I can. There‚Äôs so many fall festivals this weekend and next weekend but all I‚Äôve done so far today is watch tv üò®ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",False,False

I tend to get easily over whelmed.  They canceled the hang out anyway so now I have to still walk across town to some how burn off the breakfast i let myself eat and im trying really hard not to cry because I obsessed so hard about this.  and why cant it be easy to just let things go. let plans fall through. I cant handle normal people always flaking out on me. I CANT.,False,True

For me it‚Äôs about baby steps. It‚Äôs sometimes about recognizing that I can‚Äôt be in control 100% of the time and sometimes it‚Äôs about knowing that and planning for it. Like. I have this HUGE tendency to set myself up for failure and then be so damn hard on myself when I do the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù thing. And for me, the awful wild out of control moments happen the most frequently when I put myself in a position where too many things are stacked against me. So I know how I personally would have handled the stress from meeting new people, plus having fasted all day, PLUS walking to the other side of town. I would have triggered myself into a binge the second the snack food came out or someone suggested ordering pizza.   Anyways. I didn‚Äôt mean to go off on a tangent and I hope this is helpful and not like....condescending. Sometimes it‚Äôs just  important to know that we aren‚Äôt alone ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False

Im just so scared all the time. But I have to keep telling myself that no one even notices or half the time thinks my food habits are weird. Today at work i tried a new food item, said i t was gross, then tried it with something instead of plain and my coworkers were like ""Was it better with lettuce?""   and i said LOL   I SAID.   ""YEAH im mean i'll still probably purge it later but yeah."" and no one even heard me so why the fuck am i nervous lol",False,True

It‚Äôs always scary especially with a new group of people where you‚Äôre not 100% comfortable with them yet. I hope you have an awesome time if you do go, I know it‚Äôs tough but you only live so long on this god forsaken planet. Might as well try to have some fun while you can, one day of eating won‚Äôt mean anything within a week, but those memories can last a lifetime üíñ",False,False

Please please don‚Äôt be mad, I just wanted to offer some (hopefully helpful??) advice that I wish someone had offered me in the exact same situation. Don‚Äôt fast the day of the hang out. By the time it comes around you‚Äôll feel so hungry/hangry/on edge and you won‚Äôt be able to focus on having fun. If you‚Äôre anything like me, the second the topic of food comes up you‚Äôll get super hyper focused and end up hating yourself after. My advice is to eat something really filling/low cal/high volume like celery or watermelon or spaghetti squash, and a lot of water before hand, maybe a couple of hours, so if there‚Äôs food around you can just be like ‚Äúoh I like JUST ate and I‚Äôm super full still‚Äù and you won‚Äôt have to worry about stomach grumbles giving you away? BUT if you end up eating a little too much for comfort, the food you‚Äôve already eaten is so low calorie it will help with the guilt. Again. I hope this is helpful, and feel free to completely ignore it if isn‚Äôt. Just trying to help ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False

Because I had a really great time last night. im growing a friend circle with REAL people. and now we're hanging out tomorrow for lazy movie night and all I can worry about is ""Oh god..they're like...healthy normal people who enjoy food...what am I gonna do..do i fake eat..do i eat and regret it..WHAT IF WHAT IF WHAT IF.""",False,True

The declining new friends bc they might make you eat thing is way too real. I‚Äôve been avoiding hanging out with my friends lately because I just don‚Äôt want to eat and they always suggest getting food. They don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm getting bad again, they just think I‚Äôm busy. This disorder is so fucking lonely. I hope you can enjoy being with people, and if you ever need a friend/someone to chat with my DMs are open",False,False
