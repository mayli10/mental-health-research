Good luck with school once it starts. I'm in the same boat as you with restricting and exercise and education. I hope we can nourish ourselves well and learn a lot this year.,False,False

IF! IF you are eating 1500 and IF you think you can not get carried away, the ONLY thing I would even consider suggesting is something that is like a specific class you could go to w friends or a couch 2to 5k program where there is structure to keep you from going overboard. I’ve done running programs like that and NOT used them to exercise purge but just going to the gym quickly turns into self destructive hell.   It really seems like a risky idea - it’s so easy to tell ourselves “oh I’ll be find, I can handle that” and just flat out lie to ourselves,   You have a therapist? I would truthfully ask them - having someone to call you on your bullshit is a fucking godsend! (And you deserve to remember your college years, not lose them in the ed memory haze :/)",False,False

In my heart, I knew it was, but I think it's the metaphorical ED voice asking this. I think the fear of weight gain is why I want to go to the gym in the first place, and what I really want is someone to say ""Oh, go four times a week, that'll keep you healthy!""... and 'healthy' is my brain disguising 'not gaining weight'.      Thank you for the honest answer, because it made me look at my thoughts honestly.",False,True

That's what my dietician and doctor reccomended for me, anyway.",False,False
