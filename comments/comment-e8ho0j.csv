She definitely didn't mean harm, but someone over a half foot taller should weight at least 20-30 lbs more than the shorter person.   Like, I know people don't mean it in a harmful manner, but especially when I weighed more people were always ""shocked"" when they heard my weight. It made me feel like I should weigh much less.",False,False

It‚Äôs not like I really want to be seen as cute but in Japan, everyone prefers cute, petite girls and knowing that I‚Äôll never, ever fit that standard sucks. People tend to think tall people have it better because we ‚Äúget to eat more‚Äù or ‚Äúlook so cool‚Äù but both of those things come hand in hand with being skinny :(  And yes! That is so true. I remember when I first hit 110lbs during this health checkup day at school (basically we weigh ourselves, check our eyesight/height etc) and I said, ‚ÄúOh no, I‚Äôm so heavy‚Äù and this tiny teacher who wasn‚Äôt even 5 feet tall said, ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you just work out more?‚Äù And like I get that she may not have had bad intentions but OBVIOUSLY I would weigh more than she ever would because I was already 5‚Äô7‚Äù at that point.  Sorry, that ended up being way too long haha I was just really glad someone understood.",False,True

I grew up in south Texas and towered over the guys at my school at 5'8"". Most girls were 5'2"". In the school band they gave me size 10-12 uniform clothes... not because that was my size (I was around a size 4-6 at the time) but because everyone else was smaller than me and they got the smaller sizes. All this really fucked with my perception of myself. I feel like an ogre so often because I just will never be small no matter how underweight I get.    I have since moved to another part of the US, but I cannot break the mindset that I'm this giant freak that will never be 'cute'.   Also it's always so screwed up that people forget that taller women will weigh more. Like I could say I'm 115 lbs and no one bats an eye because it's a healthy weight for everyone below 5'6""",False,False

I'm as white as it gets and from central Europe, but my height/build is the thing I hate most about myself.. see stats. It's a constant battle because I'm pretty tall, but I either feel like I'm way too tall and broad or not tall enough to really stand out. I'm in the inbetween where you're chunky at any weight because your bones just want to be wide, and it sucks. Everyone else gets to be small..",False,False
