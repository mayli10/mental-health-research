Programming and 3D modeling give ur brain a WORKOUT  \-Writing, reading, and listening to podcasts",False,False

I discovered that knitting is a really good activity to focus on - easy to learn, cheap to do, and you get fun socks and hats eventually. I also have reassigned some of my tendency towards ritualizing food, to coffee. I try not to worry about my intake, but I make my morning coffee time a big elaborate thing with nice mugs and a nice french press and my chair by a window with the news.

I stopped doing cardio since it wsa an excessive exercise and got really into different types of yoga and weight lifting, and started going to donation based dance classes on the weekends. I also got an amc stubs membership and see so many movies now. I'm religious and have been more active in my church groups too.

My SO recently started teaching me to snowboard and we have been going ice skating lately too with his kid.  Also, I‚Äôve finally gotten back into reading which I used to love.

Fiction and nonfiction. Recently I've read Empire of the Summer Moon which is a book about the Plains Indians in North America which was fascinating.   I do mixed martial arts as a hobby, and although it is exercise I've managed to keep it separate from my ED. It's about discipline and strength and persevering, not burning calories. I find it so rewarding to punch harder or kick higher and to push myself in every class. I tend to be very introverted but this has lead me to making many unlikely friends.",False,False
