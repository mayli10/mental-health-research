I keep posting the same shit over and over again because I just canâ€™t learn but somehow putting it out there makes it seem more bearable. Shouting into the void I guess?  In this case, Iâ€™M the crappy one. Iâ€™m married. Spouse is poly accepting but Iâ€™m p sure this guy would never be and I still havenâ€™t told him and I canâ€™t fix what Iâ€™ve done to my heart :(  Emotions are so absolutely irrational!!! Why!!!!!",False,True

My not-ex-ex is secretly meeting another woman tomorrow on his 3 day vacation, and I'm not allowed to have feelings because I'm not supposed to know. He wants to have his cake AND eat it (I'm so punny) and I'm over here smiling and starving. Fuck it. I'm so glad to have this to turn to, even if that's fucked up to say. It's literally comforting. He keeps doing little sweet things, too, just to keep me hanging on. This morning he brought me a seashell. Yesterday he wanted to take me to lunch (but I ditched out). He really seems so sweet, so great sometimes, but my psycho ass knows what he's up to because Facebook. And yet here I am.   I just hijacked your post, I'm sorry ðŸ‘Ž",False,False
