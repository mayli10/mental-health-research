I'm 22, so they're starting to push hard for me to get it -- they set up all the equipment and stuff in front of me without even asking if I wanted the test done. I refused it when I was eventually asked.   Always remember that they can't do anything that you don't consent to (except lifesaving stuff if you're incapacitated). You can always say no and they can't force you.",False,True

Just knowing that my weight is going on file even if I don't know what it is gives me so much anxiety. The last time I went, I went for a flu shot and I asked that they not weigh me at all and that was great because I get so paranoid that I have gained weight or that my clothes will be heavy and I'll look like I've gained",False,False
