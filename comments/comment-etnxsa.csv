I think she decided to get thickened up both because it's trendy and because she wanted the power and performance she needed to perform for her fans.  if all the media hype is true.  if she truly felt better thin, but still low energy, there's ways to get more energy, and to eat more calories, without getting fatter.",False,False

Just some things I want to add:   Most people haven't seen Miss Americana yet. We've just got the article that she did the interview for, and what it tells us from the documentary. I'm \*guessing\* (and could be wrong) that there will be a bit more detail in the documentary than what is in the article. You also are making an assumption, as one example, that she would hide food at social events. Maybe she didn't. Maybe she compensated after said events. I don't know. Maybe she goes into more detail of all of the things you list in the documentary, or maybe she will in the future now that she has brought this to light. She even says in the Variety interview that she's uncomfortable talking about all of this, which is completely understandable. Or maybe she chose not to go into detail so as not to give ideas to vulnerable individuals.   There are a lot of things we can speculate. I get the sense that this is something she will speak about again at some stage in her career.",False,False

A real and raw description/discussion is both hard for people to grasp and uncomfortable for them to listen too. I can believe the marketing machine surrounding Swift and Netflix wanted a more...easily digestible narrative.    Her experiences and struggles are absolutely as real and valid as anyone else’s, and we can’t really know her motivations in sharing her story nor how much control she had over the final product. So I guess I have separate feelings toward Taylor Swift the fellow human and Taylor Swiftᵀᴹ the corporate construct.    Here’s hoping this decade will bring ED narratives of increasing depth and diversity into the public consciousness.",False,False

Why advertise yourself as someone who has (had) anorexia, knowing millions of fans will glamorize the illness and see as sane and healthy, for any reason other than self-promotion and profit? Especially in the age of body-positivity as she has gained weight.",False,True

It may be a lot for her to even admit having the ED at all.  Taylor benefits a lot from being thin especially in her 00 days. Yes, the fashion world would have loved her. But I wouldn't say her body was on trend. The thicker hourglass body has been on trend for a while and she was shamed for having a flat arse and no boobs. She was praised for having long legs etc. And she is still conventionally attractive but she wasn't exactly seen as #bodygoals. I think 15 years ago she would have been but Kim Kardashian changed all that. If you don't have a decent ass these days. I don't think you quite make it on the top hot bod list.  Looking back to her 1989 days....I think she would have qualified as having anorexia based on her BMI alone. We don't know if she had professional help and recovered through treatment.  She is still thin now though and I don't think anyone considers her thicc. She still has a ruler shaped body with little curves. She is just healthier.",False,False
