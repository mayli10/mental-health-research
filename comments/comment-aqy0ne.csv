I have the same problem with minimizing my issues when I open up about them and end up not getting the help or support I need.   I did want to say that tracking your intake is a good tool in recovery... I've had to do this every time I've been in treatment. It is NOT about tracking calories or measuring your good though. That would be detrimental. When I've had to track my eating it's more like 'Breakfast: bowl of oatmeal made with milk, spoon of peanut butter, banana/ Lunch: grilled cheese with a bowl of tomato soup/ Snack: apple and a small brownie' etc. You don't need to count and measure.. just track the time you ate, a general idea of what you ate, and if you used any ED behaviours. You can also include thoughts and feelings that came up while eating or afterwards.",False,False

I had a therapist tell me I couldn't be depressed unless I wanted to kill myself so it wasn't that bad. I think there are a lot of therapists out there that shouldn't be.

Why would he/she told someone with ED to track food? That would trigger me too.  Do you have an option to change your therapist? Because honestly, he sounds like he sucks. ",False,False
