You have an injury in that area, so your body produces tons of extra lymph (fluid that carries white blood cells and attacks foreign bacteria) to protect you from infection while the site heals.  The extra lymph causes the affected area to look swollen, which is what you're seeing now.  As your surgery site heals, the lymph will be carried away from the surgery site along with dead foreign bacteria and waste products, you will excrete the excess fluid, and your stomach will go back to normal.",False,False
