Sorry you are going through this. Sending good thoughts your way. I get terrible cramps. I fight falling asleep all day. I have chest pains from anxiety. Anxious and fearful thoughts are nonstop. I am so bloated I feel full eating very little, then at another point in the day I have to fight extreme hunger. My dysmorphia is worse due to water weight. I never know if I will be laughing, making weird jokes, or crying. I crave chocolate and cheeseburgers. That is all.",False,False

As well as the need to purge is not as strong. Almost like my body wants me to absorb all the calories. I have to mentally fight my body to go to the bathroom and purge.  Basically my cycle makes my ED even more stressful than normal.",False,False

And all I want to do is eat, eat, eat. Especially chocolate. If I don’t have *something* chocolate nearby, I literally throw a fit. It’s like my body *screams* for it. And I cramp so, so bad. And I have the worst poops imaginable.   I’m just so goddamn annoying once that time hits. Thank god my cycle is so irregular it’s only a few times a year. Because I can’t handle it *at all*.",False,False
