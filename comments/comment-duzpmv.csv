I grew up with a mom so focused on healthy eating and all organic foods and controlling over my diet that the beginning of adulthood alone with an ed i ate nothing but vegetable sushi rolls and salad in my colleges food court. Even now years later I feel so baffled by roommates and friends snack choices. Like people feel okay eating oreos? I can buy chips for myself? sugary cereal and instant mashed potatoes? so wild how do people do it lol,False,False
