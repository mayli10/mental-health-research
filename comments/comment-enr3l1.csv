Im a male and I have an ed but my family rarely notices which to me is fine because I want nothing in my way of reach my skinny goal but when my sis doesnt eat for a bit they think she is in love or trying to a new diet or something. Its strange to witness but I try not to draw too much attention to my issue. Yet ai fear one day I'll get really bad and still no one will bat an eye to my collapsing body.,False,False

People just assume that if you're a guy you can't have an eating disorder. Yes; it's more common in females, but that doesn't mean *only* females can have an ed. Mental illness is universal, anyone could be fucked up in the head and you'd never know. A lot of people also assume that if you're overweight you can't have an ed. Idk it just really pisses me off when people brush aside others and their mental health because they don't fit a certain standard",False,False
