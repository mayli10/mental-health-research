I'm one of those who speak of *testosterone toxicity"" as a thing, a real, ugly and pervasive thing. How men abuse women, in most climes and cultures, with complicity on all sides! It's to weep for.  Bottom-line is, I totally get how many of my wounded and hurting sisters want to escape the male gaze, all-too-often traumatizing. My heart goes out… What's a fairly recent revelation to me is that alongside the common escape of overeating to cloak the body in an armor of fat and thereby gain invisibility, some choose *under*eating, to shed their womanly shape and hide from men's eyes that contrary way…  It's all sad, so dismally sad! My prayer (and my striving too IRL, daily) is for serenity to all my sisters who suffer masculine ravages and feel forced to flee themselves, concealing their bodies in one futile way or another… *Girls! Ladies! You are not alone.*  **Attached, here is** ***[one tribute, in poetry,](https://youtu.be/dcwFu3X3_ic)*** **of mine…**",False,False

It was so crazy when I realized that everything I'd been trying to get rid of (curvy hips, womanly thighs, even my nearly-nonexistent breasts) are things that are normal part of the adult female body. ""Attractive"" to some people, even. But I don't want them. I want to go back to a time when I would run around and play freely with almost no awareness of my body aside from maybe the way in which my clothing restricted my movement. I want to go back to a time when I didn't have tons of mistakes and baggage and nasty complicated problems and trauma weighing me down. I want to go back to a time when people fell in love with me and treated me with kindness just upon seeing me. I enjoy having sex, but I miss not feeling like a walking sex object 24/7. For me, all of those things point to having a tiny, thin body.",False,False
