Diagnosed AN-B/P 7 years ago (shit...)   I binged and purged my way to my lw but just didn’t eat if I wasn’t purging - like I kept nothing in. But I ate shit loads. I sent my poor mum broke and my brother lost so much  weight because he was a 15 yo 6ft boy and I ate all his foods.   The “50%” thing is so bullshit. I’m a good purger. That’s how I got down to my lw while eating numerous family sized boxes of cereal every single day. Plus when you purge often, your stomach holds food for way longer (delayed emptying) which sucks when you do want to keep it down but just helps the purging.  Now I’m an adult and the same is true but now I do feel like I’m shifting towards bulimia, because I’ll eat outside of purging, sometimes I’ll binge and not purge, and it shows in my weight - I’ve gained 4-5kg in the past year and I’m horrified but I can’t stop - that’s mental illness. You don’t control what your eating disorder morphs into until you choose recovery.   It’s two weeks into January and I’ve spent over $500 on food. $40 a day. I’m financially ruined, AND I got arrested over shoplifting when I tried to save money.    A big part of me is thinking if I don’t choose recovery now I’ll end up obese - which is completely opposite to how I used to think (that recovery would = obesity)",False,False

I've spent so many hours trying to 'hack' my anorexia (for a lack of better term). Meticulously comparing food prices, sorting by 'price per unit' on supermarket websites, buying in bulk on Costco/Amazon, going to shops during discounted hours, at worst, shopping at Lidl. All to reduce cost. Always rice, noodles, pasta, ice cream, biscuits. Still, I could be spending up to £30 a day at times. It's possibly the worst method of self-destruction, including financial.",False,True

I'm really curious how you manage to get \_access\_ to 20000 calories a day, though. I eat around 8000 daily and it gets expensive fast.",False,False

Most of the time, my bulimia is as you described, I still eat outside of it and do some lazy purging. Sometimes I might binge and not purge, so that's how I would get overweight and obese even though bulimic.    Then occasionally I go through periods of extreme restriction and fasting alongside my b/p times, and yah, I lose a lot of weight very fast. But because of my high starting weight, even losing 90 pounds didn't make anyone blink or question that my diagnosis was still bulimia.   Which seems kind of weird.   But at the same time, a big part of the reason for the distinction is because the medical treatment is going to be different when you're underweight, and even more so if severely underweight/underweight and losing. So it makes sense to distinguish on those grounds medically.",False,False
