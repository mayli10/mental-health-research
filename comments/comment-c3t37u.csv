I started to really want nice meals, but it feels so far away and eating raisins and apples is so frustrating.    You can become a ""normal"" eater again.  It takes a lot of work and tears, but it's worth it.  I relapsed but I'll get to eating tasty stuff again...eventually.    I share your frustration.  Eating disorders are grotesque and I know you'll be happier again.  x",False,False

Iâ€™ll never forget I was your same age when I first cried while eating food. It was a stupid handful of grapes at a house I was babysitting in. It was a mixture of hatred for the food, hatred for myself that I needed it to not pass out, sadness that I felt the need to weigh 8 stupid grapes, fear of binging because of it, and so much more.      You are loved, my dear, even if by a stranger. Iâ€™m glad youâ€™re here and Iâ€™m glad you ate that apple, even if it gave you those feelings. Iâ€™m proud of you. ðŸ§¡",False,False
