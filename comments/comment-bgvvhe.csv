I remain unconvinced that it's true.  If fake sugars *did* trigger an insulin response, you'd have a lot more people going into hypoglycemic shock from drinking diet soda on empty stomachs.",False,False

I think the aspartame does it to me, and it seems a lot worse for the non-caffeinated varieties. I believe drinking them can promote ghrelin production, which stimulates hunger, but it's been a bit since I read up on it. I would say that drinking lots of acid is where it's bad for you, especially on an empty stomach, but I've lost almost 30 lbs on the ""drink Diet Coke when you're hungry"" approach so I'm not letting the science stop me.",False,False
