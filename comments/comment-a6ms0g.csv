What scared me into trying to recover was when my lifts started regressing after I'd pushed this for months. :p ,False,False

Muscle wasting isn't just about visible muscles on arms and legs--it's also about organs like your heart and brain. ,False,False

It‚Äôs just the same as engaging in any other unhealthy habit that stems from my ED. I do try to choose high protein foods when I eat...but I also find it difficult to really care about my wellbeing at all (my muscles are pretty far down on my list of concerns lol),False,False

I hate feeling like I'm disappearing or frail but I'm terrified to get soft and fat. So literally all my safe foods are proteins and small amounts of fats.... I'm convinced if I stay in ketosis I'll never get fat. But I also don't eat enough and I know it. üò£ On the one hand I'm not low restricting and fasting like when I was a kid but I'm not exactly healthy either.....,False,False

I get a little giddy seeing muscle definition. But I have the HARDEST time eating at maintenance. I try to eat as much protein as possible but combine that with restricting calories and I might as well forget about ever pooping again. ,False,False

I don‚Äôt want to be bulky but I also don‚Äôt want to be skinny fat and then there‚Äôs the whole thing where I leave a trail of my own hair wherever I go.

My macros come out at about 5% protein if I‚Äôm intuitively eating. Even when I try really hard with nuts and legumes I still barely get above 11 or 12%.   Also I‚Äôm 37 years old and I notice that compared to in my teens and 20s my lean tissue seems to waste away a lot easier. I look more skin and bones at 43kg than I did at 37kg when I was young, but I still have (or at least perceive myself to have, idk I have some bdd) more fat in some areas (hello belly!)  I‚Äôm trying to gain so I‚Äôm less dangerously UW but a big concern I have is not wanting to gain pure fat, especially just getting more belly fat and stay sunken cheeked and bony ribs/spine. I‚Äôm trying to eat as much protein as possible and exercising so I can build muscle (of course then I have to eat more to offset the calories burned üò≠)",False,False

I honestly don't like very many protein rich foods so I tend not to eat them when restricting and eat mostly carbs. Last winter I lost over 30 pounds in a short amount of time eating like that (my diet was probably half sugar, it was terrible) and I got really flabby despite being thinner. May have happened anyway but I definitely attributed it to the lack of protein. ",False,False
