He always phrases comments weirdly and I‚Äôve come to realise he‚Äôs just good at putting his foot in his mouth. It‚Äôs a guy thing. As another commenter said, they just don‚Äôt seem to think things through and articulate them very well before they speak.",False,False

He's negging you!"" But since you are actually good friends with this person, I think he's just somewhat tactless the way many teen boys/young men are. They don't understand the pernicious body insecurities most AFAB people carry, and don't always phrase things well.   However, I know these comments can be haunting even when people don't mean them that way. I'm sorry it's bugging you, but I really doubt he meant to hurt you.",False,False

When I was 16 I had an ex tell me, ""I don't get why you do this, do you even lose weight? I don't see a difference"" when I told him I was restricting. He was trying to make me feel better and show that my weight didn't matter to him, but oof if that didn't make me want to never eat again.",False,False
