This is beginning to sound like classic refeeding syndrome.  This with the bone marrow depletion you've described in your last post - I think you should seek medical attention as soon as possible.

You're body finally has enough nutrients to start repairing itself, so it's making you super sleepy so that it can do its job, as well as trying to conserve energy. You've been experiencing a famine, and the little primal part of your brain is not happy about that and doesn't know how long this food will last. The excessive hunger is also a part of this. Starvation results in reduced hunger signals, and eating again not only revives those cues, but also puts them into overdrive because with the aforementioned repairs taking place, you *need* extra calories. It's unpleasant and most definitely scary, but hypersomnia and hypermetabolism are normal parts of recovery. The best way to make them go away is to listen to them. They'll lay off when you've had enough. This is a great opportunity to learn to listen to your body. Good luck!! &lt;3 ",False,False

Now that you’re fighting to stay alive, it can take a break. Might take a little while to understand what’s happening and that it’s a good thing, I promise it will be worth it.  Congratulations on getting better ❤️❤️❤️",False,False
