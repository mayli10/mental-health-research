I only think Eugenea is an issue because she‚Äôs got 12 year olds saying they want to be as thin as her. She used to/ does say nothing is wrong with her. So, little girls normalize that. I can‚Äôt speak for others. For me the issue isn‚Äôt that her ED is so visible. It‚Äôs that she denies its existence. I was once 13 and on tumblr. All the ED girls on there didn‚Äôt lie and pretend it was all good. They all insisted, ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt have an ED please leave. You don‚Äôt want to develop issues.‚Äù  Wether people want to admit it or not, you emulate people you hang out with or look up to. When you‚Äôre growing and trying to figure out who you are, the influences around you matter. They help shape you.  Nothing is wrong with her having a YouTube channel. I just think it‚Äôs needs to be addressed that it is not normal to be that weight. It‚Äôs not normal for your legs to turn purple and your heart to fail. Even if you don‚Äôt care that she‚Äôs influencing people. It‚Äôs the internet. Every youtuber who does something negative gets flack. She doesn‚Äôt get a pass because of her mental illness. I feel that way about a lot, not all, mental illnesses. Don‚Äôt give me a pass. I‚Äôm responsible for my actions. ",False,False

I definitely felt like mine was a total addiction. And one thing that makes me so angry about this issue is that addiction treatment frequently involves support from people who have been through/are going through the same thing (AA and NA groups, etc), because they can understand and share stories and help each other in a way an outsider can't.   When I was going through treatment, all I wanted was to speak to other people who understood how I was feeling. I felt so, so alone and all the doctors just told me everything I thought or said was 'my ed talking', completely invalidating everything I was trying to explain. When I asked if there were support groups, they said they weren't allowed for eds because we would all get together and sneakily share tips and/or jealously sabotage each other.

Reddit _really_ likes to pat itself on the back for being open and supportive of mental illness and disorders. Depression is discussed a lot, without any judgement (which is good!).

It's not ok to talk about it unless you're making fun of models and telling them to eat a cookie or you're judging someone for being too thin or too thick?   Every disorder has a support group, those who are looking to get better and those who are suffering who need to vent and talk about what they're going through. Every group is allowed to have that except for us. Unless you're ""full blown recovered"" and ""eating healthy"" you're not allowed to talk about it? So I can't talk about my feeling and my struggles and I constantly feel alone and like I should be ashamed and hide what platforms I do have to vent on and when I post I feel bad about it. I shouldn't feel like I'm a freak and like connecting with those who can relate makes me a bad influence on them.  The people making me feel this way are the same people who make my disorder worse. And side note, last I checked she wasn't even open about her ED and her mom said she's sick but not anorexic, so those same people are shaming someone who's I'll for being ill. My best friend has weighed 80lb her entire life, people like them do exist and shaming someone for having an internet presence because she's skinny and that seems suspect isn't ok. These people are hypocrites.  /End rant",False,False

When you ban a drug, you create a black market for it. People will seek out what they crave, legal or not. Instead, places like this are like needle exchanges. We can't stop you from the habit, but we can provide a safer place.  You can't 'catch' an ED and this is how these people seem to think. It's just telling people with EDs to keep it to themselves rather than seek help/support.   Replace ED with another mental affliction and it sounds ridiculous.
