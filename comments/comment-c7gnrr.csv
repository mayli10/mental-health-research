""trying""... then she would insist we eat together and cook bigger meals and watch me finish it and i'd do it so she'd back off but feel absolutely horrible and cry after  &amp;#x200B;  i don't purge bc i have a fear of vomitting but i feel like i'll start if i come clean about my ed and she starts going crazy trying to get me to eat a lot. i don't know if confiding in her is an option at this point.  &amp;#x200B;  i'm 19 but my family always treats me like a baby so :/ there's that. anyways, don't be sorry!! your reply meant a lot to me and i appreciate it. might take you up on the offer soon &lt;3",False,True

Maybe reach out to your sister and admit that you’re struggling? I know you’re not pro-recovery but depending on your age your family may not be able to force you to do anything.   If you’re a minor obviously that makes things 10x more difficult.   Sorry I can’t actually be of much more help but for what it’s worth I’m happy for you to message if you ever need someone to talk to. Hope you’re doing okay-ish despite everything x,False,False
