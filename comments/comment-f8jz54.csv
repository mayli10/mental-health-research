Can't really explain it. Just OCD things I guess lol but I've been fixated on those digits for years.  I'm working on it though. Currently trying to warm up to 6 as a concept...",False,False

I haven't been honest about all of the disordered eating with my psychiatrist but I suspect that most of my ED is a form of OCD in disguise.  My OCD is definitely about control. Weird rituals and compulsions I have. If I can do them ""correctly"" it makes me feel like I'm in control of my life (spoiler alert: I'm definitely not). When I think about it, restriction is often just another ritual for me. When I restrict, I feel like I'm doing something ""good"" and I have my life together.  And yeah I also have tons of weird eating rituals. I don't have the ""something bad is going to happen"" thoughts, I just have intense anxiety and feel like I'm out of control when I eat things in multiples of 3. Because 2 and 4 are good numbers and 3 is not. And other stupid nonsensical shit like that lol.",False,False
