Your body will respond to something high in protein, fat and fiber for the purpose of satiety. Something like a protein shake with chia/flax seeds, protein powder and ur fav nut butter or whole milk (u could also add a banana or half of one if you‚Äôre feeling drained for some extra carbs) as an example.  Congrats babe! Sending u love and support üíï",False,False
