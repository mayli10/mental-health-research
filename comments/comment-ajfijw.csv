Even enjoying something plain is a step in the right direction because at one point (for all of us I'm sure) all food was considered the enemy. I suppose mending a relationship with food is best done one meal at a time and between the choice of eating something plain or not eating at all, I made the better decision :-) I totally get what you mean about the mental fulfillment too, it's all too easy to forget I do have moments when I feel good and positive, just thank you, this was really nice to read.",False,True

Making yourself a meal of something like steamed vegetables, a starchy carb, and a protein source of some kind. Every once in a while I find myself in a stressed-out phase where I just live on easy-to-grab stuff like plain tuna, apples, rice cakes, etc. But it feels really good to take a few minutes to arrange a proper meal, like it's mentally as well as nutritionally satisfying.   I have issues with orthorexia, but it really does make me extremely happy sometimes to sit down to a bowl of veg and like, consciously do something that I know is good for all the cells in my body. I think I get more pleasure from the concept of nourishing / fueling my body with micronutrients and amino acids than I do from the actual taste of food, or maybe it all just gets mixed up together in my mind. A sense of virtue, perhaps? But it doesn't involve any suffering or deprivation, because everything tastes wonderful when you're hungry. I think most people wouldn't believe me if they knew how much I truly enjoy the blandest, plainest foods because it would just be impossible for them to wrap their minds around the fact that say, baked sweet potato is as good as cake to me ‚Äî but even better because it doesn't come with all the sugar and guilt.  Idk, what I'm trying to say is that I see it as a good thing to enjoy food, no matter how bland or plain other people think it might be. Everyone has different tastes, and personally I think it's great to be able to appreciate simple things, to not be dependent upon the dopamine rush most people have come to expect from hyper-palatable junk food. I'm sorry you're struggling and maybe I'm missing the point if this post was only meant to illustrate that, but in terms of your excitement about food, it's not ridiculous or pathetic. I can relate &lt;3",False,False
