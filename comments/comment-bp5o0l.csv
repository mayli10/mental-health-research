People who work there will be pushy/rude when they ask what you need if they deem you are taking too long. And if you’re in a city where there aren’t a lot of supermarkets it’s even more so, since the stores are smaller and specialties, so they want you in and out. If you’re from America it’s kind of hard to adjust (and I imagine it’s the same for many other countries) - especially since you’re still adjusting to the foods they have too and may not have a list.",False,False

I permanently lost 4-6 lbs in my first 5 days of studying abroad because of the walking (20k steps a day!) and carefully balancing my money on coffee, coke zero, and food.   ED stresses aside, I sincerely hope you love your study abroad experience, and please remember to be kind to yourself! (I myself am heading back to where I studied last year in about 5 weeks because I loved it so much hehe)",False,False

When I studied abroad this really beautiful skinny girl always made omelettes and asparagus for dinner when she wasn’t out and I started following suit.  It’s hard not to just buy a baguette and/or a sandwich on a baguette, an almond croissant, and an orangina every day... but enjoy the fresh veggies if you can! Local ingredients are everything!   And go out for a few salade chèvre chauds and vin blancs... and a couple almond croissants because they’re amazing.   Let me live vicariously through you (while affirming French stores are incredibly overwhelming and you can’t take your time in them like you can in American stores, which is funny because you spend like 3-4 hours in French restaurants or cafes)",False,False
