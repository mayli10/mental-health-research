I can’t get over the beauty standards I grew up with. Like, I remember people saying does this make my butt look big? And I internalized it and hated my body. All I wanted was a thigh gap and even at my lowest I never had it. Now it’s cool to be thicc because of the kardashians and instagram but I can’t erase the years of programming that said my body wasn’t good enough.",False,False

In Africa they worship curves, they try to gain weight on purpose. It's out of its origin/place, yet Westerners use it. In the Western world it has negative connotations if you have an ED. Relatively speaking, if you have gained weight and someone's noticed, they won't classify that it was too low in the first place and it still is, if that is the case for you",False,False
