So using pharmacological interventions for weight with no regard as to how it effects the patient physically or mentally... is irresponsible. It’s bound to cause rather a distrust of the doctor, a lack of medication compliance, and very possibly a total relapse.   If it’s a lack of appetite, plenty of meds stimulate appetite. Yet doctors don’t think about the mental consequences or long term well being of these patients. If somebody with AN is that bad, inpatient exists. Pharmacological restraints are not acceptable in this day &amp; age.... at least not overtly. Makes me disgusted.",False,False

We sound similar, so I can empathize. I’m sorry things have been so hard, that must be so challenging and frustrating!   Do you feel like seeing another psychiatrist would be more productive? :( if you are feeling suicidal or are unable to function minimally they have an ethical responsibility to treat those things!",False,False

Once I have a better baseline mood overall, (and don't feel like jumping off a cliff every 5 minutes), as well as just being able to sleep, I can actually focus on recovering. Right now, my important issue is just being able to function in society, after that I can address my PTSD and anorexia, before that it's not even productive to try as I'm not at a functional level.  My psychiatrist knows this, but is more focused on preventing further weight loss than just getting to a stable place right now, most likely due to her main focus being eating disorders. I've been seeing her for 4 or so years so she is aware of what I should look like, and what I currently look like. I'm not saying I don't need to treat my eating disorder (eventually) but I can't focus due to lack of sleep/PTSD/depression so until I can finally sleep, it's not productive for me to treat anything else.  I'm just frustrated overall at what's going on, and I needed to rant.",False,True

While those meds can be helpful for people who don’t have appetite (Anorexia) I doubt their effectiveness long term for Anorexia Nervosa.  I understand your doctors approach of focusing on the eating disorder though, over the mood symptoms. Eating disorders usually develop in reaction to mood or affective instabilities. So, if you don’t treat the ED, you could present with a disorder you don’t truly have - because it’s the ED.  For example, I have BPD/PTSD. When I was restricting? My mood was the best it’s been (ever....). It felt like the best mood stabilizer I’ve ever had, and I was energetic, engaged and productive. When I recovered and my intake and weight increased, I suddenly had my horrible depression return, my overly reactive mood (I was a PSYCHO), and horrible anxiety.   Essentially, my AN was a band aid for my symptoms. So had my doctor not addressed my AN, there would be almost nothing to treat except day to day stress. Your doctor seems to be doing the same, which, even if you don’t want to or aren’t comfortable with it, is the most productive.   They do the same with addictions, as substance abuse and the ups/downs can create symptoms that aren’t organically a part of the problem. So when they treat the substance abuse, they are then able to more clearly see the problem at hand.",False,False
