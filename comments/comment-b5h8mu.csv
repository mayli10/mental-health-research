I stuff my face like a pig and I can't stop even if everyone's looking at me and telling me to stop.   Even worse, when they tell me to stop I eat even more (especially if I was going to stop right before they told me it was enough)...",False,False

My parents only ever had wild salmon, broccoli, almonds, tomatoes, berries etc. in the house. At the absolute worst there might be some bread and butter, couscous, brown rice etc. A late night binge would be on some leftover marinated spicy chicken breast with grilled veggies (soooo delicious!) that my dad made, or bowlfuls of his spicy lentil or fresh watercress soup. If I was being bad maybe some salty macadamia nuts.  I wasn't used to being surrounded by trash. It's genuinely making me reconsider marriage to him because I can't be surrounded by that gross crap. And he needs it for his kids (from a former marriage). I wouldn't feed my children junk but it's his decision. ",False,False

I am genuinely reconsidering the marriage because a healthy clean home (including clean foods) is so important to me and he is completely oblivious about that.  He has ice cream, crappy supermarket bread, processed crappy meats, biscuits, beer at home. He thinks drinking a litre of fruit juice is healthy! Being around all that crap upsets me so much.",False,False

I love living with my fianc√© but that man can EAT and we love going out to eat at new places and trying new beers and wines and stuff. I do great through the week most of the time because I make most of those meals but weekends get pretty out of hand sometimes.

In a way just awknowledging the fact that I have SA really helped. I usually take a moment before I go into social situations and remind myself that theres going to be some moments where I feel anxious and thats ok. And when the feeling does arise I try to stick with it and let it pass. Hope this is helpful, ik social anxiety is a bitch. Good luck with everything üíú",False,False

Everytime my family visits it's eating out for every meal. And I'm talkin aaaalll the fried foods and pizza buffets. Literally my Dad will ask ""what's for dinner?"" not an hour after a huge lunch. It astonishes me.  My advice? Try reminding yourself that the binge food is still there at home. You can indulge later if you do better during the outing. Or take the bread home for later. I find that the longer I can put off eating something, the more successful I am at not eating it at all.",False,False
