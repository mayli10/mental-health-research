Underweight like 15–16 BMI underweight. She was there alone, and was so weak that she had to ask for help getting the bagged groceries into her cart and out to her car. I felt bad for staring, but I felt like I was the only person in the checkout line who understood what was going on. Maybe I was wrong, and it wasn’t an ED, but I felt it in my gut. I so desperately wanted her to make eye contact with me so I could send her a telepathic message of sympathy and love.!&lt;",False,False
