Inpatient is generally where 1:1 monitoring occurs, we didn’t do that where I worked, but you can be on 1:1 at other treatment locations I’ve heard",False,False

Some make you talk to them the whole time too. Same principle applies for shower. So no they aren’t looking at you (in my experience) but can hear if you’re engaging behaviours. Some places won’t let you flush the toilet.  2 - inpatient usually is more medically unstable and requires frequent bloods and stuff generally all meals are prepared for you too; residential my understanding is you’re more involved in some meal prep and / or menus. There’s usually much more therapy at resi too as in inpatient the belief is you’re too cognitively impaired from malnourishment,False,False
