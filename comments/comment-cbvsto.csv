I never buy cookies anymore... don't keep 'em in my house. Very dangerous food for me. :'(  Around Easter time, I was at a gathering some acquiantances were having, and someone brought a plate of these big, homemade, chocolate chip cookies that had M&amp;Ms in them and, oh, to make 'em even more wonderful/horrible, *each had an Oreo cookie inside of them*. As far as cookies go (far), these were some pretty fucking glorious, delicious specimens of cookies, let me tell you. They were so. Fucking. Amazing.  ""I've been doing so well, and people here have compliemented me on my recent weight loss, so no one will think I'm awful if they see me eat just one, right?""   ""I'm never at parties like this, surely it's ok to have a second...?""  Next thing I know, I've probably eaten like six or seven of them throughout the evening. (They were big, and rich, and a lot of calories.) I managed to space them out and I don't think anyone there would have thought anything of it, but I remember being so worried that someone may have noticed how many I ate (like maybe a third of the platter?!) and might have been judging me, thinking things like ""Oh, she's gonna get so obese again, like she was before!""   So yeah, even the shame and fear of judgement from being seen eating them wasn't enough to stop me. I hated myself for eating all those stupid but delicious cookies... Husband insisted that I didn't eat that much and no one cared, but damnit, it sure FELT like I had eaten like a damn pig. :(",False,False
