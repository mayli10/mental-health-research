My parents noticed too but again they somehow think Im just losing weight because Im busy in college. They've been forcing me to eat alot of food and I had to fake school activites so I can skip meals with them and eat alone in my room with my own safe food,False,True

Since I'm painfully introverted, I rely on others to come up to me for social interaction. Of course people tend to do that more when I'm considered more attractive (I'm not trying to dog on them. I guess it's just human nature/vanity). I'm twice as productive when I am losing weight, and I feel prideful when I've eaten 90-100% 'clean' (however I may define it) for a whole week or month or however long. I'm also more confident in my aloneness strangely. Like when things are going well in these regards, I feel self-sufficient. Powerful, even. I don't worry about being alone. At least in the short term, it's so liberating. When I lose my shape and nice skin from weight gain and have headaches and fogginess from eating poorly, I lose this confidence and liberation so, so instantly. So of course, sticking with what I know makes me feel better is the natural choice, no matter what. ",False,False
