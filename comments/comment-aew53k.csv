Idk the scientific reason for it, but i think it’s like if your body doesn’t think it’s going to stay hydrated, it’ll hang onto that water?  And also the extra water diluted the excess sodium and flushes that from the body, which is the original reason for water bloating.",False,False

Also keep up with electrolytes, because overdoing it with water can flush out too much essential vitamins. You need stuff like potassium especially for your heart and other muscles. ",False,False

Yeah, I'm honestly trying to not low restrict anymore. I'm not allowing myself to do multiday fasts, and I want to eat around 800-900 to have a 500kcal deficit per day to make it easier not to purge. It's just terrifying to come back and see three months of weight loss (Aug to December, 107-92) completely undone. And I didnt even think about that  probably during the actual holiday days, I was probably like 116, or something from food, and that dropped, at least. And you stay safe as well! Thank you for the reassurance. I was really low and depressed this morning. ",False,True
