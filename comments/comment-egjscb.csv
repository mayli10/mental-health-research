As far as I know, periods are 'triggered' by a drop in progesterone. This happens naturally in women's hormone cycles, but is interrupted at low weights - which is why women who are underweight lose their period. But if you are taking a birth control with progesterone in it, and then have a week of sugar pills or pill free days (like a lot of hormonal birth control pills do) that would replicate the hormone cycle that would cause a period.   So, if you are now taking the pill but weren't during your other relapses, then I would say it's the pill.  (If you're using some other type of birth control, then I don't know enough to make a guess at what is going on... sorry)",False,False
