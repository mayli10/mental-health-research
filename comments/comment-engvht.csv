I looked into it and it says an average woman should 21-25 and an average man should get 30-38. I’ve never had a problem with too much fibre, rather the opposite, so I did a quick google search and too much fibre will cause bloating, gas and constipation but it can be relieved by increasing water intake. You are consuming 50g which is definitely more but it says here that it gets really uncomfortable at 70g. Just be careful and maybe try lowering your intake slowly so you can find a good amount for your body per day. Or maybe even try upping your water intake unless you already get a lot.",False,False

Used to eat up to 50g and my fart game was off the charts. My main concern would be if your digestive system can cope, and also if the regularity and density of your bms is affected. If you're getting diarrhea or very soft stool try to cut back a bit.",False,False
