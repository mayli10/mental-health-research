Tbh I just skimmed their website for the first time and other than having gone to med school, nowhere did it say credentialed dietitian. Also I got none of the “individualized treatment plan” they promised on the website. Just a consultation with my vitals and blood drawn, then given a weeks worth of bars and shakes... I’ve never been to a clinic for weight loss before but I figured that was pretty standard. I just hate that the shakes made me feel sick and (tw) but I was expecting a script that I forgot to specifically ask for so never got. Dieting sucks and idk if it was I was already down or if it’s the shitty diet doing it but I cried like all day today. I just wanna be skinny and not hate life.",False,True

I don't know a single dietitian that would ever recommend calories that low, and I am a dietetic intern surrounded by experienced RD's.",False,False
