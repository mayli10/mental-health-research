Like I don't have a personal story to share about this but  OP, whether or not people intervene is only partially affected by how much weight you lose. You could have severe health problems and not have people do anything about it if they are unobservant or just choose not to do anything even if they notice your weight loss.",False,False

Please don‚Äôt do it until someone intervenes. I was a severely underweight middle and high schooler (Trigger warning: BMI 11-12), and no one ever did shit for me. My parents, to this day, don‚Äôt even know I have an ED. The closest I ever got to intervention was also random strangers telling me they were worried.

Depending on what you mean by intervention, and depending on your particular social circle/family/whoever, it could be that no one will do anything until you're in really terrible danger.   Like I have a buttoned-up, secret-keeping sort of family, and they stayed so in denial that they failed to recognize they were dealing with a severely anorexic middle schooler. Even friends and classmates and any of the parents I interacted with didn't dare question my behavior (although my friends eventually started lamenting my dropping weight and begging me to stop calling myself fat). Like, the closest I got to intervention was random strangers telling me I should see a doctor. I'm just lucky I ""snapped out of"" that level of illness on my own. Many people don't.  Either way, stay safe, friend.",False,False
