For me it's like... i just feel like the rules don't apply? Like, it's always scared the hell out of me to hear about other people being so thin but when I was at my thinnest I was certain I was fine and nothing would happen to me. but then I was in the hospital with organs threatening to fail and a hell of an arrhythmia and the doctors were telling my parents not to get their hopes up. It was a bit of a wake up call. I still haven't fully ditched that way of thinking (I'm still adamant that I just don't *need* a BMI of 18.5 and will be *totally* fine once I get to 16.5).

To be honest, even though I keep hearing stuff about EDs and low BMIs being dangerous, it actually doesnt really... register??

First time around with anorexia I was at a lower weight and had some really nasty soreness going on because of exercising and walking.  This time I'm not as underweight, but that part's still exposed enough to be rubbing on my knickers.  I wear a panty liner because it's not as harsh as material.  It still gets sore and itchy as hell when it tries to heal itself.  Probably TMI there as well, but there sometimes it's like an ED takes away any dignity you've got.  Yeah, it's not something I'll miss when I fill up these butt cheeks.  The saggy skin looks like the butt equivalent of National Geographic tits.",False,False

I noticed the same thing when I first got down near my lowest weight two years ago, and it *seriously* freaked me out. I'm not in the habit of checking out my naked ass in the mirror, but I did because I was about to go in for a colonoscopy and knew I'd be on full view for a room full of medical staff.  I am back at that weight now (BMI 16) and while it's not as dramatic as what you're describing, I do have a disturbingly empty space where I think there should be a tighter crease. My ass has always been flat as a pancake, but now my butt cheeks just sort of droop apart -- it's a bit nauseating.   Also... I sort of have these wrinkles/creases under my butt??! Like my ass has just totally deflated and sagged down instead of tightening up as it gets smaller? I really don't understand this considering I've never been overweight.",False,False
