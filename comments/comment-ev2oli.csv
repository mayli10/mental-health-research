My mom attended two sessions and the whole time refused to listen and just went on about how she feels personally disrespected by my actions. My dad just didn't go at all. They both then decided they were too busy and I finished therapy alone, despite the heavy protests of my team who said they need to be there.",False,True

I believe it was ultimately out of their own fear of not knowing what else to do to “protect” me. The grounding, the no phone or internet - all because they weren’t sure what/who was influencing me and so all ties were cut. Is there a school counselor you could see? Maybe see if there are any group sessions you could attend? Suffering alone is not the answer and I know we’re all here to help you as much as we can",False,False

It sounds like a pretty unhelpful response. Did they not receive any education themselves as part of your treatment, or were they unwilling to listen? In particular, the  ‘you’re too smart for this’ would seem to reveal a serious lack of understanding. This isn’t about intellect or intelligence. For me there’s a definite disconnect between my logical mind and my emotional mind - a lack of smarts is not the problem. Actually, I’d be wiling to bet that on average we’re a higher performing and more intelligent population than the ‘normal’ population.    If you think they’d be willing to listen and learn, perhaps a counselor could help explain things to them? There’s also family resources from NEDA and NAMI in the USA. My parents went a few times to a NAMI support group for families when I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2, and I think they found it helpful to talk to other parents. They started trying to understand what I was going through and what might help in a way they hadn’t before. But sometimes parents just won’t listen and don’t understand...and that’s a really hard place to be. You absolutely deserve care and support as you find your way forward and I really hope people in your life will step up to help you find that &lt;3",False,False
