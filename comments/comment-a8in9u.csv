Moms are often responsible for the beginnings of their daughter's eating disorder, whether or not they know or acknowledge it. One of my first memories is my mom tell her she was glad it was soccer season again because I was getting chubby. I was 4 and she was the one feeding me so.... but yeah. It didnt get better from there. Hang in there and recognize that your mom probably has a really fucked-up relationship with food and whether or not she is trying to fuck up your relationship with food as well, she is. It took me until my teenage year to recognize that my mom has weird restrictive eating habits and has a strange habit of over feeding her kids, maybe as a way to make herself feel better by comparison? It's awful and it's not your fault. You're not 200 lbs and not even close. But, even if you were, your mom shouldn't ever make you feel bad about your body like that. I guess my only advice is to try to always remember that these moments say a lot more about her than they do about you.",False,False
