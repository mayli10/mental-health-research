I hate my dumb brain)  I went clothes shopping with my friend who's 5'2 and thin today. I've gone down from a women's XL top and size 16 pants to a S/M top and 6/8 pants, and now she and I shop in roughly the same section because she buys baggy clothes. Hell, she was shopping in the men's medium and large sections while I was looking at men's smalls/extra smalls and she kept showing me things and it was all I could do to not snap at her that I already own a million shirts in those sizes that are way too big and I just want some damn things that fit me.   Clothes shopping sucks both because my body still looks so bad (I think some of that is just loose skin now too, fml) and because most of the women's clothes in my size are too short because I'm 5'10. I love being tall, I absolutely do not want to be shorter and still honestly want to be taller, but trying to find long sleeve shirts today was the worst because the sleeves of every single damn thing I tried fell an inch or two above my wrist. I definitely only can wear pants that are marked as longs because the same thing happens with them otherwise. And the weirdest problem I've discovered with pants: they don't make size 6s for people with feet as big as mine. I wear a women's 12 shoe. I like skinny jeans and other tight to the leg pants but now it seems like 1/3 of the pants I try on won't even go over my damn feet. I'M 5'10 DAMMIT IF I HAD SIZE 7 FEET LIKE MY 5'2 FRIEND I WOULD LOOK ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS.  Maybe the best part of shopping with my friend was afterward. We went back to her house and she went through her closet a bit and offered me some clothes she didn't want anymore because we have similar fashion sense. I always thought of her as so small but now we can share clothes. She offered me a pair of size 5 jeans! I think they would've been a bit small in the waist, and they would've been ridiculously short because of the 8 inch height difference so I didn't bother trying them on, but the fact that she thinks I can wear a size 5 is amazing. I ended up taking a few sweaters and a brand new North Face brand parka for free (!!!) and I'm super stoked about it. The parka is especially great because it's a women's medium and the sleeves are miraculously long enough and it should be warm enough for the rest of the winter. My old parka is an XL and while I've still been wearing it, it's ridiculously baggy and some gusts of cold air always manages to get into the space inside it. I'm so stoked that I don't have to drop major cash on a new coat when I have no idea what my size will be at the end of this winter, much less next winter or winters after that due to my history of prolonged periods of binging.  Also, I ate 4 pints of diet ice cream but stayed under 1200 calories yesterday and somehow managed to not be up at my weigh in this morning despite the near 100g of fiber I ended up consuming. Overall, today was a good day despite the irresponsible spending.",False,True
