Even if you gain some weight, most if not all of it will be water weight instead of actual weight/fat – water retention and bloating is really common when upping your intake! Besides, eating more can also cause your metabolism to increase, and you also naturally expend more energy on non-exercise activity (eg. your body might fidget more).   If it helps, I went on holiday a few weeks ago and ate whatever I wanted for about 2 weeks; I neither binged nor restricted, ate loads of good food, probably 2500kcal or more every day. And I didn’t gain weight! In fact, the scale showed that I lost one pound or so, although that might be due to natural fluctuations.   It’s okay to let yourself have more food. 2000 really sounds okay – I know you might get this a lot, but you’re really young, you probably *need* to eat above “maintenance” just to maintain health, to let your body grow like it needs to. Energy will go into developing your bones, organs, brain, etc. Not just stored as fat.   Sending all the love &lt;3",False,False
