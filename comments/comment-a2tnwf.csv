I eat them rarely, often at a mid-nice restaurant i'll get a burger or veggie burger.   I think a lot of people avoid/fear condiments and a burger with cheese and ketchup and mayo etc. likely worries people aiming to ""eat healthy"" and is part of the bad rap? And then adding the cheese in general is something someone could worry is too much fat and maybe a double dose of protein when you can get calcium etc from vegetables. IDK. Maybe this is just how I understand my ED logic. Sorry   But I also kinda traffic in being a cool-girl who can eat so liking burgers makes sense for me. I also LOVE cheese.",False,False

I use 96% ground beef (140 cal per 4 oz), usually the bun is 110-150 calories, american cheese tastes best on burgers imo (45-60 cal depending on brand), lettuce, tomato, onion, jalapano (10-15 cal total), mustard (5 cal or negligible- if I even use it)  I have 2 saved in my fitness pal of homemade burgers and itâ€™s 340 and 369. If I add avocado itâ€™d prob be around 400.  Not bad at all imo. Itâ€™s the fries that get you. I get the ore-ida fast food French fries that are like 130 calories for 27 fries.   Iâ€™m all about  eating delicious foods but finding ways to eat them for the least calories. It is a little better with the 93% ground beef but not better enough to eat more calories ",False,False

Fast food generally uses lower-quality ingredients, which makes it affordable, and therefore available to people in poverty; poverty is linked to obesity; etc etc... no idea if this all is true, its just one thought spiral I went down when I read your post. I also think because plant-based eating had a big surge in popularity in the past several years, there's been more bashing of meat-heavy and processed food-heavy diets.  I'm personally super thankful that meat is a safe food for me, and when bread is out lettuce is a good bun replacement.",False,False
