Like it is entirely possible in 200 years people will look back at our knowledge of nutrition the way we look at people in the Middle Ages who used leaches as a cure all. I donâ€™t think you should fast because you think it is some great body hack or will cure cancer but if fasting works for you like I donâ€™t think there is any evidence to prove that itâ€™s harmful, I think it could be individual.  That being said for me personally one time I fasted, and then I binged (although honestly it was like a packet of lollies so not massive or anything) and I had a seizure and it was the most fucking terrifying thing so you if you are going there fast like I think you should def be careful and have a plan and maybe avoid if it sets you off onto a restrict binge cycle",False,False

I would say to just listen to ur body, hydrate well and keep dem electros balanced! If it means anything to u, I usually cap at the week mark if Iâ€™m doing an extended fast",False,False

What day is the max youd cap it at? I'm  lowkey smart about it and I keep my electrolytes balanced , but I'm afraid that a longer fast will be damaging/ wont result in significant weightloss.",False,True

I think the 21 day fasts are insane for sure but 3 day fasts always make me feel really refreshed. I take vitamin supplements, hydrate a bunch, etc. My skin always gets so clear too ðŸ˜…",False,False
