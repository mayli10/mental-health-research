Those things don’t sound healthy. Kind of like chubby chasers bringing their SO food to keep them fat. He’s saying things to keep you thin. He’s actively telling you how much to eat. People can fuck with your mind, when you care about them you ignore it. I’m not saying that is the case. Just saying what you describe sounds not so good. ",False,False

He expresses sometimes he likes how “tiny” I feel when we have sex, but he never stopped being attracted to me and wanting to have sex with me even at my highest weight when I felt like shit.   If he really loves you then that transcends however you look! My partner has said that he misses when I was “curvier and softer” and he’s more worried about my state of mind as I lose more weight than anything else (my gw is around 95, I’m very short). Also it’s funny how his comments about missing “curves” clash with his praise of my thinness when we have sex, lol.   Tl;dr most guys are attracted to multiple body types and they don’t really know what they want other than that when they love you they want YOU as you, however that may look. ❤️",False,False

Stuff like “I love your hipbones because they look so feminine” (like, I’m underweight, most healthy weight women don’t have hipbones that stick out this much), “I like how you’re smaller than me” (he’s really skinny himself), and things about food that make me feel guilty. I often have smoothies for dinner (a safe food for me when I can count the exact cals) and decided to have some chicken too. He looked at the amount I took (which wasn’t big) and asked “Are you sure you can eat all that AND your smoothie?” I said yes and he said “I don’t think you’ll eat that much, maybe get a smaller piece”. It felt like he didn’t want me to eat that much even though I know that’s not what he was saying.   I don’t really have any advice, just wanted to say that I can empathize. :( My bf accidentally triggers me all the time. ",False,False
