The thing that really helped me was to let yourself get hungry, then eat what you are craving. ""being hungry is like being in love, you know it when it hits"" I think is the quote.  The first time around somehow I missed the ""let yourself get hungry"" part and basically binged for a week - because I'd see a snickerdoodle cookie (or whatnot) and wanted one, and thought ""well that's my intuition!"" and I gained a bunch of weight. Then I reread and thought ""ohhh. You eat what you're craving WHEN YOU ARE HUNGRY."" And that worked.  Between that advice and the book Brain Over Binge, I've had a vast improvement in symptoms over the last couple months. I binged once in the past month and maybe like twice the month before? Huge improvement over 1+ time a week. ",False,False

Food is so intimidating and i hate that full feeling. I’ve gotten better with sitting with it but it just makes me feel fat and gross. I have my meal plan from php still and made something that would fit it but it made me so full I don’t wanna do it again lol. ,False,False

I drink a lot of water and track it by using an app called “plant nanny.” I noticed that when I drink a lot more water the hunger I feel dampens tremendously and I don’t overeat as often when I’m properly hydrated. When I’m craving food, I’ll ask myself if I’ll be content with a banana or a kiwi, and if not, I know it’s just cravings for unhealthy foods and not actual hunger. If you slip up and eat a bit more than you’d hoped, don’t worry about it. It’s super early into your journey and ya gotta be kinder to yourself. Your body and brain are figuring things out:)",False,True
