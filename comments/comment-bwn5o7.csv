Mental issues/disorders/health is something a lot of us tend to make into our own little isolated islands but that just breeds bad things in the relationship.  Be open and honest, tell them you're just worried, and you want to be there for them just like they're there for you.",False,False

I think everything is triggering at the beginning of recovery, avoiding them isn’t a given because that’s impossible unless you want to cut off all human contact and refrain from looking a people/eating food. To each their own i guess, but i’d say deliberately being away from someone you love in a stage of recovery is detrimental.",False,False
