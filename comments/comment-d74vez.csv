I'm so glad it worked out for you! üíñBut like someone else pointed out, you may wanna try and use it as little as possible since it can cause liver problems if you do it too habitually.

I used to abuse dramamine (diphenhydramine = ingredient in benadryl) and OTC sleep aids in my teens. Now have liver damage.  I remember thinking that the things I did to my body didnt matter because I wasnt going to live long enough to deal with the chronic health effects of my condition anyway. I was shortsighted.

At all. Also benzo withdrawls can cause seizures and shit, so from a personal recommendation, really wouldn't recommend. I quite like some weed after caps/stims to chill you out, and you can kinda sleep a bit better. Otherwise maybe look into herbal options?

Or asjust your dosing schedule so that you are frontloading the day...ie dose in the morning/afternoon and coast into evening so you aren't as picked up when you are trying to wind down.  Hot showers/tea can help. I have good luck with kava and valerian root. A bedtime routine that reminds your body it's time to sleep can be helpful.,False,False
