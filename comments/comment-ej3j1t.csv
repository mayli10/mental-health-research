I had an ex who was into a body type that I didnt have and it was very difficult to not feel *literally* deformed. He talked about it like it was no big deal. I would ask him why he would even go on a date with me to get to know me if I was so far from his type (i was trying to give him a chance to fix what he said by somehow taking it back) and he just doubled down saying that with clothes on I looked more like i had the body type he prefers. I was heartbroken. I still am when I think about it.   I do want to make clear, which I realize that I didnt in my first post, is that I do see those who are bigger as beautiful and worthy. I think Lizzo is one of the most beautiful people ever. I don't want to look like that because I have disordered thoughts and my own self worth is wrapped up in things that dont matter, like size and weight. I know nothing I'm saying is going to help, but I am sorry if my post made you feel worse even for a moment. and I hope that one day we will both get away from the thoughts that warp the way we see ourselves‚ô•Ô∏è",False,False
