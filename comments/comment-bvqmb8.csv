Me and my boyfriend have been together for 3 years. I started developing an ED one year ago.  I came clean to him about my binges and fasts two months ago.  I didn't know how to approach it, so I wrote him a letter with my story.  Gave it to him, and that was for me the beginning of the end.  Now I feel like not only am I hurting myself, I'm also making him suffer.  If that's not enough, I started purging and he still doesn't know.  He is concerned about me, at first he asked me to write him whatever I ate.  Then, he got so fed up with me and my depression and basically gave me an ultimatum: if you want to stay with me you have to recover and seek help for your mental health because I can't deal with you like that, and that was one month ago.  I regret telling him, and I hate that my Ed is ruining my relationship.  People without eds don't understand.  Sometimes he begs me to eat when we're together. He loves me, and doesn't want to see me die, of course, but if I DON'T WANT TO EAT I DON'T.  My experience sucks but you do you girl, good luck. ❤️",False,False
