I was a huge binger due to the lack of available food at home and would secretly buy food and eat it in my room constantly, but I didn't really gain that much weight and I don't think my headspace was that messed up.  I think I developed it more as a result in adulthood after. I turned 18, moved out and then was like hey I should stop eating crap all the time - but then it definitely got taken a step too far and turned into restricting and eating very little. I also didn't feel much control in my life as a kid and a feeling of control with my my eating as an adult has been a big factor in my restricting. I'm still not super obsessed with my weight or anything, it's the feeling of control I am kind of addicted to as an adult with my eating and restricting.",False,False

When I did eat I mostly preferred high calorie foods that weren't very filling because they would enable me to eat enough without getting full.

Went through a VERY brief bulimic “phase” in sophomore year in high school. It didn’t last long and soon I started just binging and eating whatever I wanted and not really caring. In college I had a good meal plan so I was eating waaaaay more than what’s even considered to be healthy, (I’m talking well over 3000+ calories a day with a very sedentary lifestyle) couple that with binge drinking and being depressed and you get weight gain. At my highest I was 145-150 lbs. eventually I got down to 130.   Last year was the year that I just couldn’t live like that anymore. I hated my body and how I looked and would cry getting on the scale every day. I ended up becoming addicted to coke because it’s a stimulant that curved my appetite. I got down to 105 and that’s the lowest I’ve ever been. The crazy thing was, I HATED coke. I hated the way it made my heart race and put me in a bitchy mood all day, I hated that I felt like I needed it. (Thankfully I’ve been clean for months)   It’s really tough being out of my teens and being an “adult” that has this kind of a problem. I tried to talk about it with a former friend of mine and he told me to “grow up. Anorexia is for attention seeking high school girls.” And it really made me feel like shit. I feel like I’m just kidding myself into believing I even have an eating disorder now. I’m not thin, I’m not big either, so there’s no validation.

I was younger and very stupid to let it affect me the way it did, so I can’t say me being in a relationship with a male had any sort of effect on the start of this all, just depression in general. But I do think that if I’d always surrounded myself with other girls I’d have been a lot more self conscious and competitive about my looks, and I think my ED would’ve started much sooner, and for reasons 100% related to my body.
