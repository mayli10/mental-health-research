And make it kinda low cut so all the attention is in your boobs ;) lol that’s what I do! Then HAUL ASS INTO THE HOT TUB SO NO ONE CAN SEE YOUR THIGHS!!!

A couple summers ago I went to the pool with my boyfriend and his friend and friend’s girlfriend, who is beautiful and has an amazing figure and flat stomach, the works. I felt like such a fat disgusting cow. I weigh less than I did then and I STILL feel like a fat disgusting cow. Gotta be ready for summer. Sorry about the hot tub :(",False,False

If you don’t want to buy one I think wear the high-waisted swim suit and maybe tell your boyfriend you threw out all your others and were planning on buying new ones for the summer? I think it’s better to feel comfortable in what you’re wearing, even if he doesn’t like the style!  Hope you have fun and enjoy yourself no matter what happens:)",False,False
