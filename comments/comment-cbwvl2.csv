So you can lean into fueling the fire, or stop yourself. You're at the crossroads. Make good choices.",False,False

My ED has never been logical, it just exists as itâ€™s own shitty reality. By IF he meant me eating OMAD. Done it before, it just makes me want to keep fasting or b/p once a day.",False,True

Reread what you wrote:  &gt; **Iâ€™ve** called **myself** fat in front of my BF a few times and every time **he has reassured me Iâ€™m not**, but last night he just told me to try fasting for weightloss.   I think you've repeatedly come to him with what you perceive as a problem, and he's come to you with a possible solution.   IF doesn't have to be disordered. It's one of the best ways I have to combat binging. At my high weight, my worst binges (5-lb bags of Starbursts, 12 ct sugar cookies, etc) always happened after 10pm. IF helped me with that.   If you want reassurance and not solutions, you should probably talk to your boyfriend and let him know that you know HOW to lose weight, but it's the ""I still love you"" reassurances you need, not advice.",False,False

Especially with my history of EDs lol. Heâ€™s an extremely good guy so Iâ€™m sure he means well heâ€™s just clueless lmao",False,True

My bf does the same thing bc he hates when I say mean things about myself. little does he know it doesnâ€™t matter how much I lose Iâ€™m never really happy with my body ðŸ˜­ Iâ€™m sorry though, itâ€™s such a tough thing to share with someone who doesnâ€™t quite understand it",False,False
