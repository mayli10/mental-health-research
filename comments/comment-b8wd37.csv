Is there like...  i feel like there's some kind of subclinical hypercaloric malnutrition that's giving people what I call ""brain-worms""  Or do you think it's that the Powers That Be say ""eat less, move more"" and don't say ANYTHING about insulin or micronutrient density",False,False

I usually eat at 4pm and I kinda find the idea of eating a little gross until 3:45ish. Honestly I can wait until about 8pm before I actually get hunger signals, and after a while of doing IF, the hunger isn't ravenous binge hunger anymore. I used to eat really crappy food during my eating period but after about 6 months of being consistent, I can go until 8 or 9pm and be stoked about just having a salad! (A large salad, but usually pretty low cal, satisfying, and I get really existed about eating it!) ",False,False

If you eat, especially carbs, it triggers an insulin response that makes you crave more food to keep your body going. It‚Äôs why some people who do IF say they don‚Äôt get hungry‚Äî your insulin levels supposedly even out or stabilize after 12 hours.   Can only add my own anecdotal evidence. When I eat breakfast, I get hella hungry for lunch, but if I don‚Äôt, I can make it farther into the afternoon before I get hungry.   Of course, being a low weight or underweight can mess with your body‚Äôs hunger and fullness signals as well. But the ‚Äúgetting hungry again after eating‚Äù is definitely a hormonal response.
