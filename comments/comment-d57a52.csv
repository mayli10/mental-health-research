However, fellow-ED peoples have advised me to warm them up and then eat them, which I haven't tried yet. So maybe my opinion will change once I do that. But in general, I've tried at least 5 different brands and multiple different flavors, and I just don't like them.. When I'm restricting, I find them good to nibble on bc I dislike the taste but it helps my hunger.  &gt;Halo top  Mehhhhhhh. It's just not the same as real ice cream :( But if you need a dairy-free alternative, then I think Halo Top is fine, but it can be expensive, so I probably wouldn't get it unless it's on sale. There are a ton of other brands that are making low cal/dairy free alternatives which are cheaper. Trader Joe's has some soy-based (?) ice cream sandwiches (I think they have an ice cream pint too) which I remember being pretty good and satisfying. But my safe ice cream is the Good Humor strawberry shortcake ice cream bars, which are 160 cals, if you can eat dairy.  &gt;Sharataki noodles or whatever they are called  Nope nope nope nope. Don't get them. Terrible texture. Waste of money. Maybe try once to just try it and judge for yourself, but just remember I warned you lol.   &gt;Sugarfree Jello  I don't eat jello hardly ever, but this is probably worth the money :)",False,False
