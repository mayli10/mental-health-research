At the drop of a hat I could go from okay to absolutely furious, for very little reason. To be fair this was made worse by other things going on in my life at the time, but the implant made it so very much worse.   After that three months it settled down, I was back to normal, and had birth control sorted for the next few years so I'd say it was worth it, but it remains one of the most horrendously emotional episodes I've ever had in my adult life. Everybody will react differently, but do be prepared to feel awful. I did some reading on a couple of forums a couple of years after getting it and found lots of other people had said the same",False,False

So I never binged but would want pickles when I like never eat pickles lol,False,False

Long story short: I was insanely hungry. Because of life events and the hunger I was more inclined to eat. I fell into bad eating habits (and was hungry) and gained a lot of weight slowly. I just switched to mirena, an IUD, and I think a combination of literally not being as hungry and desperately wanting a change led me to healthy weight loss and then a relapse into disordered eating.   I don’t fully blame the implant for my weight gain, but I did notice a significant change in my very strong urge to eat.    I feel like my willpower was being broken down because of my constant hunger, but I probably could have nipped my bad habits in the bud. ",False,False
