For a good laugh I will check out the controversial posts sometimes. they downvote so many people that have real questions just because they're misinformed. ,False,False

I am mostly recovered but I still don't fit into the normie mentality on the /1200 subs and /loseit. So I come here because participating there isn't really an option. Also it's way more supportive/real/fun here. ,False,False

I'm trying to recover from bulimia and I got the no purging part down but not really the binging. I know the second I make an effort to eat better my inner anorexic comes out and I get obsessed. ,False,False
