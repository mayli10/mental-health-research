Once I decided to let them see the light of day they started to fade/blend in. I tan pretty good and every passing summer fades my scars a little bit more.

They have faded, but I once wore a shirt with shoulder cut outs and someone asked if I put a shimmer powder on them, nope, it was the shiny stretch marks. Now if I wear something shoulder-less I wear a cardigan. Honestly I can't wait to be able to wear oversized cardigans and look great, because at the moment I look like a elementary school teacher.",False,False

I put some cocoa butter (idk if it matters but the kind that comes as a stick). ANYWAYS, basically constant application of aloe Vera and cocoa butter made them pretty much invisible. Like can’t even tell if they were ever there. It isn’t foolproof but if you tackle it right now they’ll heal better since they’re new. ",False,False

They can definitely go away in that spot!",False,False
