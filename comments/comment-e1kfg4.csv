I hope his apology was sincere and he's open to understanding.  •I definitely get the recognising fellow ED sufferers thing. I don't know what it is but we can spot each other across a crowded room.  •I'm so sorry you are going through this. Reaching out for help and not really getting anything useful is awful to go through. I hope you're getting chance to process things in a more safe and secure environment right now. Hope you find some more helpful treatment options.,False,False

I have been inpatient a couple of times for my bipolar. This was well before any eating disorder symptoms (I still wouldn't consider myself to have an ed but thats irrelevant here). Here's my rant:  I went to the same inpatient twice in two months last year. I was around bmi of 19, which is totally fine and I shouldn't get any shit about it. When I'm stuck in these places I generally have no appetite though because, well, I'm locked in a shitty place with volatile people and asshole staff who don't care and don't seem to have any clue how to deal with people who are mentally ill.  One day I was trying to eat my breakfast (apple - I ate, cereal &amp; milk - I ate a little but not much, and a bagel). The bagel looked mouldy so I stayed away from it. A staff member came over and tried to make me eat it. I showed it to them and they said it was fine. I refused. Another tech tried to shove it in my mouth. Again, I refused. Finally, enough fuss was made that a nurse came over. She looked at the bagel and saw the mould and was like wtf, why are they trying to make you eat this. Eventually they brought over an orange as a compromise. It was so dumb.  Later that morning I saw my doctor. He went on and on about how I refused to eat and that I must have an eating disorder. All because of a fucking mouldy bagel. Mental health technicians can be the worst sometimes.   I'm sorry you're having such a rough time. I hope your fiance has more understanding now and can be more supportive.  I understand that the diagnosis of EDNOS is frustrating. I don't know that much about the differences, but I know how it feels to be misdiagnosed. I'm 26 now. I knew I had bipolar as soon as I learnt that it existed, at age 15 or so. But I was only diagnosed with depression and treated that way until I was 23. The treatment made me worse, I knew it was wrong, but I was powerless and it made me feel like I just couldn't handle life like everyone else could. Getting properly diagnosed at 23 made the world of difference.  Ok, thats enough of me making it about myself. I hope you feel better.",False,False
