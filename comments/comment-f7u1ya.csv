I grew up chubby, was even obese for a while, but I think you got to separate the skinny envy from ED. Ana doesn‚Äôt just affect normal weight or skinny ppl. And I think there is a lot of erase-ism there  Also all of us, no matter the ED are sick- not physically or emotionally healthy.  If you want to envy anyone, envy the people with healthy food mindsets who are effortlessly skinny and beautiful. God, I hate them üòÇ haha",False,False

I just wanna say that I understand how you feel. Seeing other people lose weight, feeling like the odd one out (maybe even like your ED is invalid), and getting an ED which runs counter to your eventual goals is not a fun time.   I used to envy those who could purge and anas because I hated feeling so weighed down after a binge. I hated being chubby and especially being obese (also since I was a kid!). However I‚Äôve seen a lot of negatives from the other side as well. I‚Äôve seen people that had major health scares, tooth decay, whose weights hit a low and in spite of that wanted lower.   I don‚Äôt wanna preach too much, but instead of envying the other side, since attempting to recover I‚Äôve been encouraged to envy moderation. Envy the ability to eat foods you like without starving or gaining. Envy healthy sustainable weight loss. Envy a healthier relationship with food instead of putting an equally unhealthy disorder on a pedestal.   The reminder that really made me rethink my resistance to recovery is the idea if I had a more moderate relationship with food. I‚Äôm talking really moderate, like a &gt;! 100-200 calorie a day !&lt; deficit, I would have been at a healthy weight by now, at my goal weight even. That really got me into a recovery mindset. It may seem like Ana is the answer to your woes, but there is a different answer to consider as well.   Regardless of whether or not you‚Äôre ready for recovery, I wish you the best. You‚Äôre not alone",False,False

Keep going and don't be afraid to try out different approaches if you think they might work well for you :) and yeah I get you, a lot of people have similar thoughts (oh I'm depressed over nothing if I had cancer I would be """""" valid"""""") and I know I've justified my ED with things like &gt;!""it'll be easier to get a job skinny bc ppl are superficial and I need every edge I can get since I don't have a degree""!&lt; for example. Something I can suggest that helps me is reading about the concept of attachment in Buddhism [like this article/podcast episode](https://secularbuddhism.com/understanding-non-attachment/) (the whole podcast is pretty good too). It's tough to handle all the contradictory and sometimes asshole-y feelings having an ED brings us, I think most of us have been there one way or another ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False

It was just a thought that if i have to go through mental pain of ed, why couldnt i get one that would actually (in my mind) benefit me?
