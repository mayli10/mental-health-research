I got surprise Easter eggs I wasn't expecting yesterday and I ate one within calories and it triggered me to want more food. I went and stood in front of my fridge contemplating what I could grab and eat before bed... and I just closed it and left gain. I still went over my calories for the day but I didn't binge (eat mindlessly) and I was still at a defecit for the day.  Easter is a super hard time for binging and you did GREAT!! Especially since you got so much of it! You should be proud of yourself for letting yourself enjoy it in moderation.",False,False
