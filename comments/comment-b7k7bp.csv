In hindsight at 13, I wish I focused more on having fun and having good memories to look back on even though I hated my body.  Eating disorders are the worst but don’t let it keep you from having the best time you can while you have it. Like try and separate feeling insecure and going out with your friends to do stuff, I promise people are going to pay more attention to how you make them feel rather than what they’re seeing! Even if you’re worried about how you look, the memories are SO worth it so don’t let it hold you back.  If you do fast, drink plenty of water and make sure to keep your electrolytes up. ❤️",False,False
