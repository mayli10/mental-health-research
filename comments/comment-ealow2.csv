Make sure youâ€™re drinking enough water but donâ€™t overdo it.   And sorry, I didnâ€™t mean to scare you with the whole amputation thing ðŸ˜“itâ€™s just one of the things that can happen if this goes on for too long. Iâ€™m not sure how long it takes for it to get that bad but probably several months. Itâ€™s just always been on my mind since I know a girl with an ED who had to get some of her finger tips amputated.",False,False

Your not getting enough blood flow to your extremities (your body tries to keep as much blood flow going to your heart and brain so your body starts to limit the blood flow going to less important areas). The reason dunking them in hot water works is that you are forcing vasodilation which temporarily increases blood flow. Limited blood flow to your extremities can lead to amputation if it gets bad enough that your tissue starts dying. Please be careful love,False,False
