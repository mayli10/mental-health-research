The only times I’ve ever (obsessively) watched those was when I was not doing well, or not trying to recover, or form healthy habits. I would just anger watch them and loathe myself into losing more weight because *really I wasn’t that sick*  even if I was already very underweight.   I don’t think those types of videos help anyone who is either in recovery or trying to/thinking about recovery. I’m sure some of them don’t have bad intentions but even those ones I feel like even if they are in recovery they still need validation so they post those and essentially scream **”LOOK AT ME, JUST LOOK AT HOW SICK I WAS!
