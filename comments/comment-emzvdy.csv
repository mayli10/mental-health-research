Plus it has 300mg of caffeine compared to 180mg in a monster. It’s also based off the manufacturers recommendation of 18 and up is safe to drink it responsibly. Because of that, some places will just refuse to sell to under 18. It’s technically not illegal to buy under 18, it’s just the establishments rules.",False,False
