It's my fault for not talking about it, I guess, but its kind of heartbreaking anyway. It's like, how are you supposed to say ""hey just letting you know, I didn't eat anything today and I'm not planning on eating tomorrow and I don't want you to do anything about it but just thought you should know ok thanks love you""",False,False

It allows me to be honest without having to talk about things I don’t want to talk about, and allows my SO to keep an eye on trends in case I’m consistently doing Real Bad",False,False
