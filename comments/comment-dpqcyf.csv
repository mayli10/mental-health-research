I agree, I think I miss how he expresses and experiences insecurities differently from me. So I forget he has any and think I am the imperfect one. And that makes me feel lonely. It is healing to focus on others and I think it is healthy to realize no one is perfect, and that is okay.",False,False

If you want to take this to DMs lemme know.   I'm working on exactly the same thing, just trying to recognize I'm not the worst and shouldn't put all of my energy into hating myself even though I feel like I do it *out of love* for my partner, because I respect and love him so much I can't possibly be good enough right?   This totally blew up in my face recently. I straight up had a minute where I was like ""he's a normie, he doesn't get how I feel, he's scared of my feelings, I'm too much to deal with"" only to realize after we talked about it that he wasn't scared of my feelings, he was just also kind of freaking out about his own shit. I had effectively deprecated myself so hard that I missed the fact that other people --particularly the ones I love!-- also have problems and feelings and I'm not the only one. They have trauma and shit too.   So I'm not trying to like guilt you out of depression or low confidence, obviously, but I think if you look at it like a service you can perform for him, to recognize *his* humanity, it will make you feel more comfortable in the role you play in your relationship. Because you're not alone, he's screwed up too! And if he's not perfect, then...maybe...just maybe...you actually are a catch like everyone says ;) &lt;3 sending good vibes your way",False,False

Wish you all the best in your relationship. My boyfriend says he found me attractive from the beginning and his friends say he scored, yet I feel I do not measure up. My eating issues have gotten worse because of my fear if I do not get better looking, he will lose interest. I know one of my most unattractive traits is low confidence and anxiety about the relationship. I have a tendency to put all my energy into love at the expense of myself.    He said I was confident when we first met, but really I was coming out of a toxic relationship with a broken heart and felt like I had nothing left to lose. Now that I am so in love with him after 2 years I feel like my insecurities are magnified because I have so much to lose. I want to be confident for real, and a source of positivity. I want to show trust and faith in my partner. I need to give him more credit, indeed, and not be so stuck in my own head I miss his needs altogether. I‚Äôm a mess, lol, thanks for reading.",False,False

And yeah, my partner and I have the exact same conversations and I've literally said those words to myself ""I only have eyes for him"" and I felt *so* inadequate compared to the girls he expressed an interest in. But, it's important to remember, your partner is probably pretty excellent and they are probably not so ugly and broken that only you can love them, you're not exactly the only option for a romantic partner in the entire world. That means they *chose* you, *decided* to be with you, not because you were just there but because you are awesome in your own right. Also, your partner is human, he has eyes, he must think you're smokin hot because, again, he wanted to be with you in the first place! And that would be true of you regardless of your relationship status.   I had to start giving my partner more credit to believe I was worthy of him. I don't always believe it but I think it's helpful to remember that if I shit talk myself, I'm shit talking him. And *nobody* shit talks my boo.",False,False

I have been struggling so hard when my boyfriend finds celebs or porn stars sexy for traits I am far from. Big breasts being the main one, I am only getting smaller chested as I lose weight. We have an honest relationship where he will share these sexual thoughts with me, and I don‚Äôt want to lose that. But I am also very sensitive and have developed more and more insecurities. I only have eyes for him sexually now, I do not look at other dudes, and I feel like a total loser. Sometimes I don‚Äôt feel special anymore and compare myself to other girls. So your comment really helped. Thank you.",False,False

If it helps, porn is all about the fantasy and that's essentially what those nudes are. For example, as a bisexual in a hetero, monogamous relationship, I pretty much exclusively watch same sex porn. It's not that I'm disatisfied with my partner or that I miss women necessarily, it's more that I already have one dick in my life, and it's my favorite one, so I don't really need to go looking at other ones on the internet.   I think it's probably a very similar thing for your boyfriend-- he has a super hot skinny legend so he's looking at pictures of super hot thicc legends.   As far as relationships/recovery/etc. I just want to remind you of a few things:  1) it's really hard to make recovery last if you're doing to make other people happy instead of yourself 2) part of recovery is finding validation within yourself  3) it's also part of recovery to develop healthy coping mechanisms   Recovering for your bf's sake might be good, and it's definitely better than not recovering at all, but it's not guaranteed to keep him around either and it would be dangerous to associate recovery and validation from an SO--like, I don't want you guys to break up and for it to convince you that recovery is pointless because it didn't change the trajectory of your relationship.   Remember that at the end of the day, you're always alone. Not in ""forever alone"" way, I mean like you always have yourself to depend on, spend time with, and care for. Other people aren't dependable in such a steadfast and constant way, because they have their own shit going on and that's ok! You never *need* another person (at least not one specific one) to live the life you want, all you need is yourself and the will to live it. &lt;3 I'm rooting for you",False,False

I tend to notice that guys want whatever we are not, since they already have us, if that makes sense. Like my boyfriend wants thicker women when I'm skinny and skinnier women when I'm bigger. There's no winning here. I hope you find peace, it may be worth talking to him a bit but if you think it will trigger you then maybe wait it out until your breakup.  I've found similar stuff, but ""huge boobs"". I have almost no boobs. It does hurt to not feel like enough for someone you love.",False,False
