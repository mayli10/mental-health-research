All phases lasting anywhere from 1week to to around a year at a time. When I go back to 'normal' eating, there's always a kind of build up? till I start restricting again and start the circle all over again. This is also why I have never rly believed I'm 'sick', but finally starting to realize.  You're def not alone.",False,False

After I realized what I did I didn't eat the next two days. I wish it could be like that all of the time and not worry about everything I eat. Food is terrifying most days. ,False,False

Normally until a family member or friend says something about how or what I’m eating. And then it’s just, “Cool, thanks for the totally unsolicited comments on my eating. Now I’m completely self conscious and probably won’t eat in front of you for a week or two because you’re mentioning it and saying shit.”    I’d probably eat completely normal if no one ever mentioned anything. At least Lola has my back, I was talking to her last night and she was like yeah I regularly skip meals gotta stay skinny and pretty, nbd. I don’t get it though cause she’s at a good weight but her daughters and granddaughters definitely aren’t. ",False,False
