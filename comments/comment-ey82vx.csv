Restriction also slows down the healing process and (depending on what nutrients you're lacking) in very severe cases can even lead to old wounds re-opening.   Your skin - especially on your hands - is constantly working to hold together. It's not a curtain draped over your body like a blanket. It's a living organ that works hard to keep you protected, healing and re-healing itself from the tiny damages it suffers on a daily bases. Without the right nutrients, it can't strengthen itself normally. This is especially true if you're also dehydrated.  Vitamins and electrolytes are the things you gotta keep an eye on. Of course, the best thing would be to make sure you're getting all the energy/nutrients you need, but we both know that EDs aren't that simple. So do what you can, take vitamin supplements, and for dry/cracking skin drink water and use a moisturizing hand-wash. A face moisturizer can also help as the skin on the face can get cracked too.",False,False

I’m just so pre-occupied with calories. I get so daunted thinking about electrolytes and nutrients and things that I just get overwhelmed and stop thinking about it and ignore the issues - which I know is a silly and immature way to deal with it!   Then something like this happens and I’m like “wow why is this happening” and I ask in this sub and then I’m reminded by people thinking more clearly than me as to why it is happening haha.   Thank-you for the info, I will actually aim to look into it this time!",False,True

Are you keeping an eye on your electrolytes? Also try taking a multi vitamin and mineral, with extra magnesium because the multi never has enough in it. Magnesium helped my nail bed I think.",False,False
