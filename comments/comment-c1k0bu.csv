I had no clue if could be used for this.  I know in the ED community, Wellbutrin gets thrown around because it's not an SSRI and it can cause a decrease in appetite. I felt good on it, but I still b/p-ed. And that's a big no-no because of heart issues and risk of seizures.  But I've been on Prozac about 1.5 weeks and haven't b/p-ed at all. I just don't feel like it and it's amazingly weird. The best way to describe it is that my sex-drive to binge is gone. That's odd, but I feel that it's accurate.   Recovery is multi-faceted and I feel like I can step back easier to see why I want to overeat.
