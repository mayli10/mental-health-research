It’s been insanity all up until about 130 days ago. I’ve recovered now and I’m also nearing a fear weight. I’m still small enough for strangers to call me “Skinny” but  I’m getting near that range.   But I know why it’s happening, I forgot that eating healthy and exercising actually causes me to gain muscle (Facepalm) I know how it is to get near certain levels of weight and all that, it’s tough to take in.  What helps me is learning about Nutrition, Biochemistry, Health, and physiology/human Kinesiology. I’d educate yourself and it’ll help a lot with getting over fears and stuff.   I’m wishing you much love and mental strength!  Ik you can find that middle area of satisfaction with yourself :) well, Happy Friday 13th lol",False,False
