My Mom has contributed to a lot of my ED because she was always making remarks about my body and how I was gaining weight, the fattest in my class, etc.  I was a perfectly normal, skinny kid.  She also always comments about herself and I catch her body checking sometimes.  My grandma also talks about how she gains so much weight by eating, especially on trips, and then how she has to lose it when she goes back home.  When I go to visit family in Asia, they all comment on how my Dad has lost so much weight (he did it healthily, with exercise), and how he looks so good now.  Whenever I have to eat a meal, I must finish everything I take, and if I don't, I'm punished.  Last year when my ED was developing, I went on a 'diet', and as I was losing weight quickly, my Mom tells me that I look so much better and how great I could look if I ""just watched my weight"".  The whole culture encourages these things, and I don't even think that my family realizes that they are doing these things at this point.",False,False

I always noticed the huge concentration on dieting and body image and it always sounded SO disordered to me. I wasn't even seeking it out, like I usually would for other things.  And then I took an abnormal psychology class and what really threw me off my rhythm is my instructor saying that eating disorders are a disorder of western society. For months I was perplexed by this until I realized what that actually meant: EDs are rarely actually diagnosed in asian society because EVERYONE seems to have one (or enables/encourages them). It seems to me that its so normalized and ingrained in to the culture that it's an accomplishment to develop an ED.",False,False
