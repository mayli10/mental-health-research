It was addictive. I felt like I had more value, which is totally ridiculous butüíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è    Now I've gained and I can't stop binging and I feel fat and disgusting even though I know logically that the weight I'm at is fine. The problem is the mental spiralling. I'm unhappy at whatever weight I'm at because it's not about my body, it's about my brain.",False,False
