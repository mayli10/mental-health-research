I used my eating disorder to cope with everything that entails. Losing my curves and everything that makes me sexually attractive to men basically. It made me feel safer and like I had control over my body.   I'm scared of the past, the present and the future. My eating disorder was a coping mechanism. Didn't get the job? Starve. Embarrassed yourself in front of someone? Starve.   Then I became so sick I had to drop out of university and quit my job. Lost a lot of friends, and also all my interests and hobbies because the eating disorder takes up all the space. I had nothing left, except my eating disorder.   I'm in hospital now and have been for about three months trying to recover, but it's hard when it feels like you have to build your life up from the beginning again because the eating disorder took so much away from you.

It's not really about what I looked like - I could look in the mirror and feel a twinge of satisfaction and fascination at my figure for only a moment before the aching and the pain I constantly felt enveloped me again, and suddenly my appearance no longer mattered if I wasn't going to live to experience whatever thrill I got from imagining the fascination of others. None of it matters when you barely have the mental capacity to do basic tasks at times. And in reality, I HATED the attention, the way people stared with either pity and/or revulsion. I didn't really notice any admiring stares - what is there to admire, really? Being treated as a delicate, fragile being is one thing, but being made out to be utterly weak and incapable is another. But I do miss the experience in a way - time passed so quickly, because most of the time I just lived in a daze, dreaming about whatever food I could eat next, and all the buffets I told myself I could ""eventually"" visit. Everything had this dreamy, hazy quality to it, like I was enclosed in a glass bubble that let me keep everyone at bay.
