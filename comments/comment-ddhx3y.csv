I will take a test tomorrow though just to be certain but I think it's just water. At least I hope!! ðŸ¥º,False,True

When I go through bingey periods ALL the weight and water retention goes right to my stomach and then disappears once I make sure Iâ€™m drinking enough fluids and binging less.  Also depending on what youâ€™ve been binging on lots of foods can make you bloated and distended looking!,False,False

I was binging a lot lately so maybe that's why I look a bit distended. I'm so scared :,(",False,True

I was on the mini pill at the time but my husband and I werenâ€™t using any backup protection, not even pulling out.  Definitely not the safest plan in hindsight.  Honestly the worst part about not having a reliable period is never knowing if youâ€™re pregnant or not so I completely understand how paranoid you feel.  I still suggest taking another test just in case, but also take a look at the foods youâ€™ve been eating/liquids youâ€™ve been drinking.  My body holds on to water weight like mad if my sodium intake is too high.  How long have you been on the mini pill?  Birth control can sometimes cause weight gain (fluid retention not fat gain) and though the mini pill is less likely to because it only has one hormone, it does still happen but usually balances itself out eventually.",False,False

I've taken the mini pill religiously at 8pm every single night since I began. I took a pregnancy test about 3 weeks ago and it was negative and I haven't had sex since but now I'm literally about to have a panic attack because I'm so paranoid.,False,True

Finally I convinced myself I was probably pregnant so went to the doctor and found out I was 3 months pregnant -_- which explained the 5 pounds I gained and could not lose.  (PS Donâ€™t believe anyone who tells you that you canâ€™t get pregnant if you donâ€™t have your period)  The mini pill isnâ€™t the most reliable birth control if you donâ€™t take it at EXACTLY the same time every day so if you are having sex please do yourself a favour and look into other birth control options unless you do want to start a family.  My son is healthy now but had a rough go in utero (growth problems) probably because I was engaging in risky behaviours while I refused to believe that I could be pregnant, and then he was born premature and was in the NICU for awhile.  Anyway TLDR if you actually think you could be pregnant you should take a test just to rule it out.  My son is my reason for living but not everyone in this situation wants to have children, and waiting too long to find out can mean missing opportunities to terminate an unwanted pregnancy.",False,False

And also being constipated and bloated. I sometimes look like 5 months pregnant! I use double up protection (both iud and condom) so the chances are like almost 0% .. But just take a test to calm yourself down! Take care!,False,False

A med i took caused my body to produce prolactine(a hormone pregnant women produce) and it caused me to gain 30 kg in 2.5 months. Go get some bloodwork done!,False,False
