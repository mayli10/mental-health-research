I also mostly closely fit the criteria for non purging bulimia (compensate with fasting and lax abuse instead of vomiting, also some restriction but nothing insane currently ) which doesn’t feel like something anyone would take seriously. I have also had periods of heavy restriction and even some ortho tendencies in my teens but those feel like a joke to me now. I don’t really like to say I have “disordered eating” either because that seems to vague and I’ve never seen a coherent definition of it.   So like, if I can’t decide if I have one I definitely can’t decide if you do! It doesn’t really matter if it’s crossed any arbitrary line yet if it’s disrupting your life. It’s certainly not an area where you should sit around and wait for it to get worse, especially now you’ve started purging. Hope you’re doing ok, sending you hugs.",False,False

(For example: if you spend your time at home being obsessed about what you will/won't eat, and if you adjust your social activities to accommodate your disordered eating habits)  ED diagnoses are tricky because they're still being developed. Many of the criteria for anorexia and bulimia are overly-specific and exclusive. The inadequacy of these diagnostic systems keeps many people with disordered eating from getting the recognition and help they need.   If you feel like disordered eating is inconveniencing you in any way, then your feelings are valid and sufficient to merit help. I don't want to preach recovery if your'e not ready for it. I just think it's important to recognize that EDs look different for everyone. And it's possible to be legitimately suffering without purging 10x/day or being underweight.",False,False
