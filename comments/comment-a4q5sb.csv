I had been the same weight in middle school but I grew into it and was at a healthy bmi, about 8 lbs more than rn whilst in freshman year of high school. There was this best friend who I made in middle school who I idolized, I tried on some of her clothes one day after I ""grew into it"" and was stunned any of it fit. Seriously body dysmorphia creeps up on you and fucks you up. I personally take pictures and string measurements to keep track. Not in necessarily a good way, but it does help me a lot with looking in the mirror and knowing what I actually look like",False,False
