Apparently, the owner refused to call the police so the security guy just ""kept"" them there (they were not trying to run away). They wanted them to buy CDs my brother and his friend supposedly stole. So on top of having no proof, they forced them to stay (qualifies as kidnapping) and tried to extort them from money...  Not sure what the end game was but since my brother and his friend had NO money with them, that's when they decided to call the parents (no cells back then so my brother couldn't do it himself).  That must have been scary for them, but in retrospect it was mostly dumb from the store management üòÖ my brother and his friend told this story to everyone and a lot of their friends avoided that store for a while (which isn't smart when you mostly sell CDs and they were in high school...).",False,False

It can be super annoying, and they can get suspicious all they want, at top they can ban you from the store and eventually call your parents if you're a minor.  One time, my brother got accused of stealing CDs (I'm old) at a store. Obviously they couldn't see anything on camera and they couldn't find anything on them so they said that ""they found a way to hide them and retrieve them later"" (?!). My brother and his friend didn't know what to do. Later on, my parents were called and they yelled at them that keeping them forcefully in the store without calling the police and without proof of stealing was kidnapping and they would attack them if they kept them any longer.

If you are, here's my advice:  First off, they can't charge you with anything if you didn't leave with anything. The cameras will tell the truth. If they bring it to court, or if the police confront you, don't say anything except ""I did not steal. I demand to speak to a lawyer. I plead the 5th."" If this is the case, I'd sue the establishment and the manager on duty (MOD) for discrimination simply because you were nervous around the products due to your ED and was accused of being a thief.
