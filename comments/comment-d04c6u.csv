I recently found her instagram through meredith foster and she is actually the person that had all the body envy with tight six pack but even admit it wasnt good for her mental health. She is still healthy and active and fit but at 149 lb.   That’s the epitome of having a healthy body image and following through it consistently. When you want the tone look and are in 24% bf you really want to focus on body recomposition instead of just losing weight by trying fad diets like juicing.   Meredith Foster actually shared she went up 2 sizes of jean size and that was okay for her. Though like any human being, she freaking out about it initially. I dont ever hear Cassey ever coming in term with increase of dress size especially knowing she works out consistently.",False,False

She also used to severely restrict herself and only let herself splurge on occasional 10k cal cheat days. She admitted a few months ago that she suffered from extreme hunger from all those years of restriction and is doing some approach called ""All-In"" where she ""ate till satisfaction"" and gained 37 pounds recently and she's been pretty open about it.",False,False

I was really dissapointed especially knowing a lot of her audience is composed of young girls. I think unnatural vegan did a good response video on it if youre interested.,False,False
