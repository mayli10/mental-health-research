The after-effects of strokes/TIAs can get progressively worse over time and if you are at all suspicious, you really should go in to be assessed.  If you are having trouble coming up with the words to describe what happened and need help communicating, DM me and I will be more than happy to assist.",False,False

Lol, I'm so healthy though right?  I just was wanting to know what was wrong with me but I had no plan to go to the doctors. Thank you though.",False,True

Jill Bolte-Taylor gave an interesting TED talk on her stroke experience related to her book “My Stroke of Insight”.  Strokes are very serious business and consulting a doctor seems like a smart choice, if that’s at all possible. It would be awful to experience a full-blown stroke because the warning signs went unaddressed.",False,False
