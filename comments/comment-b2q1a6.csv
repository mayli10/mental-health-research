Or you can email yourself the pictures. So you'll always have access + know the dates.  This way you don't have to worry about someone else seeing them or stumbling upon a picture yourself and getting obsessive all of a sudden.,False,False

The only hesitation I have regards whether or not you can view the images through file transferring (like plugging it into my computer, the folder is visible, just not the images). It's password protected, but I still get paranoid someone will find just my ugly blob self.",False,False

I had specifically counted the number of photos to make sure I wouldn't accidentally show the pics I took the night before, but then they grabbed my phone to get a better look at the pictures *and they started scrolling*. I knew damn well what picture was next, so I had to act. It was like time slowed-down as they swiped. I stg. I never moved so quickly in my life. I don't know if they saw the picture or not, but it was pretty awkward so whether they did or didn't see it it was quite obvious what the next picture was. My face must have been beet red. It was shortly after that that I learned you can set photos to private on my phone. I don't know how to view private photos though, so I don't always do that.",False,False
