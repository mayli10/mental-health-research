My dad is a Chinese Immigrant and grew up very poor so food was a huge part of showing his care for me was cooking. On one hand, I was always being told to eat more and finish my food, on the other, I was either praised for how thin I was, or my aunties would make comments on my weight gain. Because food waste was (and still is) . such a touchy thing for my dad, it got to the point where I would straight up skip meals and family gatherings so I would have to throw food away. I think this added a level of shame and isolation. I also think it was (and still is) very hard for me to explain my ed to my dad because he didn't grow up with adequate mental health education/care and English isn't his first language.",False,True
