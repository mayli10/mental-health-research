Most of them are actually very body positive towards themselves so I'm lucky! But I did have to talk to a teacher about a student who hid food in her pockets but constantly ran to the bathroom after lunch and always smelled like puke. I felt terrible talking to someone about this student potentially having bulimia when I have such similar issues, but I also want to turn this students life away from this course as soon as can, especially since shes only in 4th grade and already starting these habits. :(",False,False

I'm in college for becoming a teacher and we frequently have discussions on ""things to look out for"" in terms of any emotional or mental problems with our students. Which means we discuss anorexia or bulimia frequently. And we have to talk about warning signs for it. Pretty triggering for me, who just acts like I have never heard of these things before and stay silent the entire time. I even had my stomach rumbling during one of the discussions and everyone sort of joked about it. üôÉ",False,False
