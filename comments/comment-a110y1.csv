Thank you for your response. I am doing a 3 day cleanse right now to prepare (liquid soups, broth and fruit/veg juices), and hopefully will follow the 10 days with this same diet again for 3 days. I mean, I've done actual water fasts for 6-8 days several times before but they were so hard. Hopefully this will be a bit easier. i appreciate the warnings.  &lt;3 ",False,True

It kinda kickstarted the obsession of feeling empty, saying no to food, losing weight, etc. I started it cold turkey, no food just the master cleanse. I know not everyone can do that, but I was so desperate to lose weight and it worked. You will feel lethargic, and have no energy to do anything. All I did was stay in bed and watched anime during the 14 days I did this. And I lost 1 pound each day, more further along since I changed my diet so drastically.",False,False

I decided to do it and I'm so I excited! I'm now on a 3 day liquid diet (broth, liquid soups and fruit/veg smoothies) to prepare and I'll start on Saturday! It's 10 days. Don't bother reading the book. I read it last night and it was a waste of $3.
