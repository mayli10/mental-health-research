Iâ€™ll do some searching and see if I can find any other services.   Iâ€™ll think about drugs too. I didnâ€™t think you could really get anything prescribed for BED here.,False,True

I'd say give that a go but I cannot remember the name for the life of me. It can't treat anorexia but it did well with BED and bulimia,False,False

I wish I could give you useful advice but all I can really say is that youâ€™re not in this alone. You might have more luck asking about medications for the BED rather than therapy since there arenâ€™t waiting lists for medications and some people can find they help, but obviously there are lots of downsides to being on meds and they donâ€™t work for everyone. I find that asking for an appointment with a pharmacist rather than a GP is usually more helpful when it comes to getting something useful but that might just be because the pharmacists at my local surgery are super lovely and helpful and there are some really awful GPs. Other than that, Iâ€™d suggest trying to get some non-ED related therapy, anything you can really. Search up online for local charities that help with that, bypassing your GP and going straight through the charity can cut down your waiting time hugely. I have some resources and links I can send if youâ€™re in the East Midlands but if youâ€™re not then Iâ€™m sorry but I canâ€™t be of any more help. Best of luck to you, I hope things start to get better soon ðŸ’–",False,False
