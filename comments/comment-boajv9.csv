If you're overweight and trying to lose and have a craving in the evening after eating your allotted calories for the day, brushing your teeth can be a good way to help your self control. The problem with us/people with EDs is we take these things to the extreme or abuse them.  Like I might use the brushing teeth tip but it would be after a day of severely restricting my calories when I'm already underweight.",False,False
