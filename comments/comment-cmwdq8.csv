For me, it doesn't really matter whether I am restricting or not. I think its just because food/calories/nutrition is on my mind every hour of the day. I find them enjoyable. When I'm dreaming about food, im usually at a buffet or eating something that makes me uncomfortable to eat in real life, and in the dream i get uncomfortable. Then i wake up and im like ""ah, no worries, i didnt actually eat that"", and breathe a sigh of relief. Ive come to enjoy these dreams because I can eat whatever I want without feeling guilty in real life. Theyre definitely somewhat stressful, though.",False,False
