If you can, try to get up and moving (pacing around the house while listening to a podcast or something as distraction) - light exercise can speed up your digestion a bit.  If you can sleep, do it, but you might need to wait a little while for the nausea/pain to subside. But get to sleep as soon as possible - unfortunately, you won't feel much better until you start to digest some of that food, and the time obviously passes much quicker while you're asleep. If you're struggling to turn your brain off, I recommend listening to some rain sounds (Rainymood is a great app) or you can try meditation (Headspace is incredible and super easy to use, it makes meditating a much less daunting idea).   Whenever I'm trying to come to terms with a large binge, I think about logic. Realistically, the amount of food you can eat in a single day/sitting will not result in a massive weight gain. More than 3,500 calories are needed for you to gain just a pound of actual weight. However much you've binged on today will not make or break you - it's how you proceed from here that counts.  Try not to self-loathe. I know that is much easier said than done, but it truly doesn't improve any of the thing's you're worried about and only makes it hard to move forward. I really recommend Headspace (again). It's an app that has quick (5 minutes or less) guided meditations. If I feel like a binge is coming on, I'll do a quick 5 minute session on the app and by the end of it I often feel like I have a clearer head and I can process my binge urges without succumbing to them. Give it a try tonight.",False,False
