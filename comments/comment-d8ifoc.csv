So actually. I take that part back. I actually wanna go get what I currently have (an IUD) taken out bc it gives me a weird feeling as if I’m not fully myself but I rarely ever have periods (who knows if it’s due to the ED or the IUD but I think it’s more likely the IUD as my previous birth control made me bleed every day for a year. ... that was the bar in your arm. I forget the actual name but I warn everyone against it I’m not the only one.

I can relate 100% I’m 5’1” (and fully understand the fact it’s harder for us to stay petite and skinny bc of height; however I still love being short bc it gives us such a cute tiny lil petite aspect initially which is nice) —lol that sounded narcissistic and conceited and it was but at the same time I hate it bc as u seem to say it’s so much more difficult for us to stay thin and proportionate. All you y’all skinny ladies are hot as hell too haha no discrimination I’m just saying the shortness is all I know and I love it but we are all  in the same arena as far as struggle so I hope I didn’t sound like a pretentious ass hahah. As for the oily skin and acne I can also relate bc I have combination skin and it’s more often than not oily. I haven’t been breaking out as much after I switched birth controls bc I’ve had problems with several but if you’re on one lmk what type and if not maybe you should get on one bc some of them help acne! However one of the ones that does is what ruined my skin in high school and it’s never been the same since. But also it’s different for everyone. Wow this is long I’m sorry but hang in there much love take care,False,False
