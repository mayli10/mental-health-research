There are 8 eating disorders and only one has a prerequisite of being underweight. Forget that term now. It's pointless and hurtful.   Your disordered relationship with food is valid, it sounds like you're really struggling and you're putting yourself through hell. The last thing you need is to feel more guilty about it.  Do you think there is anything else thats going on in your life that is maintaining this? How is school and family?  If you have access you should try and speak to someone about your body image struggles. It's really hard being 15. 💙💙",False,False

If you have disordered habits that impact your life enough to make it a serious problem, then you probably have an eating disorder of some kind. There are other disorders besides anorexia. Besides that I've been diagnosed with that one and I eat junk all the fucking time. Hell I knew one anorexic chick who lived off candy.",False,False

No healthy person wants an eating disorder or engages with disordered behaviors, and if you do either of those things then you’re definitely not faking it. The strong feeling that you’re fake or not sick enough is just another symptom of the disorder, and there’s no “right way” to have an eating disorder. I’m sorry you’re struggling, your struggle is valid and you deserve a healthy relationship with food and yourself! You’re more than welcome here with a community that supports and understands you, don’t listen to the feeling that you’re not sick enough",False,False

It’s sad to me ur already struggling so much with weight and food and have been for so long :( this sort of crash diet sorta lifestyle (???) is actually really common i think and it’s how a lot of people with ED’s “start out”. It’s not healthy and it can really fuck u up if u don’t seek help and let it get worse !! I know it’s really hard but itd be best for u to seek help now and tell a parent, counselor, therapist, teacher etc. while ur still young",False,False
