Not a lot, but I was also a really unhygienic kid. Wouldn't shower for weeks, acted really creepy, etc. I had a lot of issues and didn't act like a normal person until freshman year of hs. Between that, weight loss, and starting testosterone as a transman that didn't pass well pre-t but now passes very well, I definitely get treated a lot better.",False,False

Went from being underweight to over weight then panicked and developed a bad bing purge habit and went to obese. Working my way back down but damn it’s hard yoyoing so much throughout my life.

People who didn't know me at my heaviest treat me nicely/ smile at me  and I always get a little weirded out by it just because I'm so used to being ignored or getting disgusted looks from people. I'm always on guard even when people are being genuinely nice to me just because I'm used to people being nice to me out of a malicious ulterior motive.  I've also found that people who did know me at my heaviest and have seen me lose a ton of weight now seem to take passive aggressive digs at my weightloss or have straight up stopped talking to me even though nothing changed friendship wise. I basically used to be everyones DUFF until I lost the weight.,False,False

It was night and day. Partially because it was middle school, but people were HORRIBLE to me at my high weight. I couldn't walk down the hall without someone laughing in my face or something. When I got really thin, I got teased a little for that too but overall people were much nicer. I was kind of disturbed realizing how many guys are only nice to girls they're attracted to.

Sometimes I look at old photos of myself and wonder how I let myself look like that (the answer is being waaay better at the binging side of things than the restricting bc lord knows I never had a healthy relationship with food) but it's definitely less of a wow look how far I've come! Thing and more of a if I hadn't let myself be so gross I would be where I want to be already  I get/got a lot comments about weightloss - small town so people i hadnt even talked to before felt the need to comment and it just made me so much more aware that people see me and categorise me by my weight,False,False
