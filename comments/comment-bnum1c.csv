That's never an appropriate comment to say, to anyone!!!! I'm currently relapsed with my eating disorder (i'm 29F) and I first had my eating disorder in high school. When I started to recover back then, and start to feel good and not feel the need to restrict or weigh myself and felt FREE, I was trying on some new school clothes and asked my mom if she liked my outfit and she said ""so did you gain all that weight back already?"" ......it made my insides shatter and I instantly went back to that panic mindset of obsessing over and over of how much I won't be eating the day and the day after that and how late I will stay up exercising in my room. That was over 10 years ago and I can still feel the sting of that comment.",False,False

You made SO much progress even just getting back to listen to your body and eat. Some people will always have something to complain about. We are proud of you ♡,False,False

I hope you can enjoy your vacation and the time leading up to it despite what she said ❤️",False,False
