Is it a good idea for me to keep tracking and eating at 2000kcal a day if Iâ€™ve taken my maintenance as 2500? I suspect my maintainence might be lower but Iâ€™m scared to drop calories further at risk of scaring myself (2000 was a good number for me psychologically). Am even more scared of still being stuck at this weight though.,False,True

Yes you might have fucked up but everyone falls off the wagon. Just pick yourself up and start from where you left off. Don't beat yourself up over it.   I'd advise not to fast, otherwise it might trigger a binge restrict cycle. Continue eating as you were before, and you'll probably be surprised that your binge won't make a difference! Especially if your binge was healthy food just consider that it was your body craving more nourishment and vitamins etc, and it will help you study for your a levels! You don't need hunger and brain fog getting in the way!   Honestly you've got this. You can do it again. Don't look at this stumble as ""I only managed 2.5 weeks binge free"", rather it should be ""in 17 days, 16 of those were binge free"". That's a great achievement and you can keep it going! ðŸ’ª",False,False
