I‚Äôm rounding the corner of a 48 hours fast; I haven‚Äôt eaten anything since Christmas dinner, so it‚Äôs not ~just water weight~  It sucks because I really didn‚Äôt go that hard *at all.*   Monday the 23rd was my birthday, so I told myself for a long time that I‚Äôd just eat normally. Even still, I didn‚Äôt eat all day, and did over 3 hours of weights and cardio that day just so I could enjoy some Mexican food and margaritas that night (didn‚Äôt eat until about 9pm). So I only ate in like a 2-3 hour window. I even turned down ice cream and cake -_-  Tuesday the 24th I didn‚Äôt do any exercise and binged. Oops.  Wednesday the 25th I also didn‚Äôt work out, but I don‚Äôt think I ate *excessively.* Once again, I didn‚Äôt eat until dinner, and had a ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù amount (no more than anyone else at the table). But I told myself Christmas was it, since that‚Äôd be the last day of social events for a while.   Thursday the 26th I woke up feeling bloated and disgusting. Couldn‚Äôt bring myself to weigh myself. But I did fast all day, and once again did a ton of exercise. Fitbit says I burned over 3,000 calories for the day (yeah right...).   Finally weighed myself this morning, Friday the 27th, and I‚Äôm up seven fucking pounds since my birthday. I actually don‚Äôt even see how it‚Äôs possible, since I don‚Äôt feel like I overate *that* much. I‚Äôve had binge days/weeks in the past where I wake up and eat literally non-stop all day, and I never look this bad. It‚Äôs like a giant, 7 pound jiggly sack of fat was implanted right into my lower belly, and nowhere else. I have a picture of myself from last Friday, literally just one week ago, and I don‚Äôt even look like the same person. My stomach is like quadruple the size. Even after not eating for almost 2 full days it‚Äôs HUGE. I want to cry because I‚Äôm not even sure how this is physically possible.",False,False
