I‚Äôm now limited in where I can go to eat and what I can eat. I may get sashimi tomorrow which is fun.

I went through a cow‚Äôs milk phase and it didn‚Äôt do anything bad but nut milks are lower in calorie. I also may use the egg whites I have in the fridge. Egg whites and spinach could be nice for lunch tomorrow. I might start drinking coffee regularly again. It puts me in the best mood. I love stimulants but try not to use them too often because I don‚Äôt want to get used to them or anything. I would hate to build up a tolerance, plus my heart is sensitive.
