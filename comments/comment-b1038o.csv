When I was obese it was fine because I still just saw myself as ‚Äústill kinda fat‚Äù. A healthy weight? Still kinda fat. I‚Äôve lost 80lbs and feel the same as when I was obese, just kinda fat.

I mean still fat, but I thought my clothes hid it very well. I see pictures from back then and I was stunned- I never ever saw what I did in those pictures when I was looking in my full body mirror! I was a behemoth!!  I‚Äôm 250 now and I still think I look smaller than I am. I think I look the same as I did at 207 (gained it back- thanks BED).

If I'm in a fasted state I think I look AMAZING AND TINY, one bite of food and BOOM LAND WHALE. I'm probably in the middle and constantly lying to myself.",False,False

I would look at myself constantly and do forced body checks to make myself look thinner. Someone would take a picture of my and it would just destroy my whole world.   Now I see myself as being ‚Äòbig‚Äô in the mirror but when I see a picture of myself I feel like I look a lot thinner. ,False,False

Absolutely, it happens to me all the time.

The hospital I was at for my first couple php rehabs had a hallway with nothing but mirrors. We'd walk through there to get to other departments abus coming around the corner and seeing myself having gained even more weight (was already obese) would startle me.

When I was obese I had no idea! My mom thought I was just confident. But when I saw myself I was completely blind to it. Now I‚Äôm a normal weight, I can‚Äôt see the good. I feel HUGE.

I usually don‚Äôt like seeing pictures of myself and truly avoid seeing myself. But occasionally I‚Äôll feel like I look fairly decent and then I‚Äôll see a pic someone else took of me and want to crawl into a hole because I‚Äôm like 50X bigger in the picture then I thought. But I think bdd includes any kind of warped view of oneself: bigger, smaller, other colors (like that Rachael Delzell chick), height, etc. I think people with bdd have seriously different warped views of themselves and we‚Äôre all different.
