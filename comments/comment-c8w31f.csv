It makes it fun that way too, like having a hobby. I like to peruse vegan blogs and find new recipes to try, or things to recreate. Chocolate Covered Katie is a good one. She specializes in desserts, but all of her stuff is made with whole foods and is also generally low in calories. Or like, I went to this super hipster wine bar this past week with friends while I was visiting back home and had vegan ‚Äúlox‚Äù that were made with carrot ribbons, so when I came home I figured out how to recreate it. I‚Äôve been vegetarian (now vegan) for over 15 years, and let me tell you, there were hardly ANY products on the market back then. It doesn‚Äôt have to be all quinoa and avocado in 2019. You just have to put in some effort. And yes, it can still be low calorie as well.",False,False
