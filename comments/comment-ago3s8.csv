My two relapses started in the same month.  No idea why.  During September - December my ED kicks harder.  I often wonder if it's connected to how I get more depressed in winter, but even though I HATE heat and all that comes with summer in the Western hemisphere, it's my favourite time of year because it's easier to kick back at my ED.

I lose the best. I have seasonal depression in the winter that manifests as turning into a sad slug who doesn‚Äôt want to get out of bed and once it‚Äôs warmer i can go on my beloved long walks outdoors. that and all the fresh local produce that starts coming up in late spring early summer (i try to buy seasonal and local when i can) makes it so much easier to live off of raw fruit+veggies haha. ,False,False

I hate how cyclic my life has become. I'm always fat in the winter, usually because of treatment. Then I start relapsing, slowly but surely, throughout spring and summer. The end of summer for the last few years has been full of heavy restriction, extreme compulsive exercise, dangerously low weights, and an utter addiction to it all. Then I end up in treatment all over again, usually more or less dedicated to getting better, gaining weight under the watchful eye of medical professionals until I hate myself all over again and the cycle begins anew.  I hate it so fucking much. I don't want it to be like this for the rest of my life. I hope the cycle breaks when I turn 18 and leave home for university this year.",False,False

But yes I‚Äôve noticed a pattern, not just with ED but other MH issues too. I‚Äôm at my healthiest during spring and summer. Late September for some reason I often go a bit batshit, and most of my relapses, lowest weights and erratic behaviors and feeling out of sorts happen during the rapid decline of daylight, warmth and green... I‚Äôve hypothesized for a while now that there‚Äôs a link between my wellness and nature. As each leaf falls off the trees and each bee dies it seems to coincide with little pieces of my sanity also falling away and dying!

I‚Äôm feeling it early this year, I‚Äôm already getting my shit together and I wonder how much the lighter evenings can take credit for that! &lt;3",False,False
