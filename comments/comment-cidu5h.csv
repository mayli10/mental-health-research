Sometimes I catch the merest glimpse of myself and feel like I ought to be concerned. But then I'm like, ""Enh I'll look fat again in just a sec,"" and I do.   Over the years it's gotten so hard for me to catch these glimpses at all, though, that I currently only get them in one particular window at night. I can also get them from inverting the colors in photographs and blurring my face out and mixing up the pics with other people so I can't tell which is me. ://// What even is body dysmorphia",False,False

I think it's when I have a moment of depersonalisation where I don't recognize myself in the mirror. It's like when you put on glasses for the first time and being amazed at how different things are supposed to look, but it only stays like that for a second or two. Then it goes back to normal and I go back to thinking I look horrible.  It's kinda sad, I've been getting these moments more and more over the last few years, maybe because I've been in therapy for reasons other than my ED (but definitely connected to it).",False,False

Sometimes I see them and am alarmed at how boney and small I’ve gotten - then in other outfits/angles and I literally look overweight.

Body dysmorphia fucking sucks. Last weekend I went to the beach with my boyfriend, and he took some pictures of me while I was tanning and I swear to God I look seriously ill.
