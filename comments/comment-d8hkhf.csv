I was losing steadily and exercising 5+ miles a day, sometimes doing a 5 mile morning walk and hitting the gym in the afternoon to run on the treadmill. I could do it because I stayed around a 1000 cal deficit so I could eat ~1600 a day.",False,False

Before getting back into recovery, she was eating 2200 calories a day, but she exercised so much that she was underweight and losing. Get up in the morning, take a run, and then walk all day, and then go to the gym. She ate enough that she wasn't totally exhausted all the time, but not enough to actually fuel her body and keep her from losing weight. When she was doing that, I had my 500 per day calorie limit and could barely keep up with her. We'd take walks together and I'd end up needing to sit down because the way that I restricted my intake (and because I purged w/ laxatives and vomiting rather than exercise) made it difficult for me to walk continuously. Different behaviors lead to different symptoms is all.",False,False
