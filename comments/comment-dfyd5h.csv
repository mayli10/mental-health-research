My husband and I have very different schedules so it is easy to say I already ate, or my favorite ""one of the side effects of this med is loss of appetite.""  I figure in terms of farther down the line..I'm going to mention my Doctor mentioned ""adjusting"" my diet due to cholesterol/high blood pressure, WITHOUT bringing ""weight"" into it, so as not to raise eyebrows or exhellerate suspicions, etc...which everything about my high blood pressure is pretty much true from my doctor.   The sad part is, with being anorexic previously and relapsing a few times (never formally diagnosed...and no one really ""knew"" I had an ED...) I KNOW every trick in the book. I manipulate easily and can trick others to think I'm eating when I'm not...  Pretty sick, huh?  Not going to lie. The hunger is excruciating, but I have not yet reached the point where it ""numbs"" and you can hardly feel it. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",False,False

Eventually the hunger pains go away.   I have yet to feel faint or sluggish.   When I first was anorexic, when I was 15..I barely ate anything. My mom gave me lunch money everyday and I hid it in a sock in my drawer. Anytime food was made. I hid it. All over my room, mainly the closet...gross.  It amazes me how long some people, myself included can go without actual food. I mean, when I ""binged"" it was on like cheerios or grapes. Or a slice of cheese.",False,False
