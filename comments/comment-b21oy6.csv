I used to drink a lot and my husband and I go to bars frequently. More for the social aspect, to meet up with friends, see live music, etc. but I haaaate alcohol lately. It‚Äôs so wasteful and I‚Äôd rather spend the calories on food, plus too much alcohol triggers binges for me. But I also don‚Äôt want to be the weirdo that doesn‚Äôt drink anything. I try to find the middle ground by ordering a light beer and drinking it super slowly. Or by ordering water with a lemon or like so it looks like vodka and I don‚Äôt get weird stares. I‚Äôve tried ordering vodka w/ club soda but I get anxious because I‚Äôm not sure how to calculate the calories in the vodka if they over or under pour. ",False,False

Obvs not the answer for everyone but besides that I would just ignore them - not eating a lot makes me a lightweight anyway so after like 3 drinks I'm drunk and don't really need to drink more. I just have to space them out otherwise I sober up and get sleepy early if I chain-drink them straight away.   Alternatively, I would just buy some nice booze (like a really nice whiskey) and just drink a glass as a treat at the end of a work week - I don't want to drink heaps of it cause $$$ but the \~luxury\~ feeling of sipping a glass of nice booze while I watch a show/browse the net and relax is great and super good for unwinding.",False,False
