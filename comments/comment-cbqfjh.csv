This is called the binge restrict cycle. If you were to eat a normal amount of food throughout the day your binges should stop or become less frequent. I know your unhappy with your weight but restricting is only making it worse. I was there, very overweight and constantly binging. I eventually lost the weight by doing assorted diets and low restricting but at a certain point I couldn't keep going. I would restrict for a month to a few weeks and then binge then back to restriction and feeling ashamed of my failure.  Recently I've been giving recovery a real try and it's been mostly great. I have great energy, focus and my hunger isn't crazy. This is because I make sure I eat every few hours and that I'm not eating too little for the day. I'm not weighing myself but I'm sure I'm gaining but that's ok. I'm after the energy , focus, and feeling good that comes with allowing myself to eat enough thought the day. That and not obsessing about food all the time anymore.   If your interested I'd check out intuitive eating. I'm not 100% on board yet but I'm getting there. It's basically allowing yourself to eat what you want and never restricting. Once you stop restricting the pull to binge diminishes since your body know that whatever food isn't going away and it won't need to store extra fat for the upcoming famine / restriction period. The part I have trouble with is the allowing yourself to eat anything. Like if I get sweets I still binge on those so I don't buy them as often. With intuitive eating I should allow myself to have the sweets till I don't want them anymore. Currently I eat anything I want as much as I want but just not sweets and junk food. I still got work to do but it's a hell of a lot better then restricting me so I'll take it.",False,False
