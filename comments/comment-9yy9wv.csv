That way you realize it isn't fat gained, but just water being retained due to carbs or sodium etc. ",False,False

But tbh would not recommend as it usually just leads to more binging lmao. Buuut I still do it anyway because I'm dumb af.  It sure is a mystery as to why I've been maintaining these past few months amarite. Hmm...  One ritual thingy which I do though, every single time without fail, is I have a hot shower or bath after a binge, and do something like a face mask. Just something that makes me feel clean and renewed. Like a fresh start after the binge.  I would recommend eating slightly more tommorow, and not being too hard on yourself. If you restrict too low it might just send you back to binging. Which will just make you feel waaay worse. And you could get stuck in a binge restrict cycle.   Not too sure though.   Gonna follow this thread for inspo because I too have binged today (after fasting, coincidence much, ahaha) ",False,False
