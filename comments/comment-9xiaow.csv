I'm honestly really upset at the loss of the sheer amount of resources pro/ED had, like the links to all the ED books and recovery workbooks. Hell, I downloaded and used a DBT workbook from the sub when I was going through a really rough time and could barely cope.",False,False

I'm a software dev and I think I can fix this. There's a *great* site called pushshift.io and the person behind it has been archiving all of reddit for the past few years. Everything is available there (though the data is absolutely huge, hundreds of gigabytes). This weekend I'm going to download everything and filter it to just ProED/ProEDMemes and then create a super compressed version in a more human (maybe a website? I can't host it on my home connection otherwise I'll probably get my connections suspended) format.  Hang in there!!",False,False
