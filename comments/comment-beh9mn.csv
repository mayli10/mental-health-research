Over a decade. Well, she not “just” someone but you know what I mean. Her and Amy Preskow really hit home for me in terms of either their mentality or the (obviously toxic) familial environment they grew up in. Amy, thankfully, seems to be doing a lot better now and her family is very supportive of her recovery. She even has a blog post talking about how horrible Intervention made her and her family look. I guess finding Amy’s blog late last year and seeing that she’s doing so much better, to see this in contrast is just really sad. I didn’t know her from adam, but no one deserves to live that kind of life. She is one of the worst cases of bulimia I’ve ever seen. She was deeply stockholm syndrome-d by her disorder.  I’ll be honest, I naively thought “she’s young enough, she’ll get better” but she didn’t. It just makes me reevaluate all my lifestyle, and then feeling helpless knowing that i don’t know how to stop. Which I’m sure she felt at times. I’m not only sad for Aimee and her loved ones, to have to suffer through this, only to have her still succumb to her illness but it also reminds me that I could die under similar circumstances—as a result of my destructive behaviours.  It’s just sad and scary, the whole thing. Mental illness can be terminal. Never thought about it like that before.",False,True

She was one of the cases that truly scared me too. I couldn't imagine a life literally revolving around eating (up to 150 times a day) just to throw up. I just found out she had passed after looking up that post of the bulimic whose stomach ruptured on 2medusa, a site I used to frequent A LOT as a young teen (and I'm sure many here did too) which makes me feel... just makes the news that much more morbid.  &amp;#x200B;  She looked so sick and exhausted in that episode alone, I can't believe she went on to live another decade with this terrible illness. She had made numerous attempts to get better during that time, trying to get better for herself and her loved ones, but sadly none seemed to stick. I didn't know her but I am really heartbroken to hear she has died. You always hope these people will get better. A lot of these girls do recover, even if they still struggle. But sometimes they don't and it's awful. Even though her family probably knew deep down this was almost inevitable, I'm sure their grief is just as immense and I hope they can find comfort in knowing that she no longer has to struggle and suffer. I'm not particularly religious, but she and her family were and I truly hope she is happy now that she is with God and her soul is at peace.",False,True
