Whenever you first start eating more, your body needs time to adjust. You will be bloated and pretty uncomfortable for a while. It will go away.

In general I find that masturbating helps your sex drive and is an extremely good form of self care. It's really important to be sexually attracted...to yourself? lol. Idk exactly how to describe it but I know it's really hard to get aroused with someone else if you're not feeling super comfortable/sexy/worked up in your own body. Try when you're most relaxed (like after a shower) and with a low effort method (vibrator) and you may find that you regain some of your craving for sex, which can carry over to your sex life with your boyfriend  Also, of course drinking a glass of wine helps get that tingly feeling going",False,False
