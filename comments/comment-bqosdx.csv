Most people don‚Äôt even think about how many calories a sweet potato has. Sweet potatoes are full of vitamins and energy that most people take for granted.   It‚Äôs not about how many calories you do or don‚Äôt consume. It‚Äôs how you feel after consuming them. You are deserving of treatment no matter your weight or how much you eat in a day. Your relationship with your body and food is unhealthy and you deserve the attention of doctors to help heal you.,False,False

Absolutely, it's the *mindset* that is super dangerous, because you don't know where to stop and you don't *want* to stop.",False,False

You know the subs. They're dotted with people with EDs who don't know it or don't admit it to themselves.  I know a girl with an eating disorder who doesn't eat below 1300 a day and she exercises to shit.   I agree with pinkbrightwhite, any worthy doctor knows to help you.",False,False

Be honest at your appointment tho. It's a commom thing with mental illnesses that we think 'I am not sick enough or others are way sicker than I, so I don't deserve to be treated'. But thats bs luckily. Even after only reading your post, I can feel your pain. No good doctor will send you away! I send you lots of love and a internet hug üòò.",False,False
