When I fast I get so incredibly nauseous now and terrible stomach pain and then when I eat again I get gastroparesis. My GP and the specialist I went to both agree it’s probably from my ED. :(  Getting older and staying disordered is rough.,False,False

Would eat a couple hundred calories at most each day. Would go to dance classes, come home and run 2 miles in the evenings. All while earning perfect grades in school, journaling, keeping up a social life.   Now I cycle between bingeing and restricting and don’t have the energy for anything and can barely keep my life together. I have no idea how I handled it all before and I hate myself for it.",False,False

Even if I have a coffee, go to the gym, have a protein shake, some lunch and dinner by the time I have dinner I almost want to gnaw my arm off and I have to eat something. I probably eat too much. I'm eating around 1000 to 1300 but trying to burn at least 400 to 500 off a day.  I used to be able to restrict a lot more 10 years ago than I can now. IDK why.",False,False

Tracking really does help but it can be a double edged sword if you binge and have to look at it again. The to do list is a good idea that I’ll probably have to try out though:)",False,True
