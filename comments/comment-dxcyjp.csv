But I‚Äôve found that some apps are completely customizable (usually if you pay like 4 bucks or so a month).   I only use food that I‚Äôve confirmed is correct from the packaging. Or I create my own food entry with the exact nutrition values. I have a food scale so In the app I switch the UOM to grams and just enter what I‚Äôd like.   I still use notes to track my run lengths, calories per mile, and weight associated that day even though I have an Apple Watch. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",False,True
