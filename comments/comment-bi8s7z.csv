When I was trying to create safe foods for myself, I would eat that food and then make sure to go somewhere where purging was a no-go or maybe going somewhere with friends or other things to distract/make purging impossible. That helped the anxiety go down and eventually that food was ""safe"" and I didn't have to purge it. OMADing that food/meal also helped make it safe. I don't think you deserve any shaming and I know you said you won't take any advice, but if you are not happy with the idea of leading the bulimia life then I would suggest talking to someone you are close to or a therapist about it so that they can help you. Eating 1200 calories a day even without any purging would not make you gain weight under any circumstances, your eating disorder is distorting that in your head. I hope any of this was worth reading.",False,False
