I know I’m super skinny but my bloated stomach after eating or in the morning after days I’ve eaten to much throw me off but I fear the day I’m wearing something tight or revealing and someone may think I’m pregnant.   I was wearing my baby in a wrap with the other in the cart about a year ago when my youngest was a few months old and someone was chatting me up about how I was wearing my baby. She was wearing a skin tight dress and I almost asked her when she was due (looked noticeably pregnant) and then she told me her baby was 3 months and she wanted the baby wrap I had to wear her baby  I was soooooooooooooooooo glad I didn’t ask!!!!! I can’t even imagine the awkwardness and mortification if I would have. It honestly makes me cringe to think about how close I was to asking ,False,False

I went to my husband’s work party thing and the next day he said some of the girls said I was “so tiny!” And it totally threw me off guard! Like, I’m pretty average...",False,False
