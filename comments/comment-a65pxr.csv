I keep convincing myself that I'm too fat. Everytime I eat 300+ Cal's for a meal and don't put or just binge without purging and fail my compensatory fast I feel like I'm full of shit and making up having a problem. I feel like because I'm chubby and I'm healthy and have never once suffered a single health consequence in my 15 years of dealing with this so therefore I must be faking and there's no way this is a problem at all. I feel like it's helping me lose weight which is healthier than eating normally and gaining. I feel like if I were to try and eat normal then I would just end up gaining and would have never had anything to show for my efforts. Everytime I binge I feel like that's all I do and nothing else I do exists. ,False,False

I constantly walk over 20 km a day and have probably sprained my foot and tore a muscle in my thigh. Right now I‚Äôm sick as fuck and it‚Äôs now going on two weeks and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm not eating healthy and resting but I keep going. And I keep feeling weak and exhausted but since I‚Äôm not at my goal weight I‚Äôm not slowing up.  This weekend I‚Äôm so screwed. I‚Äôm too sick to go anywhere so I‚Äôll be at home with my mom who wants to make two insanely calorically dense dinners plus would notice if I didn‚Äôt eat breakfast and lunch or went on my treadmill all day.  If anyone has suggestions please let me know. My BMR is like 1200 so I don‚Äôt have a lot of wiggle room.,False,False

I have, in the past and in general, reached out for help/medication etc. in regards to depression and anxiety and have considered at times self-diagnosing all sorts of random shit: the possibly that I have some disorder/difference/whatever such as Borderline Personality Disorder, OCD, Autism, Agoraphobia, ADHD... being a hypochondriac (HAHA!) etc. etc.   I think I spend way more time thinking about all that rather than being seriously honest with myself about my personal ""Eating Disorder Symptoms"". Despite being so active on this sub. So.... maybe I do think about it??? I feel like I don't though. When it comes to me-doing-me, I just, IDK, I feel like striving for a low weight is *safe* and *important* so... even though I have to sacrifice things and feel anxiety.... I **deserve it** or **should**. Ugh, yuck that sounds pretty terrible.  I *""barley""* restrict  I only take pseudoephedrine every once and a while @ a low dose  and I keep my use of substances ""under control"" (no ""HARD"" drugs)   I don't purge in any sort of way   I have never been anywhere near underweight BMI   I've never spoken to a professional about it. I've barely ever spoken about my symptoms/habits to anyone who cares about me  I have all sorts of baggage around perfectionism, anxiety, concerns about what it means to be neurotypical etc etc I guess somehow whatever my deal is is too mixed up with that. I don't know if thats quite the same things as feeling like I don't have a problem...but I feel so much guilt and fear about even considering that I have a severe problem... because I just ""don't"". I don't know what my answer to ""do I want to get better (in regards to certain habits)"" is.  :////////////////////////////////////  ",False,False
