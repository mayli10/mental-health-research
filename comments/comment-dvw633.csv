There‚Äôs just too many people who need help and not enough clinics.  üòï What about just a weekly therapist in the meantime? I feel like most of us end up with EDs because of other issues we have going on, maybe it‚Äôll help you a bit? I also think DBT might be worth looking into, if you can find a program. I did it before I had eating issues and I find that those tools are pretty helpful when I‚Äôm not too deep in a spiral.",False,False

I know it makes her look like she doesn‚Äôt consider my disorder severe enough, but I understand that there are people suffering with anorexia, bulimia etc. that are on that waiting list who are potentially at risk of dying.",False,True

I‚Äôm very motivated to switch to a more natural, whole foods based diet especially as my dinners are on the lower nutrition side often comprising of something I pull out of the freezer. I could be making excuses but I tell myself I don‚Äôt have the time to cook with fresh ingredients after I go to work so I end up eating more processed foods.   However, this discussion has inspired to me to compile a list of meals I can cook from scratch that I can make after work. If I have a plan I‚Äôll be ok. I love onions and beans, I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs already a base for hundreds of wholesome dishes!",False,True

I don't really know since I don't know your TDEE.   I've naturally lost extra weight over the 5 years of being vegan without really restricting at all, I just changed to more whole foods. So that's my biggest tip. I do know someone who became anemic and lost her period from eating veggie, but she ate a lot of junk food and relied on coffees.",False,False

I also eat about that amount right now, but I maintain at about 1900-2100 depending on activity. What I've found is that I really need to pack in the nutrition in the amount of calories I consume, I need to be more mindful than say, a meat eater. I usually rely on whole foods and don't drink coffee/teas that inhibit iron absorption. Pack in the veggies and try to have more legumes, they are very filling as well!",False,False

I really don‚Äôt want to go back to eating meat permanently so that‚Äôs a huge relief.   My diet has definitely been varied and I would usually eat around 1200 calories a day.

I've been vegetarian for over 10 years and vegan for 5 and I've only ever lost my period or gotten a really light one when under eating either by accident or by restriction. I did the banana diet a few years back (lol) and I lost my period for a while but it came back when I started eating other foods.
