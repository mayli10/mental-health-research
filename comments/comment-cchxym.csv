Idek if that's right but I am pretty active, I walk a lot when I can. My BMR is like 1,300.",False,True

I've been disordered for a few years so my body is all kinds of fucked up. The tdee calculators I've used say I can maintain with 1580 but I gain if I eat that much... I actually maintain at 1300.. maybe that's what's going on...,False,False

Week one - my weight was the exact same not even an ounce difference   Week two- I lose one pound   Week three- I gained three pounds   It’s SO frustrating and I wanted to give up so bad, but instead I didn’t weigh myself for the next three weeks, then when I did I lost 15 pounds.   A lot of factors could go into your weight. If you’re weighing everything and tracking accurately, then you probably didn’t actually gain pounds from fat during this time. Anytime we start a new routine our bodies need time to adjust. And like another person already mentioned this could be due to hormonal changes or water weight. Trust the process and give it more time.",False,False

I know that it can be incredibly frustrating when weeks of grueling, hard work don't translate into the results you want. Just off the top of my head - maybe the weight gain is a result of your period coming? I gain around 2 pounds or more everytime my period comes, but when its gone the pounds just whoosh off. Also, when was the last time you had a BM?   Best of luck, my friend.",False,False
