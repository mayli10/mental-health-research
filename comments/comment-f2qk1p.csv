At my lowest weight when i was so underweight i was so skeletal my hip bones were still too wide for tiny jeans and i had a huge meltdown in a uniqlo dressing room.

I don't tend to lose weight, I tend to gain it. Starving/restricting myself only made me fatter because of all the stress and my metabolism slowing down.  I've known people who eat more than 2000 a day, don't exercise and still don't gain weight.  It is the way it is.",False,True

A healthy woman should eat around 2000 if not some more, and for men it's close to 3000 if they're tall.  You might say this comparing to other people who restrict, but they are looking at it from a health perspective and also trying to appeal to large audiences, so they talk from regular people's POV. Lacking almost a thousand calories a day will affect your health.  But yes, I think this program needs a lot of improving, this should be one of the points they talked about some more. They show a lot of people who intake more than 1000 calories a day, which for some anorexics could be a victory win.",False,True

Like, that’s not small at all.   But I also read somewhere that the show lies about the amount of calories for the super skinnies so it won’t “trigger” people.",False,False

I love the diet swap, I think it's the most important part in showing each side of the spectrum about  relationship with food. How the fat ones get mad at the skinnies for not being able to finish their plate and skinnies making excuses not to eat  their gigantic meals. I adore the way both don't seem to notice how they are behaving over food.",False,True

I sometimes feel like you have to fit the stereotypes to fit in here. I relate so much to people on the show who only have a glass of coke for lunch or a candy bar. I restrict, but I also eat hella sugar. I'm not recommending it, but it's comforting to see other people who get called ""fit"" and probably get told things like ""you must eat so healthy"" because of how they look but they are actually existing on sugar and hunger highs. Not saying they all have EDs, people can have food issues without mental illness. Basically it's nice for me to be reminded that not everyone's food issues or disorder follows the same rules and that's okay. Even though I drink regular coke, that doesn't mean I don't have a problem and my stupid brain has to keep being reminded of that lol",False,False

Like a person who eats 1200 calories a day at... let’s say my height (5’4.5”, very average, with light exercise). If I eat like that everyday, I will lose at first quickly, then more slowly. I will be at a deficit for a very long time and become severely underweight before I stop losing.   Being honest, a lot of people with EDs, will tend to binge once in a while. Binge restrict cycles are extremely common. These create an unfortunate up and down where many people end up at nearly neutral or cycle weight. Some people will notice their loss slow down a little for other reasons, including things like lower activity even if binging is rare. I notice if I’m too hungry I tend to spend more time in bed...   The Superskinnies have often been eating low amounts over a long period of time, often paired with an active lifestyle. Even if it’s as much as 1400-1500, over a handful of years that tends to keep their weight down.   The unfortunate reality this community has helped me come to terms with is that EDs often sabotage the one goal we seek the most. If anything, the show is a testament to how one can lose weight without necessarily going to extremes, but through a daily moderate deficit.",False,False

They *are* thin compared to average population.  And could we maybe swap bone structures? I'm very small boned and therefore need to be really *really* underweight to have like my ribs/collarbones/hip bones sticking out. Yeah I have thin as fuck wrists even in higher weights but I'd rather have visible ribs :'),False,False

But...how can that be too much when it's like a binge to me? How did they get so skinny eating almost 1500 calories???,False,False

Basically my summarization is most of the underweight participants lead very busy lives and do not have time to think about eating or are ortho. Just my opinion.,False,False

Bone structure plays a huge role in how you look while emaciated.   A turning point for me was when they went on about one contestant’s BMI being “Waaaay too low!!” And I was like “Oh mine is much lower... shit.”  I /do/ wish they’d put more focus on EDs instead of just shame-scaring the heavy contestants tho.,False,False
