I remember when, after many weeks of turmoil with food, I finally made the uncomplicated decision to get a chocolate froyo with each topping that caught my eye. I knew it was going to be delicious and enjoyable and a relief to just have something I like without stressing over it.   As the lady is putting on the last few toppings, a friendly acquaintaince (who has commented on my lack of eating before) said ""ooh, you're treating yourself today!!""   Yes, I was. Fuck you for ruining. üôÉ",False,False

One time I went to my mom's for lunch after fasting for three days and went back for another half bowl of soup (It was all veggies, so no more than 200 calories for a whole bowl) and my mom was like ""Wow, you sure are hungry!"" Meanwhile she's over there eating just one bowl, but with tons of bread and butter, so easily 900+ calories and I'm like wtf?",False,False

I used to eat a lot of high volume but low cal foods to feel really full but stopped because my mom would always comment on how much I‚Äôm eating... it feels silly to complain about having to eat a normal portion size but at the same time there‚Äôs nothing better than absolutely demolishing a heaping plate full of steamed broccoli ://,False,False

No because he doesn‚Äôt think he did anything wrong.

Luckily thats really the only thing she has ever really called me out on but my dad does often. Funny thing is that he eats like shit.

Ok 500g of broccoli is a lot but i had logged and planned for it so i don't see why she even cared. It frustrates me.
