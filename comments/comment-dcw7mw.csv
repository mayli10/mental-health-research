Yeah, the behaviors themselves are technically our choices, but there's also a proven genetic component to EDs and all addiction issues really. It's an illness. You don't accuse people with depression of choosing that (unless you're a shitty person, which there definitely are those people who say it's your fault for being depressed).",False,False
