Anyways, I’ve been both underweight and overweight. I’ve experienced several instances of fat shaming, yet when I was skinny I was praised, I got more attention, people were nicer to me. Sure, my grandma would tell me hey you’re too skinny eat a cheeseburger, but that shit does not at all whatsoever compare to the shame and hatred I received on a daily basis when I was overweight. So, yeah. If it even exists.",False,False

And skinny shaming is a thing a lot of people suffer from. Not just those with EDs. Excluding ""skinny bitches"" from the club is exactly what happened to ""fat bitches"" and why the entire positivity movement occurred.  At the end of the day, it's about the unattainable and harmful expectations placed on women, and we're all shamed, no matter what we look like. Skinny shaming has been around just as long as fat shaming, because we've never liked what weight anyone is, we love to pick them apart. The only difference is now, ""skinny bitches"" are dismissed because there's some sort of competition going on as to who has it worst for whatever reason, and the real point of ""all women with any body"" having it the worst is the real problem. I'm not dismissing either side, I'm sympathetic to the problem of fat shaming, and think body positivity is great, except when it comes at the price of ridiculing someone else repeatedly until the entire narrative is changed, and only fat is considered healthy. Subtle aggressions like ""skinny bitches"" are thrown around, and if you're a skinny bitch, you can't get irritated about that term, you're fatphobic, but if you're a fat one, you're somehow better now .. Which is what essentially happened.",False,False

How many posts are there in this sub about the massively triggering comments people make criticizing the bodies of underweight people? People do deliberately go out of their way to shame others, especially women, about their size. One could argue that it comes from a place of jealousy rather than disgust the way fat shaming does, but it's weight-based bullying.   If your argument is that fat shaming is more common and socially reinforced, then okay... but you're also talking about there being 50x more overweight and obese people than there are underweight, so of course there are fewer instances of thin shaming. That doesn't mean it doesn't exist, or that it's not harmful, or that it's not gaslighting to tell people who have experienced something that it doesn't exist.   Body positivity being for everyone means it is *for everyone*. Using derogatory terms for thin people while claiming that thin shaming doesn't exist is, like... it's kinda bizarre. ""Don't make shitty comments about others' weights"" should not be a huge ask, especially on the topic of body positivity, and even more so in a sub for eating disorders.",False,False
