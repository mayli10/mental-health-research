Part of why I keep returning to my restrictive behavior is because when I do I’m so much more effective. I’m better at my job and in my relationships. My house is always tidy. I do more of the things I’ve always meant to get to. I’m more social. And as a perfectionist that gets me high. I know that’s usually the opposite of what people experience but for me restricting seems to bring out my best.",False,False

No official ED diagnosis, mostly because I never brought it up in therapy and because I don't feel like I would be taken seriously because I have a high BMI.

Because my BPD tells me if I am not perfect,  I am not worth loving. Everyone I know and care about will hate me etc etc etc.  I usually count calories/macros in MFP and it does make my brain freak out to see that that I gone over my calories or ate too much fat or sugar. The hardest thing in the world is to cut myself a break. Going 300 calories over my budget is not the end of the world. It's maintaining and that is okay.   My problem is that I want to lose weight and lose weight fast (because I want to be perfect. I want to be good at everything. I want people to praise and validate my fucking existence.

Sometime in my senior year of high school I decided that I would try to stop caring about having a consistent aesthetic, and then after that I would get comments from people about how different I look from day to day (especially in college, when I was switching back and forth between doing femme looks and doing more masculine looks).
