I prefer the slightly sweeter red onions as they cut through the spiciness pretty well)  \- Thai seasoning - I add very little chili powder because I'm a Weak Bitch but do you. It's a combination of cumin, black pepper, hot chili powder, garlic powder, ground dried lime, paprika and a little turmeric. You 100% don't have to add every single different spice/herb. This is just the specific one I have.  \- 100ml ish of water  \- Any veg you want. Mushrooms and red or green bell peppers work really really well, green beans are good too. The only thing that hasn't worked is baby corn but tbh I'm not a huge fan of that in general so that might just be me. You can basically put any vegetables in this, though. Cut the vegetables fairly chunkily.  &amp;#x200B;  Method:  &amp;#x200B;  \- Fry the onion by itself for a minute or two  \- Add the vegetables, spices, ginger, and lemongrass. Cook until they're relatively soft (3 or 4 minutes? I do prefer the veg to be a bit crunchier so cook for longer if you prefer softer veg)  \- Add the light coconut milk and cook for 3 or 4 minutes  \- Add the water and stock. Keep it simmering for 10-15 minutes (should have reduced a bit but still be very soupy and creamy)  \- Add the soy sauce right at the end and serve! This makes enough for two or three portions - I can't say whether it freezes well as I haven't tried that, but it does keep in the fridge for a couple of days.",False,False

Lately I've been eating a lot of Crave Frozen Dinners because they're shockingly healthy and actually kinda good.

It definitely doesn't account for the amount of variety that you have, but considering that I try to eat a little extra carbs to help with my migraines and also that it accounts for all my of my daily recommended nutrients it's perfect for me. I also figured that on weekends I could just stick to the supplements and eat whatever I want. That should still get me 80% to 90% of my recommended nutrients.",False,False
