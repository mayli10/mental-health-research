I live in a city so itâ€™s nice to be able to walk longer distances to get errands done, that way I donâ€™t feel like a slob. But lately Iâ€™ve got a depressive episode which is the WORST because when Iâ€™m depressed I just lay in my bed and sleep so then I feel like a mushy fat blob.   Good call on the electrolytes and everything haha. Iâ€™ve noticed many symptoms getting worse from purging and restricting recently. Thank you for looking out, it really does mean a lot. Friends know that Iâ€™ve dealt with my ED in the past, but thatâ€™s just it, they believe itâ€™s in the past. Itâ€™s nice to come on here and vent, and itâ€™s even nicer when I can talk to someone directly about it! I hope you have a wonderful day ðŸ’–",False,True
