If you do that, try to eat it without distractions like tv or music. Pour a nice drink (0 cal if you have to) and take a sip every bite or two. Take small bites and let it sit in your mouth to get the flavors. Even if you don't eat the whole slice, give your ED a subtle ""fuck you"" and enjoy something you've been craving",False,False
