A lot of people liked to call me a “chipmunk”. At first I thought it was cute because chipmunks are cute until one day, I saw a skinny girl get complimented for looking like a Disney princess.  It wasn’t until seventh grade when I decided to lose weight. Kids are vicious.",False,False

She herself is a wonderful person but she has her own demons that I inherited and am now trying to exorcise. I've gotten rid of the hording and basic bad housekeeping and now all I have left is the body and food problems. I'll get there eventually!",False,False

I was on a T-ball team probably 1st or 2nd grade (age 6-7 in case you don't know the American system). Me and the other girls were hanging out near the field and one had flipped over the bucket we kept the balls in and was sitting on it. When she got up i wanted to sit on it and she told me I couldn't because I was bigger than her and it couldn't handle my weight. We were the two smallest girls on the team but she asked me what I weighed and when I told her she said she weighed 5 pounds less than me. And this was in front of all the other kids.    Why that stuck with me for 20 years I'll never know but here we are.,False,False

Or when you have to get weighed in front of everyone and are twice the weight of your best friend, also in 3rd grade.  I would grab my fat rolls and ask my brother about them.

I hit puberty early so I had boobs before everyone else but I was still petite. Soffee(?) shorts were in so I always wore the and I was sitting in the kitchen and I remember telling my mom that my thighs were big when I sit down. She basically just ignored me and said don’t say that.  8th grade. Came back to school from summer and got new jeans that were a size 2 instead of a size 0. Felt so bad about myself for a while until I lost the weight. I learned that it’s easier to eat less at school because my lunches consisted of a Powerade and a bag of cheese it’s from the vending machine because it wasn’t cool to bring a lunch and I never had time for breakfast. Also no girl wants to chow down in front of all the boys of course!! During the summer I would just snack all the time.,False,False

Saw pics of me at field day and bawled my eyes out that my stomach wasn’t perfectly flat like some of the other girls.

I noticed my stomach stuck out and started worrying that I was fat. Then around six or seven I saw that my stomach wasn't sticking out anymore and I told my mom excitedly and she was happy for me.
