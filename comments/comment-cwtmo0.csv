From your post, I'd say you qualify (being fat is your worst fear, small meals and calorie fixation, you're underweight but think you're fat, and your caloric intake is likely far below your maintenence). If you don't have a PCP, it may be good to establish care so they can keep an eye on your health.",False,False

A lot of the behaviors you described are very common in eating disorders and an eating disorder isn’t about the number of calories you eat.   I would recommend seeing someone who specializes in eating disorders (not just your PCP) if your healthcare situation allows it. Good luck!",False,False
