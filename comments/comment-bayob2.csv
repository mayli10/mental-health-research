This Christmas was the first in a few years I didn‚Äôt purge at. Last year however, I was very drunk and was awkwardly hiding food on my plate, like VERY awkwardly and my boyfriend even asked what I was doing. After dinner I was so uncomfortable that I purged and walked up to my boyfriend and said I made myself puke because I ate too much.

She instinctually knew I wasn't okay, but I was so manipulative that I made her question whether she could trust her own perception.

It‚Äôs a big deal every year and they make tons of food and desserts and cocktails and invite like 25 people, all close friends but who are significantly older than me. I was uncomfortable the whole time I was there, had no one to make conversation with, and hadn‚Äôt eaten very much for days and really weeks prior, so I stayed by the food. And ate.   I didn‚Äôt even gorge myself in hindsight, but I had a couple drinks already, and after realizing what I had done I thought to myself ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to be able to get rid of all this here or back at my dad‚Äôs without someone seeing. I‚Äôm going to get absolutely trashed so that when I do throw up I can blame it on the alcohol.‚Äù And so I did. And made a fool of myself at the party in front of my dad and family friends. And that the immense shame I felt when my dad was holding my hair out of the way while I threw up seven strawberry cosmos (I don‚Äôt even LIKE cosmos) and who knows how many glasses of Pinot Grigio into his toilet at home was still better than feeling like I had somehow gained ten pounds in a night was a really hard realization.   Now my dad watches me whenever I have a drink like a hawk, but at least he doesn‚Äôt know about my ed‚Äôs right haha ü§ô",False,False
