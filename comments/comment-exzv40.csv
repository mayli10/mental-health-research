(Coming at this as a legal adult who wants help, and of course perspectives/objectives vary.)   One benefit is that depending on your ED symptoms and experiences there can be meds that would be indicated or contraindicated. For example, some meds help some people with obsessive thoughts while other meds can have a higher risk of dangerous side effects in people dealing with restriction and/or purging (lookin’ at you Wellbutrin). Sometimes talking about what’s going on mentally and emotionally helps them fit the pieces together of what’s going on for you overall and what modes of treatment might be worth looking into. It’s fairly common for EDs to co-exist with other mental health issues, and identifying that can gradually provide some clarity about how to move forward.   Sometimes I’m in a healthier mindset about disclosing what’s going on with me than other times, so I try to take advantage of my more willing moments to get things on the table (even though future destructive me sometimes throws a fit). I learned the hard way that I have to consciously choose to make the effort to keep myself safe and give myself a shot at a life I feel content to live.",False,False
