I will make sure to drink plenty of water and am hoping to maybe try and get some fast food item with one of my friends before I go, since it’s easy to get some calories without eating a huge quantity.   I’m not sure if I’m quite scared of food, tbh, but this is the first time in my binge eating life that I really don’t want to eat. Four days later and I can’t see that changing quickly which is shaking me up. Regardless, I’m trying to keep my nutrition up so at least I have that going for me.   I am not planning on drinking too much at the party and have a lovely friend who is not planning on drinking much at all (like one beer at most) who will be Ubering home with me. So I will be safe in that way for sure!",False,True

I am trying to pick myself up as best I can. I’ve been so fortunate to have friends that have my back and are trying to keep me from feeling alone through all this.   I am visiting her today so I’m hoping that will be a good opportunity to realize that she’s going to get better and be okay. I haven’t seen her since the incident so I feel really lost. It’s weird when the apartment is empty and her absence is something I feel strongly.   I’ve been slowly but surely tidying up and doing normal chores and am trying to get back on my healthy plan, since I know that will be best to stick to long term. Been drinking a lot of my calories (in a good way) and might invite my friends to dinner before the party so I can get some heartier food in me before drinking drinking.   Thank you for the well wishes.",False,True

But don't let this bring you down. It's hard, but you'll see your girlfriend again. You will have the chance to share with her, and heal together.  Also, it's not because she is suffering that you can't suffer too. Don't let her pain invalidate yours. It's okay to feel like you do. But remember you won't feel like this forever and it will get better.   I really hope you can eat enough in the next days.   At least before drinking. Take care.",False,False
