I'm on medication that stops nightmares, well it's supposed to. It doesn't actually stops the nightmares, but I don't wake up and freak out. It stops the anxiety reactions, same with my PTSD during the day.  If anything Seroquel probably makes me sleep too much. But the valdoxan I'm on is a melatonin antagonist and creates melatonin without making me feel hung over like actual melatonin does.",False,False

Some keto folks say keto makes their skin clear, their depression disappear, helps them get better sleep and just overall makes them feel good and sharp and focused. Ridiculous cultism. I feel like I always do: some days tired, pretty much always pissed off lol. Keto is a *weight loss tool* for me. It has worked for me, and I’m pretty okay with the stuff I eat daily. I wouldn’t do it if it didn’t work as well as it does. Of course I gotta count my cals too. I don’t like the cult mentality, and I 100% get it if people find it too restrictive. It’s a shame to hear people have had bad experiences.",False,False

I had nightmares every night for years and it wasn't until I was put on a sleeping medication that I saw real improvement.

I really got into keto and intermittent fasting and all it did was make me hyper self critical, hyper restrictive and constipated. And I never lost any weight at all in 18 months because it turns out it was my medication making me fat and unable to lose weight, not sugar, carbs or evil, evil dairy.  So all I have to show for my foray into fasting is an ED that is more extreme and more self hate. I've made it easier on myself to not eat and I never have an appetite any more. These are really bad things for my health and sanity ongoingly.  I hate fasting so much now because my brain keeps trying to convince me to fast for weeks at a time. Good thing I'm good at distracting myself I guess",False,False
