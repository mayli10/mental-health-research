It would prolong the enjoyment of the treats more, vs trying to rush and feeling sick. I'd break them up into a dozen treats and call it The Twelve Days of Christmas, haha. Hmm... I love peppermint bark too and I agree, it's the perfect holiday flavor. I just know the ice cream parlor by me has All the Christmas Things and I'm so tempted bc ""it's the holidays.""  Slippery slope for me though. :)",False,False

I'd do them all at once but I don't know if that's actually good advice.",False,False
