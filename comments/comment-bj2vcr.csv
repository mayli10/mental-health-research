I started my walk on my Apple Watch and got 1.36 miles before the baby started crying so I had to stop and take care of her so I PAUSED my app and then I forgot to restart it!! I know I walked at least 4-5 miles based on how my legs felt but it wasnâ€™t recorded so it was as if it didnâ€™t even count!!  Then my stupid brain went home and binged because the whole thing was so stressful and upsetting ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©,False,False

At one point I was wearing two fitness trackers at the same time so that if one was charging the other was still tracking. In my mind, if I'm recording anything I must record every single thing, otherwise it's useless and the non-recorded activity did not happen.  I hope you're doing ok and don't get barred again.",False,False

I donâ€™t trust that itâ€™s accurate enough and I am afraid of eating back more calories than I spent.   My main reason though is that I high restrict anyway and I like the idea of exercise being a little bonus calorie subractor. Also, by not recording it I have a little bit of a buffer in my logging if I ever make any mistakes.",False,False

Definitely walked a lot but it didn't get recorded so I had to go work out at almost midnight to make up for it.,False,False
