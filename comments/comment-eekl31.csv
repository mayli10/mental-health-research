Your metabolism ""slows"" with weight loss, but only because you are smaller and need fewer calories to maintain. It doesn't slow just because you restricted.   &amp;#x200B;  When I switched to maintenance I increased my calories to a number higher than what I was eating before but still below maintenance just to be safe. Eventually I adjusted that to the number which allowed me to maintain.",False,False

I made the mistake of not doing that, and let me tell you the pain was fucking horrendous. Then having to deal with feeling heavier because of the food weight, hell would've been paradise.  As for weight gain, you will initially see an increase, but that'll be food/water weight. You'll be surprised how quickly your metabolism bounces back into proper form. It takes a couple days for your body to realise ""oh, we're getting energy on the regular, let's up the ante then"", but so long as you stick with the increase, your metabolism won't betray you.  My main issue has been gas. It was far worse at the beginning of the week and caused so much pain I thought I was going to throw up. I take probiotics which help, but they can only do so much. I'd introduce foods that are easier for the body to break down, so that excess gas and bloating is minimised. What foods that includes depends on what you've been eating and what your body is used to, but squishy foods are a good place to start.",False,False
