I developed this unhealthy relationship not so long ago (while I type this I feel like I want to puke)... my brain just totally disconnect when I touch food, is insane honestly, so I can understand... I’ll tried fasting today but ate 2 apples and I live alone but made the mistake to tell my father I was fasting so my sister came and bring food and well (they thing I didn’t eat because I didn’t had food at home)... I would recommend you trying eating healthy for a couple of days, I’m not much a fan of counting calories, I’m more the type of trying to eat as clean as I can so that’s what I would recommend you... maybe fruits? For the sugar cravings... 3 bananas, some apples and a salad with maybe a sweet mustard dressing... and then after that go lower and start cutting cals at day... ",False,False

As someone who started the same way as you (BED to restricting) the biggest thing I could say is to not beat yourself up if you go a bit over your limit. Like I used to eat up to 4000 a day (gotta love Depression Meals™) so eating a little over 2000 is nothing in comparison, right? Just be safe about it!",False,False

I wouldn't go below 2000 at first, just for a little while so your stomach can get used to normal amounts of food, and then go lower over time. And I'd recommend staying over 1000 total, since that's a big shift!",False,False
