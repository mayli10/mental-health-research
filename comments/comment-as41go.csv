I still desperately envied the average looking girls who had true friends and loving boyfriends and somehow didn't care that they had a little pooch or some thigh fat and magically the people around them didn't seem to care either?  I think the main issue is feeling like I didn't have inherent worth so I needed to make up for it by being as superficially attractive as possible. And then I look at those happy girls and I wonder why they DO have that inherent worth and don't even need to worry about all this shit. ",False,False

Adriana Lima ended up getting a divorce and left with 2 kids alone, many models who were tossed aside for their smarter, older counterpart (Clooney's ex's vs his current wife for example), and most successful billionaires with steady marriages have wives that are about the same in looks as them... i.e. Bill Gates, Zucc.  There is definitely more pressure against women in the silliest of things, but I remember the reality around me and realize maybe it's not all what it seems.",False,False

I don't want to sound cynical. I don't feel like its right to agree with you but I do. I have been on both sides and after a few years of telling myself it's fine, recovery is always better, I've come to the sad realization that I will never be as loved unless I fit a certain ideal. I never thought I would relapse again and the last two weeks have just rapidly gone downhill and yet I love it. I've done this enough to know I WONT love it in say, four months, but I honestly don't give a fuck. I just want to be thin and pretty again. I want people to be kind to me. I want my husband to state at me and tell me I'm beautiful  again. I know I sound shallow. Crazy how much your mindset can change in a month.",False,False

Until you're sad and tired all the time and you can't go on a date without spending 5 minutes ordering a salad to your specifications and taking the rest home. And your skin will wrinkle and you'll get extra hair all over your body, your breath will start to get bad. you won't be able to hold a proper conversation.

I've wasted most of my life hating myself and I regret it more than anything. I'm 25 and wish I hadn't had an ed for the last 15 years because it hasn't brought me anything I value at this point.

I had this false conception that I simply wasn't affected by what larger society wanted, and while I still can not give any less of a shit about a lot of body ideals, this post made me realize that it's undeniable that I care about some of them.   It's really sad things are this way; that whether a person is conscious of it or not - and at this point I'm not fond of assuming it's confidence first that made the difference - they judge what invisible qualities the person has based on what they look like. No one should have to feel bad about something that's largely out of their control, and it's really a shame that often this extends to personal value. No one should have to feel like they're nothing for not reaching a standard that most will probably fall out of simply by aging. ",False,False
