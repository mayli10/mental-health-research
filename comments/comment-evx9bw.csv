Ive been in and out of therapy for the last 7 years, and literally none of it has been directly focused on my EDs. My current therapist is the first one I’ve ever talked to about it at all, and she doesn't push me on it when i don't want to talk about it. If you don’t want to talk about it, you don't have to bring it up. If they do ask you about it, I’d encourage you not to lie about it, but you can tell them that you came to them for help with your depression and that’s what you’d like to focus on. Also, as long as you’re stable and not at risk of immediately hurting yourself (or someone else), they legally can’t tell anyone what you talk about; it’s a HIPPA violation and they could lose their job and be sued for an insane amount of money.  Honestly, for me, doing therapy for anxiety &amp; depression also helped me start to be ready to let go of my restrictive ED, even though i wasn't talking about it in therapy at all at that point.",False,False

I want to go for BPD and anxiety, but not for my ED. I just don't want to get rid of it yet. It's helping me be productive in school!",False,False
