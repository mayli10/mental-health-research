I've been powerlifting for 3 years and at first was really enthusiastic about building a strong upper body, but similarly to you recently I got Insecure about my arms and pretty much stopped benching and doing most accessories, and I *think* they're a bit smaller? But definitely much softer. I don't know if that's any better tbh, but at least my shoulders and traps don't stand out as much as before since I stopped doing like 4x15 overhead dumbbell presses lol, to give an example.   I still lift a little bit, I've gotten really into cycling and for that I've been working on strong core/trunk/back, so I do rows, planks/etc, and push-ups, and I'm working towards a pull-up, but that's about it for upper body. I keep heavy sets to very few reps, in case that hypertrophy thing about high rep sets is true. I don't know, it seems to be working a little?  It may also be a mental distortion, like the more you focus on your arms, the more problematic they seem to be, right? Maybe you can try actually measuring them with tape and seeing if their size is objectively changing. Eventually though, if you keep a deficit for long enough, it's impossible to gain muscle and much, much harder to maintain it, so at the risk of sounding \~pro\~ you just kind of have to...stick with it? Sorry that's not super helpful!",False,False
