Now my brain just thinks ""oh well now you can't have it, but you can also stop thinking about it"". I've always been food obsessed. However, I do get super annoyed these day if someone eats my ""safe foods"". Honestly, I don't give myself many choices of whats acceptable to eat in my house, so if my bf eats my low cal foods then I'm instantly upset. I do try to hide being upset though. My ED is not his problem and it is all our food, not just mine.",False,False

Part of it is really weird parenting when I was young (my brother and I both hoard food and we are basically opposites psychologically) but a lot of it is just my brain panicking. I have a shelf of my own food that‚Äôs labeled, not because my partners will take it, but just because I get incredibly anxious about the amount of food I have changing unpredictably. I went through a period of food insecurity a few years back because I was super broke, and now I feel like I have to have my house fully stocked with food at all times, even if I don‚Äôt eat it.",False,False

And then he actually did want a bowl of the super low calorie vegetable stew that I had carefully made and counted the calories for...while he had a fucking pizza in the oven.  And he's UW! I almost started crying lol trying to explain to him why it's for ME only but then I realized vegetables are good for everyone and I can't give a good reason why he can have any.

So, I don‚Äôt eat all day, and when I come home from work I want my carefully planned meal. She always hovers around and asks to have HALF of it. My singular serving of food. For one person. And if I say no, she‚Äôll say she at least has to try it, and she‚Äôll take several huge bites of the best part.   Not to mention if I tell her to stop picking at it she‚Äôll throw a huge fit and call me selfish and talk about how mean I am. Honestly, it‚Äôs so narcissistic it hurts. She even knows I have an ED.

Also, if someone takes a piece I have to recalculate the calories.  If I'm eating something and don't know/have no way of figuring out the calories, I can't stop trying to share it, though.
