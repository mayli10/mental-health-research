That makes me so happy to hear. :)   And thank you so much. I wish I could say recovery has been an easy road. Going from fitting into extra small (everything) to what I am now is a real hard pill to swallow. And I admit I struggle with some new habits that formed along the way but I refuse to die to this. ♥️ Your comment gave me a sense of motivation so I thank you.,False,False

I try to “be the change I want to see in the world” etc. and have been called nice by some really lovely people.  Cheesy but whatever. But there are definitely times where I’ve been consumed in uncharacteristic envy driven by seeing people thinner than me. So I was definitely having a dark moment intentionally wanting to be on the other side of it.   I’m glad to hear you had a change of heart ❤️,False,True

It's more likely someone struggling with their eating or body image would see it and be encouraged into disordered habits because they want to look like that at any cost and your progress pic reinforces the thought that restriction/purging can make them look the way they want (which with EDNOS being the most common ED by far, plus bulimia and BED, is not going to be true for most disordered people) than it is likely someone at risk would see it and be inspired into healthier habits.",False,False

Not trying to be over dramatic but you really could be saving someone from a life of misery.   My (at the time) ignorant self was very unaware of how dangerous my original weight loss regiment was, and I was sadly sharing pictures. However, now I try to be as open and honest as possible about how dangerous my attitude towards food was.",False,False
