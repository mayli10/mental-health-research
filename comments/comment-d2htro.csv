Have you been drinking enough water? Have you been sleeping enough? It sounds like you are in deep pain and if you need support we are here and your friends and family are here with you.   Please, you are enough. Please stay health. Eat enough, sleep enough, drink enough. The weight will come off but it does not define you as a person. We are to support you :)",False,False

It won't be your fault, because it's not something you can just use willpower to avoid. Just because you have fat on your body (everyone does) doesn't mean that it's any safer or that it's an endless supply - your experience will vary based on your vitamin and mineral reserves, and again, those with EDs are usually already pretty nutritionally deficient no matter what size you are (binging may give you calories but unless it's on a LOT of healthy food, won't give you enough nutrition)",False,False
