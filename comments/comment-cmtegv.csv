Also, my best GF is in a ldr, and I know it is hard on her sometimes, so I hope things are wonderful for you and you get to see him lots.  :)    Also, yeah, I wish my BF would have protected me by keeping this dude away from me, for starters.  But also, not letting me drink after a certain point.  He even said he knew I hadn't eaten all day, or even drank any water.  Not his fault/responsibility to monitor my drinking, I guess I am high maintenance but... eh.",False,True

And your story relates in a lot of ways, but obviously is much more serious and I am so sorry that you got to that point of trying to commit suicide.  I hope you are okay now.  I am SO sorry that your BF didn't stop you and protect you when he should have, and yeah, okay so maybe he was pissed off or maybe my BF was the other night, but I know that I would 100% protect him if he was in a mental state where he couldn't take care of himself (because I have when he has gotten shitfaced drunk and acted like a total idiot).  And yeah, it sucks that we had to get to that place, and I don't excuse my behavior (yours is different), but still... watch out for a person, especially one you say you love.  Anyways, I really do hope you're doing much better now and that if you're still with your BF, that he is being much more supportive now.  &lt;3",False,True

Before judging you for not doing something in a state of almost unconsciousness, he should have made it HIS responsibility to watch over you. What kind of bf is he for not doing anything against it? What does have to happen for him to do something? He's being so unreliable man I'm so sorry for you. You should talk it out with him if possible",False,False
