I’m in the UK. I don’t know a whole lot about the process because it’s really difficult to find out without doing it. I’ve just heard a lot of rumours over the years of people getting denied for various reasons, and I know they check your medical history, so I was trying to keep mine clean. However, receiving help can surely only be a good thing!",False,True

It’s always good to hear people say that things got better after they’d opened up. That’s what I need to know right now!,False,True

I'm assuming (because you said ""wife"" but please correct me if I'm wrong) that you're a guy, and if so, I want you to know that you're not alone in this struggle. I've been working on opening up myself, and once I've accepted it, it got better too.",False,False

I know it’s the right thing to do, but I don’t totally want to recover right now so it’s difficult. Circumstances have led me here and I’m not quite ready.   I work in quite an isolated way but travel frequently to meet my team, and it’s been helpful having my manager know why I can’t do team meals or don’t feel safe staying away more than 1 night at a time. She’s on maternity leave so I plan to share limited details with her replacement.   I’m the UK and I might have the details wrong about adoption but I’m pretty sure you have a very thorough medical. It’s next to impossible to get the whole story without actually doing the process. It’s really frustrating and honestly a big worry that me asking for help is going to put a stop to our family plans. But, I can’t be a good parent like this. Huh.",False,True

For example, it's been very important that my providers know everything that's going on, and it's important for my SO to know the full outline of the state of things. That honesty and openness is hard at times, but so essential to my having a shot at moving forward. But my employer for example, didn't need to know details beyond ""I'm getting treatment for a health issue"" (and could not legally demand I give specifics beyond having my doctor fill out a form verifying what I need). My US-HIPAA-brain is also surprised that applying to adopt would require your full medical record to be released. Is that really how it goes? That's...intense.  Best of luck with the visit to the GP. I hope your wife will listen and hear and respond with compassion. Asking for and accepting help is such a courageous thing to do because it means letting ourselves be truly seen. And while uncomfortable, being seen can also be an amazing and healing experience &lt;3",False,False
