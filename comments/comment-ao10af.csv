My go-tos are  Roasted veggies (toss on a pan with aluminum foil and stick in the oven until starting to brown, you can do this with frozen veg too just stick them in while its pre-heating to thaw!) + an over easy egg or some ground turkey/hot sauce or chicken breast (you can roast it with the veggies even)  Brussels sprouts, cabbage and an apple sliced up and tossed in a pan with a chicken sausage link and seasoning (lemon pepper works great with this).  Cauliflower rice stir fried with kimchi, add shrimp or turkey bacon (and some other veggies like carrots/peas/broccoli/cauliflower if you'd like).  Also wraps are great if you can find low cal shells (I have some that are 50 cal a shell) so I wrap them with whatever I got lying around (roasted red bell peppers, turkey bacon, tomatoes, a tiny bit of avo/guac is good!).  Veggies are great filler, and protein + a little bit of fats help with feeling full.",False,False
