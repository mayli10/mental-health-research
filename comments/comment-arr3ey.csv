I find that working on things together makes my brain work much better. When it's just me I can never seem to do thinking stuff.",False,False

I know so many would-be bio majors who dropped because of it. That sucks about office hours! In my experience though if you email, profs are usually willing to meet with you at a time that works for you. The good ones, anyway. Also if you have teaching assistants or lab instructors or literally anyone else involved with the class, I'm sure they'll help you.   Studying a lot definitely keeps me from eating, but make sure you're not burning yourself out. You can't work through brain fog from restricting!   I really hope it works out. I know you can do it though!",False,False

And honestly, my abnormal psych class is going well. It's mainly just my microbiology class that's giving me troubles. Unfortunately that class doesn't have a tutor so I'm kind of out of luck. And my professor's office hours don't line up with my work schedule at all so he isn't available to me. I just need to suck it up and study more. And stop eating everything. Maybe I should study every time I feel hungry and want to eat. ",False,True

What's the minimum number of classes you can take per semester? Maybe if you deload a little bit it'll help you catch up. All that stuff you learned and worked hard for is still in your brain, you just have to remember and give yourself time and space to ease back into it again! You're so so close to finishing your degree, I know you can do it. It's okay if it takes you a little bit and if you struggle initially. You've been out of it for 3 years! You'll definitely need some time to adjust again.   Do you have an advisor or can you speak to your professors about your hesitations? They've dealt with this a million times before and they'll definitely know how to help you.",False,False
