ED is a mental health, we can't control it using motivation alone. There's no motivation in the world that would make you or anyone with this condition control it, or we would already be out of problems, right? So, it's ok. But see, it's not your fault having ED. You can have some responsibility over it, but never guilt. We live in a world that obsess over thin bodies, so much that people die trying to achieve this ideal. At the same time, we are wired, as humans, to crave for fat and sugar. There are some people who crave it less (the lucky bastards), but overall, we crave it. To make things worse, it's easier and in some places cheaper to get unhealthy food full of sugar and fat than healthy foods. It's the disaster combo. So, no, you are not a piggy, you are a human being whose brain go in ""I have to store all this sugar"". You don't need to punish yourself even more, doing fasts that harms your body. You already punish your mind. I think that you must know everything already.  If it's possible, look for help. Therapy helped me a lot with compulsive eating. But don't try to use the fasts to harm you. Actually, it's a good way to help you when you get better from the ED. Food (even the unhealthy one, in moderation) is not enemy, it's friend. And life is much more than our weight. I really like the r/antidiet and the r/EatingIntuively when I'm feeling bad about myself and my weight. I hope you get better!",False,False
