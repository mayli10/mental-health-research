I’m not sure what they are called in English though sorry. They are a type of nut but I don’t think the calorie count is that high. I’m wary about eating Chinese snacks because rather than staying calories per serving they will write calories per 100 or 200 grams and you have to weigh each individual package yourself. You can send the nutrition label to me via message and I can translate it for you.,False,False
