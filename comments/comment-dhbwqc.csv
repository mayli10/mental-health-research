I started sleeping with one of them sometime afterwards and he only brought it up once and never again. Just be casual and act super ditzy about it,False,False

He sounds like a decent dude who'd hopefully respect that.  For what it's worth, my now-wife only found out because my drunk ass forgot to close out of MPA before going to bed. It was pretty hellish.   *But* - that broke through the ice in our relationship, so I could actually trust her. Because hey, if she was ever going to leave me because she found out something about me she didn't like, that would've been it.  Maybe in the long run, this could have a silver lining for you two too? I'm glad he took it reasonably well + reacted with kindness.",False,False

He probably feels uncomfortable too cause he knows something he shouldn't.  A beautiful quote out of some Netflix series: ""It's only awkward if you make it awkward.""  Try to act casual any try to forget it. Maybe it's not even a big deal. Good luck ‚ú®",False,False

Well, he actually sort of guessed when we went to a pizza place and all I got was a salad, no cheese, no croutons, dressing on the side and then only dipped my fork into the dressing. I was also too skinny at the time so he put two and two together. He was two years older than me and got a total knight in shining armor complex, like he would be so sweet and encouraging to get me to eat, as if he was going to ‚Äúsave me from my eating disorder‚Äù. Part of me loved it and the other part hated it.",False,False
