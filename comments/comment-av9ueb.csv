OMFG that is so disordered to feel like it’s being lax or lazy to not count coffee. No one with normal eating patterns counts black coffee! Black coffee is so few calories. If you’re at the point where you are counting drinks that are legit &lt; 5-10 cal, you’re on the slippery slope to disordered eating. My mind is blown right now.

Remember the days of Livejournal and MySpace and bashing “wannarexics”? The early ED community was so sick and mean and competitive. I’m so grateful places like this exist.   Don’t get me wrong. I’m still not recovered and I still relapse. But having this community helps me manage so much better than I ever was able to before. I’m safer, more conscious. And for the first time in my life I feel like I can be honest. It’s such a healing experience. I don’t think anyone really grasps how important and cathartic it is is for us to be able to talk freely about our experiences, without judgement and without having to present them with the “right” sentiments. The fact that we even can all laugh and joke while recognizing we are sick is a testament to just how therapeutic and supportive this community has become.  💕",False,False
