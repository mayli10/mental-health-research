I just went vegan December 31st and i thought it would help me be more restrictive but I‚Äôve actually found the same thing- i am so much more lenient now. What the fuck is that.,False,False

To summarize, thank you for sharing your experience. We are very similar with a lot of this. I don‚Äôt believe I have an ED because I don‚Äôt have many fear foods most of the time (although I had many more fear foods before I was vegan). I hope you feel better ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,True

It's hard when people assume we're doing great because we look good or our exterior lives look 'fine', when in reality we're locked in a daily struggle to withstand the pain of consciousness.  I'm sorry things have been so difficult and painful. Being in the place of wanting and trying to die was an excruciating period of time for me. I 100% did not expect to make it out alive. I was so fortunate that my community had pretty good resources to offer, and that a couple people were willing to stay in my life even as I became a multi-year tornado of anguished destruction. I hope that if you reach out a hand for help, that people will reach back toward you and help you find what you need. &lt;3",False,False

It‚Äôs not a lie. But seriously people. Not everyone loses weight to look good! I literally developed ED behaviors because of stress/grief/sad and like... yeah i did want to lose weight but it‚Äôs mostly that it was such an awful, shitty year and a lot of things happened in my life that i had no control over... and well, as we all know we can control how much food we eat so.   I‚Äôve been thinking lately that i am definitely not disordered and do not have an ED because i am currently maintaining my weight and haven‚Äôt been strict at all (want a donut and pizza for lunch? Go for it! Twice this week haha, want Thai for dinner? Sure why not!) and i am basically not afraid of food at all anymore. I ate chips this past weekend.   But then today... i was like, my butt got bigger. I feel gross. Okay i need to go get groceries so i can start eating 600 cals again.  Womp womp ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  Edited because i wanted to clarify that i didn‚Äôt eat real chips (like fried, salty chips) for like 5 months because i was terrified of them. Like not even on a cheat day. And i love chips.",False,False
