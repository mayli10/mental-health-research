I had to have a serious talk with my SO for similar reasons.  I have bad body dysphoria due to gender issues, and he's boob obsessed. But the more he touches my boobs, the more anxious and disgusted I feel. So we have conversations about when it's good and when it's not good for him to be touching.  If my mental health is strong, go for it.  If I'm having a shit week, give me a break!  A breast reduction is probably in my future tbh I can't wait.  Good luck :)",False,False
