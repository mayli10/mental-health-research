Idk how that works man.   And she's had an ED, so it's cool to see she has a way better relationship with food. The only restrictions she has are no animal products, which is an ethical decision, not a weight one.",False,False

People talk about ‚Äúintuitive eating‚Äù a lot, but if there is such a thing, he‚Äôs got it down to an art.",False,False
