When I got my period, it would cause up to FIVE pounds of bloat, which would go away on the first day!! Surely wait things out. :) it’s all about how you feel anyways!! That’s something you can’t measure on a scale.",False,False

I’m scared of salt and that making me retain even more water but I’ll try potassium!,False,True

I bloat a lot during my period so it might be that, too. I'm just going to have to learn to focus on the process, not the results... it is so difficult when you don’t feel like you’re acceptable.",False,True

They don't like being empty. So if you're eating at a deficit, you are definitely burning fat for energy. It just takes a while for those cells to accept that they're gonna be empty and let go of the water.  Having some potassium sometimes helps me, or magnesium citrate, or even just salt. Just kicking some electrolytes into my system seems to shake the water up a bit. Just don't take too much potassium - it can hurt you if you take too much.",False,False

I’m In the same boat and it sucks. But sometimes our bodies take time to react and I’m sure this won’t be any different, good or bad.",False,False

It’s why people tend to bulk (build muscle and gain fat), then focus on cutting; you cant do both at once.  I’ve had the same happen, and that “woosh” people talk about randomly happened to me. Sometimes it’s waste in your GI system, bloating etc! So many factors with dietary changes.",False,False

If you were just working out and not doing calorie counting you would gain. The weight on the scale is not representative of your actual progress when working out along side calorie counting. Simply calorie counting with no workout would net pure weight loss in the “numbers on the scale” sense. You’re doing amazing keeping up for a month. Keep going and you’ll wonder why you were ever doubting yourself.,False,False
