Do something nice for yourself because the most important thing in your world should be you. Fuck anyone that doesn‚Äôt treat you right. I‚Äôve spent so many fucking birthdays alone and isolated and it breaks my fucking heart that anyone else has to go through that bullshit. Indulge yourself, be it a slice of cake (if that‚Äôs going to make your day brighter) or a bath bomb and a face mask. I‚Äôm going to shut up now because, again, it breaks my heart that anyone else deals with this to the point where I‚Äôm on the edge of tears but have a happy fucking birthday and love yourself as much as you can. You‚Äôre alive and therefore are deserving of love and compassion. Have the best day possible because you‚Äôre worth it, you beautiful human being.",False,False
