I can deeply relate to feeling out-of-control when you doubt your abilities, though. I pin a lot of my self-worth on the skills I've taught myself as an artist and when my confidence is shaken it shakes my whole self-worth, too. BUT what helps me sometimes is comparing myself to my past self, not to others. I look at how far I've come and I think about how, when I first started, I would've given anything to be where I am now. So, it doesn't matter how slowly I learn, or how I learn compared to others. Nobody can deny my progress and my skills and the control it took me to get to this point, and nobody can deny it for you too :)",False,False

Ive had two seven year toxic relationships. I managed to escape the last one in 2016. And Im still recovering. It takes time.  I understand losing friends, I am right there with you. The only thing worse than being lonely for me us being lonely and fat. If I can socialize with confidence, it makes a huge difference.   When you are leaving a toxic relationship, you must get your priorities straight. I dont starve myself, I eat enough protein and macros. but Ive learned throughout the years, that if you dont prioritize your own safety and sanity, you will lose those things, and you cant buy health.   Maybe take some time to identify your priorities. Things that are important to you. Make a list. Then any time you have a decision in life, you can look back in your list and make sure it conforms to your priorities.",False,False

You have a lot on your plate that you need to cope with right now so it's natural that you would be drawn to a coping mechanism that you felt worked in the past.  With hindsight, though, I think we can all admit that disordered eating never actually made anything better or gave us any real control. We always end up controlled by it in the end. You already know that what you want out of this situation is to feel a sense of control; is there another way you could get that same feeling? What are some of the things in your life that you CAN control? Even if they're small? Like making the decision to join a club that nobody else you know goes to, or to pick up a hobby that only you get to mandate, like gardening? It might sound silly but I got really deep into planners a while ago because it was something satisfying that I had total control over, and it made me feel more in-control to look at the final product.",False,False

I had spoken my heart to a guy I was in love with and I was friendzoned, and also dubbed unattractive for the first time in my life. I'm very good looking and so I'm told, and I tend to seek self esteem in how desirable I look... soooo when you have this kind of dysmorphia being told you're not someone's type physically is triggering. This summed up with work problems and a bunch of stuff.  I just said fuck it this is what I am. I eat and vomit. It's a part of me. Let me just enjoy it. Ate oreos and nutella like no tomorrow for days, got drunk like hell, vomit, repeat. Until luckily my family got by.",False,False
