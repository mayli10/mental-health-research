Spaghetti squash, pickles, a whole fucking container of pre-made salad from the grocery store with no dressing, etc. Wash it down with carbonated sugarfree pop. You won't want to binge after that, but you'll still have calories left over to eat something more nutrient dense.   \-Don't have anything binge-able on hand.   \-Be with someone else, if possible",False,False

Do NOT eat trigger foods when watching TV or anything else where I can consume food mindlessly. 2. Do NOT eat trigger foods alone (especially if you have a whole box of cereal, an entire cake, etc).  3. Only purchase individual sizes. A gas station pack of oreos is okay. A full size pack from the store is not. 4. Recognize speed of consumption. When I'm losing control, I noticeably start to eat faster. 5. Be aware of your emotions. Consciously ask yourself if you've fulfilled the craving. If yes, stop eating. 6. If you notice yourself losing control, leave. Physically leave. Go to the gym, go to the mall, go to a friends house, just leave.  7. Make sure you have somewhere to be. I'll eat significantly less if I have plans in an hour vs if I have all night to sit at home and binge.",False,False
