I experienced it when I was in recovery. I never felt full and ate up to 5000 calories. For me it lasted around 1 week and after that my hunger cues went back to normal. I know it feels terrifying but it’s honestly just your body trying to repair the damage that starvation has done to it. If it makes you feel any better even though I was consuming huge amounts I gained near to nothing bc my body used up all the energy right away,False,False
