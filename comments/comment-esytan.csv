You’re not alone - I get them too and I understand how overwhelming they can be. I’ll post an edit when I have more time linking some information and resources I’ve found helpful in case you can benefit from them too. In the meantime, just know that nothing is fundamentally wrong with you and that there are ways of treating this - and you’re struggling with something that you don’t have to fight alone.",False,False

Oh, you're in the middle of a shopping centre, already stressed from trying to deal with the shittonne of people here, LET'S REMIND YOU AND HAVE YOU RELIVE THIS AWFUL TRAUMATIC THING THAT HAPPENED TO YOU!!!!!! HAVE FUN DEALING WITH THIS FLASHBACK IN THE MIDDLE OF A SHOPPING CENTRE DUMB BITCH!!!   Sorry, I know you said they're not flashbacks, but what you described is exactly what my most extreme flashbacks are like for me. I can't see, hear or feel anything real around me and I am totally engrossed in the memory of the traumatic experience. Flashbacks (or waking nightmares) of this intensity are so hard to deal with, especially when you're in public. The only thing I've really found that works is figuring out which of my senses tends to stay in reality, so that I can then try and use that to ground myself and break myself out of the memory. For example, the only thing that really grounds me is smell (or taste but fuck going there and adding more stress to my brain), so I carry with me a small box full of smelly stuff like essential oils (and sugar free gum, just in case) and some stuff to squeeze, pull apart and destroy in the process. I also have a bigger box with more of the same in it for when it happens when I'm at home.   I'm sorry you're going through this, and I wish I had some more solid advice. Breathing exercises *can* work, but they take practice, and I find they take longer to work than just shoving some intense smell up my nose to remind me where/who I am and what I am doing.    Feel free to pm me if you want to talk about anything you're going through.",False,False
