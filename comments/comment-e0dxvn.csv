If I don‚Äôt have something then I‚Äôll get to a point where I can‚Äôt focus or my head is too messed up to pay attention to stuff I need to hear.   If I didn‚Äôt have to try and look normal to people by eating certain ways it would be better. Eating around certain people gives me high anxiety and I live with one of them rip",False,False

I have an ED because its the only thing i can ‚Äòcontrol.‚Äô ANY food: meat, fat, oil, veggies, feels like its rotting in me and i want it out.   its not just carbs, its food in general tht i struggle with. cooking food and consuming it. bc i would legitimately rather go days w/o eating. bc that feels better than feeling full.   keto would encourage restriction, yeah. it might fix the fasting issue, but my underlying issues w/ food and control and binge eating are still gonna be there.   im still going to want to starve myself more than eat.   im still gonna get the urge to throw it all back up after a meal, keto or not.   i know what would fix my energy levels: eating food in proper portions. but i have an ED that wont let me w/o me feeling guilty.    glad something works for you, though.",False,True

I eat a keto diet and my energy level is so much better for it, I just need protein and fat. Keto cut cravings down for food so much that I never get hungry and what I eat doesn't feel like it's rotting inside of me. Sugar gives a lot of fuel to bacteria, which accelerates rotting, (think of how your teeth rot on sugar or yeast feasting on sugar to ferment beer).  I just buy seeds, nuts and cheese and eat that, no need to make food. Fasting is easier on keto because there's no sugar rush/crash so you don't black out. Get flax seed or fish oil for omega 3's which is one of the essential nutrients that rarely come in food and you will see a boost in energy.  After I get the right balance of omega 3 vs omega 6 (omega 6 interfere with omega 3), and cut out the carbs, I have no problem doing physical jobs.",False,False
