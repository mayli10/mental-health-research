I would love to lose it...but Iâ€™m reaching this point where I donâ€™t know if I can deal with the distress from it. I have loose skin and a layer of subcutaneous fat that from YEARS of being obese. Surgery is probably the only way Iâ€™ll every lose it. Being underweight didnâ€™t get rid of it and gaining a bunch of weight back certainly didnâ€™t fix it. My core is strong, but it is fat. How many more years can I dedicate my life to hating my stomach?     Man...Iâ€™m just tired to be honest. Thank you for commenting and making me feel less alone.",False,True

We donâ€™t deserve this. Iâ€™m sorry youâ€™re feeling this way, but know youâ€™re not alone.",False,False
