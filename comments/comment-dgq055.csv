But it is difficult to change. I have been learning that there are some foods that can affect the production of the hormones.,False,True

Thanks for the explanation.,False,False

I OMAD some food from a fast food place a couple nights ago and despite feeling pretty full from it I binged on 4-5 bananas which led me to involuntary throw up because my stomach was so uncomfortably full it hurt like a bitch. I rarely buy junk food since I know I won’t be able to control myself so when I binge it’s almost always on fruits ugh,False,False

Like is it possible for that to go back to normal/recover eventually?",False,False

I’ve definitely eaten around maintenance (1500) before and then been so upset that I allowed myself to go that high that I then shovelled a further 3000+ in straight afterwards. i was in pain by the first bite and yet kept going :/ it’s strange how it shouldn’t physically be possible to keep going, but when you’re eating to fill an endless emotional void it kinda makes sense",False,False

Because there's a difference between hunger and appetite. Like hunger is physical and causes the hunger pains that you feel. And then appetite is emotional/chemical and is hugely impacted by the appetite hormone Grhelin. And there's a huge like between binge eating and imbalances and sensitivity levels to Grhelin and Leptin (satiation hormone). So when you get hungry pains it signals the brain to release Grhelin so that you'll eat, but you can only produce so much of any hormone at any given time and also over time you become less sensitive to certain hormones. Which is why binge eaters feel the need to keep eating after they're physically full- they're insensitive to Leptin being released. so if you go long enough without eating you'll become less sensitive to Grhelin and will mostly only experience hunger pains. And what's also frustrating is that I know this shit because I'm studying nutrition and psychology but I can't get myself to explain it well to the people that make these ignorant comments.",False,True
