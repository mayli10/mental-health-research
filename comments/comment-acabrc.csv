Don’t give them your money. What a bitch. I don’t know how salespeople can believe that treating people poorly is an effective sales tactic. I am so sorry that you got caught in that situation. ,False,False

So in light of the grocery store post from earlier, how do I feel about this? I think that there are probably some differences and similarities, but I want to clarify a point or two:  1.	Are you from a country where vanity sizing is prevalent? A size 0 in the US is not the same as everywhere else. Perhaps the sizing in Jerusalem is less influenced by vanity and a 0 is closer to what it may have been a long time ago in the US?  2.	Was this saleslady speaking her native language? I know a number of my friends who are ESL speakers can be brutally blunt because they don’t know how to couch their words in a way that sounds more polite, things we learn socially over time rather than in English class.  3.	Was she putting off other nonverbal cues that she was judging you, like with her eyes? Was her tone dismissive?   I’m so sorry this happened to you, regardless. Normal interactions become so fraught when you are dealing with internal insecurities. I’m a much smaller size now than I was a year ago, and I find shopping to be MUCH more stressful now. When I was fat I could grab an XXL and know it would fit me fine. Now, I could be an XS-M with no consistency. ",False,False
