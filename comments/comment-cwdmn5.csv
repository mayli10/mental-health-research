I can't take regular vitamins because my stomach is super sensitive but I have zero issues with the gummies!  I'm not sure how you feel about cliff bars but those things have always helped produce a BM.  And, when it becomes too much to handle, suppositories are pretty fast acting, simple, and cheap.  I struggle with severe constipation because not only do I restrict but I also take Kratom which caused constipation as well. The things I have listed above have helped me immensely.  Good luck, love, and feel better!‚ô•Ô∏èüí©",False,False

It has helped me so much with constipation, as well as muscle cramps and sleep. You can find it at any drugstore or online. The brand name is ‚ÄúCalm‚Äù but generic is cheaper and just as good. I recommend the flavored version (10 cal/tsp) because the unflavored kind is bitter and undrinkable.",False,False

I too have stopped eating because of it.  Constipation is a vicious cycle because the longer stool stays in the intestine, the drier it becomes because the intestine reabsorbs the moisture.  Then it becomes hard and nearly impossible to pass.  So you need to stay ahead of that by keeping your stool moist.  (Sorry, I know it‚Äôs gross.)  Fiber supplements and soluble fiber from food help a lot of people, but *make sure you take them with a fuckton of water or thugs will get worse*.  The point is that the fiber carries that water into your stool.  Or try some ‚Äúgentler‚Äù laxatives like Miralax or milk of magnesia, or even just stool softener pills (docusate sodium).  All of these draw water into your large intestine.  Another couple things you can try are colonic massage (really, this is just using your hand to try to push the stool down to the opening of your intestine) and drinking hot and/or caffeinated beverages *with some food* in the morning.  Everyone is different so it might take a while to find what works for you.   For me it‚Äôs milk of magnesia, stool softener pills, oats, and drinking a Monster approximately half an hour after breakfast.  I really hope you poop soon üíú",False,False
