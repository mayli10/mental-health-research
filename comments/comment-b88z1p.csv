When I was in a similar position, being told I was worthwhile seemed like a broken phony record but knowing that there were people around me who loved me and would be affected by my loss was what kept me from trying anything.   Be gentle with her though. It takes a long time to find self love and acceptance and she's not going to accept everything you tell her right away. So also be gentle with yourself because helping someone going through a mental health crisis can be draining for you as well. Lean on your other supports and take care of yourself both before and after each time you contact her. ",False,False

It’s just that I’m not sure whether she’s really going to do and I don’t want her parents to freak out and make her life a living hell. I know that her ending up dead would be A LOT worse, but I’m convinced that she won’t do it. Still... what do I say to her that makes her understand that she’s not worthless?",False,True

Would you rather lose a friend because she got mad that you told someone, or because she killed herself and could have done something about it?",False,False
