I was visibly pissed. The professor was shocked too and just kept saying ""well actually family therapy is the most effective...."".   &amp;#x200B;  This girl always said ridiculous things. In a history class she started a statement with: ""I don't know which war it was, but the one with the Nazi's"" ....   Lol I have so many community college stories... bless that place.",False,False

Opposite of being active isn’t anorexia at all. I don’t know his age but he sounds extremely immature. The joke is also not particularly funny, unless it’s a group of young children in which case they may find it funny as they don’t fully understand what they are saying.",False,False
