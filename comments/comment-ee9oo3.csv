Like everyone knows something is up.   I’ll always hard core restrict when I know I’m going out to eat then “treat myself” to a burger and drinks and then feel like shit for eating something with so much oil. It feels like I’m poisoning my body with each bite. So then I compensate by fasting for the next day or two. Was it even worth it to “treat myself”?",False,False

One time I got a grilled chicken breast with steamed broccoli and it was $15. Total bullshit",False,False
