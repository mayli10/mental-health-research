A guy I liked told me one of the main reasons he'd never be in a relationship with me is he wanted a partner who was a foodie like him. It really stung, because it made me think if I didn't have this illness maybe we could be together. Especially because his new gf is borderline underweight and enjoys food UGH. I felt bad about it at the time but thankfully I'm over it now.   Think about it this way...we as ED people are looking for a partner who is willing to put up with our ED. That's a huge requirement, possibly even stricter than wanting someone to be a foodie. It's just a matter of compatibility...no preference is worse than another, and you shouldn't have to make a permanent recovery to be with somebody. I really hope somebody who doesn't care about food (but not in a triggering way hehe) will come along and sweep you off your feet &lt;3 &lt;3 Best of luck &lt;3 ",False,False

If you were a foodie and heavier he‚Äôd want someone else.  If you were skinnier but ate *even less food* he‚Äôd want someone else.  Barring finding someone who has a rare medical disorder where they can eat everything but remain emaciated, he‚Äôs not going to find what he‚Äôs looking for.  And even if he found someone with medical problems, it doesn‚Äôt sound like he‚Äôs empathetic enough to deal with all of the other ramifications that go along with that.  Unfortunately nothing you can do or say will make him a better person‚Äîand remember that goes for whoever else he‚Äôs with too.  The next people he dates will get the same treatment.    Instead of looking at this guy with rose colored glasses, look at him the way you‚Äôve described here.  He lacks empathy because he expects you to be something you have no way of being.  He‚Äôs selfish because he‚Äôs going to keep putting that on you and every other skinny girl he meets.  He‚Äôs immature because he thinks being a foodie is a top desirable personality trait.  If you‚Äôre still seeing and sleeping with this guy, put this all out on the table.  Either he‚Äôll get a wake up call or he‚Äôll move on to the next (which it sounds like he‚Äôs doing anyway.) If you‚Äôre just occasionally talking to him but not seeing him, cut him out of your life for a while and only think of him in the terms that you described here instead of whatever made you fall in love with him.  I hope everything gets better for you!",False,False

Any thin foodie I‚Äôve ever met or seen has had an unhealthy relationship with food. I think it‚Äôs totally possible to be a healthy weight and be a foodie through moderation, but to actually be thin and maintain thinness takes restriction of a kind, so he‚Äôs gonna be in for a shocker.  How he feels about you isn‚Äôt a genuine reflection of who you are. And I‚Äôm happy you were able to experience such emotions because now you know that it‚Äôs absolutely possible for you. You can have these feelings again if you‚Äôd like. It might take awhile and a few failed attempts but it‚Äôs possible  ",False,False

You gotta be size zero, but wait you also have to eat 24/7 and be a total foodie, but WAIT you also have to be super low maintenance and have no insecurities about your body. Lmao that person does not exist üíÅüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  Not trying to trash talk this guy you're talking about...I dated and married a foodie and I love him to death. But I know how much it sucks to have an issue, and to think someone understands, but then the minute you show any symptoms or try to advocate for yourself they act personally targeted or like it's the first they've heard about it. Don't let this experience discourage you bc there ARE people out there who will love you and support you regardless of your ED ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False
