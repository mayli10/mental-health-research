At Iftar I have been known to oh-so-piously linger on for ages with Maghrib prayers waiting for everyone else to go away so I can eat like the creepy weird ED hoe with her anti-food rituals that I unironically am and go the fuck to sleep asap. I'm also one of those people who combine iftar and dinner so at least even if I overeat or get pressured into agreeing to someone inviting me over to their place ~~to drown me in a sea of oil~~ for Iftar it's still basically IF/OMAD.,False,False

People who know about my history have asked me, ""Does fasting bring you closer to God?"" and the answer is obviously no because I never did it for the right reasons. I was literally sinning by fasting because of the reasons for which I fasted (self-harm)...why would that bring me closer to God? And even if I did the Daniel-style diet and avoided meats and rich foods, that's just orthorexia to me. God has provided many avenues through which I can experience Him, chief of which is his Word.

I'm a Christian and I think conversion therapy should be banned everywhere (it is in Australia, where I am). The Daniel diet is a complete sham, my pastor and I joke about it - he knows about my ED - because it is loosely based on two references from the book of Daniel.
