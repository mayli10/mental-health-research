Iâ€™m trying not to read it too fast and savour it slowly in case I canâ€™t find another book like it.  Have you read anything else similar to Letting Ana Go? I really loved how we go through the process of her transitioning from normal to ED.,False,True

If I grow some balls I might try WastedðŸ˜‚  Iâ€™d really love to know which YA novels contain EDs as subplots. Seriously, if you remember, donâ€™t hesitate to let me know.

I loved it; it's a memoir, not fiction, so it was very real. Definitely triggering tho. She's a great writer, and I want to read her other books  I've read other books where a character besides the protagonist has an ED and it's a minor subplot. I can't remember any titles, but they're all YA books",False,False
