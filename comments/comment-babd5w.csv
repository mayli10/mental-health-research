Then come back. Be prepared, but try to really look at that little human and remember you are their entire world. I have a 16 month old, struggled with EDNOS and other shit for years before even getting pregnant, still feel awful. Still struggle, even more. I don't wanna be like ""omg just think of the kid it gets better"" cause that's bullshit, but remember you're making fucking life and that is some cool ass shit dude! ",False,False
