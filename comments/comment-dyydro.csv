I ate the green beans but I havn't eaten anything today. Today the school gave out free pizza and pop, but i just drank a bottle of water. I have felt tired and slow all day but I can't bring myself to eat. I'll probably eat an apple later because my mom will make me eat in front of her when she gets home and probably interagate me about wether I ate or not today and then I'll dissapoint her instead of lie and say that i have. I don't like lying. Last night i had a dream that I binged again and I woke up in a cold sweat. Life is not good right now",False,False

But I didnâ€™t follow my meal plan, was under my calorie goal by at least 1000 every single day. I hated the idea of food and started feeling suicidal again. Yesterday I was having chest pains and couldnâ€™t focus on anything for more than a few minutes. And it sucked mostly because those are things I associate with my lowest weight and Iâ€™m nowhere near there right now. My BMI is borderline normal.   But last night I kind of had this epiphany that I was making myself needlessly miserable and slipping back into a place I genuinely donâ€™t want to be. And so I forced myself to eat. I didnâ€™t enjoy one bite of it, but I managed to get up to my calorie goal and guess what? Today I feel a million times better physically. Mentally Iâ€™m still struggling but thatâ€™s so much easier to deal with when Iâ€™m not on the verge of fainting or having to brace myself against the wall catching my breath because I feel so weak. Itâ€™s just... I really need to remember this. To realize that even on bad days I have the ability to force myself to eat even if my ED is screaming at me that I canâ€™t possibly do it. Iâ€™m stronger than the worst parts of myself and I need to focus on that.",False,False
