I feel you. Before my boyfriend and I even made it clear we were officially dating (or maybe like very very soon after we did), I made some joke about how he was mine and I wasn‚Äôt sharing with anyone (something along those lines) and he replied something like ‚Äúunless Jlo showed up at my door and wanted to fuck me‚Äù  He knew very soon after he shouldn‚Äôt have said that bc he deleted the message even though it was too late HAHA now, here I am a year and a half later, I fucking hate Jlo and everything about her and I‚Äôll never forget what he said.  I know I‚Äôm being petty however I have never brought it up again.",False,False

When he was a kid it was Anne Hathaway, because he loved Princess Diaries, and dear god does that make me smile every time I think about it.    I'll comment on girls in movies or shows we are watching, like ""wow, shes gorgeous, so skinny, blah blah"" and he'll be like, ""eh, I don't like her (insert random body part)"".. like ""no, her nose is too big,"" or ""eh, I prefer your color eyes,"" ""her cheekbones are too large"" (legit what the fuck??).   Anyway I'm positive he's doing this to not hurt me, he knows I'm incredibly self- conscious and has been around through several relapses over 7 years, but SOMEHOW my disorder twists it, and I start to think if he has all these super specific problems with girls, he probably has some things to pick out on me.   It comforts me that through his flaws I love him to pieces and am entirely confident he feels the same.   OP, get you a person who shuts the disorder up, who stops it in its tracks for even just a brief moment because you suddenly realize your body doesn't even come into the equation when they think of all the things they love about you. You deserve it, we all do.    Oof this came out super long and preachy and I hate it a lot but idk, you should hear it.  Love wont solve everything but it should make things easier, not harder.",False,False

I think it‚Äôs the same with your boyfriend too. There are a lot of versions of sexy out there. Even when I think about it with real life people there are sexy people of all ages, bodies, and colors.   I think attraction is largely a product of tension and exposure. I realized Gyllenhaal was, in addition to good looking, a bigger actor when I was younger and I kind of imprinted on that and have good associations with him. I think Portman was the same for my husband because he watched the Star Wars films as a kid.",False,False
