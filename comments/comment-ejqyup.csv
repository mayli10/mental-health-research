It also helps because Im not nibbling away at a cracker, so no one suspects anything. Im stuffing my face with half a cabbage dressed with salsa and a boca burger. They just dont know its 200 cals and only half of what Ill eat that day.",False,False

I do find myself mentally rejecting many a Bad Food more and more often, though. So I can't just say ""I'm not going to eat any XYZ"" and successfully avoid it, but my brain can make that decision for me.",False,False
