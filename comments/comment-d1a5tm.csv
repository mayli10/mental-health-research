No longer at that lw, I’m high 19 aiming for 21.   I was a full hourglass to hourglass to inverted triangle. I lost pretty evenly but at around 19-20 my frame kinda limited where I lost. Only things left to lose from were tits, thighs/hips and muscle. So my shape changed from an hourglass to a inverted triangle.   So at least in my experience until I reached under weight I was just a less fat version of the same shape.",False,False
