I know sometimes id post isolated incidents about my ex on relationship subs and I was immediately told he was an abusive piece of shit and I needed to leave ASAP. It was a little bit of overkill when I just wanted to get the issue off my chest.   It’s complicated but I think people *leap* to conclusions like crazy and the thread becomes a train wreck",False,False

I agree it makes me worried :/ My GF knows about my ED and hates it and I know she worries about me, I can't imagine her ever, ever purposefully triggering me or telling me it's fine to restrict because I look better that way/will want to have sex if I do.",False,False
