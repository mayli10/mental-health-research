Since I was a fat kid that lost a ton of weight no one noticed it was unhealthy I get called out all the time when I gain. No one has ever even thought when I lose a ton of weight quickly and get underweight that it's an ED. I get praised.,False,False

It’s even worse since I use to be pretty overweight and lost a lot so now when people see me eat something unhealthy they automatically say “oh be careful you will get fat again” and I freak the fuck out and beat myself up over eating something and turn the day into a full binge,False,True
