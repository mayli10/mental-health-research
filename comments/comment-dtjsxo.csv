I just wanted to vent about how annoying it is to constantly want to be triggered and not be able to. I thought this was a safe place to talk about how weird my mind is being right now. I wasn't asking for anything other than someone to hear/read what I'm going through right now without any judgement, as I have no one to talk to right now... Also, y are u putting trigger in quotes? I get this might not seem like a problem to you but I really dont appreciate it since it is for me.",False,True

Either way it would probably be better for your mental health to take a step back from all that stuff and try to focus more on yourself and your own wellbeing and what you need to feel successful and comfortable and happy. We’re coming into the coziest, happiest, warmest season of the year, it would be a shame if you couldn’t find a way to let yourself enjoy Thanksgiving and Christmas without focusing so much on binging and trying to “trigger” yourself.",False,False
