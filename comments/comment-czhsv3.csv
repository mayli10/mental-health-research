This is sort of rare, I guess, for me but I have had this happen before outside of being sick. The last time this happened, I had a simple roasted beef sandwich. Just bread and meat. Nothing out of the ordinary. I typically drink water and tea. This occurence has come and gone but for me it happens usually after a really long fast. I've had 40hr fasts and this would happen. It always feels like whatever I ate dropped straight down and liquified from my esophagus to my colon. It's kind of strange.",False,True

I've had something like this happen before but it's kind of less often if I am just plain old restricting my calories but eating 2 or 3 times a day. I usually have more ""wet"" movements anyways. I like to drink a lot of tea and water because I'm not anxious of the weight changes from liquids. I'm not taking medication, either. I've got an oral food allergy, but I avoid all the foods in the group Im allergic to (birch pollen). However, I've considered IBS in the past because I also tend to be very gassy (constant belching and toots) after I eat just about anything. I think I'll look more into it but I was just seeing if maybe it was me that had the Hershey Squirts immediately after something was eaten following a long fast.",False,True

Or did you have it in the past too? Have you ever had normal bowel movement?   How old are you (approx.)?  Do you only have this when you eat only 1-2x in 32h? And what exactly do you eat?     As a child I had cramps often and diarrhea... but there were also ""more normal phases"". But as a teenager it got worse. I didn't even know what normal pooping was, because I was 2-3x a day on the toilet and it was never really ""solid"" and more ""liquid"" (sorry, not a native speaker and don't know how to describe poop properly) and I had bad cramps and pain, but not always...      I visited doctors and I ""just"" have some intolerances... my whole gut was inflamed because I ate this stuff too long without being able to digest it properly, so I had to cut out a lot of food for a while (like also very oily/fatty food, protein from animals, all fruit, sugery stuff, basically everything... I ate potatoes and rice without oils and just a bit of salt for weeks and it slowly started to get better...That was years ago.    When I eat ""normal"" now.. I have those almost liquid poops, when I eat stuff I actually can eat, it's better for me, and when I eat ""the worst"", then I have to RUN to the bathroom in pain.      But what you describe can actually be anything and I can just say that you should visit a doctor because it's not normal. Maybe it's your eating habits. Maybe it's ""just"" an intolerance, but maybe it's an inflammatory bowel disease or celiac disease. It can be nothing too serious, but also something really serious.",False,False
