Like, ""fasting"" throughout the day and only eating one meal at night or whatever is usually fine, barring extenuating medical conditions and the like, but long term fasting? That shit does *not* work unless you've got the mental resolve of a goddamn buddhist monk, because the *second* that you break that fast, you are more likely to binge than you ever will be or ever have been in your entire fucking life. After somewhere in the late 30s or early 40s your brain sooorta learns to ignore a good chunk of your hunger cues, but it's only doing that cause it ain't got the energy to think clearly. The moment that you swallow the first bite after breaking that fast is when you are at your most vulnerable to binge urges, and what makes that even worse is that bingeing on as empty of a stomach as you'd have after a long fast like that is just about the single most dangerous type of binge there is, because your eatin' bits have relaxed due to not being used for a good while, which means that they Are Not Fucking Ready to take in as much food as your brain is going to try to all but force down your throat.  Second, long term fasting fucks with you in a way that just about nothing else can. You lose the ability to complete more or less any brain function that isn't absolutely essential. You'll know when you need to piss; you'll know when you need to rehydrate; and you'll know when you need to sleep; but just about everything else? You're going to lose the ability to walk ten steps without stumbling around like a drunk person or getting dizzy and almost passing out. You're not going to be able to think clearly at *all*. You might think you know what I mean when I say that, but I promise you that you don't. It is so much fucking worse than you think it could be. You can't form sentences; you'll forget what you're talking about mid-conversation; you'll be actively thinking about something and suddenly realize that you lost your train of thought *five goddamn minutes* ago and you've just been blankly staring off into space trying to catch it again; you'll forget where you are and why you're there (for example, I was breaking a 96 hour fast with Chipotle and I forgot at some point that I was at a Chipotle and waiting in line, and when I ""came to"" out of my Void Brain, I was looking at a Chipotle employee and had *zero* fucking memory of having entered the Chipotle or what the fuck I was doing there, and I hope to god had only *just* asked me before I came to whether I wanted to get a burrito or a bowl, cause it took me a good twenty or so seconds to figure out what in the fuck was going on before I replied); you'll just completely lose huge swaths of time, like you were under anesthesia or some shit, and have an unbroken chain of time in your memory from eight hours ago when you went to refill your cup of water and now, when you're at the library checking out a book, and you don't even have a *hint* of an idea as to what in the fuck you did for the past half a day; you'll lose the ability to regulate your emotions, meaning there's a good fucking chance you'll be in a lecture or something and notice your hand is getting wet propping your face up, and then you'll touch your face to discover that you've been crying *hard* for at *least* a good couple minutes and you have no clue why or when it started; etc. etc. etc. It fucks with your head so goddamn hard. You know how sometimes you'll drive somewhere, but your brain goes on autopilot while you think about other shit, and you get to where you were going and realize you don't remember the drive at all? Imagine that, but you don't remember getting in the car, you don't remember where you were going, you don't know how long you've been on the road, and you only realized you're driving a car because someone honked at you because you're driving fifteen under the speed limit and drifting across the center line.  Third, you get weak. You get so fucking Holy Shit I Think I'm Going To Die weak and it's fucking torturous. I've slept on the floor more than once because I'd spent too much of my wildly limited energy that day and I didn't have the strength to lift myself up onto my bed. There was one day where I ended up having to piss in a cup because I couldn't walk from my desk to my bathroom to go before bed, cause I could only manage to take the three steps necessary to flop down on my mattress and that wasn't nearly enough to make it to the bathroom.  Have you ever started crying while taking a shit because you can't muster up the strength to push the turd out of your ass? If that sounds like fun to you, then long-term fasting is right up your alley.  Fourth, you experience *oppressively* bad dissociation and depersonalization, and you're putting yourself at risk of inadvertently damning yourself to suffer through that *permanently.* You're going to stop feeling like a human being. You're going to stop feeling like you have a physical form. You're going to stop feeling like you even *exist*. You know that quote ""I think, therefore I am?"" You're going to start to doubt that you're actually even *thinking* about anything; you're literally going to doubt that you have a *consciousness.* This shit isn't a brain *fog*, it's a brain *void*; it's not like you're reaching through a mental fog trying to figure out what you're thinking about or how you feel, it's like there's fucking *nothing* in your goddamn head, and it's not a content nothing, either - your brain feels like it's in a vacuum that's desperately trying to fill itself with air or thoughts or *something*, but you're too malnourished and disoriented for anything to get in, so there's this unceasing, oppressive negative mental pressure going on inside of your mind that ends up not being just an *obstacle* for though, but an impassable fucking wall. You know how body dysmorphia can make it feel like you're not looking at yourself when you look in the mirror, almost like it's a different person? That shit gets turned up to eleven. You'll look down at your hands and you'll not know who they belong to or where they came from. You'll walk past a mirror in your house and get *startled* because you have *no idea *who the *fuck* that is. You'll start running into shit because you've lost all sense of the fact that you exist as a tangible object in the universe. If it gets *really* bad, you'll suddenly realize that you're looking at yourself in the third person, and everything looks wrong or blurry like it's a tilt-shift photograph, and the camera'll just slooowly zoom out and defocus; that shit is one of the most goddamn unnerving, terrifying things that a human being can possible experience.  The reason you're putting yourself at risk of that shit being permanent is because once your brain passes through the veil it's near fucking impossible for it to figure out how to walk back out of it. Permanent depersonalization and dissociation (DPDR) is usually caused by trauma (as one's brain will detach itself from the situation at hand in order to try and cope with what's going on, and having to do this too often will end up causing it to more or less make that its default setting) or drug use (if you get way too high or have a bad/disorienting enough trip, your brain might get stuck in that limbo), but it can *definitely* be caused by malnourishment. While my experience with DPDR is almost entirely due to trauma, there are a shitload of people I've seen, and three people that I know personally, who developed DPDR due to a period of fasting for too long too many times. You learn more about this shit at /r/DPDR, by the way, but yeah.  #Don't do fasting, ya walnut.",False,False

I’ve done longer than 50 hours without eating while ill before but not since I started trying to lose weight. My experience totally lined up with yours though. Except these days I don’t think it would be that awful... think of all the weight I’d lose if I just didn’t eat? That would well worth the hardship of it.,False,False

I can go into more detail if you want but the gist of it is that, somewhere in the mid 50s, you more or less detach from the physical plane and spend the rest of the fast stumbling around like a blind ghost caught in fog, and everything's confusing and overwhelming. It's awful, and you don't even stop being hungry, which made me feel like I'd been scammed by all the IF stuff I'd seen lmao.",False,False
