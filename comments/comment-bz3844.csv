When you’re coming off of restrictive eating it might seem like ANY type of increase in eating will feel like a binge. I also noticed that when I started eating normally again I was excessively hungry and it made me nervous that I was doing the same thing. Eventually it evened out, and I wasn’t eating as often as I was but was eating a normal amount. You’ll be okay, it all evens out in the end.   If you’re in the midst of recovering I’m sending you so much love and positive thoughts! Hopefully this helped in any way.",False,False
