My fiancé and I eat the same dinners, and I make a variety of different meals. I’m also short, and he’s tall, so our nutritional needs are different.   Typically I will weigh out all my ingredients and calculate the calories for the whole meal. After cooking, I’ll weigh out a smaller portion for myself so that I know how many calories I’m eating. I’ll give him a much larger portion of things like rice, bread, etc, and I’ll have more salad or vegetables to bulk up my meal. It takes a little longer to calculate everything, but as long as I know the nutritional information of my meals, I have no problem with spending an extra 25 mins (~20 mins to prep and weigh ingredients separately, and then ~5 mins to weigh the food afterwards and weigh out my own portion). I’ll start cooking early so that I’m not feeling rushed and stressed out about it.   Neither of us eat breakfast, but I usually have my own snacks/lunch. He’ll either fix something for himself or eat something from the freezer. I make burritos, pastries, breads, etc, and freeze them in big bags so that he can pull one out whenever he’s peckish. They’re more for him, but I calculate the calories and label the bags so that I can comfortably eat them if I’d like to.   It’s a little tough at first to incorporate the calculating and weighing into your meals all the time, but it becomes second nature after a while. I hope one day you won’t need to feel troubled about this, and you can eat comfortably with your SO. Good luck!",False,False

He knows I’m a “max calorie counter” (I’ve never called myself anorexic irl), so he lays everything he uses for the meal on the counter so I can read the nutrition facts, calls out his measurements as he cooks, and then lets me choose my own portion size.  So for example, if he’s making breakfast burritos, I get to pick the tortilla (I opt for 70 cal tortillas, he picks 210 for himself), I pick the cooking oil (0 cal coconut or avocado spray ftw), I tell him how many eggs I want, and I tell him which toppings I want in the burrito and which to hold on the side. At the end of it, I can make myself a 150 calorie breakfast while he gets his 700 cal one.  If he notices I’m eating too few calories, he insists I add a snack, but I get to pick the snack, so I just pick one of my safe foods while he makes himself some torts.  We also go ham on salads. We make salads together where I use a specific 25 calorie dressing, spinach, and imitation crab while he loads his with avocado, cheese, and steak lol. He always takes the bigger bowl/plate, and he lets me scrape my food onto his plate if I feel like it’s too overwhelming.  tl;dr It’s totally doable if he works with your disorder. I feel more comfortable with his meals than I do with most restaurant meals.",False,False
