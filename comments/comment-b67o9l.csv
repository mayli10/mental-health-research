I also went from binge eating to restricting in the last few months and the power trip is massive, but the discomfort of not Instantaneously Being Thin and also Being Fucking Hungry is so hard. I struggle with hormone fluctuations from not eating and find I'm sometimes sadder while restricting than I am when I eat regularly. If that's consistent for you, try sticking in a few days of regular eating into your week and see if that helps. It's actually good for your metabolism, too, to keep your body guessing so it doesn't adapt to fewer calories. And if you're finding yourself truly hating these thought patterns, seek....therapy...dooooo it. Your therapist can work with you to diminish troublesome thought patterns while accepting there are some behaviors you're not ready to let go of. REALLY! Just a thought :)   A note on your friends: set some fucking boundaries that they stick to or drop 'em. Seriously. You are old enough and wise enough to get out of situations that hurt you, and any friend of yours who thinks it's fine to say that shit either must be told to stop or must be kicked to the curb. Have some faith that your suffering is not fodder for other people, and if they're treating it that way, then \*throw them out of your life.\*  OP, I believe in you. Carry on. You're doing great.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;",False,False
