Itâ€™s horribly painful and I break out into sweats and canâ€™t get get anything up. So now Iâ€™m back to exercise bulimia and restricting. Iâ€™m trying a bit to just do healthy amounts of exercise and moderate restricting but fuck me itâ€™s hard to convince myself itâ€™s okay.,False,False

I actually have a doctors appointment about it tomorrow... and I've got to somehow skirt around the fact I'm fasting again.. while also telling her because that info is really important in the whole 'not dying' thing.  My meds suppress appetite. And I promised her I wouldn't abuse them. And she trusted me ;-; So now I'm afraid of her taking the meds away / hospitalising me / just being dissapointed in me. ,False,False

I'm curious was the anemia caused by fasting, cuz we're in a similar situation (besides the fact that I'm a guy but i doubt that changes much) ",False,True

Binging makes me lethargic, fasting makes me lethargic. But that zoned out spacey feeling, it's addictive.   I used to be okay. I used to go to the gym. I used to have energy. But no, I had to lose 5 pounds and read all the 'great' things about fasting from every blogger and doctor ever. Which led to binging. Which led to more fasting. For longer and longer and longer. So thanks Dr. Jason 'it heals your body' Fung. You colossal fucking asshole.   You wanna know what's hilarious. He recommends long fasts, for maximum 'autophagy' but he himself only fasts 16/8. Dude skips breakfast.   I'm 7 days into a 14 day fast. My blood tests from a few weeks ago came back; I'm anaemic as fuck and my body is literally eating my heart and liver to stay alive. That sweet sweet 'autophagy' everyone's talking about, yeah, whoops, it also kills you.. ",False,False
