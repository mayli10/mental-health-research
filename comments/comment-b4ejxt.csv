I need to lose weight the healthy way but it just pushed me back into an ED again. I don’t know what to do because I legitimately needed to (obese) but I can’t do it in moderation ,False,False

My weight almost doubled when I was pregnant and I relapsed hard after my first baby was born. I strongly recommend discussing with your health worker or equivalent. If you need someone to talk to who knows about dealing with ED in parenthood you’re welcome to message me, I’ve been doing it for 13 years now 😬 best of luck ",False,False

I also started trying to “healthily” lose weight this summer with IF and 1200. It was fine at first? But it eventually kicked my history of disordered eating into overdrive and it was downhill from there. It was like my brain was trying to justify restriction by saying “Look, normal people eat 1200 so 1000 isn’t that much less. Neither is 900...” and so on. I feel like my slogan should be “I tried IF and all I got was this eating disorder” ",False,False
