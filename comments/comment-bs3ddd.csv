Let's say this all together: FUCK HIM.  He's your ex, and exes stay exes for a reason. You aren't together so you don't need to apologize to him for shit.  Everyone told you he was bad for you, and now you have the opportunity to do so much better without him. Please, don't do this to yourself. Don't starve yoursef for him.  You'll only be hurting yourself, he doesn't care.  Please. ❤️",False,False
