I like to vicariously eat through other people in videos. Itâ€™s very strange because I also have misophonia. Normally just seeing someone lift a piece of food to their mouth triggers extreme anxiety. But for some reason seeing it filmed with music over the chewing itself doesnâ€™t bother me in the slightest.,False,False

I would never ever ever say anything and it doesnâ€™t make me feel superior at all (but I do freak out a bit if Iâ€™ve had more than other people) but I could literally give a running tally of the calorie count of food eaten for anyone at any dinner table Iâ€™m sitting at. Also I am so fascinated/ jealous watching people just eat food w/o a care in the world. I have this one friend who is like exactly the same height/weight as me and she just does NOT care about calories at all and I am so envious watching her eat. ,False,False
