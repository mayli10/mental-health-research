When your body senses a threat, it sends epinephrine (adrenaline) into your system. Your body thinks it needs to DO SOMETHING or die  This makes so much fucking sense. I've been wracking my fucking brain trying to figure out what the FUCK this could be and it being my ED mixing with PTSD makes so much sense. Thank you so much.",False,True

The best thing I ever did was start emdr and somatic experiencing therapy. This is the result of your adrenaline system being totally fucked up. When your body senses a threat, it sends epinephrine (adrenaline) into your system. Your body thinks it needs to DO SOMETHING or die, so it stops all unnecessary functions (like digestion or holding in pee, which is why people shit themselves from fear). Your body is doing everything it can to keep you the fuck alive. The problem with ptsd is that your brain misinterprets non threats as threats, so it’s firing adrenaline responses constantly.   I highly recommend Dr. Peter Levine’s book ‘In an Unspoken Voice: how the body holds onto trauma’. It’s SO validating to read about exactly what’s going on in your body and realizing it makes COMPLETE sense.   I cannot stress enough how important somatic experiencing was for the physiological symptoms to subside. It’s like a massage for your psyche. There’s some very gentle body work involved and a lot of visualization and being present in your body at that moment. I’ve never left therapy feeling so much better than when I walked in, until I started doing these kinds of therapies.   I’ll mention that I tried years of talk therapy with different kinds of therapists and almost 15 different meds within 3 years, and emdr and somatic experiencing helped more than anything else ever has.",False,False

I have CPTSD, though it's getting treated with EMDR, which has been massively helpful, though is not for everyone.    I don't have much else to say other than good luck and I really hope this gets resolved!",False,False

When I started seroquel I plateaud for 11 days and had panic attacks every time I weighed myself I just. I can't go into treatment til I'm underweight unless I'm going to die otherwise.  At least with this I *can* eat. I can eat up to 1000ish if my stomach is empty. I just want the honestly traumatic vomiting to not happen if I have to eat something for optics around family or w/e,False,True

Since it’s psychosomatic, a therapist would probably be your best bet. Do you have access to one? If not, maybe there’s worksheets or books that could help?   I don’t wanna be like “jUst mEdItAtE!!” But have you tried things like meditation, DBT, etc? Perhaps that would be helpful too.",False,False
