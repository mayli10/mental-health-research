And imagine the money you spent on food that basically went in the trash. I’m not saying i haven’t done it... but it’s just bad. Also I’m scared of gaining weight from the extra calories that may get accidentally swallowed :(,False,False

HOWEVER, if I take a bite of something and decide it’s not “worth” the calories(because i mildly don’t like it lol) I spit it out and throw the rest away. Idk if that counts or not but here lately if i’m mildly underwhelmed I will spit.",False,False

I did this last year and thought I found a loophole to binge eating without gaining weight. It became EXTREMELY addicting, a huge waste of time, hurt my jaw, mouth, teeth, and still gained some weight from swallowing excess. I cringe when I think about the time and money I wasted last year doing this... I tried to quit but still end up falling back into it some days:(",False,False
