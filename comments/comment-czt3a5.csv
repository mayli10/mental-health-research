If it causes extreme distress, interferes with life, causes unhealthy eating habits more than infrequently, persists for an extended period  etcetera is when it’s a mental disorder.  It’s similar to how people can deal with a few symptoms of depression and not have a mental depressive disorder, which is a common response to loss/stress etc.  I do like how empathetic you are though, EDs usually “start out” with just little things here and there though, the wrong trigger when in this state can totally unleash one quickly, unfortunately :(",False,False
