I wanted to share because I understand at least partly what you’re going through :(   I hadn’t really acknowledged it but reading your post helped me to realize it more fully.    I believe in us. I want better for both of us.,False,False

I have the same problem; I honestly can't eat if there's no one else eating around me. You deserve to eat. You're allowed to eat by yourself and with other people, and you don't need permission -- but I'm giving you that permission anyway.   I've recently started seeing a new therapist, and she told me to come bring food to my appointments with her and she'll eat with me. It meant so much to me. Have you talked to your boyfriend about your problem? Maybe he'd be willing to schedule meals together with you everyday.",False,False

Your story sounds so similar to mine.   I’m sorry for what you’ve been through, too. I hope you’re doing okay.",False,True

I do not enjoy food. I hate the thing the rules my life.   You are not alone. I first fell into serious ED habits when I was with my ex. We had been together for years already. We had shared so many meals together. Nice restaurants, taking so much time to prepare meals for each other. Cooking together. Sitting and watching a movie while eating pizza. Going out and getting drunk together and then getting a burger on the way home. I’d cook him breakfast and eat it with him.    And then I started counting.    Numbers took over my life. I became envious of the food he was able to eat. Disgusted by the fact that I needed to eat at all. “I need to lose more weight” “I’ll eat normal when I’m x weight”  He stopped cooking for me. He’d put all this work in and I’d come home and say “but did you weigh the meat?” “You used oil. I can’t eat that”   He stopped eating with me. We stopped being able to have leisurely grocery shopping trips together. A part of our relationship died.    I ate my meals when he was gone. Over the kitchen counter. Disgusted with myself for eating. Even more disgusted because I ate more than I planned, ignoring the fact that I have a very active life and ignoring the fact that I need to eat.    I am so so sorry you’re going through this. It’s unfair. You don’t deserve this. You deserve to enjoy this part of your life. I wish I had advice.",False,False
