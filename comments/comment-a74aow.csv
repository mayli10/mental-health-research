I did not feel like I needed to binge.  It worked so well on me that I ended up thinking maybe my munchies were just a need for electrolytes.  I'm not restricting though. By not bingeing I mean I ate like 1 normie instead of eating for 4 of them ðŸ˜‚",False,False

Also my periodâ€™s super irregular (itâ€™s late a few days even now) and I sometimes donâ€™t even get bloated. But when I do I get in a warm bath and lay on my stomach. Also you can put a towel in hot water and put that on your stomach. With cravings, the best advice that I have is just to stay distracted and focused. Also, I know this sounds stupid, but if you wonâ€™t buy it, you wonâ€™t eat it. So just avoid buying stuff that you know will tempt you. ",False,False
