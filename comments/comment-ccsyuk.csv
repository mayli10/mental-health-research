I have purged maybe a handful of times in my life. Not my thing. Knowing I won't allow myself to purge stops me from binging. When I know I am going to purge afterwards I eat more because ""it's just going to come back up and doesn't count""    As soon as I started that train of thought I got off the damn train. Nosiree I love my teeth.",False,False

First time was a huge binge and I felt awful and wanted it gone. Second time I ate a rice krispie treat to break a fast and hated myself. After the first time, I thought it was a freak incident, then the second time happened, and I got really scared because ""what if I can't stop?"". A part of me always wants to purge whenever I binge, which is a lot, and I also tried to purge once or twice since then, but am proud to say that I haven't actually purged again. My strategy is to just avoid the bathroom, either try to socialize or lie down in bed on my stomach and hopefully I'm too lazy to get up ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Stay safe &lt;3&lt;3",False,False

I went from never having purged to purging multiple times a day when I was in high school and that made my ED go from something I could manage while having a pretty normal life to something that kept me out of school and in treatment for years.   Also, both the vast majority of the health issues I suffered from, and the grossest, most unethical, most illegal things I did were because of purging. It solves literally nothing in the long run.   Figure out what you need in order to never do it again (support, eating more, eating less, knowing the consequences, distractions, etc) and then hang on to that thing.",False,False

Purging quickly turns into a vicious cycle that is very difficult to get out of.  If you continue you could end up having a seizure and seriously harming yourself, in a coma or dead.  Ultimately purging isn't going to help you lose weight because it will lead right back into binging.  If you can, getting on an antidepressant has been shown to help alleviate binging/purging related to bulemia - I suggest seeing a psychiatrist if you can.",False,False
