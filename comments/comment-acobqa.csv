It was actually pretty great bc I'd some of the healthier stuff (lettuce/fajita veggies/pico salsa/guacamole) while I was working then take home a meal of the same, plus all the diet coke I could ever want lol. I didn't have to buy much food if I worked a lot in a week and didn't wanna think or focus more on food too. Of course there were some downsides and I did B/P a a few times on some stuff from there but frying chips really put me off of that &amp; I tried to stay the fuck away from the unhealthier options. Also my uncle said I'd probably gain weight from working there so it was also a big ""fuck you no way"" when I didn't lol.",False,False
