My mom didn‚Äôt let us growing up.  Flash forward to my ed flair up. I starting drinking Diet Coke at least 3 a day for the caffeine intake (coffee really starting making my IBS bad recently) and to fill me up. In 4 months I‚Äôve lost 25lbs and I eat at least 1000 cals a day now. Bad days for me are 1500. In the first months tho I was at 500-600 cals :-/.  If I had the reg Coke it would be an extra 300 cals and I think I would see a decent difference? Idk I could be wrong cuz I‚Äôm an idiot.,False,False

I‚Äôve lost plenty while guzzling the shit. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not /great/ for you... but I find it highly unlikely that you would have the same results drinking 3 regular sodas a day vs. 3 diet sodas a day.,False,False
