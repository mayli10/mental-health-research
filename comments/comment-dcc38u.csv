Luckily I’ve had a consult for another program and came out of that feeling positive about the program (aka they didn’t say I wasn’t sick enough, and they actually listened and were concerned).   I will definitely be choosing the other program over the one I ranted about. I know beggars can’t be choosers but 🤷🏾‍♀️😜. If I’m going to recover I’m sure as hell going to do it in a supportive environment where the staff aren’t condescending!   I’m trying to be patient! I’m just tired of waiting and waiting haha, but of course that is not a new concept for public healthcare.  I was so tempted to hop into bed and burrito myself in my duvet and sulk for the whole day, but I made myself get out and do stuff. One foot in front of the other!   I hope your therapy goes well, and that you find it helpful! Thanks again! ❤️😊",False,True

I am very petite and me never technically being underweight (due to my height) is what kept me from seeking help for such a long time. I’m not in therapy yet but I will be in two weeks. It feels like BS that you can be sick even if you don’t “look” like it to other people but keep your head up as best as you can. I know deep inside all of us there are people who just want to be better but be patient with yourself (and with Canadian healthcare for what they said) it’s okay to feel like you don’t wanna be better sometimes. One day at a time. ❤️,False,False

I feel like I’ve been punched in the face. My day was going great and then this.   Thank you so much for your support, I really appreciate it! ❤️  I’m going to try my best to brush this encounter off and to keep fighting, but I feels like I’m fighting a losing battle 😣  I hope you are able to find the treatment you need and I wish you all the best!",False,True
