And I as well am aspiring to be a full time artist , but have not allowed myself to be and countless other things until I’m skinny and this has led me to my highest weight. After all this time , I realized that THIS is also what’s stopping us from getting to a healthy weight, it’s the fact that we’ve denied ourselves life until we’re skinny that puts us further away from actually reaching a healthy weight . So while we’re letting life pass us by, we are also not getting anywhere near our weight loss goals, and trust me , this goes on for years , I’ve not only threw away my teen years but my early 20s as well.  Please don’t make the same mistakes I have made . Decide today. Get out a notebook and write down everything you put on hold down. And start everyday to do one thing from that list . Trust me , not only will you start living and enjoying this beautiful life , you will also become your best version mentally and physically. This is the only way to get out of this cycle , you won’t reach your goal weight until you allow yourself life first.   DM me if you want a recovery buddy and we could motivate each other through this if you want!",False,False
