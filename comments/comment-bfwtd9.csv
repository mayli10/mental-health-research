I nudged my friend and said “he look that’s you” and laughed. Solid few seconds go by and I realized that the long haired kid buried in a huge jacket and hat was me.   I realized then that I have legit no idea what I look like out in the real world. Like I pour over myself naked in the mirror but I don’t check my outfit before going outside because I don’t care how I dress just how I physically am,False,False
