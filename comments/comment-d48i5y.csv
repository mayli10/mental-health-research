Iâ€™m kinda in the same boat as you were, Iâ€™m 20 and Iâ€™m university, and just recently decided I needed to start recovery. I was pretty confused as to where to start too since there isnâ€™t really a set plan to follow for starting recovery. I agree that looking into on campus resources would be a good idea and they have information on other places to go if you need to. What I did was I made an appointment for a normal physical, Iâ€™m still on my parents health care, (Iâ€™m in the US), and wasnâ€™t ready to tell my parents yet about everything, so I made a normal physical, told the doctor what was up, got diagnosed with a general â€˜eating disorderâ€™ and they sent a referral to a local eating disorder clinic. Unfortunately they sent me to one that was closed, and I had to do a lot of waiting and emailing my doctor to go to another one, but I found a new one on my own and had them send the referral there. Not all clinics require a referral from a doctor which I didnâ€™t know before this but I wish I did, then I wouldnâ€™t have had to wait as long to call the new place. So I also recommend calling eating disorder clinics and seeing how they operate and what they require for intake. Also if you call a local clinic they usually have good resources for outside therapists and counselors that are good for ed treatment. But basically thatâ€™s all the stuff I did, and I had to go back to the doctor to get a few medical tests that were required for intake, blood test and ekg, and I am now waiting for the clinic to get back to me about which type of treatment I need. If you have any other questions Iâ€™d be happy to answer them:) good luck with everythingðŸ’–",False,False

If you do enough research you may find a safe feeling in this lifestyle that might get you to eat more without that fear of gaining weight. After reading that vegan book Skinny Bitch, I really felt like I could eat again. I have a history of disordered eating and I really identified that the issue wasnâ€™t a fear of eating, it was a fear of gaining weight.   Hope this helps x good luck!",False,False

Depending on the size of your university, most universities will offer counseling at a pretty cheap rate. I had (to my knowledge) unlimited appointments with our counseling services at $15 per appointment, although with the size of the student body it wasn't always easy to get consistent, frequent appointments. My friend, on the other hand, just moved to DC for grad school and her university is much smaller than where we went to undergrad, so she was surprised to find out she could only do 6 appointments at her campus; they do, however, help their students get set up with an off-campus therapist if they need more than 6 appointments.  If you go to your university's website, you can probably find a page about the health services and they might have info on counseling there!",False,False
