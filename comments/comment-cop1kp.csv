And IMO when I get rid of food by purging I feel like such a failure, like I was too weak to just deal with to the ‚Äúproper‚Äù way. Obviously fasting/restricting more isn‚Äôt a good thing, but it‚Äôs way better than purging/puking. Just be mindful that fucking more with your intake can result in binge eating.",False,False

The loss of electrolytes, dehydration, face swelling, teeth sensitivity, etc. just isn't worth it. And after I purge (especially if I have restricted all day) I usually feel more hungry or sick the next day.  Tomorrow is a new a day hun. I know it isn't easy and it can be hard to resist the urge. Honestly, sometimes I will just put on a youtube video and fall asleep or lie in bed until I forget about it. Feeling overfull is a temporary feeling. Take care!",False,False
