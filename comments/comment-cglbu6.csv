I have had two friends die from eating disorders: 1) from starvation 2) a bulimic who was a healthy weight, in for treatment, went home for the weekend to see her kids and died on the sofa. Not sure if it was a heart attack or what. This is no joke, really. Eating disorders donâ€™t age well. Just remember, repeated vomiting can result in mouth and throat cancer. Apart from not dying, do you want to have part of your mouth cut away or have speak through a voice box? This is really fucking serious. Not enough people are aware that eventually, it WILL happen to them.",False,False
