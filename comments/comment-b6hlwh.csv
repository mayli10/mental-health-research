When I was in high school I lost about 30lbs rapidly, came to school visibly drunk, got drunk at school, had occasionally visible (esp when I played sports) self harm wounds, or sat under my desk in class with the hood of my sweatshirt up and crying because I was terrified of people looking at me.   No one told my parents any of this. I mentioned something the other day and they looked shocked. I’ve been out of hs for 12 years so it’s not a big deal now (also sober). I still don’t understand why none of my teachers said anything to either the school administration or my parents.   But I agree with the person above about taking snacks to class. ",False,False
