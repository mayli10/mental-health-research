Ask, not sure if you can relate but for me itâ€™s ALL numbers Iâ€™m obsessed with, but only since my ED took hold.   Like, in middle school when it started my math grade took a hard flip and I suddenly loved the subject?? I beg my sisters to let me help with their homework lmao.   I also now obsess over money (numbers!!).   And I work in a warehouse and my job involves focusing on lots of different numbers and I honestly think thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m so good at it.   Yikes just realized this is all probably way off topic and I should have just made my own post. ðŸ˜… But yes, I too am obsessed with numbers.",False,False
