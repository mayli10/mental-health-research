This [nutrition info](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f5PY81ey56IYfySNCZ1HDOGxedLZYdY3/view) from Kung Fu Tea is thorough and has pretty good insight into what a typical milk tea chain's drinks will be like. It's not exactly the same everywhere, but I think it's a great baseline to start. The components of most milk teas are milk powder, tea, sugar, and usually boba (after cooking, it gets soaked in sugar for flavor). Of course, the calories would increase a lot if you have a larger cup (\~24oz) than a smaller cup (\~16oz).  (Clarification on that nutrition chart, bc it's confusing at first glanceâ€”under milk tea, it says ""milk tea,"" ""milk tea with one topping,"" and ""milk tea with two toppings."" And the calories decrease the more toppings you add. The reason they entered it like this is bc the toppings displace volume in the cup, so there's less actual milk tea that goes in, hence less calories. You would use this value and then add the separate value for toppings.)  I work/have worked at an independent milk tea shop for more than two years, and this is what I calculated for our own drinks. We use milk + tea + brown sugar syrup. In a 16oz drink, that's 5\~10kcal for tea, \~95kcal for 100ml whole milk, and 100kcal for 50ml syrup (equivalent to 5 pumps syrup). So 200kcal for the tea itself. If you don't add toppings, then there's more milk to top it off. Let's say +50\~100 for a total of 250\~300kcal on a plain 16oz milk tea. It can be lower if you ask for less sugar or more ice.  Toppings:  I never had an opportunity to calculate the exact calories of sugar-soaked boba, sadly there just wasn't enough down time. IIRC when I did the math for boba w/o sugar, it came to around 120 for a small drink. So if you add calories from sugar, I think 200-300 is a reasonable estimate. For people who really like boba but want to cut calories from the drink, it's probably better to just get a plain tea instead of milk tea, and with very little to no sugar. Or ask for less boba.  Jellies and puddings have overall less calories. I would recommend trying it if it's available, I personally prefer it to boba. I actually just had a scoop of coffee pudding in my milk tea today after my shift (carefully measured out 80 grams of our batch for 50kcal of pudding). It's pudding powder + boiling water that sets in the fridge, so although the powder is calorically dense, since most of the final volume is from water, it becomes surprisingly reasonable.",False,False
