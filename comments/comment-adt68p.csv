There's been candy in my apartment since Halloween. The sour patch kids are tolerable since they're only 55 calories a package. But the kit Kats are sent from the devil himself, ~200 calories a pop and they're my favorite. One day I'm like ""there's not too many left so I'm going to demolish them so they won't tempt me anymore."" But there were like 7 of them and I've been trying to stay around 1200 so then I'm like ""this candy is more than I planned to eat in a day."" I still ate prolly half of it before I felt so guilty I couldn't keep eating them.   So yeah. Recently I started throwing away or not buying stuff like that though.... I threw away 4 packages of sour patch kids because every time I wanted one, I chucked it in the bin instead. There aren't any pretzels or chips in my house right now and I plan on keeping it that way.   I try really hard to have an ""every bit helps"" mentality. It's an effort, but I try not to think ""this day is ruined so fuck it."" I definitely used to have that mentality, it took a lot of effort to change it. And it still creeps up, it's still an effort.   I mean I only exercise purge and I have to wake up in this body whether I binged 2000 or 5000 calories, might as well minimize the damage best I can.

It‚Äôs so weird even when I restrict and am contemplating eating something I automatically assume I‚Äôll eat the whole package, of like falafel, tofu, frozen veggies or whatever and on that I base whether I can fit it in my plan.
