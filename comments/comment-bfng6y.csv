I've always been a pretty lonely person and I like the feeling. I'm secretive and I usually can't wait to go home during social events.  I carefully plan my not-alone time to make sure I have enough time for my ED. Sometimes, I count the hours to make sure I will have enough hours when I go home to buy food, binge, purge, and get some sleep.  Other days, I buy food, go home and cry without eating. It has become sadder than I expected and it definitely feels like a presence with me. I watch a lot of mukbangs too, not while I eat, but before. It makes me feel less lonely. I like to be alone, but sometimes I just want someone to shake me and ask me WTF I'm doing with my life...",False,False

I can't explain why but it makes me feel a lot less alone. It also makes me think of the whole personification of anorexia thing, Ana, which makes me laugh a little.  This is far too relatable. I too would describe my ED as a ""friend"" I don't understand why though. And I do whole personification of Ana thing, like when I'm thinking abouth ED related things (what am I allowed to eat, when I am allowed to eat, how much exercise must I do today etc) which is pretty much all the time, I imagine that ""Ana"" (whoever he/she/it may be) is telling me what to do and I create entire conversations with ""Ana"" in my head. üòÇ",False,False
