It's primarily about ethics- whether it's ethical to force an eating disordered person into treatment against their will- But there's a lot of interesting speculative stuff about the origin of eating disorders, including that morality theory and some family/social dynamics theories.",False,False

It makes a little more sense when you think of people with eating disorders as having a moral obsession with lightness. it makes more sense for a person to think ""if I was a better person, this wouldn't have happened to me"" than ""if I wasn't fat, this wouldn't have happened to me"" but for whatever reason, these thoughts are the same in the heads of many people with EDs.",False,False
