I’ve also heard it can help improve mood but I haven’t been taking it long enough to notice a difference. I have debilitating PMDD so really I will take anything that makes those claims lol,False,True

Usually they’ll have directions on the label,False,True

Both were 50 billion. I use amazon and get a 2 pack that last me 3+ months. I only take 1 capsule a day for maintenance. It's about 40 bucks per order but that's only about $13 a month which is reasonable for my grocery budget.   Whatever brand you use, make sure to test out that it works and has active cultures in it. You do this by putting 2-3 capsules inside a glass with some milk (like 3-4 ounces). Lightly cover it and leave it out at room temperature and it should begin foaming and start to curdle in a day or overnight. If nothing happens, return it and get your money back.",False,False

Itll eventually go away but if your microbiome is unbalanced (more bad bacteria and fungi than good) then when you start taking probiotics it'll start to kill off the bad stuff as it repopulates your gut and consequently release gas and make you bloated.   Still, I definitely recommend taking probiotics because the benefits outweigh the initial and temporary bad effects.",False,False
