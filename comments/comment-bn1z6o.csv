In the most simple and limited explanation: no, there aren’t any “real” appetite suppressant pulls out there. One of the primary appetite/hunger hormones, ghrelin, can only be initially negated by a volumetric change in the stomach. When your stomach is empty your body secretes ghrelin, if you eat or drink you fill your stomach and pressure receptors can notice that you’re more full. This indicates the body to stop releasing ghrelin. Ghrelin acts on your brain (hypothalamus) to increase your appetite and it also results in a cascade of reactions that cause your stomach to prepare for food too, and thus hunger rumbles and things like that.   Really all I can suggest is high volume, fibrous, low calorie foods like vegetables and a lot of water. Maybe add some protein with light fat.",False,False
