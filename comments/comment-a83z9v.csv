I felt no judgment from her, just from myself. Thanks.  I'm still feeling lightheaded and weak. I'm chugging gatorade, water, and food. So physically I guess I'm getting better. Mentally it's hard af. I'm not counting calories, just trying to get as many healthy and electrolyt-y foods in my body. I feel gross. I feel pathetic. I feel like I have no control and like I'm ruining any progress I had made. I'm terrified of getting on the scale. It sucks and I can't wait to be okay enough to restrict again.",False,True

I used to work in the ER and I promise we're not judging you. Eating disorders and other addictions are kind of like the national passtime of medical professionals. The work they do is highly stressful and most of them have less-than-ideal coping mechanisms -often involving food.  The primary objective of an ED nurse is to get you out of the ED. Their secondary objective is to keep you out of the ED in future. Their delivery tends to be a bit terse, but they're not judging you I promise. Three rooms over they probably having a detoxing drunk or a vomiting child to deal with. Providing harm-reduction tips to someone with an ED was probably the highlight of their shift tbh.   I don't want to minimize your experience. I just hope that getting some context from the other side might help you feel less attacked by the exchange.   Also, sidebar: how are you feeling?",False,False
