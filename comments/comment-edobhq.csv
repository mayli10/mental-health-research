If you're at a very low BMI, it's pretty unlikely that you'll look skinny fat because you don't have much subcutaneous fat. I would maybe do legs a bit to keep your bum and legs looking perky and toned but other than that you should escape the skinny fat look at your BMI",False,False

I'm around the same bmi and for someone who didn't exercise my body looks okay. Even my stomach looks fine. Flat and all. I know some women complain about stomach fat while being skinny, I don't have these problems. Recently I started to lift weights 6 days a week and I'm very curious as to how my body will change.",False,False
