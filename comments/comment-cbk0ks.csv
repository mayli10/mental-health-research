I've been there and it's hell. Your mom is probably scared out of her mind right now and doesn't know how else to handle this, but I get that it's hard not to hate her for it. Maybe it would be worth it to have a talk with her about what helps you (support and understanding) and what doesn't help (cutting you off from everything by taking your phone). Idk if she's the type to listen to that sort of thing but it might be worth a shot?",False,False

But it just sucks that she‚Äôs using that as a way to make me ‚Äúget better‚Äù, especially because my boyfriend and I are long distance and without my phone, we have no way to contact each other üòï I guess I‚Äôll just have to be sneaky lol",False,True

It should be obvious that your eating disorder isn't just disobedience and that there's actually something wrong that needs to be carefully treated.,False,False

Forcing you to live by her standards will only make things worse. She should try being compassionate and make an effort to see where you're coming from. I really cannot believe that so many parents don't understand that. It seems like they just assume mental illness is nothing more than making bad decisions. Even if that were all they are a parent should try to understand why you would make bad decisions rather than punishing you for them.,False,False
