I feel like I might've done workouts that target the wrong areas of my legs (aka make my thigh gap disappear) :/ I don't necessarily wanna build muscle but I already have them so it's hard to get rid of... I guess I'm just gonna keep cutting my calories as much as I can and avoid moves like basic squats and lunges that might make my thighs even bigger",False,True

Also, do you think they look too muscular or too big in general?   You can target specific areas if you want to build muscle (aka look more toned or more muscular) but you cannot really loose weight in specific areas, that only happens when you’re in a caloric deficit and where you loose most weight depends on your body type.",False,False
