Most white Americans smell vaguely of dairy. Many Indians smell vaguely of delicious spices. This is like people who brag that they don't have an accent, when of course they do.  I'm sorry you're feeling self-conscious about your diet, though, and hope you're able to cook more soon. Indian food smells great! But if you want, you can always ask the Spanish guy if spicy smells bother him, and if they do, try to cook at times when he's out. Surely there are ways to air out the kitchen, right? (But honestly...barring legit allergies, I don't have much patience for people who claim to be unable to tolerate food smells. If I can learn to deal with the smell of bacon and fish - as a lifelong vegetarian with a very powerful nose, who used to gag at those odors - I'm pretty sure he can learn to deal with turmeric and coriander. Although I know that wouldn't solve your feeling of self-consciousness. But hey, if you don't ask him, you'll never know how he feels about those smells.)",False,False

It must hurt to hear people say stuff like that about your cooking and culture but try not to take it to heart. They're being stupid and ignorant. Many Indian dishes are so nutritious and economical and you could make a lot one day and store it for the next few days. Its not weird to use the kitchen. Normal people use it every day, so no need to feel self conscious!",False,False
