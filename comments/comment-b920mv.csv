I’ve never been to Walden, but I have been to CEDC and Renfrew also in the Boston area and MN was by far the best care I received. I know cost can be a barrier which sucks but if your insurance will cover it, it’s a good program",False,False

I was very recovery minded and they allowed some really horrible, triggering talk all the time and did nothing. The groups were awful if they even happened. I lost my mind there. I spent most of my time crying and listening to the girl in the room next to me purge and curse out the staff. It was a truly awful experience for me and I would absolutely never recommend the program to anyone but I have to praise my social worker there who was exceptional and the light of that awful experience.",False,False
