We are now only semi close on social media but we do not talk regularly. I think we're both struggling.  I misread this initially and thought you meant lost a friend because of death.

Funny thing is I moved out of our place after that (we were all roommates) and the minute I left, they all turned against her. Seems like some people just need to have a target all the time.

My ed started at the end of high school, and between then and mid college they had several interventions for me. After the last one I got tired of it and basically screamed it off, half thought i was crazy and needed help and the other half were more indifferent and all ""B dragged me into this idk"". so alongside that plus the core friend of the group B, my bestie since middle school, living with me in the dorms, not respecting my privacy, logging into all of my social media to screenshot evidence of my ED spiralling to use against me and send to my mom, and also briefly being FWB that i no longer wanted to continue doing, our friendship exploded and the rest dissolved away from me.

At school, I don't even talk with my friends because I've gained weight. I just feel utterly disgusting. I can't stand socialising anymore. I haven't even celebrated my birthday because I was afraid of the calories, and I've even asked all of my friends not to bother with any gift.  I feel lost. Defeated. Isolated and alienated.
