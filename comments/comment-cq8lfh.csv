She is definitely one of Maddy’s style icons, especially with her prom dress and the two piece at the carnival. She’s also on the middle to higher end of the BMI range, and shes just as (if not more so, because shes the OG lol) sexy, powerful, and captivating as Maddy. I saw her live at the start of this year and it probably saved me from falling too deep into my ED. This is definitely way to long of a response to your lighthearted comment lol but hey maybe this is useful, also Kali has amazing music anyway so if not anything else this is a rec for her lol",False,False
