It's like the weirdest addiction of self torture that is also somehow praised and considered healthy. Yay fitness and well being!   And oh jeez, the water bottle haha. I always have a coffee post gym to give myself some fake energy to make it home and starve off my hunger further.",False,True

I know logically that it's 'unhealthy af' but my ED brain loves it.  i'm currently in a bad stage of over exercising, after like a year of not exercising at all. and I'm in constant pain, so when I get to the gym, i genuinely feel like I can't do it. I think 'just 30 minutes of very slow  jogging'.  But after doing a slow, agonising jog for a bit, I dissociate kinda hard and then it's all so easy. I'll workout for hours sometimes, staring vacantly on a fixed spot. and then when i finish, I'm so dissociated that I can barely acknowledge people in the gym who say 'hi' or smile in greeting, or even 'nice job'. I think I come off pretty rude because of it :/   The dissociation lasts until i get to my car, and then driving home I come back to myself a little, and then... climbing out of my car and walking the 12 steps to my apartment takes a full fucking 20 minutes of moving very slowly, doubled over like an old woman. I once dropped my water bottle and had to kick it to my apartment because if I bent my knees I would crumple.   Also. I dropped my phone in a store today and some polite kid darted down to pick it up for me before I could and I nearly started crying from gratitude. I hope that boy, wherever he is, has a wonderful, beautiful, bright future full of love and good karma. Kids are great, man.",False,False
