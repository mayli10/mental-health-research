Hopefully I can help and chime in here and help.  When I was in treatment (over 10 years ago now) I almost checked myself out of my program one day because I had to eat a piece of McCain chocolate deep dish cake with my dinner. I was so mad I couldn't stop sobbing. One of the nurses took me aside to talk me down from doing something irrational, and she gave me some real talk that I needed to hear and I still carry with me to this day. She said, ""*Why don't you just try recovery for awhile? If you end up hating it so much, you can always go back.*""  And it's so true. It's not a perfect journey and that's okay. If you can think of this journey in steps and take one day at a time VS. trying to envision the rest of your life in recovery, that may also help you ease into it. Your eating disorder voice will slowly get weaker and weaker as times go on. I, like you, didn't believe I could get better. I just decided to give recovery a chance because I had nothing left to lose and my life couldn't get worse, and I'm still here 10 years later, still appreciating recovery more and more each day. It does get better.  Good luck, you deserve the best.",False,False

Then the starved brain is NOT as productive as a well fueled brain",False,False

I'm also a grad student and increasing my productivity/focus is my only real motivation to recover. I've struggled with AN for 10ish years and it never really goes away -- other things (like school or work or whatever) just get more important, but my ED always comes back.",False,False

I also am working with a treatment team that have tried pushing higher level of care, but I don't want to. I have no interest in full recovery right now though because I also just don't see the point. I don't want to have my life micromanaged, I want to continue to make my own choices, but I also want to be productive in other parts of my life",False,False

What I've noticed so far   Pros:  More consistent energy levels  Better mood  Less obsession with food  Cons:  Constant vigilance   Breakdowns over calories by the time dinner comes around   Some days feel better and more natural than others. Some days I slide right back into my old habits. It's not easy, but it's not as impossible as I thought either",False,False
