It‚Äôs not really the buying that‚Äôs a problem; if I were to actually eat a reasonable amount of food then what I buy would be appropriate. The problem is that I prep this food knowing subconsciously that I have no plans to eat any of it, then I pack it up and take it to work and (big surprise) don‚Äôt eat it, and then have to throw it out because it‚Äôs been sitting at room temp in my bag all day. I put an apple in my bag with high hopes every Monday and it inevitably stays there till Sunday when I compost it and then put in a new one. I think the reason for all of this is that I‚Äôm SO scared that I *might* get hungry at some point in the day, and if I don‚Äôt bring food I could be stuck with options that I‚Äôm not mentally prepared for.",False,False
