And if she mentioned it before the stuffing got consumed, she‚Äôd get some/all of that food on her plate then end up throwing most of it in the trash.    The last time I celebrated Thanksgiving with her I didn‚Äôt touch any food she likes because I didn‚Äôt want to hear about how I was eating so much, how I could be so selfish to take the food I knew she wanted for leftovers, etc.  She still used the holiday as an opportunity to complain about the ‚Äúsmells‚Äù of spice used on my food and how repulsive they made the house smell on her favorite holiday.

That is *nothing*. She‚Äôs very incorrect. I‚Äôm sorry you have to deal with that. If that happened to me it would make me second guess myself.   Something about mothers and eating habits, I really hate it. I‚Äôm *highly* food agressive. Cannot stand when people talk to me or look at me when I‚Äôm eating, or acknowledge my food or that I‚Äôm cooking and make me describe my food. No idea why or if that‚Äôs a normal thing or not. I can only eat food if I‚Äôm distracted because the chewing noise aggravates me too. Yikes. Anyway...   My mother always found a reason to talk to me while I ate, or ask questions to make me speak between bites. She would always find ways to comment on my food no matter what- a couple strawberries or a cup of ice cream it made no difference. I remember one time I snapped when she commented on how I was just eating whipped cream in a bowl and I flat out through the whole thing into the trash.   Seriously let‚Äôs all just ignore the mom talk, please. It‚Äôs never a good idea.",False,False

I was serving myself a second plate because I was just leaving a 24h fast and my first place was just a spoon of everything and she said ""Are you gonna eat AGAIN? I can see your fat from here, you should start controlling your weight"" I tried explaining that I haven't eaten all day and she just continued and when I decided to not eat that plate she said ""Wait, I didn't want to make you lose your appetite I just wanted to make you aware that you need to control your weight but you can eat that plate if you want to"".   That's one of my worst memories that I have and the reason that I relapsed and wasn't able to go back to recovery for a long time.   I hope you can see that sometimes they're doing it because they want to mess with you and are completely oblivious to what is really happening",False,False

I would say it to her and ask her not to comment on your eating habits. Parents don't realise how much their words can effect you, especially with sensitive topics like weight/food/appearence. Try to remember, she only sees you eat. She can't see the starvation or feel the hunger pangs or see the constant counting and ruminating.   I never thought about my eating habits as a child until I was around seven or eight years old. I ate three chocolate eclaires. As ya know, a child given a box of cakes would do. And my whole family tore into me for it. Including my step-dad who weighs about 400lbs. My mother made me stay in my room all day and GROUNDED me for the only time in my life, because I ate three fucking pieces of cake. The topic of how fat and greedy I was became the talking point for the day for the whole family - they even let my grandparents and my aunt know about this apparently heinous thing I had done, even though they weren't fucking there! The tears and the shame that came with that whole day is what kickstarted my issues with food. It was the first time I was made to feel guilt and shame for eating.",False,False
