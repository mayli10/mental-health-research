I used to put globs of butter, brown sugar, chocolate chips and whatever sweet junks I could find in the pantry in my oats for a quick and easy binge snack lolol.",False,False

When I was in the hospital I had a lot of oatmeal and it's just so good. I make it with protein powder, SF hazelnut syrup, and unsweet cocoa powder, so for a half cup(cooked) it's like 130 calories, but it keeps me full for a long time bc it's not Just Carbs. I'll also make voluminous oats like that :')   Greek yogurt is actually a fear food for me. Idk why.",False,False
