There's definitely a lot of charitable or practical things I could do aside from fasting so I'll think about bringing it up with my mum.,False,True

The spirit of Ramadan is to purify your mind and body to bring you closer to God. How can your thoughts be turned toward a higher power when your mind is consumed by ED thoughts? You cannot help others if you are falling apart, and the spirit of charity is a huge part of Ramadan and Islam in general.   Listen to your mom and don’t fast. You can compromise and give up something else that allows you to think of those less fortunate than yourselves, without hurting yourself. You can give up cigarettes, or social media, or dining out. Use the money and time you would use on a vice ordinarily and give it to charity. Like today I ordered a really elaborate meal from the spaghetti factory to binge, but instead of bringing it home and gorging myself, I went to the river to find a homeless guy and just gave all the food to him. I helped myself and another person today and I didn’t have to starve myself to do it.   You don’t have to tell your mom that it’s a mental reason. She already sees that your blood pressure is tanking and it’s actually bad to hurt yourself during the fast. That’s why there’s exemptions.",False,False
