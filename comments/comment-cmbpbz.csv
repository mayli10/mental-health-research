I used to hide mine from my boyfriend and when I finally opened up to him about after gaining hella weight from trying to appear “normal” by eating with him, he was completely understanding. We pre-discuss meals if we’re going out so he makes sure my anxiety is low. We’ll eat dinner together when our schedules allow but he also checks in to make sure I’m still comfortable with the food being served. I’m not sure if your SO knows or not but it could be helpful if they do. I know too, too well what you’re currently going through feels like.",False,False
