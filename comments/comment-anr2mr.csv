For someone who prides themselves in being a very rational person in every other aspect, and someone who values intelect and intelligence, i definitely feel very dumb for allowing myself to waste my life like this. I don't put half as much thought or effort into anything else in life than losing weight. The worst is I don't blame myself too much for bingeing, I see it as the disease it is, but ive yet to fully accept that the restrictive/purging side of me isn't a choice. I could just accept being chubby. I could be a smart, intelligent, educated happy chubby girl. Instead I'd apparently rather have no hobbies or energy for studying and reading because starving is more important and beauty and thinness will make it worth it. Except I never actually get there since i keep bingeing and the cycle has been that way for some 10 years now. They say the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over expecting different results. I judge myself for that. And for putting so much value in outside appearance. That's why I'm so ashamed to admit this problem to anyone, tbh. I've imagined talking about it and immediately feel like it comes off as ""i want to be pretty and nothing else matters as looks are the most important thing about me"". ",False,False

I just wanted to be skinny and hated exercising and eating healthy so I was like ""whatever, I'll just be bulimic.""  Six years later it's definitely a compulsion/addiction but, if I could stop without gaining weight, it'd be wayyyy easier to stop. I don't like anything about myself except my thinness, because that's just a quality I value in myself. I don't have the bone structure or the weight distribution to rock a few extra pounds.   And eating disorder is a set a behaviors though. Regardless of motivation, it's an eating disorder, and it's dangerous, and it royally sucks.   I know everybody is always looking for the Reason^tm, especially professionals and especially us as suffers, but really it's just a combination of neurological, environmental, and social factors that fuck us over.   Why you suffer doesn't impact how much you suffer. You're valid. We all are, no mater why we do this. ",False,False
