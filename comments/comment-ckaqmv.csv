I did go to the hospital for some tests when I was in high school though because my pediatrician was concerned there might be something wrong with my stomach. I drank some barium and had an Xray done, but the doctors found nothing wrong. I think I was just having stomach aches because I was under a lot of stress. It's only been the past year or so that I've been experiencing stomach aches again. Well, this time it's my whole abdomen that ends up hurting. It's possible I could have dumping syndrome because my body doesn't seem to fully process food. When I first decided to gain weight I would eat an excess of 500-1000 calories per day and after a month of that every single day I only gained one pound. As I said in my post though, my symptoms don't seem to line up with the timeframe of what would be expected of someone with DS and I don't get diarrhea. At worst maybe sometimes my poop is a little softer than usual. That's largely a result of diet though. It can happen to anybody depending on what you eat.  I usually don't eat meat besides ground beef and chicken. Sometimes fish, but rarely. Even when I eat ground beef it's usually very soft and isn't stringy. I think I made a post mentioning the burgers my dad made last night. I do usually avoid sugar, but I've been having trouble getting enough calories to maintain my weight without it since I've been visiting, so I have been drinking sugary soda lately. I rarely have much dairy. Usually just a little. Most of my calcium comes from nut milks. I do drink meal replacement shakes sometimes and I was reading that they can aggravate certain GI issues, but I never feel sick after drinking one and they don't seem to impact my likelihood to get sick later on. I even showed my GP the label of the shakes I drink and she said they seem like they should be fine. I'm pretty sure dairy is the main concern, but there's not that much in them and I'm not lactose intolerant. For the most part I feel best when I avoid solid foods and worst when I eat a lot of solid foods.",False,True

I was diagnosed with Dumping Syndrome (although all my symptoms don't quite add up) after a stomach emptying stidy, however it normally only occurs after a stomach surgery which I have never had. My GI specialist was stumped at how I could have it, but I never mentioned to her my history with anorexia/disordered eating. She thinks there's more causing it than just dumping syndrome. Have you had any previous stomach surgeries?   I started eating very very slowly, and cutting out a lot of sugars, meat, and dairy and it's helped me significantly. I hope this helps, I'm very sorry that you're going through this. I know your pain.",False,False
