I have never once felt judged or shamed by them.  More than anyone, dentists know how distressing it can be to have visible tooth problems.  They have given me good product advice and harm reduction tactics, and don't make me talk about the ED in any way, they just tell me about how they're going to repair or maintain my teeth.  For reference, my teeth are FUCKED.  I have 10 teeth that are my own, the rest are partially or entirely fake.    Being upfront with my dentist MASSIVELY reduced my anxiety about dealing with tooth problems.",False,False

Just make an appointment and be honest about your past. Cosmetic and restoration dentistry can do amazing things, though it can be a bit spendy.",False,False
