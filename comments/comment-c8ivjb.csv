And that means there’s 2 of us suffering. Feeling alone. Yearning and aching for *someone* to notice. Reach out. *feel* our pain. Tell us they can’t see us this way anymore. That we NEED recovery. You are not alone with that feeling. We share it &lt;3,False,False

Sending u warmth and love ❤️  If ur feeling up to it, try doing little tasks to put some tangibility on existing. ex: updating playlists, write/type one memory from the day (a conversation u had, a place u went, a story u read, etc.) journal on a google doc or a notebook, just little things. I hope u feel better soon!",False,False

And you’re absolutely not a terrible person, especially for wanting so desperately for someone to notice your suffering. That’s normal when battling an ED like this. Is there a way you can get outside help from a therapist or counselor if you’re not comfortable outright talking to your family and/or friends about it? I’m in a similar situation as you, and want so badly for my husband to just *notice* and  subsequently care about my ED on his own, but I’m realizing that I’ll likely either have to just bluntly tell him what’s going on, or seek outside help from a therapist. But trust me, I know, it’s so hard. I haven’t even taken the leap myself yet so I understand how difficult it is.   Take care of yourself. &lt;3",False,False
