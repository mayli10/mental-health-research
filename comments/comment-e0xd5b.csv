I think itâ€™s mainly because all of those varieties make me feel restricted in the end, I would be happiest if I could eat just 3000 calories a day and it would just not affect my weight at all, because even intuitive eating probably only works if you let really go and not have a â€žI must eat as low as possible or else Iâ€˜ll gain/not lose!â€œ mindset, but heck, I WANT to lose weight! :(",False,True

My binge/restrict cycle is just switching mindsets - binge / intuitively eat / trying to eat in a calorie budget / cutting down the calorie budget to see faster results / binge   Every path leads to a binge for me and Iâ€™m doing it to myself. And it feels extra heavy thinking about all the time Iâ€™ve wasted,False,False
