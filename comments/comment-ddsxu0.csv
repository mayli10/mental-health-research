It can be so hard to remember that sometimes.  What were previously my ""big"" clothes are no longer big on me, and it's so demoralizing. I hope one day you'll have comfy clothes, and here's to eventually being comfy in our own skin!",False,True

My bigger sized clothes don't fit. I get home every day and URGENTLY strip off from the discomfort and my body has patterns and lines from where the clothes have dug in to me.  It fucking sucks, but try to remember that size is just a number.  It's just a number and nothing can't be undone xx",False,False

I‚Äôve been going through the same thing. And honestly once I let go of being that certain size, and started getting the size bigger I‚Äôve felt so much more comfortable and far less like I‚Äôve put on a lot of weight. Having clothes dig in just makes you feel worse :(  As hard as it sounds, just keep telling yourself it‚Äôs just a number!

I never did. I lived in sweats the whole time I was at my HW and saved all my skinny clothes for later. If I ever get fat again I don't know what I'll do but it's almost like new clothes is ""sealing the deal"" and just settling into my new big body. It's so dumb when you think about it, like we shouldn't be so attached to pieces of material literally. There are girls that are big that rock it for sure but personally I just look gross and chubby when I'm fat. Sorry for the personal story. Major props to you. This is a big step.",False,False
