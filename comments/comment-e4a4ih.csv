What I'm trying to say here is that love can be completely and utterly all-consuming, and while it still sucks that your BFF doesn't have as much time for you right now as she used to 1) that will slow down and she will come back to you because you're her bestie and that sticks and 2) it has absolutely NOTHING to do with your weight or your appearance, in fact it has absolutely nothing to do with you at all, it's just love overriding every ounce of her common sense or awareness  I know you already know this but it bears repeating bc that's the nature of irrational disordered thinking like ours. It has NOTHING to do with you and she still loves you and wants you to treat yourself nicely, the way she would treat you.",False,False
