My whole body gets the cold kind of goosebumps and it's shivering and it's so uncomfortable it feels a it painful even. Nails go purple, same with my lips. I also get sleepy sometimes. But only when I eat, it is quite bad. If I don't eat, it's fine XD. I sometimes put on a blanket or a jacket but it doesn't really help, or maybe not as quick as I'd like it to. Never seen a doctor about this specifically, but I also have an ED so I assumed it's ""normal"".",False,False

I can also get HORRIBLY sleepy and get pulled into sleep, does that happen to you too?  I have some weird circulatory issues (yay I get to see a cardiologist soon! :0) and I’ve been trying to space things out. Hard because I’m a one meal a day kind of person...   I like to get a heating blanket or heating pad when this happens to help warm up. I also started wearing compression socks which sounds like it wouldn’t help with cold feet but they actually help my dumb circulatory system push blood to my feet.   I hope you feel better!!",False,False

If you have garbage circulation then you’re more likely to notice.   Can’t give any advice about improving circulation. My toes are purple and I’m prone to sores in the winter.,False,False
