It just occurs to me sometimes that I’m doing something repetitively that’s physically painful as a distraction from other kinds of pain and it changes my body. So far all for the better, but it sounds a lot like unhealthy behaviors that I do when I feel shitty. I think I probably am overthinking it, and even if this is some kind of coping skill, I do enjoy it a lot and it’s not causing any serious damage to me which is much better than the alternative ",False,True

I never thought of it as SH, just as one more way to exert my will over my body.  I fucking own it and if I want this mark on it, this mark will be there.",False,False

I learnt that plucking unwanted body hair is a good way for me to avoid worse forms of self harm since its productive and I feel better about myself after. Ive also done it to avoid food once or twice.
