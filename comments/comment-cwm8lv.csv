Well probably ever since I started drinking, but that's how long it was a real problem in my life. I had an awful acid trip, which ended in me swearing off all drugs. I didn't drink for a few weeks, but came back to it because it didn't seem like a big deal. This is when it got to be the worst.   I wasn't drinking every day anymore, but i did something horrible to someone when I was on the verge of blacking out. I hate myself every day for it, I will never forgive myself because there is no reason to. Don't try and convince me of anything otherwise, I know what I did. But I haven't drank in weeks. Its not that long, but I'm proud of it. If anyone ever tells you getting sober is easy, tell them to shut the fuck up. You get clean, because it's what you need. You know that, judging by your post. It's tough, its worth it, and if you relapse there's always tomorrow.",False,False

I have been clean since May, but I miss it very much, and if you have any part of you screaming red flags, take yourself seriously and do your best to keep the habit under control. Drugs really will consume you if you are not careful (no matter what kind of drug it is) and I would never wish this upon anyone.",False,False
