It’s almost exactly what I was telling myself when I was first seeking some kind of treatment:  “I want to feel better, but *keep* the eating disorder.”  And you know what?  My treatment team was like, “okay.  We will meet you where you are and try to help you improve your quality of life wherever possible.”  They flat-out told me that *most* adults with ED enter treatment with some variation of this perspective, and some of them change their minds and want full recovery, and some stay wanting to just make life a bit better without recovery, and that’s still a valid treatment goal.",False,False
