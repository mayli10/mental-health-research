I got some contour stuff recently but havenâ€™t tried it yet. It intimidates me honestly. But Iâ€™m going to try it out at some point, hopefully soon! ",False,True

But also, it can be a lot of fun to be playful so my advice would be to play around and find a style you think suits your tastes, society be damned!!

The trick with contour is finding a shade pretty close to your skin tone, but cool toned.  This will help create the appearance of a subtle shadow, enhancing your cheekbones, and if you go light it may look like you're not wearing makeup. If you do simple eyeshadow (a cool toned shade in the crease and nothing else) you create a shadow on your eyes that isnt obvious. A light brown liner in your waterline can also help with looking closer to your age. And, as someone else said, a more ""professional"" haircut will help.  I myself believe that every hair type is able to he professional onit's own, but I also know that not everyone thinks that, and getting recognition as someone who is mature and developed can be helped by how you style your hair.   Also, clothes that are fitted at the waist but loose elsewhere can help define your body and look curvier.   I hope all the advice you've gotten has helped!!",False,False

Partly to go for a more mature look and partly because I have very unruly hair that was getting exhaustingly long lol. Itâ€™s about shoulder-length now, but just my natural color, blonde, and curlyâ€”so that doesnâ€™t help things.   I almost always leave it down, but should probably look into ways of pulling it back that appear more professional. I just hate exposing my chubby cheeks even more ugh",False,True

I find that a professional, clean cut and dye can have a lot of power in making someone look more mature.  If you have long hair, maybe try a shoulder-length bob and some subtle highlights to elevate it. A lot of mid-twenties people have a hard time letting go of their high school length (myself included).",False,False

Iâ€™ve actually never heard of that style of pant but I can see how that would work. Lighter colors also make sense... A problem since my wardrobe is like 90% black butttt maybe I have something lighter if not champagne-colored.  I actually have been doing the leggings under pants thing haha (and shirts under shirts..) Winter cold is good for something I guess lol.  Thanks for this ðŸ’•",False,True

Shoes depend on climate but I usually go with flats/loafers in summer, ankle boots in winter, and oxfords if I'm just feeling it that day.  With the shirt tucked in and the blazer open it's super hard to gauge proportions. Minimal makeup and jewelry will make you appear older. Hair however you feel most comfortable, but I put mine mostly in a low bun with some long bangs tucked behind my ears.  I have no idea what you're looking for but I'm like a serial interviewee since I job hop all the time so feel free to AMA lol",False,False
