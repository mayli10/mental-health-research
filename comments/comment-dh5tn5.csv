Im like you, if I deviate from the plan that's it, that's my concept of a binge. Causes me massive anxiety if I have to make a change to what I'm gonna eat, even if it has exactly the same calorific value.",False,False

Sometimes it doesn’t have to be a ton of calories. Lately my binges have been compulsively eating one or two PB sandwiches on top of my regular intake.   However last week, I did a self-destructive 5000 calorie binge of just random shit in my pantry. Both are binges to me, but in different ways.",False,False

There are times I eat more than I had planned and feel bad about it but I wouldn’t necessarily call it a binge. I consider it a binge if it’s completely out of control, frantic, frenzied, I’m shoveling food into my mouth without even tasting it, I’ll eat things I don’t like just bc I can’t stop eating, I’m miserable the entire time, I eat past the point of pain.",False,False

I know I'll ""binge"" on Saturday nights but it's controlled and accounted for by cutting the rest of the week so it doesn't feel like a binge.  On the other hand, going 200 over what I planned for a day with steamed vegetables and fruit fucks with my head badly.",False,False
