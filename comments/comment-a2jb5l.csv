I was called fat there, and it was never my intention to gain weight, those 9 y/os never knew my life, yet I can't move on.  And then in 5th-6th grade when I ate more salads and lost weight, I was still called fat, just because I was an early bloomer who hit puberty before those stick-girls (there was a 4 ft 7 girl who was like, 54-57 pounds).  What sucks is I was actually normal then, yet now I let their words fester in my mind and become the cause of my low self esteem, anxiety, depression, disordered eating...",False,False
