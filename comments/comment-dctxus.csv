I don’t know what caused it, pulling myself out of the relapse fixed it and I can’t run anymore (unrelated issue), so I can’t say what was behind it.   Do you think you could have POTS? It can be similar to how when we stand up we get lightheaded but it’s it’s own condition (caused by lots of dif things but sometimes by looser blood vessels. When you stand up, your heart has to pump a TON faster to shunt enough blood enough because your veins aren’t tight enough to maintain pressure.   Anyway maybe look up standing POTS test if you think so? It’s an issue I deal with and I know exactly what you are describing so maybe we have it in common.",False,False

Sometimes restriction comes with neurological syntoms mainly bc of lack of B1-vitamin, and severe anorexics can develop a condition called Wernicke-Korsakoff that can become irreversible if left untreated. I would recommend you to see a doctor, take care&lt;3.",False,False

I've never head anyone else bring this up before!  When I was at my lw (very low) it happened all the time without exercise. It would start as numbness but then progress into very painful pins and needles that would migrate all the way up my leg. I almost always blacked out after this. I figure it must have started out as something less severe than that, so I would be cautious.",False,False
