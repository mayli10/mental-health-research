Hella depressed and when I was in a better place I used to love food and things like trying a new restaurant or cooking a fancy dish or baking would genuinely cheer me up. So obviously the solution to feeling apathic and dead inside is to keep semiliterally throwing spaghetti at the wall hoping it’ll stick. But it doesn’t. Food isn’t going to make me happy because nothing is and the process of getting my hopes up and down isn’t worth it.,False,False

I kind of had a weird realization? Food wasn't making me happy anymore. It wasn't giving me enough of a dopamine kick anymore to numb or distract me fromhow miserable I was feeling. That, coupled with reaching the point of pain-from-fullness several times in the past few days, made me just lose the desire to binge.   I don't think it will stick, but if worse comes to worst for you and things persist for that long, maybe you'll get that 'out' too?",False,False
