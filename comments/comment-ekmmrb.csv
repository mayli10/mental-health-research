By the way if you ever need to do that, use /r/NukeRedditHistory. Reddit doesn't actually delete your comments fully when you delete your account, so you've gotta edit each and every one of them to something innocuous before you delete. NRH goes through and does all that for you so that you don't have to go through the hell of doing it manually",False,True
