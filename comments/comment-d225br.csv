It’s not you It’s not about you It’s not because of your body It has nothing to do with your personality   Boys. Are. Stupid.  This can be a major event in your life, I understand that... But this does not define the rest of your college experience  This does not define you   Easier said than done, but ignore him.  Maybe he is really busy and can’t get back to you, but maybe he is just a doodoo munching douche canoe.  Your hard work, intelligence, and perseverance got you into college, and it’s going to get you through it, and it’s going to put you in a beautiful place. You’re going to look back and think “damn, that guy was an asshole... good thing he bailed because now I found this cute guy that actually loves me, and we’re traveling the world.” Keep going. See a therapist if you need to but don’t blame yourself and don’t hate yourself.   YOURE AWESOME, he is the epitome of loser and missed out on a great thing",False,False
