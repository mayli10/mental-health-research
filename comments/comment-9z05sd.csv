I lost soo much weight in college and then gained a lot of it back after graduating (life stress and all) but I just realized that I can’t be frustrated because it took FOUR years for me to get so tiny. It’s obvi faster to gain 10 lbs than to lose 10 lbs (or for me it is lol) so now I’m just trying to figure out how to stop the binges and just accept that I need to be patient.,False,False

Losing that much weight takes a tremendous amount of dedication and hard work. Hopefully they made real lifestyle changes that will help them keep the weight off vs someone who restricts so severely that they lose the weight really fast and then gains it back even faster. We all like to think that it’ll be easy once the weight comes off but the reality (that is back by both science and endless anecdata) is that maintenance is really hard.   Why does it take them so long? Quality of life. They lived their lives instead of being so utterly consumed by weight loss. I envy that. ,False,False

Whenever my former therapist urged me to avoid ED forums (even though I made it clear to him from the start I am not in recovery from my ED) at all costs and I'd try to explain to him those are actually supportive and helpful, I knew in my heart of hearts that there are things, like progress pictures and stats, that weren't available to ED sufferers in the previous decades and that are just fucking with my mind and making me miserable, and actually ""ruining"" my real goal, which is to lose as much weight as possible.   Please try to keep in mind these things are extremely individual and are consisted of tiny little details, behaviors and thought patterns. I am *not* trying to persuade nor encourage you; I am just trying to help you ease away the pain and discomfort these useless comparisons cause. ",False,False

And as obviously disordered though it is, I felt/feel exactly like you do. I decided fuck no, not another year of my life will be lived like this, and lost the first ~90lbs in about 7-8 months.   Now for me obviously a huge part of that was falling into my ED (from BED to atypical anorexia, where I kind of still am?) but I had also figured if the common wisdom of weightloss says you can safely lose an average of 2lbs a week then there is no reason not to aim for at least that and that would be a loss of 112lbs in a year.   But I figure those people are doing what works for them and/or falling off the wagon here and  there.  ",False,False

In all reality, from a healthy weight to where I am now, even with heavy binging involved, still took a good year and a half, two years. I am very impatient, and very much frustrated with my food addiction (because how can food be addictive right?? ohohoho) so I feel ya.  Another thing to consider, is that slow weight loss tends to stay off since it comes from sustainable dieting rather than telling ourselves we will be fine crash dieting. We gotta learn new ways to eat and essentially exist, and that takes time. ",False,False

Typically, people will go on a diet that they can't maintain (e.g. It's too restrictive, it cuts out too many of their favorite foods, they can't put in the time at the gym). After so long of trying to do something so mentally/physically taxing, they break and eat ""normally"" (read: how they used to) and gain some/all of the weight back before they reach their goal. Hence the term yo-yo dieting.  The ""trick"" is to not ""go on a diet"". But instead, to make lifestyle changes that you can actually maintain for life. And along the road, form healthier habits.",False,False

I reached a point where I feel like eating less affects my relationships too, not just me in isolation. I'm never sure if I'm ready for that and I keep doubting my goal.",False,False
