I would work on feeling more confident first because I’ve been there with pushing dates off for one reason or another and I’m telling you it’ll never be the perfect, right time you have pictured in your head :( either go for it and risk it or work on yourself and stay off the dating profiles for a bit",False,False

I agree you probably shouldn’t go on a date if you feel legit disgusting, that usually backfires (in the sense that you kinda aren’t your best self bc you’re self conscious and upset. But even though you’ve gained some weight recently, it sounds like you still managed to go on a couple dates that went okay, right? If you like this guy so far, I’d try to follow through and bank on you feeling better about things in a week or so. Try not to purge or binge in that time, but even if you do, your mindset is more important than anything. If you try to cultivate confidence and bravery, that’s what will really count. I mean I’ve looked awful but felt great and I’ve looked great and felt awful, and events always go better under the former circumstance.  Don’t feel bad about delaying, either. Just say something’s come up for the next however many days, you’re unexpectedly busy, whatever. Delays, cancellations, etc...that’s all 1000% normal on dating apps, and dudes in particular are used to it.",False,False
