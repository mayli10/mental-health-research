If you can, you should go to a doctor and get diagnosed because most of us here are not medical experts which could result in a misdiagnosis. I personally think it sounds more like a mood disorder affecting your will to eat but once again you should go get it checked out at a doctor because I wouldn’t know. Some people also don’t have the money for it so if self-diagnosis is your last resort then I suggest you do some research and try to find a diagnosis that suits you best. :) Good luck!",False,False
