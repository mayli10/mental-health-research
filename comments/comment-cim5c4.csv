It's the reason why I never got into treatment for an eating disorder. I am formally diagnosed with BED, but my health care provider at the time marked it down as ""not the focus of therapy"" because I wasn't in a dangerous area with my weight. I also lied about struggling with eating because I felt like they wouldn't believe me if I told them I was still going through cycles of binge eating, restricting and bingeing/purging ALL THE TIME.  Last year my restricting/anorexic behaviours came back with full force. I lost a lot of weight in a pretty short period of time and everyone congratulated me because I'm overweight. Then I had a breakdown earlier this year and tried to stop, but now I'm back in the same hellscape. Your brain doesn't stop with this bullshit just because you are no longer underweight. Not eating enough, not getting the nutrients you need, is dangerous, even if you are overweight. What I'm doing to myself is a nightmare and I'm still not ready to get help because I feel like I don't ""deserve"" it and nobody will take me seriously because I'm not emaciated.

When you’ve had an ED ruled by weight loss for so long and then you can weigh I think there is something to be said about how even more skewed than “normal” your perception can become. I think it can sometimes be even more detrimental to your mental health than your ED originally was because you have lost all semblance of self when you identify with your ED and lose that “identity.”   I’m in recovery now and it’s been several years so my ED thoughts are much much quieter now. I still have a ways to go and sometimes old habits die hard, especially in times of stress, but it’s no longer a conscious decision and I try to correct the behavior.
