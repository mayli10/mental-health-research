My mom's an RN and I'm still learning what normal people think ""gross"" is. Turns out it's not normal to talk about bodily fluids at the dinner table - who knew?   I think babies have different color and consistency poo than adults... so I'm not sure that your green poos mean you're starving.   Also your poop color has a lot to do with what you eat. Like my BMs are also yellow, but I eat a ton of curry, tumeric, and corn. Or after St Patrick's day, all that green beer will turn my BMs blue (?) for a few days after.   Also, I was looking for other foods that change your poo color, but I found this spoopy article related to yellow BMs if you're interested: https://www.healthline.com/health/digestive-health/yellow-stool#causes",False,False
