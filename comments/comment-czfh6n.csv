Fasted today. Epic fucking mood swings, goddamn near had a mental breakdown. I knew I just needed to feed my brain so it could work. Finally ate. Actually felt a bit better because my brain could work better...buuuuut now all I can think is how weak I am because I ""broke"" and ate food instead of having cigarette number 183.  Oh and BPD brain told me this today: I'm faking my ED because I'm not as thin as some others WHILE ALSO telling me that if I eat my day will literally be ruined and oh hey weigh yourself for the fifth time and compulsively update your weight on Peach BUT ALSO I'm pretty sure you're just faking an ED because you're too lazy to put in effort BUT ALSO you would seem so dedicated if you just stuck to this 60 hour fast I mean you did it a week ago, etcetcetc.",False,False
