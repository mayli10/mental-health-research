I have never felt so blessed in my life with such people. They encourage me to eat healthy food and to check if I‚Äôm satiated so I don‚Äôt end up binging. My friends are the people that keep me going rn,False,True

I have like fully repressed those three years lol. I made zero friends but did meet my husband, but spent every day pretty much alone. I don't have any friends who are lawyers, didn't make any friends in law school, which did bum me out for awhile but tbh like those people were just not my cup of tea and that is totally okay. I work for the gov so even though that cuts a lot of the bullshit, but even still my only real attorney friend from work was a former social worker who also hated lawyers haha.",False,False

Law school stress is insane, people at my school are legitimately regressing into a high school mentality or something because they act like children most of the time and it just is so overwhelming to have to go back to that and still try to be a nice, decent person.",False,True
