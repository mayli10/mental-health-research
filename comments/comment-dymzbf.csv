But like, I would personally recognize the combo as an ED thing because I'm in that world. Maybe if you're not exposed to EDs every single day it doesn't look weird. Luckily no one pays much attention when I skip lunch either. I usually make myself a thing of broth so I can just say I ate soup.",False,True
