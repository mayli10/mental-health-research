I pretty much lived off of things that are sweet or I have supplements. I've had brittle nails because of this but not really any hair loss. I'm getting the necessary vitamins now thanks to my dietician.",False,False

I’ve also wondered abt it before and I’ve looked through the sub to get a better understanding,False,False

The best way to explain ARFID is it's like your mind &amp; body don't see most foods as being actual food whether it's because of appearance, smell, taste, or texture. It's all unconscious. Even when I try to eat new foods, my body doesn't handle it well &amp; tries to get rid of it via stomach pain, gagging, or vomiting.",False,False
