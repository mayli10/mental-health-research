I usually can eat without eat but when my stomach  is killing me and my appetite just ain’t there weed will maybe do it for me. But really I smoke for the pain cuz it’s 50/50 with me getting an appetite on it.  I appreciate your input tho it’s definitely something to think about ,False,True

But generally so long as you cover your protein, carbohydrate, fiver and fat needs you'll be okay. Fat is important to get into your diet as it is key to absorbing many vitamins. You should be able to get most of what you need from fruits and veg but in general I'd suggest taking a B12 pill.    Your best bet would be to ask for a blood test to see your levels and go with the doctors suggestions on forming a diet around that. ",False,False

But I’ll vape sativa if I’m trying to get an appetite and Indica for when the pain and nausea gets overwhelming.

I make her an uncrustable (I got an uncrustable maker) after she has a bowl and she usually scarfs it down in less than a minute. They're really easy to get down for her and I usually make one for me too. I've noticed he appetite is a lot worse when she's using hard drugs, but when she's off those and has more meals a day she progressively starts feeling more hungry on her own and having more food in the day.
