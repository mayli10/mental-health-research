A lot of times people say stuff like this last minute before leaving because they’ve been thinking and don’t know how to bring it up, so they do it on impulse so the message is at least out there.  Honestly, I’d think about talking to her when she comes back. She wouldn’t have said it if she didn’t want to help.",False,False

The fact that she said it at all means that she cares and is probably worried because she won’t be around to see you daily.,False,False
