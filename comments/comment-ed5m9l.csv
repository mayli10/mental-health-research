I’m trying to point out that people scaremonger about sweeteners a lot and that the evidence isn’t as conclusive as people act, and that it’s up to individuals to decide if they want to consume them or not. I don’t think sweeteners have a relevant link to cancer and I don’t think they cause weight gain, for example.  I still drink and eat a lot of foods containing artificial sweeteners and I don’t personally believe they’re bad. I want people to be informed both ways and not make snap “all sweeteners are awful” or “sweeteners are perfect, better than sugar” arguments.",False,False

If I feel hungry it’s still ultimately up to me to decide when and what I eat, so I meant that it’s up to an individual to monitor and manage their sense of increased hunger and whether they eat more in response.",False,False

I follow a few keto subreddits, and allegedly certain 0 cal sweeteners do still affect blood sugar, like regular sugar does, so this might be what causes hunger? Just a theory of mine, idk how this stuff works...  I see lists of the 'safe' sweeteners posted a lot on those subs. Iirc, Dextrose and Maldextrine are two that are 'not safe'. Monkfruit, Sucralose, and Xylitol are safe ones (though Xylitol is poisonous to pets so its often put under 'unsafe' for that reason)",False,False

It’s like the new thing to scare people with. Sugar isn’t evil anymore, it’s sweetness! I’m diabetic and have used sweeteners in place of sugar for a long while, I’ve lost heaps of weight and my blood sugar and body has never responded as if I am having sugar when I have sweeteners.  Now, I’m just a single anecdote - but the research is not concrete in any way shape or form and sharing it as gospel like this is super dumb.",False,False

Some low-cal sweeteners can have a laxative effect in large quantities, especially sugar alcohols.  There is some research suggesting a correlation between some artificial sweeteners and raised insulin levels ([source](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/261179.php#2)), but the conclusions you can draw from this are wildly varied. It's up to you to keep this in mind and monitor your sweetener consumption re: insulin in the same way you would monitor sugar, outside of calories.  The early studies that suggested a link between specific artificial sweeteners and bladder cancer in rats have not been replicable ([source](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/diet/artificial-sweeteners-fact-sheet#is-there-an-association-between-artificial-sweeteners-and-cancer)). It's unwise to conclude that there is any meaningful link between sweeteners and cancer.  People suggest that sweeteners can lead to weight gain because they can make you feel more hungry, but this is up to an individual to monitor and manage. Personally, I don't find myself feeling particularly hungry after consuming something with artificial sweeteners, but even if I did, it's up to me whether I then eat something and how I manage my diet/calories afterwards. If I found that artificial sweeteners made me unbearably hungry then I would limit my consumption of them or time them before/with other meals.  Other than that? The main ""catch"" with artificial sweeteners is simply that they don't taste as good as sugar to most people, which is why most sweets still use ""real"" sugar. I'd guess they probably also aren't as cheap as corn syrup. And, of course, anti-sweetener fearmongering.  If a person decides that artificial sweeteners are a concern for them, then that's fine, and I agree that there's probably a lot more research that needs to be put into them, but I'm not a fan of concrete conclusions being drawn from inconclusive research.",False,False
