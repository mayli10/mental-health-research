I added that I was having health issues from a low potassium level and dehydration. I couldn't focus in school because of how purging was affecting my body, so I know I have to give it up. After getting an IV drip when I was hospitalized my weight went up this much, but it went down. I knew it was from the drip then, but I was scared why it was increasing so much now. But watching the scale go up as a result has been really hard on me. Thank you for giving me some reassurance! I guess I was just dehydrated. I have noticed my face was bloating, so I thought it might just be water weight, but I feel better after getting a second opinion. ",False,True

You're not just losing the liquid you consumed, but also the stomach bile.  It's very possible a huge chunk of that, or even all of it, is from water.  When you get pancreatitis the treatment is not eating or drinking anything for ~3 days, but you're constantly in a drip to get you hydrated. After not eating for three days, my MIL had gained 8 pounds! My grandfather did the same, and gained over 10 (I don't remember the exact number).   It's incredible how much water can make the scale fluctuate. If you're eating under maintenance, it's NOT fat.",False,False
