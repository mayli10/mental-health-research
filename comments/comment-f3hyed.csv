It’s so nice to know that people I haven’t even met yet care so much. It makes me have some hope for this world. I am seeing a counselor but it’s just hard because I don’t have access to them 24/7. Sometimes it’s easier to just come online and vent to the world and release the frustration.,False,True

Bottom of the flight for that asshole.   Seriously, it's hard with abusive family, especially if it's been going on a while. Do you have someone outside of the house you can talk to? Availability of a therapist, counsellor or trusted leader (lecturer/teacher/tutor?) Sorry, I'm unsure on your age so going for all of the options here. Someone in a clinical aspect or authority position may be able to support you to find ways to deal with his behaviour, or be able to liaise with some outside support to give you safe spaces to spend time in?   You're doing your best, please look after yourself and don't take his shitty behaviour to mean you're worth less than anyone else. You and the body you live in deserve to be appreciated, and that has to come from you first because you can't rely on other people to do that for you. It's not easy, but you're worthy of the hard work, remember that.   ♥️",False,False

And well, I don't have good tips referring abusive family members :( I don't even talk to my brother anymore.  I hope you're ok-ish ♥",False,False
