I've never had feelings as you describe and I don't throw up to purge... however I do get turned on by rough treatment and shame so I have had weird things turn me on. ,False,False

I don't purge, so I guess I don't associate disordered stuff with sex, but it's still weird and funny. Anytime I gag I get a little turned on. And then I notice the ridiculousness and laugh at myself. Can't explain that to anyone. Glad to know I'm not the only one though :')",False,False

Your story seems like a good example of it.   There is a way to decrease the association (this step is called extinction in psych terms), though, so I wouldn't get too worried about never being able to get rid of that association. Maybe taking a week off from doing oral stuff with eachother will help?",False,False

I have a very (weak?) gag reflex because of purging and threw up all over my boyfriend one night. he thought it was hot (....because.... big dicks? who knows), but now when I purge I feel a little less guilty? don't know if that makes sense. like, not necessarily aroused, but like I could be arousing! hope that makes you feel a little less weird haha. I don't have any advices though!):",False,False
