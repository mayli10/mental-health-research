I tried bumping my cals up to 1450, but eat like 1100-1200 still, workout like crazy, eat all healthy, keto foods, and I gained like 3lbs in two days.

Like: Weight gain (Check for me), Fatigue (Another check for me), neck pains (Check again), and constipation (another mf check).  Look into these symptoms and read up more on it and see if it's that!",False,False
