Most people are either in a muscle building mode or fat burning mode. That's why you hear body builders say they're either in a bulking phase or cutting phase. You can do both at once but it's on a strict regimented diet and exercise program while accounting for macros and calorie expenditure.,False,False

You can't create something from nothing. Getting more muscle in your butt means you have to put on weight. The only exception would be if you had plenty of body fat and were eating at maintenance because then you would burn fat from all the calories you needed for your workout and the workout would also help you gain muscle.",False,False

Lost about 15 pounds (135 to 120), and with a high protein intake and proper peri-workout nutrient timing, my lifts have actually gone up. So I think it is possible to built muscle, or at the very least, increase the strength of the muscle you do have. However, I'm not convinced it's going to happen at 500 calories/day.",False,False

This can lead to fat loss if you're burning more calories than you're consuming (which it looks like you are at 500/d)  Depending on your starting weight when you start lifting you may be able to make some beginner gains but ultimately you need to generate muscle from something. I also find that low restricting is really difficult when working out regularly",False,False

Your body won't have any energy, or any building blocks, to build muscle from. Maybe since you have a cheat day, it could work? Idk you'll need lots of protein tho.",False,False
