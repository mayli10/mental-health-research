Pasta and rice get a lot bigger when cooked!   I had a similar freak out tonight. I weighed raw meatballs and placed them on a baking sheet and baked them. I placed mine on one side so I would know which were mine. After they were cooked I thought my husbands amount (which were more than mine) looked way smaller! I was convinced his some how had cooked down to weigh less than mine. I then proceeded to weigh mine and then weigh his and his still weighed more.,False,False

It would be kind of dumb for them to give away “extra” food for free. I had the same thing happen with another box of Banza pasta a week or so ago, so it’s probably more likely my perception than manufacturer error? Hopefully...  Thank you so much. It helps to hear I’m not the only one with those thoughts. Now I just have to grit my teeth and eat three more pasta meals that I prepped :/",False,True

I also already cooked all of it :(  But thank you for replying! You don’t have to worry about saying the wrong thing, I’m not easily triggered by words/writing.

So, I don’t want to say the wrong thing. But things like pasta and rice double their size after cooked. So it’s quite possible that is the actual serving size?
