For me, my ED numbed my depression and OCD. Now that I'm not restricting and exercising (as far as anyone knows), the depression is crippling and I'm getting more and more obsessive compulsions.  My living situation is... less than ideal. As of discharge from treatment, I'll be home with my controlling mother all the time. I turn 18 is May and leave for college in the fall, so I guess I just need to hold out until then.",False,True

Like, the illness is a curse but also it’s a been a main source of stability, a way of thinking, a hobby, an excuse, a purpose, a comfort, and, yeah, a way to express your agency.  That’s one of the reasons why “just eat/don’t purge/gain wait/maintain/etc” is such hot garbage. Disordered behavior and addictions help people cope. Just getting rid of the method of coping and assuming things will be fine is so ignorant.  What does your life and living situation look like? Are there other things that can help you feel more in control or independent? ",False,False

Like, I'll break one without even knowing it exists and then be punished for it. Love that",False,True

And they threatened me with a wheelchair every time I said I was feeling dizzy, so I eventually just stopped telling them lol",False,True

I hate the feeling that you have no choice.  Honestly right now what's bugging me most is that can't lose weight. It sucks for the obvious reasons, but also bc I can't relate to anyone here. I just wish I had some agency in my own life, y'know?",False,True

I’m supposed to go back to treatment again soon. I was is a depression program mid summer and then they moved me into the ED program and after they caught wind of some behaviors. I was so conflicted the whole time because it wasn’t really my choice to switch programs. I don’t even know what I want now. Sorry, I’m rambling (I had a few holiday parties tonight and I’m a bit tipsy).  I love talking treatment though. What’s on your mind?",False,False

Around the holidays actually (thanksgiving and christmas) so I can deff relate!! It sucks but it was ultimately really worth it for me and got me really far in my recovery.   I definitely have some stories of ups and downs of treatment hahah  Mostly just remember how we had to wake up SO FLIPPPPPIN early for vitals and weights and I slept through that a few times accidentally and they put me on chair rest because of it!! So annoying lol ,False,False
