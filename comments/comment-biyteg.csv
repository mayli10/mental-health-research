The youngest was 15 and oldest was 55, so ages really range and the program was very accommodating, albeit intense.",False,False

Last summer I sought treatment for the first time and was in the same situation as you. I tried out IOP and tbh it was fucking rough. For the program I was in at least, they strongly recommended their partial hospitalization program (8 hours a day, 5x a week, for 4 weeks) first before their IOP (3 hours 3x a week). I went straight into IOP and was nooooot prepared lol. That specific IOP program was created as a follow  up to the PHP in a like ""you're not as bad as you used to be but you still need more support before we can call you recovered"" kinda way?  I'm not sure if other IOP programs are set up differently where you can go straight into it. Keep in mind tho thay I had very limited resources and that's just my own specifical experience, not trying to be super negative or dissuade you at all. Definitely still look into it, maybe the programs I had access to were just shit/not the norm (likely bc I've heard other people say they had bad experiences with that specific treatment place too (New England)). If you find one and they tell you you don't meet certain requirements literally argue with them lmao fight your way into it. I was just a pushover and tbh not really wanting to recover anyways and just gave up. You heckin got dis! Good luck!",False,False
