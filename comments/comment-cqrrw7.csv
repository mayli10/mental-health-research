It always reads a few pounds heavier so I look away lol. Then I step on it again and it reads a lower weight. I step on it a third time just to check and it says the second weight again so that's the one I go with.  You have to always weigh yourself on the same spot, on hard floor, no carpet and even flooring.",False,False

The first reading always shows a number that's 3-5 pounds higher than the next reading. However, it's the same number for the second, third, fourth etc. reading. It's so frustrating! I want to believe the second number but I'm so paranoid.",False,False

When I compare my weight at the doctor vs. home thereâ€™s never more than a pound difference  i step in and off until it decides on a number it wants to stay at,False,False
