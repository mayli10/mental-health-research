I get it on my lips from stress and as soon as I feel the first hints of itching/tingling, I slather it on an it resolves itself overnight. Yours might have progressed to the point where you will need a steroid cream from a dermatologist. My first few flare ups could only be resolved with the steroid cream but once I knew the early signs, I‚Äôve never had a full blown eczema rash again thanks to Shea butter.",False,False

Also, got a huge compliment at work yesterday &amp; am being given more responsibilities. Doing some online training at home today &amp; enjoying being able to spend some extra time with my partner.  Testing out a new meal plan, as well. Lower calories throughout the day, rather than a shitload at night. It's tough, but: 1) more feasible with my current schedule, and 2) should overall decrease my intake/combat binge urges.",False,False

I just had a positive moment that I'm holding onto and wanted to share. I was awake agonizing over weight gain all night. I had a crying spell and was just in psychological hell last night over various things including grief over a recent family member's death, and over my weight gain. My body is not the same as it was last year and I couldn't sleep because I was TERRIFIED and convinced I was developing PCOS or an incurable illness that causes weight gain.   Well, it occurred to me finally that I am not in the same town as I was in last year. Not the same landscape, not the same demanding routine, and eating slightly different. So yeah my body is going to be slightly different than it was last year and that's okay. I have been at a consistent weight and it's not bad to be bigger. Now just need to actually believe that.   I don't know if this counts as a victory but maybe it does.",False,False
