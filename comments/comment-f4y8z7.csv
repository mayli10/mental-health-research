Half of the things I was doing were automatic. She probably needed the table or was busy and tried to give you anything you could possibly need. I literally had automatic conversations saved in my head, because people are so similar and they all ask for the same thing 99.9% of the time. She probably didn't even see you as a person, but as the customer #197. She assumed you would need the box, because the other 196 customers needed it too. Like I had no idea what I was saying to people, I had my automatic lines and my fake smile. I'm not even kidding. I'm sorry for this.",False,False
