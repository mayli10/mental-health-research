I felt worse too after losing weight because I was starting to recognize myself again and the realization my problems were so much deeper than my weight really fucked me up and I just really understand how you feel right now. After a while though once I stopped “expecting” to feel a certain way it did get a bit better but I had to really try and forget that I had a body and the starving was complete self harm at that point.,False,False
