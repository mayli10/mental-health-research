Like, yeah, one day, I'm just gonna kick my ED in the shins, say ""Bye Felicia!"" and eat normally for the rest of my life, without calorie counting, and somehow stop exercising obsessively.

Like, I get that blaming the parents for their mistakes doesn’t help anyone in the here and now. But why are we now ignoring decades of research and clinical experience about the role of family environment and parent comments/behaviors? Also some parents are way too disordered themselves to be helpful and involved in the child’s recovery...",False,False

I hate the new trend in therapy/treatment that says it’s NEVER the parent’s fault, and that the family can always be an ally/tool in recovery... it’s just as bad as when it used to said that it was *always* the fault of the parents/family.

Just because your BMI is ""healthy"" doesn't mean you are, disordered behavior can cause organ failure/damage at any weight. BMI alone is pretty shit at accurately gauging health.

People thought I looked ""really healthy again"" with a BMI of 16, but thought my friend would keel over at any moment at a BMI of 20+   I wish my parents had thrown out my scales.
