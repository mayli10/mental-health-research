The quick loss is from food and water weight being excreted, so the rapid gain when you start eating again is food and water. Your metabolism will slow to be more energy efficient, meaning when you eat your body has to kick it back into gear which can take a day or two, maybe longer.  Your body will prioritise building muscle mass over storing fat, to begin with anyway, provided you have lost muscle. When your muscle mass has reached a sufficient level, your body will start to store excess energy as fat. This is more apparent when recovering from a restrictive ED. You can only gain true fat if you take in more energy than you expend, it's basic CICO. If you're in a deficit, the gain you're seeing isn't muscle or fat. Your body will try to make what you've already got stored last, which can make losses appear small, but it won't add to those stores.  The body is a complex machine. As such, this is a basic rundown of how your body adapts to lack of food. There are varying factors which affect what a scale reads and how your body copes.",False,False
