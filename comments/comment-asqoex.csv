Sometimes I just can't wrao my head around all this food jargon and results in me becoming paranoid. Actually after reading your comment I had a bit of bread for a snack and didn't feel that guilty about it. ,False,True

WHICH MEANS: even though you would only be getting 400cal either way, the scale would show a bigger short-term “gain” from the carbs because your body would also hang onto like 200-400g of water for processing them. with the same amount of protein, the process is different and you would pee/breathe/sweat that water out faster.   this is why weight fluctuations seem so dramatic after high-carb days or binges - the body holds a ton of water while it uses up or stores the excess carbs, and then drops it when your intake goes back to normal.   idk if that made any sense because i just woke up lol BUT none of this even really matters to your original question anyway, because 500cal intake (regardless of the macros) is a big deficit for literally anyone !!! i know ED Brain™ can be a stubborn paranoid fucker, but you can’t change thermodynamics. even the tiniest 4-foot-10 underweight woman has a BMR of like 1200. any “gain” from 500 calories is definitely just water and food mass !!  when you look at the specs of a car at the dealership, the weight of a full tank of gas is usually factored in to the curb weight of the car. everyone knows the gas isn’t actually *part* of the vehicle, though - it’s just the fuel that comes in and goes out. sometimes it helps me to think about food and bodies the same way. :) &lt;3 ",False,False

I promise that carbs are not an enemy to worry about. No matter what you eat, if you are below your TDEE, you will not gain weight at all. You are at a very high deficit right now, which will cause many health problems if you continue to sustain it. Calories are basically just energy that you body needs in order to function. I would encourage you to aim for higher than 500, if you can, even if it lacks nutritional value.
