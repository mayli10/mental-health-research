Breakfast is highkey my favorite part of the day. I used to be super scared of eggs, but thats the one thing I’ve been working on and if I tell myself it’s for the protein and good fats it helps for some reason??  I have two pieces of rye toast (160). Slap some dijon mustard (15) on those bad boys, cook two eggs sunny side up (143) and put them on top. Its like a spicy runny openfaced mess and I love it. Down a pot of coffee.  Lunch I have either a maple and brown sugar oatmeal packet or cinnamon and spice oatmeal (160). If I’m feeling crazy I also have a second packet, a canned soup or miso soup broth (15-250).  For dinner I’ll have canned soup, either a lentil for fiber or a vegetable (200-250) with the illusion I’m having variety.   At some point during the night I might have kettle popcorn (250), but not everyday and I overall drink coffee like its air. I’ll come out to alittle under 1200 on my heavy days, 700 on my light.

When I have time I enjoy eggs, lately a 2 egg omelet.  Sometimes accompanied by salsa and hot sauce.  Eggs are super versatile and filling so I really look forward to laid back mornings when I have time to make them.  Lunch is different every day.  If I’m working I usually eat prepackaged peanut butter crackers.  If I’m home, it’s whatever I have around.  Snacks...I try not to snack but sometimes I get hungry.  So I focus on vegetables (bc I do not eat enough) and really like baby carrots.   But sometimes I’ll go for something crunchy if it’s in the house, like graham crackers or pretzels.  Dinner is usually whatever my mom makes.  She’s on weight watchers so it’s never usually super high calorie.  Again, I try to avoid dessert but I enjoy microwaved apple slices sometimes.  Yeah...I eat more than most but have learned to stay in tune with my body.  Checking up on what’s hungry, what needs love and attention.  I do my best to acknowledge physical hunger cues (growling) and if I want to eat mindlessly, I try to do something else to occupy my mind until my body is hungry.   Hopefully this provides a different perspective.  Certainly helped with binging.",False,False
