Your recovery behaviors will look different, but they can come from the same place of self-compassion and working towards caring for your body, whatever that means for each of you.",False,False

At first we both had AN, she started to recover and I merely moved into binging when she relapsed. I’ve gotten through my binging but it was quite a journey.   At that point, when we talked about things, we largely had the same struggles. It doesn’t matter  if it’s AN/BED/BN/OSFES/ or anything else - at the bottom of the ED is struggles with regulation, control, black and white cognitive distortions, anxiety management, self perception or esteem.... focus on and talk about those.   And make sure to specify what you find triggering - maybe set goals, and without talking about numbers (if that’s triggering) say things like “I’m on track with my eating today! I’m really proud of myself for pushing through urges” or something similar. Also specify when you can’t be supportive - it’s okay to not be a sounding board all the time if you find it triggering! Breaks are okay, whether for an hour or a year. Any good friend will understand and respect that.   It’s really easy to find things to connect on, if you focus on recovery and don’t start to compare calories, weights, exercise reps, etc. When you focus on the real nitty gritty, you’re basically going through the same thing, in different presentations. ❤️",False,False

Is this recovery buddy plan based on a specific format... like how did you agree to it (what did she say?/what did you say?) Do you have outside support in relation to your goal of controlling your eating and exercise? When you worry about triggering her, or making her feel bad, what kind of things are you concerned about?  &amp;#x200B;",False,False
