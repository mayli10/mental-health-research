Since I've had different accomodation from shitty dorms, I've felt so much better and more at home. Oh no, that sucks.

Bringing a friend is a great idea. They're probably very proud of you.

They love you and want you to be around and to have a shot at feeling the best you can. You can do this no matter how hard it will be, and they will probably suppport you in every step.

That puts things into perspective for me, I can't imagine what it's like to go that long with an ED. You're a very strong and kind person so I hope you stick around and share that with the world for a lot longer.
