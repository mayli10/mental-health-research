I obsess over dessert every night. I can't watch movies, read, work.. I literally lie in bed and look at donuts on Instagram all the while annoying my boyfriend with constant foodporn.

I just ate a bowl of oatmeal with a huge dollop of it, for instance.   In addition, sugarfree syrup, diet pop, and low cal desserts can help.

Cutting it out almost ENTIRELY has been the only way to solve this for me. :/ it seems hard and sad at first, but the cravings have gone down by about 90%. I usually have like a couple Jordan almonds or a licorice twist a day. Small and manageable treats that never really exceed 100-150calories, and I’m satisfied. If you can at all possible TRY to go several days without giving in. You’ll get out of that regular habit, and your chemicals in your brain will start to cause you to not physically desire it as much anymore. ",False,False

I think I'm addicted to sugar because once I get the idea in my head, I have this insatiable need to have candy/chocolate and it literally occupies my brain to the detriment of everything else. I have the same sort of issue where I have to budget more than half my daily intake for like 3 or 4 candy bars that I just can't stop myself from having. Even if I don't keep candy in the house, I will go out and buy it as soon as I crave it.   To be honest, I've found cutting it out entirely is pretty hard for me. So what I tend to try to do is allow myself one candy bar or equivalent kind of treat and I just try to eat it slowly and savour it. If I buy chocolate, I'll eat it one square at a time, letting it slowly melt in my mouth rather than chewing it. That way it takes me long enough to eat one bar that the craving is sort of satisfied by the time I finish and I don't get into a frenzied kind of binge mindset. Similar deal with candies - get things you can suck on (e.g. skittles) so they take longer to eat. Eat them over the course of a few hours rather than cramming the whole bag in 10 minutes.  Not as good as going cold turkey, but cravings are almost impossible to resist sometimes and if you try to savour and take your time you can sometimes avoid overeating. ",False,False
