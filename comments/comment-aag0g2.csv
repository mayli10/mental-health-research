When I check celebs or other women with exactly the same body stats, I always feel fatter. I have very thin bones so I always think it leaves more room for fat :(",False,False

But just a small thing, I saw a progress pic one time of a girl my height but about 50 lbs heavier than me and was like, wtf she looks better than me! She was standing about 3/4 view and pulling a baggy shirt back to show her waist. So for shits I had my husband take a [picture of me in the exact same pose](https://i.imgur.com/nOf5MjY.jpg). Holy shit the difference was nuts. [This is ne not posing like two seconds later for reference.](https://i.imgur.com/MJGiDjd.jpg)  So yeah sometimes it's legit body differences. Sometimes it's BDD. But sometimes it's just the way someone is posing cause that makes an insane difference. Hopefully this is helpful for someone else cause seeing what a pose could do to a body was really super helpful for me. /r/instagramreality is good for that too.",False,False

I’m not.  I weigh about 130 and the size 10s I bought are falling off and look like shit. I still (discreetly) point to women easily 30lbs heavier than me and have my husband confirm whether or not I look similar.  I also lost some muscle so my body shape is a hot mess. I look deflated and have an old lady ass.",False,False

If you look at my body gallery though you can really see the range of people at similar stats. I was browsing for some GW thinspo and realized that some girls looked way bigger than I even do even now not at my GW while at my GW and some girls looked sooo tiny. I think in addition to just body type/where fat is naturally stored, muscle tone and exercise are also a factor.",False,False
