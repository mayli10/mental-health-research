After years of IBS I found that dry foods after a fast (even just the time between the last meal of the previous day and the first meal of the following) were the only thing that would almost guarantee me a good day.  High moisture carbs like rice, potatoes, really spongy breads, etc are bad in the morning, for me at least. I need like an english muffin or dry trail mix or dehydrated fruit pieces.",False,False

For weeks at a time. From this I would have the worse diarrhea. Like go through a whole roll of toilet paper in a day bad. Breaking fasts with fiber is just really hard on your digestive system. I eat less fiber now because of it but if I donâ€™t eat enough of it I get hella constipated. Break fasts with carbs/proteins. If anyone has anymore questions let me know,False,False
