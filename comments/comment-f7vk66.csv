I could eat 3500 calories in 5-10 minutes. It would take nearly 6 or 7 hours of vigorous exercise - I mean full commitment exercise - to lose that same amount. And even that would be EXTREMELY hard on the body even if I could mentally manage it.  It's completely possible for him/her to truly gain a savage amount of weight ridiculously quickly. Ask binge eaters. We'll throw down 8,000 calories over a course of a day. That's more than 2 lbs in a single day, not to mention the water weight.",False,False
