I think i would just let her do that.  If she doesn't get results and asks for advice later, my go-to is to encourage people to eat lots of vegetables and drink lots of water. I think that's the best safe advice to give- it's positive instead of negative (""eat this"" instead of ""don't eat this"") and if someone takes that advice seriously then they will almost certainly consume slightly less calories in a day.",False,False

It doesn't sound dangerous (or nice to drink), but the fact that she genuinely thinks it will work concerns me. She doesn't overeat, she's active. It's just that she is maintaining slightly above average that she doesn't like. I think she looks fine. ",False,True

If it's like a diet tea or something, you can just tell her it's only a laxative and is going to make her shit a lot. If it's like that lemon water and cayenne stuff or whatever... well... that's just bogus lol.",False,False

Hopefully she'll just feel discouraged and move on with her life. Once you learn about CICO there's no erasing that knowledge from your mind,False,False

No magic drink or pill is going to it. She needs to eat less &amp; move more.   You donâ€™t have to tell her how you did it, just give her accurate information on weight loss and maybe some sources if you can find any ",False,False
