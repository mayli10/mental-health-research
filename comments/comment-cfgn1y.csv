It drives me insane how much food they let rot. I'm just as bad when I swerve back to restriction but AHHJJJHHH,False,False

However I have found that living away from home (but with a roommate) makes it easier to restrict.

On one hand it's super liberating and empowering. I can do whatever I want (includes not showering for the whole weekend if all I want to do is stay in bed) but also I no longer have fixed eating times. That leaves a lot of space for """"snacks"""" (that turn into massive binges) where my past behaviour was more on the restricting side.  I no longer b/p and I'm really really fighting the urge. Basically I've put on 25kg in the last 2 years and it's rough. As long as I don't have a healthy relationship with food I'll be unable to act like a normal person whether I'm alone or living with people.  It's like I wake up every Sunday night with ""this week I'll be better, no extreme restriction during the day to end with an 11pm binge"" and fail miserably. Oops.",False,False

Mom was really into healthy food and living in more rural area meant that food stores where far away and you always had to take a bike or walk. We werenâ€™t at the same time home so no one watched what I ate and when I ate.  Now living in the middle of the capital city means shit ton of restaurants and big ass markets which are open 24/7. So when I donâ€™t have money which is most of the time it means losing weight rapidly. When I have money I gain few kilos. Thereâ€™s really no in between for me.
