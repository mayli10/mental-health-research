Fucking oil. That shit is just liquid calories. It doesn't even taste good. It is satan incarnate. Butter and coconut oil too. Whenever my mum's cooking and I see her just fucking drizzle oil allllll over the pan i die a little inside. Also fried food. So good but so so bad.  This one specific product from this bakery I work at - it's some kind of custard scroll with almonds on top and it's 600+ cals for a single thing about 10cm in diameter. Once again, so damn good but i want it to burn in hell.  Indian curries and nachos. I love them but they're at least like 600 without any extras.  Caramel and anything containing it  Meat pies &amp; sausage rolls. They're 400+ for one and even the mini party pies are 100  McDonald's fries - I CAN'T eat just a few, it'll always be the whole thing.  Pasta &amp; rice. Not a vibe.  (By the way, don't think I wouldn't eat all this shit. I have less self-control than a 2-year-old)",False,False
