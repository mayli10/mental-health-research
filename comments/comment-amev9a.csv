The good news is that if you keep eating the way you are now you probably won't lose more weight (assuming you did all the math and actually are eating at maintenance). If you're not sure if you're eating enough I would suggest checking out [this website](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/bwp). It tells you how much you need to eat to gain weight, how much you need to eat to maintain your weight, and how much you need to eat to lose weight. Of course, it does have the same problem that all online tools like this have where they ask you estimate calorie expenditure using options like sedentary, lightly active, active, etc, so these number may not be 100% accurate, and of course every body is different so even if you had the exact proper numbers for the calculations it could still be wrong, but it will give you a good baseline for figuring out how much you need to eat every day to stop losing weight.",False,False

What's something you can snack on without thinking about it? I've had success putting on some lbs with relatively little effort by eating some high-ish cal snacks when I'm working or watching tv.

I'm also 5'8"" and trying to recover from ana, but I start to gag if I eat a full meal, always find excuses to skip meals, etc, and end up floating between 105 and 110 if I don't fight it.  One thing that I've found helpful are meal replacement drinks. I like the chocolate flavor ""Boost"" one.
