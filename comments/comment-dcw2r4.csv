It even says ""Although the content analyzed only represents a small portion of the total dialogue from this subreddit, the themed discussion threads are the same every week and it appears that subscribers to this site follow the instructions of what the moderator wants within their posts. Therefore, we believe that an examination of one month‚Äôs worth of data is likely an accurate snapshot of the activity within these threads. Still, our results may not be reflective of the subreddit as a whole. For example, very few comments in our sample were seeking advice/support from other members of the subreddit and this may have been observed more in posts outside of the daily themed moderator-generated threads. A thorough [thematic analysis](https://www-sciencedirect-com.flagship.luc.edu/topics/psychology/thematic-analysis) guided by [Braun and Clarke (2006)](https://www-sciencedirect-com.flagship.luc.edu/science/article/pii/S1740144517302528#bib0030) of all types of posts on this subreddit, including those outside of the daily themed threads, would have provided a greater understanding of the exchanges on this subreddit.""   2) "" Although the subreddit under study explicitly acknowledges that EDs are a ‚Äúserious mental illness‚Äù and are ‚Äúnot a lifestyle choice,‚Äù the themed discussion threads seem to champion the latter. Indeed, the moderator provides weekly opportunities for members of the subreddit to share their successes and/or progress toward maintaining disordered eating goals/behaviors. Of additional concern, no recovery-oriented comments‚Äîor even suggestions to seek medical help‚Äîwere identified, likely because the moderators expressly ban this type of content. We observed that moderators posted topics for each day of the week that kept dialogue of this subreddit consistently structured around pro-ED attitudes and behaviors. Encouraging pro-ED online dialogue and thwarting potentially helpful conversations about recovery are worrisome traits of this online community that have the potential to be creating an ‚Äúecho chamber‚Äù where members are exposed to only the encouragement of ED-related psychopathology "" excuse me??? proED was SUCH a supportive place that absolutely didn't ban recovery-oriented comments?? Am I missing something?  3)  ""In this study, we conduct a content analysis of a relatively large subreddit (&gt;5000 subscribers) that describes itself as an online community for *‚Äúpeople who engage in disordered eating behaviors but are not interested in working toward recovery.‚Äù*  "" Again, am I missing something? I didn't think that was the tagline of proED, I thought it was something like 'for people who are in recovery, working towards recovery, and not interested in working toward recovery'  &amp;#x200B;  I'm so mad. I work in research and this is bad practice that has the potential to harm people.",False,False
