Grew up overweight and then into obese. Now the dream is being so small I literally can't find anything in Womens' sizes.... which I have achieved. Lol. Guess that just means more thrift shopping for old clothes! But in a way it also sucks because now I can't buy any of the cute womens' clothes that I see in like, Kohls or anything, because they are just way too big.",False,False

They're my ultimate goal clothes, more than any clothes I purposely buy because they're too small.  A lot of them *do* fit me, but that's not even satisfying because I was an obese child and now I'm just a fat adult that stopped getting taller as a tween.",False,False
