I ended up not bc I didn't have enough time (I'm late for my second job as it is) and I didn't have time to redo my makeup afterwards so yay for time constraints ig  Anyways, I feel like it's mostly because she's hated me for like the entire year that's she's worked there but I've worked there longer than her and am a v trusted employee (have manager permissions w/o being a manager) and she doesn't like it",False,True

I'm so sorry friend, stay strong :(((   honestly just like you said, a lot of the shit people say (especially about food and bodies lmao) reflect a lot more about themselves and their own insecurities than you -- or even how they perceive you. herself probably being immersed in diet culture, she wanted a way to express her bitterness... and that was just the first thing that came to mind.   the food that you got sounds lovely and delicious and I'm so glad to hear that you're trying to eat enough today!! I'm probably not a normie lol but it seems normal to me in the sense that it sounds like what I would eat for breakfast lol. besides, you deserve to eat what you want regardless what other people think; it's your body after all and I think that every body has its own path.   stay strongggg",False,False
