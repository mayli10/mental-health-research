I've recognized my disordered thoughts as being exactly that, and they're much easier to think through when you tell your ed brain to shut the fuck up while I enjoy some taco bell. I still worry about calories, and sugars, but it's easy to ignore now. I try to keep healthy, although these past few days have been a sugar-fest (it's my birthday today!), but generally I try to avoid sugar altogether. I don't think this is disordered since eating healthy in the United States usually means you're also eating a lot of sugar, so avoiding candy and sodas should be normal. So I guess, make your own reality. Nobody eats normally, they're either feeding into some bullshit diet craze or going along with the rest of society and eating like shit. Make up your own rules, your own version of healthy. We know so much about dieting properly and food, we know what to do to be healthy, we just don't want to because that's way harder than sitting back and watching the pounds slip away. Starving and over-exercising seems like hard work when you're going through the motions, but it's seriously much harder to be healthy and treat yourself right than it is to hurt yourself the way we do. Don't underestimate what it takes to recover, it's not simple at all. I've ""recovered"" on and off for about a month now. I eat okay, and then something bad happens (or I perceive it to be a bad thing, even if it isn't, as an excuse to starve myself). It's easy to get caught up in your own bullshit, ""oh woe is me"" type of stuff, and it probably seems harsh to point it out. This is one thing I learned trying to recover, is that your brain will find any way to slip back. It feels good to starve, to construct a false reality where you're the victim and everyone else is the villain, it's cozy and sweet. Reality, on the other hand, is a cruel and merciless bitch. Deciding to step-up and try your hardest not to feed into disordered thoughts is hard as fuck, because it means deciding to live in this fucked up world as a functioning person. Don't underestimate yourself, you obviously deserve to live and thrive, but your illness will take anything to twist it into a reason why you don't. Try to extinguish that, whatever that would mean for you.",False,False
