It also depends on your weight / overall health.  You can feel fine now and get worse pretty quickly later in the day. So please go tell someone and see a doctor right away!! stay safe ðŸ’•,False,False

I would just watch out for signs. Especially if you throw up and then keep throwing up with nothing in your stomach and even just bile irritates your tummy cause that is what happened to me. I hope everything is going to be ok &lt;3,False,False

That amount is a lot but isnâ€™t necessarily super scary for a 24 hour period BUT it was ingested all at once, and there is always variability in how bodies react. Like, itâ€™s maybe fine - but nobody here can tell you for sure.   The safest thing is always to tell your parent and/or call poison control and get their input. Iâ€™d think theyâ€™ll probably recommend going to the ER for assessment/treatment (blood tests, activated charcoal and the like). Thereâ€™s sometimes a psych assessment if theyâ€™re worried about your safety going forward. That can be scary and overwhelming I know.   I know talking to your mom probably isnâ€™t what you want to do. But maybe it could be a good outcome? You donâ€™t have to live in so much pain that taking handfuls of pills feels like a good option. &lt;3    (Iâ€™ve been there and it escalated and escalated until multiple ICU visits happened - and Iâ€™m so glad I got help and thatâ€™s not my reality today.)",False,False

I did something similar a long time ago and I threw up so much then was throwing up blood. I had to eat charcoal and had a bleeding ulcer.,False,False
