What a bad sub. I saw like three original jokes, but the rest are ""I smelled this, how many calories??????""  r/xisplenty has a lot of good looking food!

Sticking to a 1200/day diet sucks for most people, so I think it's more of a venting about their diet sub?  Some are funny, some are not.  &gt;Does overthinking my meal planning count as mental gymnastics, and if so, how do I log that?   I thought that was pretty good and seems self deprecating rather than insulting others.  Was just scrolling through and there's a meta post discussion on where people are coming from (posted three days ago).",False,False
