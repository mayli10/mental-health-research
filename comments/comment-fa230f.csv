Actually being nauseous is the only time I ever want broth lol. If you don't have a microwave, you can try boullion cubes or broth powder, whatever kind sounds best to you",False,False

It got so bad once I had to ring 111 (UK non-emergency line). The on-call nurse said to see my doctor in the morning but when I went, all they said was to make sure I'm keeping hydrated. ðŸ™„ There's nothing more nerve-wracking than feeling like you've lost control of when you might vomit.  For me, after a while, I was confident that my nausea wouldn't result in actual vomiting so I just kinda sat through those feelings. They went away after about 3 weeks for me. If you can though, could you see your doctor and stress that it's impacting your day? Hopefully you can get a better answer than what I'd got.",False,False
