It doesnâ€™t mean saying that what happened was ok. It doesnâ€™t have to mean you have magically neutralized all painful emotions surrounding the experience.

I guess it reminds me that I want to keep my energy in the now, in the moments where good things can be done...instead of spending so much of my energy fighting the past.",False,False
