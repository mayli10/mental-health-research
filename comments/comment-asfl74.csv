If she has a have your meal for lunch, she‚Äôll have something later for dinner. Her hunger cues on point. I remember being amazed at IKEA would she ordered a plate that had 1000 cal, and she immediately cut it in half. Then, she got full of half of that half plus vegetables, because you pack the rest away to eat for later. It‚Äôs astonishing.  She eats a lot of healthy foods and doesn‚Äôt really eat junk food except at parties. If she gains a bit of weight she‚Äôs able to notice and then just gradually adjust her even have it for a few weeks and somehow cuts off a few calories a day without too much thought.  Unfortunately I don‚Äôt know how to emulate it. ",False,False

He typically eats oatmeal and peanut butter toast for breakfast every morning and then packs lunch consisting of a sandwich, an apple, 2 string cheeses and a variety of chips. When he comes home from work he will eat some cookies and a banana. For dinner he usually makes veggie stirfry or something. He loves to cook.  He is 6'2"" and his weight does fluctuate from 150-160 depending on the time of year, whether we visit family, etc.   In social situations, he eats until he his full and then he is done. He never really comments on the quantity of food he eats or says ""i'm hungry"" or ""i'm full."" He literally just eats or he doesn't. It never crosses his mind to talk about food unless we are literally in the middle of cooking. I don't really feel like he ever thinks about it. I am so jealous of him.",False,False

For reference he‚Äôs a 6‚Äô2 weight lifter so he‚Äôs really muscular, but he‚Äôs not so thin that he‚Äôs ABSOLUTELY shredded (he kinda has a Daniel Craig body if that helps)  Anyway.  So he normally eats 2 large meals/day and snacks. He drinks water throughout the day and chocolate milk with his dinner. He only really has alcohol when he‚Äôs out with friends or at a restaurant.  His lunch is usually consists of 2 fried eggs with a little olive oil and a slice of Canadian bacon in between a bagel.  At work he usually brings a granola bar and/or peanut butter crackers to snack on.  For dinner he has whatever his mom makes. Usually a meat, a carb, and some veggies.   Before he works out he has a protein shake.  At night he usually has a snack like some candy, Italian ice, or ice cream.  ",False,False
