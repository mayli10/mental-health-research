Like I have been desperate to binge and got the stuff and then threw most of it out, after nibbling on it and it being completely without taste or texture. Like it's nothing in my mouth. And then I tried again and still nothing. I think I've reached a point - and this sounds completely nuts - where I'm *too depressed* to binge. What a concept. I'm doing a 100 hour fast instead, like a big fucking idiot.",False,False

Lack of pleasure is also a symptom of depression which I get sometimes but usually I don’t hate the taste of food. But I can’t enjoy any types of sweets people give to me that I didn’t plan for and I have no desire to eat them anymore.",False,False
