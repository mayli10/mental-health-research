And I’ve actually gotten like an official scan of my body that breaks down the amount of fat you have to muscle and bone and water and stuff.   And even w a medical professional telling me that I’m “underfat” and “severely underweight” I’m like ... obviously y’all lying and your machine is broke and even if it’s true it just doesn’t look good on me and my body has just situated the fat I have in the worst places so I look like a slug  So Idk ): I think EDs make it impossible to see yourself for how you really are ,False,False
