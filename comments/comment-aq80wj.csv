I am missing so much school because some days my brain is too foggy. I am dropping my grades because I can't focus, even on the subjects I love. Before you know it this isnt about numbers anymore but about your life and your overall success. What will your weight be worth if every other aspect of your life is going to be controlled by it? This feeling of control and being able to eat those calories feels so good I was there, exactly like that. 1200 calories. Now I want to gag at the thought of 800 calories. Your mind isnt going to stop as much as you feel you have control over it. That's why it's a mental disorder. You know yourself this isn't healthy but there is a whole other ""person"" ruining your life to keep your numbers perfect. If you need to talk I'm here because I feel like I am looking at a reflection of my early ed-self. Take care of yourself honey, much love.",False,False

It took some effort to eat until I wasn't hungry anymore, especially knowing I would end up with over 1200 calories for today. in the end 1300 or 1400 is a good amount of calories and I'm still gonna lose weight with it. But those numbers are so addictive, it's crazy. ",False,True

An unfortunate feature of EDs is that you will seek out self-triggering content. This is one of those places. Yes, it is also supportive and good for harm-reduction yadda yadda, but ONLY in people who are 100% resigned to having this disorder long-term. Frankly, most of us are just waiting for it to kill us. You do not want to be in a community of one-uppers who are sicker than you, it will only push you further into disordered eating.   [What Mia Did Next](https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCTvnKA-Oef-wruoTQ3SsLFA) on youtube is someone who I can relate to, but who is fully recovered and takes no shit. I recommend watching her videos on recovery. She's not preachy or out-of-touch like most recovery-centric people are.   There's a point in the development of an eating disorder where you have a choice to succumb to sickness, or to try and fight it. If you make the choice to continue after that point, you WILL need professional help to claw your way out (even with help, a lot of people never recover and eventually die of organ failure). Take it from me, who relapsed two years ago and signed up for therapy again TODAY because I have done all that I can to save myself, and it still isn't enough.   You're most likely still at the point where you can unfuck your life, like when you turn around you can still make out the path you took to get there and you could probably retrace your steps back to sanity. Take that opportunity, it will not be an option for much longer. I thought, probably last year, ""I wanna see how far this rabbit hole goes."" I had a morbid curiosity. But turns out, there is no limit to how far I can fall. I just can't see where I fell from anymore. And not even in a ""this is really deep and interesting"" kind of way, but in a ""I feel bleak and empty and terminally bored while actively dying"" kind of way. You know? Get out, get help, you do not have all the time in the world, you are not the exception, you need to protect yourself while you still can.   *steps down from soapbox* ",False,False

I love the hell out of my mom, but I'm too scared to be in a room alone with her because she found out about my eating disorder. Staying with my family has become stressful and triggers suicidal ideation. I've lost most of my friends because I'm too tired to leave the house, and all of their social outings involve food, and I'm scared. Get out before you lose everything, and remember, calorie counting is supposed to have a MINIMUM of 1200 calories a day, and the recommendation is to have a window, not a strict limit. Aim for 1200-1400 or more per day  ",False,False

I am now borderline 49 kg. Honey. you don't need to restrict your calories. Eat your maintenance atleast, work out, and eat to make up for that. Getting muscle will give you the body shape you want. I still feel fat and that could be my body dysmorphia. Get out while you can like the other poster said.

I'd say you're in the former; get out while you can. Everyone here can promise you, you'll regret it if you don't because once you are fully in the clutches of an ED, getting out is no longer so simple. You can look good, be fit and healthy, and even thin, without an ED; you don't need this. And I bet over 90% of the users here would push the magic button of instant recovery if it existed; no one really wants this..this is just pain.",False,False
