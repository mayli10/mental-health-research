I gained weight when I was in treatment and everyone else (my treatment team) thought it was fine but my BMI when I went in to treatment was like 25. So gaining on top of that really threw me for a loop and I relapsed immediately if I even got out of my disorder in the first place although I think there was like a few days to a week where I really thought I could leave this behind but that was before I weighed myself and saw I had gained 8 pounds. I never ate at maintenance consistently (maybe before I turned 12 but after that my weight was always on an upward trend because of overeating/binging because that is when my depression started) or maintained a healthy BMI even before I became bulimic so yeah not really sure what the hell im supposed to do to be “normal” and happy with my body at the same time. I don’t want to discourage anyone from treatment because being bulimic is no way to live and I’m reattempting treatment with a different psych and therapist because I really want to be normal but it’s very frustrating because I feel like they focus too much on stopping the purging part without caring about the binging,False,False

Lots of people with EDs think we must always be either gaining or losing weight. Guess what. The majority of people stay the same weight and eat at maintenance every day. That will happen to you too. The first couple weeks you might gain or lose because there can be lots of fluid shifts after you stop purging. Within a few months if you abstain from binging/purging/restriction and follow your meal plan, everything should settle down and you'll stay at whatever your ""normal"" weight is. ",False,False

Its both a possibility and doable. Whoever if youre underweight you could gain to be at a normal bmk and then maintain. You won't gain weight for eating normally :) maybe you will gain weight st the start but it usually goes away. Besides q part of recovery is to stop being so obsessed with weight gain ",False,False
