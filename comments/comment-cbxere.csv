HOWEVER, I’ve found that it helps to remember WHY I had this nagging thought. Why was I judging this person drinking a sugary drink freely? Because a part of me is jealous that they can do so without caring. Even publicly!  EDs really, really suck - but I personally think it’s important to look at it in a psychological standpoint, to identify your mental traps. Do you actually hate these people? No, I doubt it. Don’t let your ED turn you into an outwardly judgmental and hateful person.",False,False
