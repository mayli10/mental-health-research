I got supplement pills of the stuff (you can find it online or in any supplement/health store) for 600mg hydrochloric acid and pepsin and I take one when my stomach is in a lot of pain! It helps digest the food and takes away the bloat. Bloating is honestly not a normal part of digestion, at least not how it was happening to me. Like my stomach was embarassingly distended. So personally I don't buy the whole ""it's normal"" stuff. Check with your doctor but it might be something similar to what I have! Hope this helps &lt;3",False,False

Sure, EDs can screw up your digestion in all kinds of ways and make it worse, food intolerances can cause more bloating than is normal, etc. but when it comes to simply experiencing some abdominal distention and fullness after eating, there's nothing patholocal about that, it's just a part of being human (though, granted, a not-talked-about, less attractive, something you don't see on Instagram type of being human).

Maybe you're extra sensitive to gluten/dairy? I bloat like mad after dairy. When I was at my LW I used to think I was bloated after every meal, but it was just the feeling of a full tummy? Freaked me out.",False,False
