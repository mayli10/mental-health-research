I always heard it through someone else or through some situation where they have to tell it to get what they need. I lost around 30 pounds and for no one to be concerned is unbelievable but I get where they're coming from. It's dangerous to assume everyone's inaction comes from the same place.,False,False

And this can definitely a mindfuck for people who aren't accustomed to this behavior from the general public. Or to the dropoff in comments from friends/family after your initial plunge in weight. Despite being very used to it, I admit it frustrates me sometimes.   Like, I've been underweight so long that the people around me think it's just my ""normal,"" which irritates me (and, on a practical level, disturbs me...people shouldn't think this is normal, and I live in fear that others will imitate me bc they think I'm stable and fine).  Sometimes I get urges to drop down to some drastic size, even though I don't truly want to, because then maybe a friend or family member would finally say something for the first time in years.",False,False

It's hard looking at it even from the inside to say what course of action is best. On the one hand, I feel almost ""ignored"" when it isn't brought up by friends/family, but on the other hand, I don't want it brought up, either? Like... I currently have no plans of changing my behavior and it makes me feel exposed/overanalyzed when someone does bring it up.   It's such delicate situation, tbh. I don't think you should feel guilty; there's really no ""right"" way to go about it.",False,True

I didn't see her regularly after our second year rooming together and I don't think I would have commented during her decline anyway considering I wouldn't want her to think people overanalyze her body (she definitely wore loose clothes, half out of modesty I suppose, until she got to her lowest and started wearing crop tops and shorts). But when I saw her at that point and still acting normal and fairly energetic instead of lifeless and frail, I just didn't know what to say. Going ""I'm concerned about how thin you've become"" seemed presumptuous for some reason, and it's not like she didn't know how thin she was (until I knew about BDD). I definitely didn't want to encourage her by somehow ""admiring"" her thinness, though at the same time I understood the possibility of wanting any validation that she was being seen. So I just treated her like we were the same friends we'd always been, unsure if I was doing more damage by seemingly ""ignoring"" the change or if I should have risked overstepping boundaries and reached out.  A lot of people will notice but just have no idea how to bring it up. It does seem taboo to comment on someone else's sickness. Only the oblivious or perhaps shameless will ask ""this might be rude to ask, but do you have cancer?"" or something like that. Maybe I should have openly cared more. I still think about her although it's been years and wonder what state of mind she must have been in to get that bad, and whether her boyfriend (who I was always bickering with, so I didn't ask him) ever approached the topic",False,False
