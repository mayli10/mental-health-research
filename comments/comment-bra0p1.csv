I need to snap out of it and take care of myself but I feel like I just can’t or don’t even want to a lot of the time. I know it’s me doing this to myself so I just feel invalid.,False,False

We all know what we are doing isn't good because we hide it from others. I know purging, cutting, felling sick &amp; anxious all the time, lack of sleep or oversleeping and so on aren't good things, doesn't mean you don't suffer from it.",False,False

It doesnt mean there is none. I feel like knowing that you have a problem and not changing it actually undermines how serious it is.,False,False
