I was making sure that everything I had needed to be prepared.   Now Iâ€™m not doing OMAD but Iâ€™ve also been sticking to this. Sometimes Iâ€™ll go to binge on nuts or seeds and stop myself because itâ€™s wicked fricken scary to eat the uncounted calories after being a Cronometer nut for a while now.  Edit: also the time thing that the above commenter mentioned is very true. Often times Iâ€™d want to eat more but since my meals are so labor intensive I wouldnâ€™t have time to make more.,False,False

I literally thought about this daily. Which is really weird for a 16 year old girl to do, but then again, is anyone really surprised I developed an ED? ðŸ¤·",False,False

Or after only 5 pounds youâ€™re already skinnier and prettier! Every single lbs counts. Itâ€™s not like you get the big price only after your reach your goal. Know what I mean?

Buying foods that need preparation only help a lot (ex: raw eggs, low cal pasta, raw meat, plain vegetables, etc.) Not having readily available pre packaged food does wonders because you have to predetermine how big of a portion you're going to eat before you cook it. There's no going back for immediate extras if you need to spend another 20-45 minutes making it.  It's a lot healthier, and you can decide what goes in it. It's also pretty damn fun to learn how to cook.",False,False

I was stuck in the cycle for like half a decade or more.  Well, I did it. Unintentionally almost, but I did; I lost over 50 pounds. I'm still quite always from my GW because it keeps getting lower and lower, but rationally, I know it's getting lower and lower underweight. It's different than when I was back there where you are.  I'm glad I did it. It didn't happen until I recovered treatment and meds for my BED though. I'm just saying that it's possible. Like, I know we're different people, but if I could even do it, you have a high chance of you being able to do it too.  I remember how hard it was during all those years of being clinically overweight/clinically borderline obese though, and I have a lot of empathy for how hard it is, especially for people with ED's.

Be gentle with yourself though bc we all know that 500 cals is not sustainable. I was the biggest I had ever been at Christmas time then I did OMAD for 4.5 months and lost 50 pounds. Now I hate myself a lot less. I was doing between 900-1400 calories a day. I have been binge free in 2019 so far and I can chalk it up to not destroying myself with low restriction everyday bc tbh attempting low restriction is what made me a binge monster which is why I blew up to my HW in the first place.   Be well and be kind to yourself in anyway possible even if itâ€™s not food related.,False,False

Went from restricting to BED, gained 50 kg and probably still counting. For years I've tried really hard to overcome my emotional dependancy on food until I just almost gave up, cut everyone away and became a shut in.  I am utterly disgusted by the cold mass of fat and deep stretch marks my body is covered in. At this point I probably have diabetes or something, I don't know. I'm too exhausted.
