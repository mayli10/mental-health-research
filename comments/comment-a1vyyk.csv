I do have to say you are surrounded by people that love and care about you and only want to see you live your best healthy life. But I think they should have talked to you first. Definitely see where they're coming from and they are coming from a place of concern. You're also 25 now so your mom can't force you to go to treatment. Is she saving the money so that if you decide to go to treatment, it's there just in case?",False,False

It always feels shitty when parents find out about a relapse. I hope you feel better about it soon /:",False,False

I mean if I was in that situation and thought/knew my friend had a healthy relationship with their parents I would inform them out of fear and guilt. Which is a fucked up thing for me to admit.    But it is unpleasant they couldn't just talk to you about it first :/,False,False

On the other hand, your mom trying to force you to go back into treatment doesn't seem like it will change too much. Also, you're 25 so I don't think she can force you to do anything tbh.",False,False
