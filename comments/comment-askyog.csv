It was basically the first time I would be directly interacting with them (and all of the other higher ups/etc.) and was extremely nervous.  I made it through the night and finally after everyone has left, I started cleaning the bar and doing the inventory for the following day.  Took a second to check my email and saw that my fiancé (of ~6 years) (literally planning our wedding and wearing the mother f*ing ring on my finger) had sent me an email basically detailing that we were over.   When I got home from work he had spent the time I spent at work, also working hard, but at cleaning out everything aside from my clothes, bed and dog from our apartment.   I seriously lost my shit.  I have never ever in my life been so depressed.   I later found out that not only was he using drugs and drinking behind my back (I am sober and he was supposed to be as well), he was also cheating on me with someone from his work.   I'd love to give you some hopeful ending, but I can't.  I'm definitely over him, but I haven't been able to date or trust anyone since then and that has been about 5 years ago.",False,False

I’ve been with my boyfriend for over five years and I’ve been unhappy for the last year but like… deeeeeeply unhappy these last six months. He and I didn’t really have a lot in common and that wasn’t necessarily a bad thing, but it’s gotten worse. We used to spend our days together at home eating pizza and playing video games and I gained like thirty pounds after he and I started dating. So needless to say, now that I’m back to my skinny self after my “new year new me” diet last year, that doesn’t fly anymore. We’ve had a lot of problems in the last year but it’s like the one thing that was keeping us together is gone now? I hardly eat anymore, and I prefer to go out and drink with friends. He doesn’t drink and would rather just be home sitting around. Even when I try to get him to go for walks or come hang out for a while with our friends, he just complains and sulks the entire time. It’s so stressful and I can’t do it anymore. He and I got together so young and I didn’t have a lot of experience dating or with relationships before him. It kind of freaks me out and sometimes I wonder if the things we fight about are normal and whatever. I broke down crying last weekend and moved out after four years of living together because I need some space to figure out what I want to do. I think I decided I want to fully break-up and start seeing other people at some point. I’m afraid I’ll regret both staying with him and not staying with him so it’s really weird right now. He’s extremely upset and calls me all the time because he misses me and it’s all just very hard. I’ve been stuck in this very bad binge and restrict cycle for the last few weeks because of this mess of emotions and I just want to go back to my “normal” disordered eating habits. ",False,False

egvizyc,t3_askyog,t3_askyog,Annaniks,1,2019-02-20 07:30:23,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/askyog/break_up_diet/egvizyc/,"My ex broke up with me via text the morning after seeing me at his football game where he told me he loved me and he wanted to go out after he got off work the next day. Our paths crossed months later and we went through this horrible back and forth of him telling me I was the one for him, then that he didnt want to be with me over and over and over until finally he settled on that he did want to be with me, and I was going to visit him, (live in Canada he lives in the capital I live near Toronto) after just flying in from the west coast the night before, I caught a bus to him and within an hour of me getting there he told me he was in love with someone else. When I was flying for China a week later he wrote me to say that if I ever told the other girl anything he'd come for my throat. After that he kept checking in on me every few days trying to be friends, but when he messaged me saying he missed having someone love him and that he missed sex in his life I knew he felt no remorse and cut him out of my life. It was hard, Its hard to imagine I'll find anyone I love the way I loved him but I know it's just a matter of time, and I just distract myself by focusing on what I'm eating, and working on moving back to the capital since that's where I go to school, you'll get through this love, it'll feel like you're dying at first, but little by little itll get better xx",False,False
egv7c8o,t3_askyog,t3_askyog,sadveggiehead,1,2019-02-20 02:49:09,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/askyog/break_up_diet/egv7c8o/,"My ex and I were together for almost 3 years, came to college together, for these years we spent basically every single second together, same job and everything. When he ended it I lost a significant amount of weight, ironic because he always weighed less than me but in about two months a weighed less than him. I couldn’t eat at all because almost all of my meals were with him on a daily basis. Eating alone made me feel pathetic but not only that I just wasn’t hungry. The thought of food was sickening. It’s still hard, but lately I’ve been binging and I miss that sad sick feeling. It does get better though, I promise you that. When the breakup happened I thought that I’d never get better, that I would feel so horrible forever and that I was the only person who felt this type of pain and passion. It’s been 4 months and I feel so beyond comfortable being on my own. Every time I do anything from laundry, to homework I know it’s all me doing it, on my own. It makes me feel better knowing I’m independent and taking care of myself. ",False,False
egv39rb,t3_askyog,t3_askyog,obama_means_family,1,2019-02-20 01:04:17,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/askyog/break_up_diet/egv39rb/,"My boyfriend and I had been together for two years when we broke up. Prior to that I was really happy, a little over two years clean from cutting and most of my bad behaviors with food. We we're long distance for a while because I was at college and it was getting harder, but I still thought we were in a good place. Little did I know the guys at our church we're trying to get him to break up with me because I was unbaptized (in their eyes) and therefore not a Christian.   Needless to say I was devastated. I never got a real reason (until over a year later) and it completely broke my heart. The final nail was hammered in on our two year anniversary, and the day I got home from college for the summer, after having begged and argued with my dad to get me home that day for our anniversary.  When things started going south I wound up starting to cut again, which continued until March of last year (hopefully I won't relapse again but you never know). I started trying to lose weight and get that revenge body too. I spent most of the summer working, drinking, smoking (that good shit), a couple harder things, and basically trying to get over him. It was made way worse because he kept saying things like ""just bc we're broken up now doesn't mean we always have to be,"" and paying for my food, and giving me rides, and doing things we didn't start doing until we were a couple (we'd been friends beforehand). I eventually told him that if he didn't want me then, that was it, I wouldn't take him back.  Of course I was a weak bitch and couldn't get over him. I tried for sure, but I wound up overextending myself in school (officer in two clubs, plus other clubs, plus dnd, plus friend group, oh and taking 4 sciences). I spiraled down in my depression while still cutting, drinking, smoking, etc. as a means of self medicating (poorly). I failed multiple classes and dropped out to move back home.   After a couple of months at home I had probably my worst ever panic attack, cut super deep, and eventually had a moment where I decided fuck it, I have to change my life. I stopped cutting, started trying to stop purging (haven't completely stopped, but it's fairly rare now), and started eating a little healthier.   In the summer I started dating someone else, then wound up breaking up with him to go back to my ex. Many people thought I was an idiot, but I love him. He really matured from our time apart, not to mention apologized profusely for the way he broke up with me. He knows he was an idiot and doesn't deserve me lol.   I don't know if reading this will help you at all, but that's my story. If you ever wanna talk, feel free to message me",False,False
