I know both New Farm Clinic in Brisbane and Robina Private Hospital do inpatient for eating disorders. Don't know much about New Farm, but the Robina one apparently is quite intensive.   There's also Byron Bay Clinic, but they aren't covered by private health insurance and would be totally out of pocket. Also a warning, I tried to get in there and they wouldn't take me because my trauma history is very complex and they didn't want to take on the risk. Just thought I'd let you know in case you are similar.",False,False
