I'm trying to get better at getting back into cooking. I read a galaxy brain tip the other day for logging leftovers - you weigh the food you make and put the weight as your servings. e.g. if you end up cooking 700 grams of food then you list it as 700 servings. Then when you dish out portions you weigh your portion, so if you dish out, say, 230g, you are eating 230 portions. I haven't tried it yet but it sounds GENIUS and I'm gonna give it a shot next time I cook!  right there with you on the shittyveganfoodporn train, choochoo...

I heard it was cheaper than buying pre-made seaweed chips, but I personally have never had the chance to try it because I eat it so rarely that it's been years.
