Just randomly burp up random bits of food, sometimes undigested. Went to my gastroenterologist one day telling him about it. He told me something that pissed me off. He literally told me "" I know of it..its psychological most of the time..you are doing it..its all in your head. I was so put off by his comments and felt dismissed. But guess what... since that week of my life I havent done it since. I didnt even try to stop? He told me that and sometime that same week it stopped. It was the craziest thing to happen to me by far.",False,False

I developed it as a coping mechanism trying to stop purging. Have you told a doctor or anyone about it? I’m so ashamed and scared to but I have no clue how to stop,False,False

Back in elementary there were times it was obvious? (Most the time no, but back then there were a few times the food would have a little trouble coming up once partially up? So it would end up with me rolling my shoulders? This kind of problem went away though.)  But I wasn't completely aware of what kind of movements I was making until it was pointed out?   No one understood what I was doing (me either), I think they thought I was in pain and I'd be like ""oh no I'm fine."".    But it's because of those incidences that I became a lot more aware of what I was doing?     My one friend knows about it, but we don't really discuss it. (Not much to say after mentioning it tbh.)  Since it's not as well known as other eating disorders I can see how people who aren't truely listening would see it as purging.     Tbh it reminds me of [this scene from sponge bob](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL63KEVG5yQ). (Minus putting it in your hand before re-eating it.)   I remember me and my friend at the time were watching this, she thought it was disgusting and I was like kind of awkwardly keeping to myself ""I kind of do that in a way....."" xD     Personally beyond my one friend, I don't think I'd tell anyone else I know? I just don't think they could relate and therefore I'd be afraid of making them uncomfortable? Idk.  But yeah you're not alone!",False,False

Honestly I indulge in it a lot. Super gross but like...it tastes like food so why not? For me it happens pretty much anytime I eat a meal, no matter what it is. Sometimes I can control it better than other times but mostly just feel uncomfortable of I don't get the food out.",False,True

It's just something I've kept a secret so long because of how weird I feel it is. I alternate between swallowing it and spitting it out mostly because I'm embarrassed of it and sometimes am not alone to spit it out, and also because I know I wont be taking in much food at all if I spit it all out. Glad to meet someone else with it, it just embarrasses me.",False,True
