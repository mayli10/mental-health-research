It's a really nice perspective to hear bc I guess deep down I still believe my mom was just being honest.  I do know fat and ugly people find love all the time. It's just hard to not beat myself up about still being single while everyone I know my age has had someone for years. I feel defective. My mom is only one of two friends in her group that isnt a grandparent. All her friends kids are at least married but they are all at least a few years older than me.   I'm on a dating app as of just recently and was talking more with two dudes. One asked me for nudes so I blocked him this morning (at least he thinks I'm hot?) And I have a date with the other on Friday. I havent been on a date in 2.5 years (and a real date where he paid and there was real potential of pursuing me in like 10 years).  This guy isnt super good looking but he seems nerdy and nice and like a normal person. I'm going into it with the mindset of a more fun job interview. I have to see not just if he likes me but if I like him. I'm hoping I like him and that we click but at the very minimum I'm going to get to go to a new brewery.   This time I'll only sleep with him if I like him and know him for a little while, at least a month. I'm kinda desperate for sex but I've never slept with anyone who actually cared about me or wanted to date me officially which at 31 makes me feel kinda worthless.",False,False

She went from morbidly obese to just chubby; it must have been a loss of at least 70 lbs and she looked like a completely different person afterwards. The school newspaper even did a story on her ""weight loss journey"" and interviewed her for it; she was very open about the process and not ashamed as far as I knew.  Most days in choir before we started practice our director would ""check in with the group"" and make any announcements he needed to; etc. The day of this incident, he was like ""Wow, did everyone see the amazing story about Becky (not her real name lol) in the newspaper?
