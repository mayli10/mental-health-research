But I guess this is a way to strike up convo about this. Thanks &lt;3,False,True

Cutting has such an eDgY persona. After a (relative) stable teenage (things were still cooking back then, stuff with family etc etc), I want to hurt myself at 23 fucking years. I'm just a late bloomer, eh?",False,True

The biological effect cutting has is very similar to the ones eds give you. It’s not a huge leap for a brain that harms the body it lives in through starving to branch out into cutting.,False,False

They’re not going to think you’re an edgelord. They’re going to think you have a problem and that you’re telling them so you can get help.   Just say it exactly how you did in the title. You don’t have to go into graphic detail like “I wanna stab myself in the eyeball with the fork I used to eat with every time I have mac n cheese”. Just “eating upsets me to the point I think about hurting myself and I’d like to work through that without going to extremes”.   It actually takes a lot for them to get freaky about stuff. Remember that they deal with worse and much more dramatic things. Just do what’s best for you.,False,False

Sending love your way, I hope things get better for us both",False,False
