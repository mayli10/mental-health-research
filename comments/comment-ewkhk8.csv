I usually only eat a small lunch around 100-300 cals at 11, so when I wake up at 7 I usually have been fasting for 20ish hours. Having to leave my bed knowing the wave of vertigo and nausea is gonna hit me is horrible tbh.  I’ve found that it helps for me to just jog a bit on the spot once the vertigo subsides. It might seem counterintuitive but it kinda gets my blood flowing and my system back on and I usually feel fine enough to bike to school afterwards",False,False

It’s almost like some kind of morning sickness.  I have to eat something in the morning bc it can get kind of debilitating for me??  Are you taking BC pills?  Sometimes I think that also contributes to it.   But yeah, you’re not alone in this I’m certain.",False,False
