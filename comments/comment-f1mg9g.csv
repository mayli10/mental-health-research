I have a therapist I just dont want to tell her. Im scared because even tho its bad I lowkey dont wanna stop until I reach my goal weight (and I made all my research my goal weight is PERFECTLY HEALTHY for my body size and height).

But tbh idk what eating normally even actually is because in my mind, 700 calories a day is normal? Is rounding up your meals to the nearest hundred normal? Is lying that you ate while you were out or over-describing how much you actually ate normal? Am I really doing it for attention if no one on my life has any idea what's going on? I keep feeling like maybe this is a phase and I'll go back to normal soon and yet three weeks ago 800 was the arbitrairy limit I set in my mind and we've only gone down since then so when am I going to snap out of it?",False,False

I'm diagnosed but more often than not I'm absolutely sure I'm faking it. Like yeah I'm diagnosed but that's only because I'm so good at lying and faking that I convinced them I have an ED.

I struggled with this a lot literally 2 weeks ago and I‚Äôm luckily feeling less fake right now. It‚Äôs an awful feeling because it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm trying to stick myself in this community of sick people and relate to them but I‚Äôm really just a normal person trying to be quirky. To get rid of these thoughts I just tell myself a bunch of stuff like ‚ÄúNormal people wouldn‚Äôt ____‚Äù or ‚ÄúNormal people wouldn‚Äôt go this far just to fake an illness‚Äù and sometimes it makes these ‚Äúoh I‚Äôm faking it for attention!!!‚Äù thoughts go away temporarily. Also, imposter syndrome is very common with eating disorders so there are many people who can relate to you including people who are diagnosed. I can confidently say that you are not faking it for attention and your struggles are very valid. :)",False,False
