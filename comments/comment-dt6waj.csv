For me, short hair doesn't make me look fat but it does make me look about 3 years younger.   Also fuck them, lol. Short hair is lit and it's worth a go if you're comfortable. Hair does grow back.",False,False

Even if people at work say any different, it might be due to a variety of reasons – they might just have been used to seeing you with longer hair, or they might have beauty standards that simply don’t align with what’s good for you, etc. And either way, most comments might just be casual throwaway ones, and they’d probably forget about it and get used to your new hairstyle in no time. You do you! Good luck.",False,False
