Cats really are the most delightful companions- they always just seem to know what you need. I’m not used to the silence yet, I keep thinking I hear her scratching or snoring, but it isn’t.   I think the thing to remember is that this pain is temporary, and you’re always stronger than you know. I completely believe that you’ll get through this.",False,False

My boy is old too, 13 according to information from the shelter I adopted him from but the vet thinks he's older. I've had him for 8 years. Cats are the best companions.

Hopefully he won’t have to suffer too much. I’m sure you’re taking good care of him. If it’s possible, try to eat at least a little bit. Losing a pet is hard on you as is, but I hope you can take care of yourself as well. If not - I’d be lying if I said I didn’t understand. I’m sorry I don’t have any better advice.
