Also, I know it’s hard to go out and have fun when you’re feeling guilty over this, but doing so may lift your mood or help put off a binge. Whether that be doing something with a friend or just by yourself. You deserve to live your life and be happy!! Good luck tomorrow I believe in you haha",False,False

On Saturdays I go to the library to revise which has been very helpful for me. I don't have many friends as the more I binge the less I feel worthy of friendships so I can't hang out with people. I give myself 2× maintenance days per week on a Friday and a Saturday, but by the time it gets to Saturday I just want to start eating and not have to stop. It just feels like even if I can abstain for a longer period of time than a week, binging is inevitable for me and so I might as well not even try a week   You are truly kind, thanks for replying!",False,True

Are you able to distract yourself in anyway tomorrow to get your mind off of food? Hobbies, going out, going for a walk etc. I have the exact same problem, eating “normally” during the week but when Saturday night hits, I go HAM on all the food I have. You can always message me if you need some sort of support system",False,False
