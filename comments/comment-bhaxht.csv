I use cream and flavors but I would not be able to restrict or exercise like I do without it. Breakfast? Hot coffee. Going into work two days without food but don‚Äôt wanna pass out? Ice coffee.

I do a very similar thing with a sweet soy latte. If I'm still aimlessly hungry and want something sweet and satisfying, bam.

Or kimchi. I've never thought to log sugar-free gum because I don't mentally consider it eating since I don't swallow even tho I know I'm still absorbing calories. I don't log black coffee or tea, even though one of the coffees I drink isn't really coffee and it's like 15cal per cup instead of like 5 and that makes me anxious but I try not to stress about it bc I'd rather drink 15cal of hot water than eat 150cal of boredom food instead. Whether I log energy drinks or not depends on whether I feel like it or remember. I don't log spices unless I'm putting them in a recipe in MFP. I was so bummed when I found out cinnamon had calories lmao...  I think the weirdest one I don't log is Halo Top because it's significantly more calorific than other foods here. Like yeah even if it's ""only"" 300cal a pint or something that's obviously more than a 23cal energy drink or a 2cal pickle. But Halo Top for me is like... is there a word for something that's a ""safe food"" not because it's low calorie but because it stops you from binging on worse stuff? Like a ""dam food""? A ""sandbag food""? Because if I feel like I can eat as much Halo Top as I like without having to log it, then if I want something sweet I'll just eat 100\~ calories of Halo Top instead of binging on real ice cream or chocolate or cookies or carbs etc.   Even if I go ham and binge on an entire pint of Halo Top, I'm probably not going to binge on anything after that, so I'm at most 350cal in the hole, which is always better than being 1000s of calories over. Stressing over food is also likely to cause a binge so if I just go ""ehh, I'll just have Halo Top"", I don't stress, so I binge less.  Sorry for ranting. Maybe that's just what all safe foods are lol.",False,False
