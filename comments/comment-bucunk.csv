It's wild that there's people out here who are so non-obsessed with it they don't even know.",False,False

They just pick up whatever looks good and buy it! I notice this especially at Starbucks when I’m in line. I’m waiting to order my coffee while looking for the lowest calorie sandwich option, or just not eating at all. People must think I’m nuts for picking up stuff and staring at the labels and repeating multiple times. Hahaha well I cant understand how people don’t care or don’t notice that dessert has over 600 calories!!   Ugh and yes you reminded me of the grocery store breakdowns. The bakery section is meant to break our spirits, as well as the snack aisle. Stay strong sisters, binge worthy snacks are lurking.",False,False
