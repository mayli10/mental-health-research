One of them is 4'10 though, so it's no surprise that she has a tiny frame to go with her height. The other one just has an *insane* metabolism. I used to be so jealous of her back when I went to school with her because all she ate was junk food 24/7 and remained around the 40 kilo mark. However, she hated it and all she wanted to do was gain 5-10 kilos.",False,False

People who are “naturally” underweight are underweight because they either consciously restrict their food intake to great extents (eating disorder) or are extremely picky (also an ED — ARFID), have a medical condition that impedes weight gain, have low appetites, are so busy they forget to eat, etc. None of these things are healthy.   If someone is consuming the amount of calories they need and they are engaging in healthy eating behaviors, then they will not be underweight. So, while perhaps not everyone with an underweight BMI has an eating disorder, they are still not consuming enough calories or they have a medical condition that impedes weight gain (gastrointestinal problems, metabolic disorders, etc.). It’s not “natural,” meaning they can’t just eat 3000 calories a day and remain at an underweight BMI (unless they’re exercising excessively).  I would often say I was “naturally skinny” when I was younger, but in reality, I later realized I wasn’t eating as much as I thought I was, and later on, I developed anorexia nervosa (although the people around me would always say things like, “Oh my gosh, you eat so much and don’t gain any weight. You’re naturally skinny,” but they didn’t truly know how much I was actually eating on a daily basis just ‘cause they saw me eat a lot once).",False,False

His diet is full of highly palatable calorie dense foods but he rarely bothers to eat, and when he does eat, he rarely finishes his plate. I spent the full day with him once and logged everything he ate, he skipped breakfast, had Chinese noodles with chips for lunch (left half of the chips) and then eat a half a packet of biscuits for dinner, which totaled at \~1500kcal, below his maintenance  He's now trying to gain weight and he's not having an easy time. He told me that he considers eating to be chore that he has to remember to do throughout the day so he doesn't get tired.  It's weird, I on the other hand can't stop thinking about food as long as I have calories left in my daily budget, even if I'm completely stuffed, my mind just never stops saying ""when am I going to eat next? When am I going to eat next? When am I going to eat next?"" until I've met my budget, then I start thinking about what I'm going to eat tomorrow instead.  He's also a really really picky eater, whereas I can count the number foods I don't enjoy one hand.",False,False

I work with this girl that is very skinny and she has some kind of medical issue..I forget what but she eats fast food every shift and snacks on everything all night and stays small.  She complains that she can’t gain any weight cuz she wants to be more curvy.  I would so trade places with her.  I think other naturally thin people just never have much of an appetite and so eating honestly feels like a chore to them or they forget to eat.  That was me when I was a teenager.  It didn’t last after that lol.,False,False

There are also people who can be even more under their BMI having an undiagnosed metabolic disease, or an alteration in their development.

My boyfriend had a highest BMI of 15.3 when we moved in together.  I've helped him put on a little weight but he's still very underweight.  Honestly it almost made me cry the first time I saw his back naked. Not because I wanted that but because he looked so unhealthy and I wanted to help him. The dude just gets very intense into activities and work and forgets to eat, then is too tired to make food so he goes to sleep...I hate him hahhahaa.   I've honestly questioned if he has a secret ED but anything suspect is just him living his whole life on few calories and that's just what his body is used to. He does say that sometimes he feels anxious after eating a big meal...but I think that is more normal than we realize and purely biochemical and related to blood sugar or something and not from feelings of guilt or shame.  Maybe it's evolutionary...like ancient humans were most vulnerable after eating a big meal, leaving them lethargic and less aware, so the ones who got hyper anxious after eating lived to make more babies :)",False,False

I’ve worked with a couple chicks that totally didn’t have eating disorders (knew them well and spent enough time with them to see signs) and were UW. High high high metabolisms.

It embarrasses the hell out of him and he really wants to gain weight and muscle, but not enough to change his eating habits I guess. He eats a lot of crap when he remembers/ wants to and has things he likes around, and he doesn’t feel guilty about it afterwards, but has just gotten used to not eating enough frequently enough after a lifetime of super picky eating. I really do believe that it’s more about force of habit than ED rationalization for him. I think other disorders or health issues can definitely lead to seriously low weight. Not sure if that would still be considered an ED if unrelated mental or physical illness led to accidental disordered eating?",False,False
