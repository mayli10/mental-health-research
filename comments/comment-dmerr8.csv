Itâ€™s very soft and flabby. I always figured it was a bit of both, but it makes more sense that thereâ€™s a lot of skin there - when i suck in and bend over, there is a LOT of obvious loose skin there.",False,False

Iâ€™m still not certain, but the Internet said if it goes thin and wrinkly, if you pinch it and it does that or if you grab it and pull it and it doesnâ€™t wobble/jiggle like typical fat then it is likely loose skin. Iâ€™m pretty sure I have a mix of both, not entirely sure but hoping to lose a few kg more to be certain. Makes me super paranoid. Hopefully someone with more knowledge than me will comment - Google searches mostly just give you blog posts from 40 yo women with 3 kids or people whoâ€™ve lost, like, 100 kg, so thereâ€™s not much info out there for people like us.",False,False
