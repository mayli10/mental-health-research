And yeah, I have an Ed and my self esteem is pretty low, but that’s my deal. Having someone else do things that make me feel worthless is a whole other kettle of fish.   Thank you for the advice. And I’m so glad you came out the other end! I have hope for me. ",False,True

I was with my ex for 7(!) years. We essentially grew from teenagers to adults together. When we broke up, he had a new girlfriend only weeks later. I was gobsmacked. But in the end, I actually spent more than year discovering my strength, individuality, resilience, and a lot of my sexuality ^^ and I ended up feeling like “the winner”. I didn’t need anybody else to feel happy or confident. I met many people and did a lot of spontaneous silly stuff that I otherwise wouldn’t have done. ",False,False

I held on to hope every day and kept him on my social media and even when he was off my social media I would check his accounts anyway. The only way I moved on was removing him from my life for good. I removed him from everything. My phone, my Spotify account, gaming account and everything else. I have him no where. And this helped me move on quick and got the pain out too. I cried for the first week, yes. But after that week I pulled myself together and never looked back. I might have an ED. I might feel worthless, I might hate myself 6/7 days a week but I will not let someone other than myself make me feel not good enough. You will get through this. You may not feel like you will but trust me. It might take months. It took me nine months to be done but damnit I made it and I'm thankful that I did. Out of sight out of mind. Believe that.

I figure he just cared so little about me to begin with so he’s able to just go about his life like I never existed. But what you say makes sense.  I appreciate you taking the time to reply, thank you for your kind words. ",False,True

Some people need someone else to get over their previous relationship. I wouldn’t be surprised if the new person is there for an emotional rebound - someone for your ex to base some self esteem of.  Take care of yourself now. It’s tempting to slip into unhealthy coping mechanisms, but you need your strengths now.",False,False

And it hurts like hell, and will hurt like hell for some time.   It will eventually get better, but in the meantime maybe pick up a hobby he has no connection to at all?  It can feel like every memory and habit you have is ""polluted"" by his memory, but it can help to make some changes to your daily routine! It's less of a chance to be triggered by a memory of you together, and is a great time to jump on some self improvement. It's scientifically proven that the best time to change a bad habit or make a new one is when there's a new change in your life you're still getting used to.   Try and look at it like a springboard for change, even if your heart is in knots. I wish you the best!",False,False
