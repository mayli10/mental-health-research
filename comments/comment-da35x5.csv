My mother was obese and constantly obsessed with ‚Äúdiets‚Äù. She‚Äôd make me do them with her even when I was a normal weight. Sometimes she‚Äôd force me to eat a ton of very high calorie high fat foods and other times I wouldn‚Äôt be allowed to eat. Or I‚Äôd only be allowed diet shakes or whatever else she was on at the time. So I started secretly buying food from a vending machine and eating it in private which usually meant horking it down as fast as possible so I wouldn‚Äôt get caught.   My dad really didn‚Äôt mean any harm but he‚Äôs very... well, he doesn‚Äôt understand human emotions. He‚Äôd try to be funny and make pig sounds if he saw me in the kitchen.   I got kicked out of the house for a bit and had to live with relatives. Was already restricting and b/ping at this point. I was really secretive about eating and they‚Äôd not only tease me horribly about it they‚Äôd talk about the ‚Äúmassive amounts of food and dishes‚Äù I had hidden in my room.   I can‚Äôt put all the blame on family tho. I was also a competitive athlete and the other girls and coaches were merciless. Didn‚Äôt matter how little you weighed you always could lose more!   Bonus ed fuel: my mother had those kitschy country kitchen decorations with fun sayings about how food makes you fat and nothing tastes as good as skinny!   Haha kill me. üòê",False,False

My sister and I used to love going binge food shopping together (I almost kind of miss that). My step mom lived off of candy and cigarretts, and her weight varied dramatically over the years. I guess I felt like no one had any control in my family, so I had to be the one.",False,False

They'd plate us up 3000+ calorie dinners and yell at us if we didn't eat every last fucking bite and every goddamn drop of sauce. My grandma would pick us up from school DAILY and give us burgers and if we didn't eat them we were being ungrateful shits who didn't really love her. They would constantly tell us we were ""skinny"" and needed to *gain weight* even if we were literally obese (my brother, and past me). They screamed at me for wanting to diet ever, and would give me *more* food than ever at dinner after I told them that (what a fucking shocker it is that that's when I started purging). They finally slackened up on meals my senior year of high school and let us portion our own plates, and whaddaya know my sister immediately started eating absolutely miniscule portions, her weight dropped like a rock from normal into dangerously underweight, she very obviously needs treatment, hasn't had her period in almost a year, and almost went through full renal failure, but my parents think she's just ""having some health issues"" and that her weight being two digits even though she's 5'7"" is ""totally normal.""",False,False
