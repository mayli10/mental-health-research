I was mainly reading about it on body building forums, which were very insistent that EC stacking will “melt away your fat and make you shredded!!”  Good to know. That’s one less thing I’d have to track and worry about haha",False,True

You’d gain maybe 100 calories worth a day, *maybe*. Less if you’re more underweight as your core body temperature is already at a lower level, so the effect ephedrine has to increase the “fat burn” is slightly nulled because it raises your core temp. It’s best use is for appetite suppression, honestly.   But yeah! Not to nag. We already put our hearts through enough.",False,False

I was looking into EC stacking more for the weight/fat-loss aspect rather than the appetite suppression (although that, of course, is a bonus). It's not something I'm definitely gonna do, just a thought, so thanks for the heads-up.",False,True

When I was on vyvanse, my heart rate did elevate a bit- I think I’d have caffeine and that’s it an I’d be fine. Personally vyv killed my appetite well all on its own. But adding ephedrine one top of the vyvanse might not end super well if you’re not accustomed to having that much stimulation at once. And you said you’re sensitive to medication- the vyvanse, honestly, should be more than enough.   I don’t advise stacking with it at all.",False,False
