I think now is a great time to consider recovery though I know this weight is tempting to push since it‚Äôs *so close* to 99lbs (my Ed‚Äôs goal) but we are waaaay too tall for that!!,False,False

(I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù) Eating disorders and weird. I was barely eating when I was obese, but I somehow ended up getting to a healthy weight through exercise. (And actually ate correctly for once) It took me about 6 months to get down to around 170. I kept dropping weight, and eventually started restricting again because I wanted to ‚Äúkeep pushing it further‚Äù - I am much closer to where I should be weight wise. Getting back on track has not been easy but so much less emotionally draining than being obese. I‚Äôm honestly fine at this weight, I just need to get in a healthy eating routine again. I wouldn‚Äôt mind gaining 5lbs. (ED is screaming at me for saying that lol) but I‚Äôm very close to recovery, I just have bad days.",False,False

Not chubby, but like hella fat by non Ed standards. I was miserable because people and fun of me and they made me feel disgusting. I just wanted someone to see me.   I went from that to thin in a year. I was 11 and by the time I was 12 it was noticeable that I was thin. Before hitting 13, I got down to an alarmingly thin weight. That‚Äôs when my mom took me to doctors because she thought I was sick( not anorexia but like cancer or something) that‚Äôs when the doctor was like oh shit she‚Äôs bradycardic. My heart rate was like 29 beats per minute. That‚Äôs when I was hospitalized for the first time. I won‚Äôt say the weights I was at this point as to not trigger anyone. I recovered properly at 18( then got into bulimia) now I eat about 2000 calories and I am still very slim. I don‚Äôt purge and I am just normal active( figure skater) . Not alarmingly thin but still petite. Iam 5ft 1 so it‚Äôs not like Iam tall. I want to say this because I was scared of recovering properly because I was always petrified of being fat again. It didn‚Äôt happen for me but even if it did I think Iam more happy when i put aside the roller coaster of binging and restricting.",False,False

Passed out almost daily, fucked up my potassium and sodium levels and yeah. Thinking back on it, I'm fucking insane for doing this again. I just severely relapsed and haven't eaten in 13 days.

I suffered from ednos in highschool and after graduating moved states away from all my friends and started to suffer severely from binge eating. Skyrocketed from 150ish to 230 in about a year (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äô‚Äô) in September of 2016 I relapsed severely into AN tendencies and lost 100lbs in 6 months to the horror of my family who knew I had an Ed but I didn‚Äôt admit to and vehemently denied ever restricting/purging.   Regained about 35lbs while in a relationship with my now ex over the next 3 years and severely relapsed in August and have lost 25lbs since  I don‚Äôt really plan to ‚Äúrecover‚Äù but I know I will NEVER allow myself above 145 again if only to keep my BMI in the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù range and because I know how strained my body was above that weight.,False,False
