I’m really burning 50-70% of what the machines say, and even then every app and monitor I’ve tried varies. So my goals the numbers plus “feel like death with asthma a few times”",False,False

But for me, once I've hit my time/ calorie goal, seeing the number climb higher is better than stopping. So I'll push myself as hard as I can. It makes me euphoric and jelly-legged  Also, just found this very unscientific article about the differences in the calorie count reliability between machines  https://www.shape.com/fitness/cardio/how-inaccurate-are-calorie-counters-gym",False,False

So now I wear a heart rate monitor watch which is a bit more accurate but still stresses me out lol. ,False,False

Although for me it's typically, instead of sticking to the amount of time I might have had allotted for working out, ""okay now you have to get to ____ calories burned before you can leave"" or pushing myself too hard to burn calories faster, etc.  I'm glad you didn't purge, at least. Lots of love your way.",False,False
