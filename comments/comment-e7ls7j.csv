As cliche as it is, they are your support team and have been there to help u and guide u for the very reason of getting to the weight that is healthier for your body's operation. I've been recovering now and I can sense a little bit what you mean as I let ED take control of much of my life where I now have to figure out ""how to live"" and enjoy life vs just float though it. And I have thought about turning back to ED but just had to keep telling myself that I'm doing this for a reason ( a better more fulfilling life). Idk if that helps but I hope it does :)",False,False
