I was told that French people see food differently, while American people  (generalizing here) eat/snack whenever, many French people only eat at specific hours + with people around them instead of eating alone. They also really like to choose bio stuff which usually is lower calories. I stayed with a French family and that was my experience, as a person who struggled to not binge for more than 2 days, I hadn't binged for 5 weeks there.",False,False

She thinks that they must be doing “the trick,” when of course the author is trying to compare that style of eating to the character’s binges.  Obviously not scientific but it really made me think since I wasn’t bulimic last time I read this book.",False,False

I mean, the main difference I see between American dieters and French women who are interested in being skinny (without being disordered, necessarily) is that the French think realistically about food. If they have fatty cheese or a piece of cake, that means they need to eat light at their next meal. They'll have a small salad or some veggies, not eat meat and more cheese and carbs and just try to like, do portion control on that calorie-dense food.   I know how basic this seems in theory, but it's amazing how Americans often won't think this way. I watch my relatives just not even consider taking their previous meal into account when they choose what to eat next. When they're indulging, they say, ""Oh, I'll make up for this later,"" and then like...they might *try* to take less at dinner, but they're still determined to eat a totally normal dinner, more or less, after consuming a significant number of cals at lunch. idk Americans have this weird dichotomous *thing* about deprivation, where it's just not really acceptable to say, ""Damn, I had French toast for breakfast, maybe I'll eat tomato slices with fresh onion for lunch,"" because that's nOt rEaL LUnCh and therefore that is unHEalThY and bAD behavior. But then Americans will also do things like attempt to cut out an absurd number of food groups at once in the name of some weird new diet, only to snap and then start going hog wild with cheat foods. It does seem to me that the French are better at practicing genuine moderation, and also at portioning food accurately.  But of course, most of them grew up learning to eat properly at literal school, where a full lunch is usually served. So the country as a whole does value teaching people to appreciate food, while being realistic about dietary balance.  That said, things have changed rapidly with the rise of processed and convenience foods. Also, these observations are based on the white Parisian middle to upper middle class, and really, that food culture can be surprisingly similar to that of white, coastal upper-middle class America. (But the Americans still tend to be wayyy more neurotic about food, and overall we just make eating so much more complicated than it needs to be. Also we all eat too fast, regardless of class, and don't fully respect meals as a rejuvenating gift, as opposed to a hassle/chore. This latter thing, of course, is partly due to our shitty work culture.)",False,False
