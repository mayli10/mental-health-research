Also you have to specifically eat carbs since the brain can only burn sugars.",False,False

It ideally needs 516. It’s 6 cal per billion neurons and we have approx 86 billion neurons. 6x86 = 516.   The second thing is that approx 20% of however much you eat will go to the brain.   These things seem conflicting to me but anyway, I guess they’re idealistic. If you’re eating 1000 cal then your brain will only get 200.",False,False

The more you eat, the more the brain has to function better. I would stay over 1200 at least if you can. If you do any exercising, that should be considered too.",False,False
