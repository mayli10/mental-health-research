You sound like such an amazing person to be around. If anything this must have taught you that people love others for what they are and mean to them. And regarding what someone looks like, everyone has a type, but this is usually just attraction based preference and not no-go criteria.   &amp;#x200B;  My boyfriend fell in love with me at 240 lbs and is just as loving and caring around my 170 lb self. I'm still trying my best to lose weight and he has been my rock. He did not love me any less back then and him supporting me on this journey gives me strength every day.   &amp;#x200B;  So keep being yourself and do not let this get you down. Someone will love you for you.",False,False

That could be me being presumptuous, however. But even if he isn't an asshole, or usually one, what he did to you and how he went about it is horrible and your feelings of feeling used are entirely valid. That's such a cruel thing to do to someone, especially after you bent over backwards for him when he needed a shoulder to cry on or someone to just be there.   You're a human being and you deserve to be treated as such *no matter what.* I know this probably isn't of much consolation to say but this is a big world we live in. It's likely that you'll eventually find someone for you who won't treat you this way because he or she knows that no one deserves to be thrown around like that.  This is a heartbreak for you and I guarantee you that you're going to be upset about this for quite some time but there will, most likely, come a day where you aren't. A day when these feelings lessen day by day until it slowly simmers out. That day isn't today and it most likely isn't tomorrow but don't let anyone convince you that it will never come.   I hope you feel better soon, man. Ugh, he's such a dick. You totally deserve better.",False,False

Fuck that shit. Just remember that none of what he did has anything to do with you and is only a negative reflection on him. You were an innocent bystander to someone else's bullshit and it's not fair at all. Please stay safe while you process the (totally normal) feelings you have, you did all the good and brave things by opening your heart and taking a chance and a gem like you can't go unnoticed forever.

She most likely wished she was you when you two were together. He's a dick-fuck.  He's using both of you. Why? Because he's not ok. Speaking as a fellow severely overweight female dating a guy for 5+ years now I get jealous of his lesbian friend from childhood. She is a cool down to earth girl who is a decent human and has done nothing to me but my insecurities shine through. He's figured that out and us taking advantage of people. Hard  At least that's how i saw it. I was a side bitch and lost 50 pounds to try to move on up the dick ladder. But there's no room for promotion with fuckwads.,False,False

I'm really, really sorry this happened. You are such a kind, thoughtful person and you deserve so much better than to have been taken advantage of by that deplorable piece of cockroach dung.   Please make sure to take care of yourself. This is on him, not you. Please don‚Äôt punish yourself more for him being a terrible person.  Like you once said, keep fighting.

I would find it hard not to take something like 'you'll never be her' personally. Through that sounds a lot of heartbreak / love for some else.   I don't think you can rule out the possibility he tried to move on from his last relationship but could not.   However none of that changes how you probably feel right now. And the fact that he ended up being the one not deserving of you.   You are experiencing heartbreak and you should really be taking care of yourself. You are worth the self care. If eating is a bit too difficult right now maybe buy a crazy color nail polish or treat yourself to some nice face masks. Be nice to you. Especially at times other people fail you you should be nice to yourself. Selfcare. Yes even if you don't believe you deserve it.    Often when I think i don't deserve shit I also know in the back of my head it is ridiculous to punish myself for others actions. I still do it, but I know it's sick. I you are like me and want to punish yourself for this guy being a jerk, also do some nice things. Don't let him, or his actions, define you, you are worth more ‚ô•Ô∏è.   &amp;nbsp;  You have the right to all your feelings. Still liking him despite everything, hating him, liking and hating yourself cause of this. Just let it be. It's what heartbreak is. It's gonna get better. Hold on!",False,False
