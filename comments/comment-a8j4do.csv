But idk if she will feel offended or scared and not wanna be my friend anymore. Dilemma :/ I really care for her and I’m not there to control her ED but I’ve asked her twice how she was feeling and if she was ok after (I think) she purged. But she seemed confused and didn’t like it It’s hard but I really really wanna be her friend and support her,False,False
