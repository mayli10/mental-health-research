It’s depressing because like I said, it’s a lose / lose situation for me. I’m sure it also has to do with what’s trendy right now, aka bigger butt and thighs. I know a few years ago every dancer was super thin and tan and now it’s all about #themgains ahaha",False,False

I mean, I guess some people are put off by seeing bones and your boobs/butt are probably bigger at higher weights, but I didn't think that being thinner would be detrimental to your earnings as a stripper.",False,True

Can confirm, funnily enough at my lowest weight I made significantly LESS money than I do when I’m *gag “healthier” looking. Whenever we have an obviously underweight dancer she struggles, too. Of course, you have the odd skinny fetish type of guy but they’re SO rare to come across and when I’m at my low points they’re my good nights tbh   I’m talking like, $200 less. Nightly.   Still doesn’t stop me from losing but just saying, the stereotype of a stripper body is so silly. Most of us are BMI 19-23",False,False
