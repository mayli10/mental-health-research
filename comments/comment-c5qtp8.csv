I actually already practise this quite regularly as I tend to get a lot of intrusive thoughts while trying to sleep. While itâ€™s somewhat helpful at times I usually have the best luck drifting off while listening to the same song on repeat. Last night definitely turned out to be a case of too much caffeine though, so neither helped. Looking forward to a better rest tonight XD",False,True

Try to relax your breathing and maybe repeat a mantra in your head to relax your brain. For me, stressing out about not being able to sleep wakes me up even more and exhausts me at the same time so I try to not think about it.",False,False
