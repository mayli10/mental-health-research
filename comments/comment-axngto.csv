When you heavily restrict, you lose water when your body breaks down stored glycogen, fat, and muscle, plus many people are dehydrated from not getting fluids/electrolytes in their diet. It could even be more stool in your intestines. Heavy restriction slows down the digestive system, when you start eating more that extra food can sit around for awhile. Your stomach might look bigger only because it's easier to see the products of digestion after losing fat/muscle in your abdomen from heavy restriction (think of placing an inflated balloon on a table, then covering it with a thin sheet, versus covering with a thick coat or saddle blanket. the shape and size of the balloon is easier to see under the thin sheet).",False,False

I did read something about hypermetabolism and AN recovery. Iâ€™m worried this might not apply to me since I only lost 9 lbs &amp; never got UW (my lw BMI was 19.5). I also only restricted for ~3 months w frequent maintenance days. Do you think I would have to undergo the same refeeding process? having gained fat rapidly on 1000 - 1300 cals following restriction, Iâ€™m scared this rebound hypermetabolism wonâ€™t happen and Iâ€™ll just gain even more.  sorry for dumping all this in my reply, just wondering if you have any more insight to offer. thanks again",False,True

Iâ€™m so sorry youâ€™re struggling with something similar, though; having gone through the anxiety and feelings of entrapment, itâ€™s not something Iâ€™d wish on anyone. I really hope youâ€™re able to find a way to find a comfortable balance with your nutrition and weight.  about halfway thru my restriction I noticed my weight loss slowing down, too. after hitting my lw, I upped my cals to 1000 - 1300 per day and started rapidly gaining weight. I had 8 days total where I b/pâ€™d (max 2500 cals followed by full day fasts). put on 10 lb of fat in 4 weeks. after ~month of reverting to restriction without b/p I canâ€™t get the weight to drop. I know thermodynamics donâ€™t lie but Iâ€™m so confused and overwhelmed, and I donâ€™t know where to go from here. Connecting with others at least eases some anxiety for me and I hope for you, too.

Just wanted to say I am scared of this too. Iâ€™ve been restricting to 1000 a day for a year and 8 months without going over except for Christmas and thanksgiving where I let myself have 1200 a couple times. I didnâ€™t even think about how not inserting occasional maintenance days might screw me in the long run metabolism wise because Iâ€™ve never really taken the concept of metabolic damage seriously either.   However now with all the weight I lost + the fact that Iâ€™m pretty sedentary + the fact that now Iâ€™m underweight (and how all of that results in a lower maintenance already) has me worried Iâ€™ve somehow changed my maintenance calories to an extremely low number too through the constant restriction because Iâ€™m not losing what I should be anymore on 1000 a day.   I really hope someone else has some insight on whether there is any truth to this.,False,False
