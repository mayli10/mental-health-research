My sister moved out right when she turned 18, which I planned on doing too once I hit the mark, but she bought an expensive furniture set and went into debt over not being able to pay for it all on time. Read contracts carefully before you sign them, sleep on the floor if you can't afford a mattress, and never be ashamed to accept money from the government. I don't have any real life advice, because I'm a complete bum still living with my friend after my mom kicked me out. Edit: my sister now still lives with mom. Forgot to mention that in my cautionary tale.",False,False

She still is, sorry if you thought this was going to be hopeful, but I just don't live there anymore and we barely talk. It's better this way, for both of us. She had a lot of emotional problems of her own, but she never dealt with them properly and is still suffering. That made her a bad mother, and I'm the one that had to deal with it. I don't think she's a bad person, but living with her and her having power over me as a parent was not something I could handle in my own fragile state of mind. I'm not sure why I'm talking about myself right now, I guess I hope it makes you feel less alone. Any way you can get away from her is an opportunity you need to relish. Even if it means turning off your phone and leaving the house for a while. You can deal with what happens when you get back, but take time for yourself. I thought about killing myself and other people a lot during that time of my life, I wish I took more time to be away from that house. That's the only advice I have for you, get away.",False,False
