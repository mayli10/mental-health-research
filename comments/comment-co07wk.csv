You need to eat more protein if you want to build muscle and shape up. Low calorie protein snacks (protein shake, beef jerky, cottage cheese) will help feed muscle growth. It will take time. People don't see their ideal body until over a year sometimes. High protein + lower carb + time = the body you want. I've been athletic for the first time in my life this year(I am 26)  and after 7 months I still can't really run a 10 minute mile unless I BUST my ass, but I get closer and closer. It really is the long game and dedication. Of course EDs/BD/anxiety/depression make every little shred of progress seem like its not enough",False,False
