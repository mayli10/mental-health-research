But sometimes I just crave the quickness of fast food - and I honestly really enjoy CFA and TB. Like maybe part of it is knowing the calorie count, how I can customize it, the fact I can eat it in my car, or room, and no one knows. Or like sometimes I just want a little cheeseburger - I donâ€™t really to go sit down at a restaurant and I donâ€™t want to spend $10 bucks on a meat patty I may or may not regret, end up purging, etc. Maybe itâ€™s a little messed up.m, but thatâ€™s my disordered eating talking? Iâ€™m not sure. Iâ€™m still trying to figure it out.   Not to mention, I also really enjoy a really good tacos from a real taqueria or a meal real restaurant. I guess it just depends on my craving.",False,False
