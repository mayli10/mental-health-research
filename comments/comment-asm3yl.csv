I think she feels really nervous around food as well and she's constantly eating it because she feels she *shouldn't* and she doesn't know when she'll have the opportunity next, so she eats it a lot, I wouldn't be surprised if she has disordered eating habits.   That being said, completely understandable, the way you feel. I'm so happy you're in a good place! If you feel you need to pull away from this friend, you can definitely do that. Don't let your politeness get in the way of your good place! You don't have to be rude (obvs you know this) but you can definitely say ""eh, I'm not feeling too good, shall we go to the cinema instead?"", then you are sitting in the dark for 2 hours, she can order popcorn or whatever, and you're still hanging out but no food is being consumed! Then that gives you a film to discuss afterwards? I dunno, I'm just spitballing here :P  (I think she's also a bit jealous of you and the other friends, and so is compensating).  &amp;#x200B;",False,False
