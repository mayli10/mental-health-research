There are maybe 4 or 5 girls in the program across different years. (I know because I'm taking a reduced course load so my classes are all in different years.) The upside is that I'm pretty sure only one of the girls in my program is straight and also I'm definitely the hottest girl in my program. That's not saying much, but it makes me feel good anyway.",False,False

Plus I was thinking about it earlier and realized that if I managed even 500 calories more than I need it would take me a whole week to gain even one pound. I want to gain like 10 or 20 lbs and see how I look. That will take forever. Especially because I'm almost definitely not eating an excess of 500 calories per day. Like I struggled to maintain my weight for so long and now that I want to gain weight it's just not happening. I literally ate an entire family sized bag of Doritos the other day and wasn't even bloated in the morning. That's unheard of. Like I should have been feeling awful about myself in the morning, but I was exactly the same as the day before. Why does weight gain seem so easy when you don't want to do it, but so hard when you want to?",False,False

They may just not want to eat very much. You might see somebody eating McDonald's like 5 times a week, but that could be their only meal for the day. Either that or everything else they ate was really low calorie foods like salads or smoothies. And in my experience since becoming underweight it takes very little alcohol for me to get drunk now, so if I stick to light beer/coolers or mixed drinks made with diet soda there might be like 40-80 calories per drink. Two drinks is often enough for me. Sometimes I might have three or four drinks in a night. It's very easy to assume somebody else is drinking more than they actually are if they drink very slowly.",False,False

But that was definitely my experience in high school.  All of my female classmates were tiny and would go out to lunch every day once they were able to drive, meanwhile I wouldn't have my first meal until dinner and was still the fatty.  Now, most of them have put on so much weight.  The average is around 20-30 pounds probably, but some have definitely gained more.  This is terrible of me, but one of the only reasons I keep my facebook account active is so I can keep tabs on some of the girls in high school who made my life miserable at the time and see how much weight they've gained.",False,False
