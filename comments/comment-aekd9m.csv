Every day is like a whole new short story in a collection of short stories. It may not connect to yesterday's story, but it can go so much better than yeserday's. Good luck  And don't beat yourself up if it seems like it's not going how you want. Be gentle and kind with yourself",False,False

I hope that this helps: today is Not Fucked. You still have the rest of the day to turn it around. Maybe go on a walk? (If it's safe to do so) just look around, admire the sky and the clouds and realize that in the long run, last night and this morning are insignificant. Take some deep breaths and really, really try to believe and remember that you are so so deserving of happiness. The rest of today, the rest of this week, month, and year, are yours. You get to decide how each hour and day goes. It may not feel like it, but you Are In Control.   If you need someone to reach out to, my DMs are open.  I hope the rest of your day goes better",False,False
