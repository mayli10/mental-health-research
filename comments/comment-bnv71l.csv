That can be a huge emotional burden for the other person and honestly I'm not very keen on opening up. My whole life my entire family has kind of had this feeling of ""keep your emotions to yourself"" and I'm still attached to that. I can't cry in front of anyone, and I was never taught that it's a normal thing to do, so I never had any really close friends except for this school year since I mostly keep to myself.",False,True

However, if he repeatedly talks to other girls and straight up says you lack physical aspects he finds attractive, he‚Äôs harming you more than he‚Äôs helping. I‚Äôve had experience with guys like this and realized in the end they‚Äôre digging their own graves not yours.",False,False

I totally understand how you feel and what you mean; I‚Äôm part of r/BPD and it‚Äôs not an ED behavior of mine but it definitely is a BPD behavior I have. If you put yourself in another person, breaking up with him will make it a lot easier on you. Especially because you already recognize his behavior and how he‚Äôs acting, I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs half the game. And yes this will sound cheesy, but remember how special you are. Remember your importance. There is not a single other person on this billions old, billions full planet. You sound like a wonderful person and i‚Äôm sorry this has gone on for so long, but remember that life is worth fighting for and it‚Äôs definitely worth more than a relationship that is clearly hurting you. I wish you all the best and ofc my PMs are open if you want to talk ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False
