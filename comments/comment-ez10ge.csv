My bf and i got together a few years ago when i was 19 and still pretty slim. Relationship weight is REAL and i gained probably 20-30 lbs over the last 3 years. My boyfriend is so loving too but I just feel like he would love and appreciate me more if I looked like how I used to be... like 120 or less. Idk. Iâ€™m 5â€™1 so when I gain, itâ€™s very obvious and i canâ€™t really hide it, especially since heâ€™s very affectionate and touchy. I feel this girl. But, he loves you for YOU !! Donâ€™t forget it.",False,False

I thought everyone sat on their suitcases.  Iâ€™m sure your boyfriend does too.,False,False

He loves me at low weight and medium weight, as I'm sure your SO does. But when I treat myself like shit and am triggered by innocuous comments and can't stand to be touched, then it makes him sad.",False,False

I love my boyfriend and he constantly tells me how beautiful I am and how much he loves me but the insecure little bitch inside my head just won't let me accept his love.  I can't help but compare myself to every girl I see when we're in public and honestly I die on the inside every time I see him scroll past an ig model or some thot on his phone (he doesn't follow them but some of the pages and meme pages he follows always repost them.) He's the thinner one out of us and he has a model body-type white I'm a stump compared to him lmfao. I know he's super loyal and loves me but I just cannot bear the fact that he sees girls 10000x prettier than I am online and outside on a daily basis !!!!  Honestly though, it sounds like your boyfriend seriously meant no harm by his comments. I have a weird thing where I just interpret everything my bf says as some kind of secret insult to tell me I'm fat... like he knows I like to eat healthy so if we're getting food he'll point out the healthier options to me and it immediately triggers me. That girl at the club sounded extremely annoying and he was probably so angered by her in the moment he probably thought the 100lb comment was derogatory to her (especially if he's oblivious to your ED). And the suitcase thing is so common I promise you he didn't think you're heavy!!! I guarantee he thinks your body is beautiful and wouldn't notice any of those girls over you that you noticed (things ana make you look at in public lmao). Stay healthy for urself and in my opinion I dont think your bf realized what he said at all so don't be too harsh on him but if it still bothers you then I'd say just let him know that he hurt your feelings and hopefully he will understand &lt;3",False,False

Iâ€™m sure he thought you looked lovely, I hope that doesnâ€™t seem undermining because MAN I know the feeling. I would say open up to him about these feelings but I wouldnâ€™t personally because heâ€™d apologize and feel guilty over innocent comments. Yknow?? My boyfriend is also an angel and honestly extremely fatphobic out of self hate. Itâ€™s a weird fine line. Iâ€™m sorry it dampened your weekend.",False,False
