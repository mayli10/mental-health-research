Today I got some excellent news, in the form of a socially clueless friend. At dinner, she was animatedly talking about calorie counts, steps, weight, and other fun trigger-happiness. I was initially uncomfortable, but then I realized: SHE DOES NOT SUSPECT A THING. Or she wouldnâ€™t have said that shit! Stealth level increased again!",False,False

Weâ€™re more like accountabilibuddies. We both know of one anotherâ€™s ED behaviors so we mostly just tell each other how little we ate and joke about ignoring new complications indicating we should stop.  It sounds really bad but honestly weâ€™re just real with each other. We both wish the other wouldnâ€™t do what we do but we also know weâ€™ll continue anyway and weâ€™d be hypocrites to dissuade each other from what we do ourselves.,False,False

I refuse to eat my only meal of the day (dinner) unless my dad is home, and we are ALL eating at the same time. Its cause I know hes gone a whole day without eating, so has my mom, so I feel like I need to join in lmao",False,False

I'm starting to contemplate calling the bluff and not eating when I don't want to.   Maybe, after a few times, the other person will realize the tactic doesn't work anymore/ they'll get sick of not eating when they want to, and stop trying. Emotional manipulation is not the pinnacle of caring, lol.",False,False
