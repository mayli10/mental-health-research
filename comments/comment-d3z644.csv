Like, is there an option to choose which food you get served? So maybe you can pick something that feels safer to you? Or possibly come later in the evening after dinner?  Sending good thoughts your way 💖💖💖",False,False

I realized recently that I’ve way over-hyped every big food event that’s occurred in the last year or so, anticipating it for days in advance and ruminating for days (sometimes weeks!) afterward, and that despite every day or meal that I felt completely sure would be the “end” of me remaining my current shape and size (~17 BMI), that hasn’t been the case. Realizing that has helped me let go of a little bit of the fear and enjoy the moment more.   It hasn’t mattered whether I spent hours planning ahead of time exactly which items I would eat, or made a game plan with my boyfriend/friends (although that makes me feel safest), and there have been multiple instances where I wildly overate, didn’t purge, didn’t fast to compensate, and still remain the same size. I know we all hyperfixate on details, but it’s been a comfort to me to realize that most of the time we overestimate our intake, so relaxing occasionally and reminding myself I’m a human not a calorie counting robot keeps me sane and lets me enjoy family dinners.   You deserve to enjoy this night! Maybe you can reflect on what styles you feel most comfortable wearing? You’ve got this!",False,False
