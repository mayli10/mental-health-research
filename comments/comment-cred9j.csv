I don’t think the con of having to estimate the calories is too big of a deal (its pretty easy to eyeball if you ate, say, two thirds of what you make) and it has a really good reputation.   Tip for the calorie counting: prepare the meal as instructed, then weigh it. Once you’re finished, weigh the leftovers. Subtract one from the other, hey presto, you know how many calories to log.",False,False
