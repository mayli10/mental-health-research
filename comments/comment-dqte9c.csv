It sounds like you had lots of people you cared about, and you lost them to this. I'm worried about that happening, I'm trying to recover right now so it doesnt. I'm really sorry it's gotten to this point for you, seriously. If I didn't have the support system that I have right now in my life I never would've gotten here. Maybe try to get in touch with your old friends?",False,False

I also got high when wearing cute outfits, taking pictures of myself, the regular and nsfw ones.   But at the same time I was s o envious to girls who were on a healthy weight, how things like food didn’t seem to be a problem to them, they seemed beautiful with a bit of tummy and curvy legs and long beautiful, healthy hair. And they seemed that they are l o v e d by their peers and by themselves. They were actually living their life, while I felt like I am hollow, lifeless and look old, feel old since everything hurted. I started to hate when people just picked me up like I was nothing and random strangers called me anorexic or said that I look like a kid. I felt stupid since I couldn’t even think straight and have meaningful conversationd with my friends from uni. I was just dumb and full of hate, an underdog someone pitied and almost managed to destroy my relationship, because I am a huge bitch when restricting and I felt like everything was personal insult towards me.   I’m not def saying I’m recovered and I don’t think I’ll ever manage to deal with a huge gain of weight, I still feel guilty about eating.   But at the same time like fuck I want to love myself! I want to be loved, I want to be kind to myself and everyone else, I want to live and create meaningful things. I want to be able to support myself, have beautiful things around me. And if I can’t even feed myself, how could I love myself? I’m still definitely skinny, but prob not underweight. I’m giving my body lots of protein and vitamins. Prob going to start a bit of exercising, but only the kind of exercise I actually like and makes me feel good. My cheeks already seem fuller and I’m trying really hard not to hate it.",False,False

I felt like so many more people asked me for fitness advice (like I was even the one to give it) and treated me better. I had people come up to me at work who I didn’t even know and start a convo starting with “You look amazing! How did you...” I am now weight restored and it’s literally sickening how invisible I am.
