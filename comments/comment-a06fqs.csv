I even met my closest friend on MPA. He's now recovered and such a positive influence. It's just that the toxicity was so bad that it overshadows the good parts for me.",False,False

I don't know if I find this info hilarious or terrifying. did anyone else think it couldn't possibly be this bad over there? Is it kind of like a cult?

I've had every ED but anorexia, but I still felt very welcomed. There were specific channels there for bulimia, BED, and people ""starting at higher weights"".  The ONE thing that was very rampant there, however, is that restricting and losing weight was heavily encouraged. Basically, it was a literal ""pro ED"" site. People would teach others how to restrict, purge, fast, etc.   I did like it there when I wanted to fall deeper into my ED and lose more weight.",False,False

It became a very inclusive club where these people who were suffering could be accepted. Then they could take out their anger and hurt on others  It’s really an unhealthy place. I am so thankful I found proED because it was so difficult to want to have people but not want to get involved in the proana community ,False,False

It was so toxic, something I only realised later though. It had subforums dedicated to different types of EDs but I would say 90% was anorexic related so if you didn't have anorexia you could sucks it basically.  Everyone tried to convince themselves that they were not encouraging anything to the point the ""pro"" part was banned to a subforum for a diet so that it would be a ""secret"". Only difference was that people were more direct in the subforum compared to the rest of the forum.  I remember thinspo threads that were pages upon pages of extreme bonespo and I remember following one person who survived entirely on proteinshakes mixed with mashed up vitamin tablets.  There were regular challenges about who can lose the most, who can fast the longest, who can lose at least 10% of their body weight in a month, you get the idea.  Everyday there was drama, certain users were shunned and banned regularly only to come back with another account and if my memory serves me right at one point a lot (or well, more than usual) guys joined who wanted to be an ana coach and tried finding people they could manipulate.  In the end I was mostly in a subthread with just people from my country which later moved to kik so after that I didn't really visit much.  At least they told you not to eat cotton so I guess there's that.",False,False

It's all the worst things about EDs - if you're not AN/R and you haven't done six stints in inpatient you're nothing and you deserve to die. It's not a good place.    It's like the crystal meth of EDs. If it was a room of  100 people, 75 of them would be screaming at each other and pulling each others hair,  and the other 25 would be crying in the corner. Everyone else would be crying also, but full on in public instead of in the corner.   Now,  when I start feeling like I should go back on MPA,  I know it's time to call my therapist.",False,False
