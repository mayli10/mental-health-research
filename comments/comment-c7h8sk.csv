On non ec stack days I exercised sometimes. Either short runs or bodyweight exercises.   *I am a fuckup. I have a problem. :////*   Also I am starting to get addicted to ec stack. I only feel good and productive when I take it, and whenever I don't I binge and feel miserable. It means recently I've been dropping actual weight but also I feel like shit and am worried I'll drop dead with liver or heart failure at any moment so I do not recommend this. I am so scared for myself.   cheers ✓✓✓✓✓",False,True
