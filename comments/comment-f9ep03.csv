Life has been pretty topsy turvy recently. On top of every other stressor I got demoted at my job. They say they love having me on the team and how passionate I am about the work, but their actions suggest otherwise. I‚Äôm so fucking frustrated and barely ate today. All I can really do right now is look for another job that actually pays me what I‚Äôm worth and has an organizational culture involving respect. I put so much of myself into my work and everyone knows and see that, but I took a huge blow to my phone and hours. It feels like they sliced my stomach open instead of simply stabbing me in the back. So that‚Äôs tOtAlLy HeLpInG ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",False,True

In my opinion, it‚Äôs dangerous to wait until you 100% want to recover so if you see the chance now then maybe it‚Äôs time to take that opportunity! that‚Äôs just my perspective though I could totally be off here. I‚Äôm very sorry about your job situation that‚Äôs gotta be awful, I hope you can feel that your worth more than a job title!!:)))",False,False
