Iâ€™m up like 12-14 lbs since then and I want to throw myself off of a cliff.   The worst part is that I canâ€™t just..... stop?! Iâ€™m so hungry.. the only way I could imagine stopping is just going to bed super early but I donâ€™t like to do that because night time is my only time to myself/ with my fiancÃ© since I have 2 toddlers,False,False
