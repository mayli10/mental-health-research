The thing with ED is that recovery can look very different depending on the kind of ED the person has, and it's always pretty personal.  In my case, my recovery would have to start with stopping things like calorie counting (it always sends me spiraling back into disordered behaviour), no restricting, no laxatives, no bingeing, etc. Basically stopping with trying to lose weight at any cost and instead having to rebuild my relationship with food and my body image from scratch.",False,True

Excuse me for asking, but I'm new to all this relating to ED's. When you're talking about recovery, do you mean gaining weight?",False,False

I mean, I still think I'm too fat to recover even at a slightly lower weight but..  I'm just so sorry. Recovery takes /#1 priority of course, but this is part of what makes bingeing so detrimental honestly. Just because some people binge more or less than another group does not make one group more ""valid"" than the other.  It's just horrible, and I hope you will one day receive the help that you need ‚ù§Ô∏è and for one, it's cutting out toxic people in your life who say things like that to you. People love you for reasons outside of your weight/looks.",False,False
