I guess the best solution would be to work with the anxiety, but I don't think I'm ready for that find it helps to try to find other interests/studying/hobbies etc, to keep you busy instead of the ED? I study a field that is kind of similar/soothing like ED since you have to have super much information on your mind all the time that it keeps you so busy. Yoga also helps, walks/running, music, podcasts etc etc. But yes, I miss it so much and want to go back so often, but I try to convince myself that I want the other things in life more.",False,False

I realize that's not how it works and it's quite literally the disorder itself speaking so I don't really know. I'm not mentally read to be a healthy weight but I want to stop my chaotic diet,False,False

I was severely anorexic in HS and binged off and on in college; it became a bigger problem grad school through now. I manage the anorexic symptoms sometimes and I don't want to lose that part of it. I like being thin. I'm at a near-minimum healthy weight and am pretty happy with my body.,False,False

But as of late, I've been considering reaching out, and I'm actually trying to build the courage to bring it up with my doctor when I see him next week.  But it's not so much that I want to recover, I'm just tired of feeling alone and not having anyone to really, freely talk with about it. I know if I tried to overcome it, I'd only trade my ED for cutting; I need a way to cope.  I guess at this point part of me wants to manage it. I've been experiencing some concerning physical symptoms that I know I should get checked out. I want to know to what extent the damage is I'm doing to myself. But by no means am I ready to start down the road to recovery.  That's probably my greatest fear about all this, that even if I no longer need it as a way to cope, I'll never be ready to put it behind me, that I'll always live with at least one foot in my ED.",False,False

I always felt like it was my duty to be happy and funny with my family and friends and I thought no one want to have a sick friend. I also didn't want anyone to try to stop. Things for me have changed after a friend openly talked with me about being depressed and suicidal, I realized that I don't hate him for being sick and if I feel that way he also probably won't hate me for being sick. So I talked about everything with him and it was the first time I talked sincerely. After I really realized that it's not my duty to be happy and I deserve to show and say that I'm not okay.   I also felt the same for the secret life you talk, it sucks but it's comfortable and it's always there for you.  Even if sometimes I miss it and I am not fine I still think recovery it's worth it. I don't want to tell you what to do but I think talking with someone helps even if it's really hard to do , and everybody deserve to show that they are not well",False,True

This is taking a big part of my energy and time, and I want to be well due to having a lot of responsibilities and pressure from my surroundings because everyone thinks I'm that stable happy pure girl....  And this is where the second part comes, I feel like I'm having a secret life, I'm mysterious, it's giving me an identity, and when everything gets out of control and I don't know how to deal with life, I clock out of reality and only care about this ED  It's my only coping mechanism atm  This probably doesn't even make sense",False,False
