Nobody got them all right (or even close). Sometimes the pictures featured in the sports magazine were more revealing than the Playboy! It was very surreal. We have sex shoved in our faces 24/7.",False,False

He does follow a few insta models, but they‚Äôre mutual friends/acquaintances of ours and I have zero worries that he‚Äôs ogling them given his preferences. An IG profile that features photos of redheads posted some of my pics and he followed the account (which I was totally cool with) but later unfollowed because he thought it was disrespectful to me.  My abusive ex-husband would openly ogle other women, and I much prefer being with someone who doesn‚Äôt prey upon my insecurities.",False,False

Modern social media has made it socially acceptable to look through a page of a 90% naked woman and like her pictures and appreciate her ass and it's ""not porn"" you're just looking through Instagram. It's like a whole new category socially. Guys think it's okay to have your girlfriend know which 20 women you go to Instagram to look at because it's ""not porn"" so they aren't hiding it.  I don't know what my overall point is, just the problem is very specific and modern and i think it's gross. Like if I have kids someday that will be 100% normal in the world they grow up in. My 11 year old isn't going to find a porn mag in his friends parents closet, or a website online, they're just going to go to Instagram and their friends will be openly following all these softcore porn butt accounts. Ugh. What a fucking world we're in, where a guy is getting mad at his girlfriend for not liking the dozens of women he digitally publicly follows to look at their bodies.",False,False

He is not a Facebook or Instagram guy so it helps. Mostly he reads news. I pride myself of not being jealous but my self worth and security on his interest will disappear in a blink of I had to experience him following cute girls.,False,False

How would he feel if you followed a bunch of men more conventionally attractive than him?  My older bf doesn't do anything like follow other women or even look at porn (he considers it cheating).  I am a millennial and I had never heard that opinion before him, but it's so nice. I think my generation has normalized this shit too much.  You deserve better than a guy who gets his rocks off to other women and then demonizes you for being upset over it. It's normal to be upset over that.",False,False

I personally think it's gross/unnecessary to publicly share what you get your rocks off to. Which is what it means to follow people on Insta just cause you want to look at their body.   It's another for him to not want to stop for you. This is like... acceptable but non ideal.   Getting mad at you for asking? That's shitty. He's shitty for doing that.,False,False

If he's unwilling to make that small change for you it seems sketchy to me though. If he cared about your feelings or your disorder he would understand that displaying that kind of thing can lead to really toxic behaviours for ED folks.
