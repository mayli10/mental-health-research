You sound so amazing, though. I don't think I've ever heard someone speak so candidly and with such self-awareness about what they needed for their own mental health during a stressful time, that's incredible. You are obviously a very strong person especially to be able to shrug off comments like this, even if they hurt. I hope you keep doing what you're doing and kick your classes' asses!",False,False
