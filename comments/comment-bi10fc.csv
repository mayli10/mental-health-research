I should probably quit bc I‚Äôm obsessive about my skincare but I‚Äôm worried it will make my ED worse and it also helps keep me away from more debilitating drugs. I‚Äôve been thinking of trying to replace it with vaping CBD eventually. I mostly enjoy the comfort of having a routine/ritual to do with my hands so I‚Äôm not thinking about food. Or heroin. üòÇ,False,False

Honestly I just was very careful about what I put in my mouth and was aware that many people stress eat or eat to do something with there mouth to fill that hand to mouth action. Its like when i started the pill, the chemist said to me ‚Äúthis can make you gain weight, IF you over eat‚Äù sooo if you don‚Äôt you are jot magically going to gain weight! lot‚Äôs of iced water, low cal drinks helped. I do remember being a bit bloated/ full after stopping smoking but that‚Äôs because smoking being a stimulant speeds up your digestion so there was a bit of constipation, but that eventually evened out.  I was horrified to think i would gain a bunch of weight, it will not happen if you don‚Äôt ‚Äúreplace‚Äù smoking with food.  I told myself i could try to quit for awhile and if i gained some kilos i could go right back, turns out i did not have to and bonus honest my skin never looked better. I did not realise how dry and kinda grey my skin was, so much better now.   Its actually mentally tough to give up cigs..honest if you can push through the first week or so you will end up wondering how you ever smoked",False,False
