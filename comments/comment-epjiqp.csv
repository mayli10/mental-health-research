You said you are running too and are probably being more active in general, and all that can cause water retention. Check out this article that talks about it a bit and explains what's going on in your muscles at a cellular level (sorry I'm a science nerd and love reading up on this stuff lol) https://health.clevelandclinic.org/just-started-exercising-gaining-weight/ But basically it can take a few weeks to a month to lose the water weight, which is v obnoxious. Its hard to ignore the number on the scale even in the face of facts (I.e. definitely not eating a 10000 cal surplus) but we got this!",False,False

Its the worst, I always hate that when I pick it up with strength training or exercise intensity too (I've been holding onto water weight for a couple weeks myself rn and its FRUSTRATING af) I know its so difficult, but if you hang on with the exercise and moderate eating plan I promise you will feel better in the long run &lt;3 Also try drinking more water and powerade zero or another drink with electrolytes. Staying hydrated is very important too.",False,False
