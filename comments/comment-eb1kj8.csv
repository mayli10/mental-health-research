You still deserve compassion n love n support,   I’ve been trying to recover and I got my period back just under a mont ago- right around a time where I was definitely flirting w/ restriction. It made me rlly want to relapse, but now I’m trying to meet my body in the middle, if it’s trying to return to this state, I might as well give myself a shot at nourishing it. I don’t know if this was any help but I just want to let u kno ur not alone ❤️❤️",False,False
