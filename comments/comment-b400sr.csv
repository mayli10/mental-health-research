When I was in HS, I'd do two hours of either swim or water polo practice AT LEAST almost every day. It wasn't unhealthy. Most athletes I knew did more than that.  That being said, I also didn't restrict or purge at the time. I had a very strict, clear-cut case of BED, so I had very normal eating habits with just a Caloric surplus due to bingeing.  When my BED evolved into expressing symptoms of other ED's, and I did things like EC stacking, purging, fasting, etc., two hours a day for me was quite unhealthy. I wasn't listening to my body while training. I wasn't trying to get better at anything; my only goal was to burn as many Calories as possible. I never felt light-headed swimming 2 hours/day in HS, but I feel light-headed all the time now.  It really just depends on outside variables.",False,False

Since I'm not 18 I can't see a therapist on my own. My mom refuses to take me to one for an unknown reason. I'll see what I can do. I've tried everything and she's turned me down. Idk but I'll definitely try.  ,False,True

What type doesn’t really matter right now.   I’m not a doctor, of course, but the reason you’re hurting is because you’re overtraining. Your body is never given time to recover. I’d really recommend trying to take off from exercise for a while (like a month since you’ve been doing this for years), but if you can’t try to see a therapist for these thoughts.   You should also know your weight and height ratio are not disgusting.   Please stay safe.",False,False
