I had a therapist that would constantly talk about Donald Trump. XD but yours sounds way worse than that! Your session is not a time for the therapist to work out her own issues!   I know it's really disappointing to go to a therapist that doesn't work and it sucks to have to find a new one. Is there someone else within your first therapist's office that you could go to? It might seem awkward, but you have to do what's right for you. If she's not working and there are limited options in your city, you shouldn't feel bad about switching to a different therapist within the office. That sort of thing happens all the time.

I went to therapy a few months ago and my therapist was super judgmental and all she wanted to do was talk about her upcoming books. I ended up giving her feedback about her marriage struggles a lot of our sessions. Eventually I discontinued her services. That coupled with my doctors basically laughing in my face about my health anxiety made me fairly distrusting of health professionals. I know I just have come across is a few bad apples but I live in a small town where mental health care access is SUPER limited.,False,True

I'm the same about hating comments on weight loss, especially the really positive ones. I like to make people feel a bit awkward when they mention I've lost weight by saying ""yeah i knowww I've been a bit sick lately ðŸ˜£"". It gives them pause to think about whether weight loss is always a good thing.  BUT. Today my friend mentioned my weight loss .  Me: ""yeah I've been so stressed and busy lately I haven't really had time to eat properly"" (which is very true, but i won't pretend I'm not taking advantage of it)  Friend: ""noo I think it's probably all the dance you're doing""   Me: ""?? Didn't you hear me when i said i was so busy I haven't attended a class for 2+ months?""   Friend: ""teaching kids dance then.. All that cardio..""   Me: ""I've been teaching the same amount of classes all year though?""   She was literally trying to argue and tell me why *I* lost weight ðŸ˜’ I think people want to avoid the discomfort of complimenting me saying I look better than before, when the weight loss wasn't healthy. Also people just looove to think you can outrun a bad diet",False,False

When you lose weight, people never consider that maybe you didn't lose it on purpose. It's so upsetting when you hate your fucking life and people are like ""OMG!! You lost so much weight! You look so good!!"" Like they're complimenting the fact that I wanted to kill myself for 3 months? Or the fact that I'm so depressed good has felt like ash in my mouth and my stomach's constantly in knots? What are they trying to say about how I looked before I lost weight?   Honestly for me, all the compliments were a reminder of why I was so depressed. It made me really pissed off at how superficial society is.   Buuuuuuuut tbh fuck aaaaalllllll of that. I was in your shoes a few years ago and eventually I ended up needing some help for my anxiety and depression. It really helped me, I don't know if I would have gotten through college without professional help. Is it an option to go to a therapist for your anxiety? ",False,False
