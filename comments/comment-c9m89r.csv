It's just so frustrating that it's hard to keep going sometimes. I feel so much better when I skip meals/food times. I know that is just the eating disorder talking but I haven't gotten to the point where I can point to how much better I feel and use that as ammunition to ignore it. Idk, there's not a lot of trust there and I'm not sure how to build it. I guess I have to just keep going and see",False,True

At the very beginning/I'd say first month or so it gets worse before it gets better. Time consuming food intake &amp; you're not kidding about the pooping! If you're busy busy busy how about granola bars, cake bars, prepackaged nuts/sandwiches or something you don't have to prep in advance &amp; can just eat on the go? Way easier.  But from my own experience the energy thing - once the body has healed enough stuff inside to stop you feeling drained &amp; exhausted all the time (because it's rerouting everything to internal repairs) I got a crazy energy burst! It's been great since then. I can think much clearer, I'm happier to do more stuff that doesn't just involve sitting on my arse, I can hold a conversation &amp; actually participate &amp; hear what the other person is really saying rather than being constantly distracted by thoughts.  That said, I felt totally shit for the first month or so. I felt guilty, bloated, exhausted...this is normal. Your body has been through hell &amp; if you're anything like me it had begun shutting down - low heart rate, no period, brittle nails &amp; hair, poor digestion...these things need to be repaired or at least begun to repair before your body is going to bother with giving you energy to do stuff. It doesn't want you to do stuff at the beginning, it wants to rest &amp; heal your systems first.  That's just my experience but I do find it ties in with many others experiences I've read about. Good luck! Keep at it.",False,False
