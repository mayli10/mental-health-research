The one I take is 50 billion (idk what that means but I heard thatâ€™s the strength you should take!) I also heard you can get them through foods like kimchi and kombucha and yougurt, but if you do that itâ€™s better to make your own bc commercial pasteurization kills the probiotics, but I havenâ€™t tried or done research to see if thatâ€™s backed up by science bc taking the tablet worked really well for me!",False,False

I'm about to find your patties right now! And I think I saw small serving size packets for almond butter at the health food store. That sounds nutritious to boot,False,True

I like the little baby York peppermint patties (the unwrapped ones) they are 15cal/piece and they are super satisfying and you can freeze them to make them super chewy. Also weirdly I have found that when I take probiotics regularly it helps SO much with sweet cravings (I know that sounds so fake but I swear it works.) also a date w a tiny bit of almond/peanut butter is SO sweet that it kind of satisfies the craving for me, it is around 90 cal but I can actually stop at one which I sometimes canâ€™t do with other treats.",False,False

Not sure if you're in the states, or in an area that has them, but they're my go-to in a situation like this. 80 calories for four giant marshmallow squares. They have several flavor options (I usually go with Strawberries and Cream). They are really sweet, but SUPER filling, so it's hard to overindulge. Anyway, good luck friend! ðŸ’™",False,False
