Hoping to get a good job in the new year and keep exercising as much as I have been. I wanna continue recovery even though I dunno if it’s actually possible. I’d like to get to the point where I’m still controlling my weight but don’t freak out about it or am ruled by self loathing.  in tired of being crazy and want to have a relationship sometime in the next year or two.  Been managing to eat really healthy and exercising almost every day (gym has been closed this week...and I didnt freak out about it!! So maybe that’s progress)   I want to do lots of good work for Uni and make art and spend time with people who make me feel good about myself. I want to keep cooking for myself and doing dance classes and going for walks outside and sleeping, and hopefully need less therapy.",False,False

I've mean meaning to make an Aussie holy grail post!   I have a protein bar, and then about an hour later I make dinner. Basically anything that is tasty.

Very low carb and sugar;  heaps of Stevia and protein bars/mousse/shakes.",False,True
