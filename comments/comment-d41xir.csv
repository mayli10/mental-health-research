So you cannot increase the Kcals in oatmeal by exposing it to heat. That’s literally impossible if all you are doing is JUST cooking it Xoxoxo,False,False

Cooking can’t increase or decrease the calories in a food if you are just adding water.   Because things can get bigger or smaller, or lose or gain weight (through water being added or evaporating) when cooking, sometimes cooked versions of the original portion size are a different weight or size after cooking  (eg after you cook your 1/3c oats with water, it’s actually swollen up to a full cup worth of food. So it’s like 1/3 dry oatmeal is equivalent of 1 cup cooked oatmeal- both are 100cals.",False,False

I hope you get to eat it with milk sugar and cinnamon someday.,False,False

Only real difference is the volume, 1/3 cup dry oats would weigh more than 1/3 cooked oats bc there’s more of the oats but it doesn’t affect the calorie count",False,False
