Membership salespeople are typically very pressured to sell so more than likely theyd be willing to arrange a trial class for an instructor,False,False

But the rec is better than the commercial gym.   There is one for $25 a month that's pretty close to my house and has classes and is much bigger.... I pay $10 right now but I also take a cardio drumming and yoga class every week so sometimes I wonder if it would be worth it to switch.   But part of it is I really like my yoga teacher. She does a restorative class that I usually do right after my cardio drumming. And I'm not sure if I would like the gyms yoga teacher :c ,False,False

It's a ~luxury~ gym I pay ~$130/month for, but it's totally worth it for the saltwater pool, steam room, sauna, and the fact my machines are literally never taken.   I used to be a SoulCycle freak so in comparison I'm saving money, which is kind of fucked if you think about it. However my fave instructor from SoulCycle just moved to my gym and is going to start teaching the Cycling classes here so that's the best christmas present I got this year.",False,False

I miss my veggies and i wanna do cardio in peace. But mostly I feel sad when I see that type of people stop going to the gym and stuff like that. Cause Iâ€™ve been there.
