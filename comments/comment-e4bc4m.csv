Mine was caused by too many NSAIDS and antibiotics to treat H. Pylori, which I didnt have.    I have been drinking a shot of fresh potato juice in the am and pm, on an empty stomach.    Two hours after, I take my PPI and I drink a probiotic.    I still dont have much of an appetite but the stomach pains are gone and Im not belching as much.   Its been 17 days since my misery began but just take things day by day.  Rest and minimizing stress is also very important.   For the potato, get two small potato, peel and shred then, like if you were going to make hashbrowns.  Then squeeze the juice out of it and drink it on an empty stomach.   It tastes horrible, but it was worth it for me, to get rid of my pain.  Per family and friends, it coats your stomach and heals the stomach lining faster.      Im not a medical professional, but this has worked for me.    I hope that you feel better.",False,False

Do you have a doctor you trust that you can be honest with about your behaviours?",False,False
