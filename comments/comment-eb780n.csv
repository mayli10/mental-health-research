Two options- be honest about your struggles and ask them to not pressure you into eating because it gives you anxiety and they should understand. Or lie and say you’ve been having stomach issues and there are only certain foods your able to eat currently. Best of luck and I hope your friends are understanding and accommodating. Be careful drinking on just rice cakes also. And if your feeling up to it challenge yourself to try one thing that is being served there.,False,False
