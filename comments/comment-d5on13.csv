I was nauseous a lot, too, and so SO bloated and uncomfortable feeling. I also had constant diarrhea which was... possibly the worst part. Or no. The gas was worse. I was so farty. ):  I was tired a lot, too. Like food just took so much out of me I’d have to nap constantly. I felt weirdly weak? It was probably mental, though, since I had to stop working out so much so I was just obsessing over my muscles atrophying. Lol.   I broke out CONSTANTLY and it was very frustrating because I worked in make up/skincare at the time.   BUT once my body got readjusted to eating, everything just kind of faded and I was physically okay. No issues, except I still farted because that’s natural and blah blah blah. Mentally, obviously... that’s the hard fight.",False,False
