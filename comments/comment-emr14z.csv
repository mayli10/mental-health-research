This is the strategy: start by changing your point of view on food.  Seriously, it works wonders but it takes time. It probably took you years to get on those daily behaviours that are now suffocating you. Change is possible but it is a daily challenge that you will have to commit to.  Here are some examples on how to change the point of view I mentioned above so that you move to a different kind of life while keeping the weight you feel good about.   Example: You mentioned the problem of going to events like dinners or dates. Why not approach going out in a different way? Instead of thinking that you won't be able to calculate the calories, that all that is served is fattening and you will be better staying away from the entire event see it as an opportunity to get out of your head and your obsession by meeting other people or knowing more about them.  A family gathering? Sit beside someone you haven't seen in a while and ask about their life. Focus on engaging and knowing more about what is going on with their day to day, you can chat about hobbies or something you watched on tv and called your attention, whatever really. Engaging in conversations with others as the focus of the meeting will help you in feeling better as opposed to focusing on the eating and counting. Ok, you will eat a meal, that's what you do at gatherings but when you are focused on connecting with people, food is not a main event. Practice this. Your new rule? Get to know 3 facts of someone at the meeting that you didn't know about.  Another example: You mentioned hating yourself after eating a meal. Again, change your focus.  At least try to have 1 meal a day where your focus will be on how this meal will nourish your body.  You probably know more about healthy eating than the average person out there. Choose a meal with grains, vegetables, meat, etc, whatever combination you feel will be good to nourish your body. Make it visually appealing and good for you, not calorie count focused. (I particularly love very colorful salads because they are visually beautiful and I know that all those veggies and grains are good for me, every part of my being will thank me for the vitamins, minerals and energy I am bringing. Afterwards I feel light but energized for the next couple of hours and can concentrate on the work I have to do because I took care to have a balanced meal.) Serve yourself a meal that is good for your body and have it without distractions (phone, tv, web). Focus on the goodness that you are bringing to yourself, on how the nutrients will make you feel and on how you are doing good things for this person you are looking to become.  Takeaways:  -While on social gatherings focus on meeting people and knowing more about them.  -When having your meal focus on having what is good for your body and your soul.",False,False

I suggest you stop counting and logging calories. It’s ok to estimate so you don’t overeat, but I’ve learnt that if you eat normally – three balanced and sensibly portioned meals a day – and go about your daily activities – you won’t gain a million pounds. I think that’s what most of us are afraid of, like for me, I always think: if I don’t keep strict control for even a few days, my body will expand like crazy. But you know, that’s really not true!  It’s a big psychological barrier. Our brains like to exaggerate. You just have to keep reminding yourself that *you will not balloon* from eating normally.",False,False

Does it make you feel more confident? Get more dates? Have better relationships?  Do a pro/con list of getting better. On one side, put everything that you gain from how things are now and on the other, put what you think you would gain from normal eating. Which side is longer? Which side ""weighs"" more. Sometimes the side of get better had 100 things on there but the one item on the ED side feels more important. How do the things on the list compare with your values for yourself and for your life.  Things you can do now:  * Stop calorie counting. Go for a day and see what it's like (probably anxiety provoking - that's ok) * Ask a friend/support/dietician to tell you what to eat for a day. Eat it without making changes to it and see what it's like (hint: probably anxiety provoking, that's also ok) * Write out a list of all the mean things your ED says to you (or if you don't ascribe to the externalized ED - the negative ED thoughts) --&gt; now objectively look at them. Are they all 100% true? Like, based in fact, multiple people have told you similar things, true? * Identify little tweaks you can make. Maybe you're not ready to fully give up what you're doing, but are there small behaviors you could let go of? Ie, Maybe you weigh yourself daily, could you shift it to once/week? Could you try eating a scary food item once a day? * If you're dreading things you can't control, then you need to start pushing yourself out of your comfort zone on a regular basis to get used to the feeling (of not having control, not of dread). If you start feeling anxious about something, find a way to lean towards the anxiety, rather than push away from it. * Start noticing the stuff you like about life and yourself now, as it is. Do you 100% hate yourself? Is there a baby toe, or maybe a freckle that you find kind of endearing? Start there. ED: ""Ugh! I hate how I look!"" You: ""That may be so but my thumb nail is looking particularly nice today"". Thoughts are like habits. If you want a different batch of thoughts roaming your head you need to start practicing by intentionally thinking different thoughts.",False,False
