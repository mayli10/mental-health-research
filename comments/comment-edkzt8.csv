That’s a lot to be trying to process and deal with in such a sitting-centric society! I don’t think you have to give up on an office career though, if that’s the career you want.    One avenue could be therapy - taking a look at the thoughts and emotions surrounding low-activity. A secondary avenue could be to break up the day with a little activity during breaks/lunch, a standing desk, etc. Breaking up the sitting is healthy! I think it just can take some work to find a balance point where incorporating activity is a healthy thing rather than a maladaptive compensatory sort of thing. If that makes sense...   Good luck! I hope the internship turns out to be a positive experience.",False,False

I don't know how much that'd help but I know a few people who swear by them and it could help you feel less like you're just lazing around on a chair?,False,False

I just couldn’t be there. I felt like I had no control of my life. Due to sitting all day, I’d feel bloated and exhausted.   So I began to throw up 3-5 times a week to make up for all the calories of sitting there. Then I would work out like mad when I was out of there. 1 hour in the morning (running or HIIT), 1 hour of swimming in the evening and 1 hour of a walk.   So the thought of going through that again is anxiety provoking",False,True
