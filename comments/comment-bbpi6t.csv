Neither does 2 pieces of pie.   I feel like anything beyond one serving size is a binge and feel strong urges to purge :( so I know how you feel! But also remember that logically it’s our disorder that makes average amounts of food seem like unbearable amounts if the foods break certain rules/aren’t safe.   Sometimes it helps me to take a deep breath and try to view it objectively - NOT a total failure, most people struggle with portion control when it comes to foods they really enjoy. The exact thoughts you shared have caused me to have repetitive purge days but it’s not too late in the day to decide to try and view the situation a little differently and be more forgiving of yourself ❤️",False,False

Please try and be kinder to yourself, you’re doing so amazingly well!!",False,False

Please dont be too hard on yourself because you ARE doing well!   Dealing with this stuff is super difficult and the fact that you hadn't purged for a whole week really shows that you're SO fucking strong. This might have been a minor setback but tomorrow is a new day. Keep fighting, dont let this get to you. You got this!!! :)",False,False
