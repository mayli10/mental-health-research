I get what you mean about only being able to eat certain foods, that's literally me. I'm glad your phobia is under control and i hope you're doing better now.",False,True

I remember a few incidents that probably contributed to the fear.. most importantly, my dad has the same phobia and would always get extremely nervous whenever I felt sick as a small child. I also remember adults at daycare/preschool freaking out more than usual whenever someone would throw up. At some point it developed into an obsessive fear, so bad that by my early teens I could only eat certain foods, could not eat in public, could not eat more than a certain amount, etc. Then I got skinny and realized this was the magic cure everyone was always searching for. All you have to do is not eat!   The phobia is mostly under control now. I still panic when I feel sick, but I can eat in a restaurant now if I want to. I just obsess over my weight now instead.",False,False

I really do think people forget how impressionable and manipulatable children are, i mean they're/we're like sponges that absorb all the information around them/us and they/we internalise statements like 'just eat' 'why is it so hard?' 'you're not eating enough' 'you're skin and bone' so deeply. I get the enabling thing you mentioned as well, because people tried so hard to help me but were inadvertently giving into my unhealthy behaviour of eating the same thing or not eating at all to keep me happy, instead of addressing why i had these problems to begin with. I hope you're doing better now  and i wish you luck.",False,True

My mother was very stern/cold/depressed and anorexic. I think I equated food with comfort and started bingeing and hoarding food early (I remember someone telling me once, ""We're not going to take it away from you! Slow down!"" Both me and my sister grew up overweight while our skeletal mom subsisted on Coke and cigarettes with the occasional half-eaten egg.  I've always wondered if we were subconsciously trying to eat *for* her, but literally just now realized maybe my grandma enabled us to either spite or feed-by-proxy my mom.  Funny that both of them only bought us total crap to eat, all processed junk. Now I'm on the other side and reaching for UW myself.",False,False
