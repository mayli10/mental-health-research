I'm afraid that until I lose 40 lbs I'll never find love. But with being thin comes the ocd need to count. My life becomes entirely dictated by dieting. I know I need to lose weight for my health as I'm also afraid of getting diabetes and my cholesterol is already less than ideal (180). I beat myself up for being too lazy to stick to a healthy diet that would allow me to get thin again.,False,True

I do that as well, Iâ€™m overweight and when I purge and obsess I can lose weight at a steady pace but the second I get comfortable or take a weekend off I gain it all back plus some and have to start all over again. Itâ€™s like I canâ€™t just eat like a normal freaking person. Itâ€™s always need binge purge or binge and gain a ton of weight ðŸ˜µ",False,False
