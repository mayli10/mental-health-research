It tends to be overly optimistic and allow way more calories than you should be having. I use MFP with sedentary lifestyle to judge how many calories I should be eating to hit my goals. Any exercise I get I just consider a nice boost to speeding those goals up. Fitbit is great for monitoring heart rate, sleep, activity reminders, and steps, but I think of all that stuff relative to each other and track changes between them more than rely on a single point of data telling me what I should do",False,False
