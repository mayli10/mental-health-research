To resist the urge to binge, try upping your daily intake by 100 calories or so, and drink a BUTT TON of coffee. Seriously, just chug all the caffeine you can stomach + LaCroix, Diet coke, etc. Carbonated 0 cal drinks will become your friend. I know this is bad advice, but when I have the urge to binge, I stuff myself full of caffeine and carbonation until I feel sick- sick enough to not want to eat at all. But, in moderation, it should help you a bunch. Good luck, it sounds like your going through some rough times. ",False,False

After all, my main disorder will always be BED, so I'm sure this stuff will spontaneously go away sooner rather than later, and I'll just be stuck back at BED again, like I always am. Except that time, without Vyvanse, so I guess it's just best to wait this out for now. Silver lining is that it'll be easier to get the last 10 pounds off. It took forever to get the first 45ish off, so I'll take the extra help to get to -55 lbs so then I can be done with weight loss once and for all and focus on recovery through maintenance instead of recovery at a Caloric deficit because that shit is damn near impossible.
