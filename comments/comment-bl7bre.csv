This sounds like a ""line"" he read online or in some disgusting PUA manual that's supposed to make you want to prove yourself to him. But because he just used it on you with no reason, when you questioned him he didn't know what to say. I can't think of any other reason he'd be so brazen but not know how to respond.",False,False

I had a relative stranger (coworker who I've maybe worked 2-3 shifts with) tell me I seem like I have ""ugly duckling syndrome."" Basically that my demeanor is meek and therefore that must mean that I was an ""ugly duckling"" when I was younger and still carry myself that way. Though it's supposed to be a compliment because, well, you're not an ugly duckling *any more.* Gee, thanks.",False,False

My old workplace was full of dudes like this. I think maybe they just want a reaction. I've heard so many oddly specific comments about my looks - from my deepest insecurities to people somehow taking my best features and finding a way to turn it into a negative thing.
