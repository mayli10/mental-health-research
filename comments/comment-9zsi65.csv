It was her grandfather's, but even if she didn't have an explanation that's all she would have had to say - you can use everything except x, y, &amp; z. You don't have to be rude, just say hey, I know it's weird, but I'm really particular about my food and these three cups. If you don't mind not using them I'd really appreciate it.   I can't imagine eating my roommates food without asking her, I'd feel so rude! It's not unreasonable at all to ask her not to eat it! Don't feel like you have to explain everything about your ED unless you want her to know about it. ",False,False

She should have enough of her own dishes that she doesn't need yours. If she wants to borrow something she needs to ask first, and then return the items in good condition.
