Currently debating on ""not wanting to get better"" vs ""not wanting to ruin my relationship"". Like why can't I have both? But at the same time if my SO enabled my behavior that would be so unhealthy realistically. ",False,False

Never went to therapy and only made half-assed attempts at reducing/stopping purging because that's what everybody thinks you should, purging is bad for your health, ""not cool"", expensive, bad for the relationship... not surprisingly, it didn't work, because there's no true desire to stop, only logical reasons to it.   Bulimia might have become part of my identity, I might rely on it as a coping mechanism, just gotten used to it. Whatever the reason, it's here to stay.  Having had my share of pro ana communities in their heyday and real-life friendships developing out of them, my experience was that those friendships either fizzle out pretty quickly, turn toxic (pushing behaviors over the edge, or one decides to recover and goes nasty on the part that doesn't) or too demanding (because one part is obviously very, very sick in some way). I miss the blatant honesty of those online communities, though. Even this community, enforced by reddit's rules, but also self-enforced, suppresses a lot for the sake of ""not encouraging EDs"" or ""not triggering someone"". I'm not mad enough to deny the common sense behind it, but it also has w whiff of dishonesty. Suppressed does not mean gone, it simply means people don't talk anymore about their very low weights or extreme behaviors, or seek their meanspo/fatspo/bonespo/whateverspo elsewhere. ",False,False
