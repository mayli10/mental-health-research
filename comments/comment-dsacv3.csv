People with EDs do it to get past their obsessive weighing, but those in the FA movement have other motivations.",False,False

It's meanspo for me and likely something that contributed to the development of my ED. It's where I got the idea that if you ever eat for pleasure, you'll become obese. E.g. I can't have white rice because whole-grain is healthier and nobody NEEDS very tasty food. I know that's not what the sub believes in, but the message got warped and taken to the extreme in my brain. I also obsess over fatlogic's opinion on acceptable portion sizes, frequency of meals, etc.",False,False
