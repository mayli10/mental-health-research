There is some need for the body to get the rush of endorphins that accompany self harm or purging or restricting, but the other side of it is conditioning. There’s a saying that neurons that fire together like to continue to fire together. Basically, X happens and Y follows, and that neural pathway gets reinforced every time that pattern appears. The more reinforcement there is, the easier it becomes for your brain to follow that path automatically. Something bad happens, so you might cut. You eat something, so you purge. The mental illness drives these patterns and these patterns make it even harder to recover. Even after breaking the cycle of needing endorphins, that pathway will exist, and since it’s used so much and is so refined it’ll also be what your brain goes to first when these situations arise. That’s why even after forging new pathways and being in recovery or not self harming for years, relapse is so close by. Recovery literally requires using different neural pathways that don’t allow Y to follow X until they are stronger than the ed pathway and your brain starts to use those as second nature. That’s why recovery is a choice that you have to make constantly until it becomes the new norm.   Tldr: Having an ed isn’t a choice and recovery is hard because neural pathways ",False,False
