But I realized how good those 10 days purge free were, so I am now trying to be purge free forever. BUT I still have big issues with food and since I’m not compensating by purging, I am partaking in other harmful behaviors (restriction overexercising etc) i said it’s common to still restrict or be more heavily restricting while overcoming bulimia bc we still want to lose weight/control some aspect !! And recovery from bulimia doesn’t equate all disordered issues solved",False,False

I sense that there is a lot of association with love &amp; care that we are given from childhood to be associated with food (eg mom’s cooking= motherly love&amp;care). So in the moments when we need love &amp; care we reach for food as adults. And with restriction: when it feels that our entire life is spinning out of control — the only thing we can control is food — so we do that...,False,True

I had to sleep through pain of having too much food in my stomach and be very gentle with myself the next day — didn’t eat until 24h later and finally felt “empty stomach”...but I can see how this can push towards recovery... thank you for sharing. You don’t need to reply, but I want to ask this if you’re willing to share — have you relapsed since you found your body unable to purge? X",False,True
