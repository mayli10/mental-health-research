I also suffer from BPD which is probably why i got so upset with what she said and read too far into it when she was probably just trying to help me. Thank you and you don't need to apologise, wishing you the best.",False,True

Relapsing is almost always gonna happen in the process of recovery but it is more or less mind over matter when it comes to getting back on track. Although in this case, our minds work against us so idk. Best of luck though, and stay safe.",False,False
