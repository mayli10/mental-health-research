It isnâ€™t worth it to come back after 8 years... please see whatâ€™s at the bottom of this relapse and why that affected you so much after all that time so you can live an ED-free life as best you can. This is terrible to come back to and Iâ€™m definitely a hypocrite but please just talk to someone about it.  Lots of loveðŸ’•,False,False
