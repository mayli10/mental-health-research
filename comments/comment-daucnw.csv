If everyone is working on a farm then they need lots of food to keep them going. However as times have changed, peoples traditions haven't and because eating is 'nice' everyone still eats like they are spending all day outside",False,False

I've never heard of 200 minus your height in cms, but that kind of test would be even more utterly fucking insane. The 127 test would give me (for instance) a slightly less insane BMI of 13.8, versus the alleged 200 version's totally insane BMI of 12.8. (But again, those are both *extremely* dangerous BMIs.)",False,False

Food is comforting, a social thing, how you show love and effection. If you are sick with anything food is the answer. Before dinner (mostly at a family get together) a big setting of fruits, nuts, and tea are set out and it‚Äôs said that it opens your appetite for the actual meal you are about to eat. All the food has a large portion of rice or bread on the side. There is always dessert served, multiple types. You also always eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It‚Äôs rare to just have a cup of coffee and start your day. Also being vegetarian or vegan is very very rare. I‚Äôm veg and my family thinks it‚Äôs so weird. They think my health is at risk by not eating meat. But my mom and have complete opposite views on eating and it‚Äôs really weird for them to understand. My grandma gets excited to ‚Äúfatten me up‚Äù.   Every member of my family who lives there is over weight and no one is really concerned but in secret knows that there are consequences for their eating habits.",False,False

I won't lie, I think basically everyone around me is a little chunky but I truly don't care any further because the only person's body I care about is my own.
