You may have caused other users to refrain from posting and seeking support out of fear that their experiences will be nit-picked in other subs. You have violated the supportive nature of this subreddit in a way that shouldn’t need to be expressly prohibited in the sidebar because most people don’t need to be told that it’s shitty to post screenshots in other subs looking for validation of negatively-received comments. Congratulations! You highlighted a new and innovative way to covertly bully and abuse the sub’s members! Hopefully the mods see this and add to the rules of the subreddit moving forward as a result of your behavior.   &gt;	You also seem to have an issue with emotional regulation but I will refrain from continued personal insults and name calling  Ah, there we go. Right on schedule: make assertions about my character that might undermine my position. That’s ok. You can call me whatever names you like, because the facts don’t need me to be emotionally regulated. That’s the great thing about reality: it is real no matter who points it out to you.",False,False

This comment is a record of the above post as it was originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited. Redacted screen grab Op posted in an eating disorder sub about a rude bank teller commenting on her ""pregnancy"" when OP was not pregnant. Her post is an emotional, profanity and violence laced mess. All other comments echo the same profanity and violence. As someone who has struggled with eating disorders, trauma and toxic family most of my life, I empathize with her situation. However I seem to have more tools in my toolbox than this person appears to have. Years of therapy and more specifically the DBT concept of rational/wise/emotional mind has saved my life. I refrained from vulgar language and encouraging violence. And (I thought) defended well my intentions. What's your opinion? I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please contact the moderators of this subreddit if you have any questions or concerns.  This person is harassing OP and should be banned imo. Offering up hollow platitudes is unwelcome enough on a post CLEARY looking for commiseration and for a space to vent after an understandably hurtful interaction.

Because those make ANYONE look pregnant, even if their tummies are concave. In fact I know some people who literally associate certain cuts with pregnancy to the point where they think anyone wearing it HAS to be pregnant. Like it's maternity wear they hand you with the pee stick or something. It may not have had anything to do with how your body looked and everything to do with an association they can't break from.  Also, if you are worried about having a tummy, even if you've been losing the weight for a while if you're still at a deficit (trying to lose the last 10) your weight might still be fluctuating enough that your body recomp hasn't happened yet. So when you do hit your GW and maintain more consistently, your weight will redistribute. It's like how we lose weight from our limbs first because they're not as important to our body's survival as say, our organs, so you get skinny wrists when you start losing, but you don't walk around with disproportionately skinny wrists for the rest of your life.",False,False
