I have no problem with him watching porn and using social media. They're perfectly acceptable things to do. It's my issues and insecurites that are unreasonable so I'm the one that needs to adjust.,False,False

I really understand your concern and appreciate it, sometimes people outside the relationship can see red flags so much clearer, but I swear we're fine :) I just shared my story anedoctally",False,False

I have absolutely nothing to do with my husband's social media, even his public posts. I've accidentally stumbled across his porn on our shared PC before and alt-F4'd with my eyes away from the monitor in a panic. I know whatever I see will fuck me up so staying ignorant is better for both of us.",False,False

I 100% trust he’d never cheat on me nor want to but somehow this situation felt like cheating. if it were a porn star, I’d be gucci. I follow male celebrities (and, as a bisexual, female ones &amp; tons of female  and I completely understand the difference btw visual stimulation/pleasantness &amp; appreciating that and the fact I don’t fantasize abt or want to have sex w anyone but him like he is with me. and the whole snapchat thing - she never posts at all. and he knows how much the other snapchat stuff hurt me. he was having doubts about us during the period of time like 3 months into dating that I realized he had been watching these girls’ stories. but I eventually got to a place where I understood it and could even categorize some of what I do as that...but it’s how it went down (lying across multiple conversations that bothered me). but it’s not like I haven’t had doubts like I am rn lol but this specific instagram thing seems so much more personal and he himself doesn’t know why he was doing it so I’m just concerned that he’s not analyzing his behavior and secretly is not actually committed to us without being aware of it. I mean far and away his habit of lying is the #1 thing that hurts me. I’d honestly be able to get over small things like this - I know that it’s possible to have a slight crush on someone while in love with someone you’re dating exclusively. I actually am facing that right now. but it’s the weird instinctual lying and lack of transparency that is fucking w me the most. he could stalk a porn star’s insta in my face &amp; I’d not bat an eye if he would just do it in front of me. but him lying/hiding it, and especially the fact it’s a girl that actually goes to our school, makes it leave a bad knot in my stomach, yanno? does that make sense or do you think I’m crazy :/",False,True

It's like they're hooked on visual stimulation - which kind of makes sense to me, with porn being readily available and all. For the sake of my mental health, I just let it go. When he picks up his phone to scroll through social media, I shift my position so I can't watch his screen even if I want to",False,False
