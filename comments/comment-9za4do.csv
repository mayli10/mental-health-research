It's going to be a weird Thanksgiving anyway - the first one after the grandparents passed away - so everything is going to be morbid and tense enough without me making everyone aware that I'm privately freaking out the whole time, too.  On the other hand, I could maybe present it as ""I wasn't sure if anybody remembered to get the whipped cream, so I stopped on the way to pick some up!"" And since my FIL is diabetic, and my safe whipped cream is sugar-free..... yep, there's the solution. That's what I'll do.  Okay, that helps. That helps a lot. ",False,True

I hate when Iâ€™m tempted to kind of game the system that way. Like, if itâ€™s the buttermilk pie (which Iâ€™ve never heard of btw! going to look that up), you can sort of resign yourself and aim for portion control if anything. But if you *know* your safe whipped cream is just as good - if not better - than their high-cal whipped cream, itâ€™s so existentially excruciating...   I might just bring my safe whipped cream as if itâ€™s some newfangled amazingness and offer it to everyone else too lol. It depends on how aware they are of your ED, of course. If theyâ€™re not, you could pass it off as an alternative version or another contribution to dessert. If they do know, maybe they can be chill about you having your preferences, since you are still having the dessert with them?  idk, best of luck and i hope itâ€™s delish ðŸ§¡",False,False
