He is the one who is NOT ENOUGH for you. You deserve a kind and a loving man, not a dude who lets you fall asleep while crying. I know it may be hard, but I would seriously reconsider this relationship.  Putting your problem in a different light: would YOU allow your boyfriend to fall asleep while crying? Don't waste your time with people who are not worth it, who bring you down or who don't support you. His behaviour was horrible, and I'm so sorry that you had to go through that.",False,False

Like maybe this is why I'm not eating because I don't feel like I'm good enough. I should be thinner, maybe then he'll care more... I'm sorry you feel this way but I'm hoping that one day we can find true happiness in this crazy world",False,False
