Hes gotten better but tbh before i think it was just that he was such a navie, insensitive, airhead. Very self absorbed and wasnt aware of anything with himself or others.  Maybe hes just trying to be supportive and doesnt realize this type could actually be harmful.   Maybe try to get more in depth with him? Over time my bf has gotten more aware of what hes saying to me could end up different than just any regular dieter. ",False,False

I might be wrong but I think he is trying to help you reach ""success"" (as he sees you striving for weightloss? IDK) if that makes sense? Like you say, some of the gravity of things isn't ""registering"" and he is encouraging/putting a spotlight on  behaviours that you feel anxious about  Anyway- if anything that he is saying is bugging you or feeling unhealthy, please try to talk to him more specifically about what might help you vs stress you/hurt you",False,False

Thank you for your concern though! I have found another job, I lost my old one in June. I went back to work at a coffee shop I worked at in college. Thankfully I'm sick of all the food there.",False,True

I'm so so sorry you don't have someone to confide in about this but that still cares about your mental health. It sounds like he is prioritizing what he wants to see over your health (mental and physical). It honestly doesn't sound healthy but it sounds like you are very deep into a relationship.  Have you been able to get another job?  ",False,False
