Your mental and physical health come first, doesnâ€™t matter what you think he deserves. I know you love him so itâ€™s futile to try to convince you that the first statement isnâ€™t true. Just please, try to consider your own well-being first, as hard as it is.   The weight will come off regardless. Try to be gentle with your body",False,False

But seriously, I know starving isnt healthy but I'm so used to it giving me results, its the thing that got me down 20kg in weight like a year ago. I'm also a very impatient person so I fear I'd lose motivation due to slow results.",False,True

Donâ€™t restrict like crazy just because a guy canâ€™t get his dick hard looking at you, thatâ€™s entirely counterproductive to losing weight for your health. And your health comes first, I understand you care about him and having your partner tell you they arenâ€™t aroused by your body is horrible for your mental state, but that doesnâ€™t mean you have to restrict. It might take longer, but itâ€™s better than the alternative. Ultimately youâ€™ll be the one who makes that choice, but donâ€™t let what he said shame you into starving yourself, because you deserve better than that.",False,False
