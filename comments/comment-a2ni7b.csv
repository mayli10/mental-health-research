Youtuber Mike Thurston had his body fat tested. He got the exact same number on his DXA as I did a couple weeks ago (15.4%) and yet he looks absolutely shredded while I look like a skinny-fat deflated balloon. It's because he physically has more muscle mass than I do. Muscle mass is the biggest determinant of aesthetics. One of the biggest encouragements for me during my ED recovery has been seeing how gaining weight (probably 25+ pounds at this point, dunno, haven't weighed myself in a while) has massively improved my looks because the muscle gain way ""outweighs"" the fat gain in terms of contribution to your aesthetics.  &amp;#x200B;  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-qbNmR8cLQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-qbNmR8cLQ)  &amp;#x200B;  I recently moved to a push-pull split. I rarely directly train legs because I do spinning 3x a week usually.  &amp;#x200B;  My push workouts hit:  * chest (pecs) * shoulders, heavy emphasis on the front delts (OHP, incline/flat bench press with dumbbells, etc) * side delts * triceps  My pull workouts involve a lot of different rows and hit:  * lats (assisted pull-ups are my biggest focus. Wide grip and thumbs behind the bar help decrease bicep involvement for me) * traps * rear delts * biceps  Some muscle groups I find can handle a butt-ton of volume like chest. I do pushups at least every other day and am working on bringing the total up. I did 80 split into 2 sets of 2 yesterday. I train abs using knee raises and the ab crunch machine every session and increase/decrease the number of sets according to how recovered I feel (varies from 4-8 sets). I do dumbbell shrugs with heavy weights (60-70 lb dumbbells currently), not just to hit the upper traps but also to increase my grip strength. Very useful. I do facepulls every session as well to help strengthen my back and correct postural issues.  &amp;#x200B;  There's miscellaneous accessory work I do from time to time when I feel like I need it. Russian twists, planks, glute bridges, miscellaneous lighter weight squats and deadlifts (which are useful for stretching out my ridiculously tight hamstrings more than anything else) using dumbbells.  &amp;#x200B;  I avoid heavy compound movements (don't do the big three, squat, deadlift, bench press at all) and supersetting high intensity movements. In my experience going high intensity during my bodybuilding routine completely ruins my spinning because your CNS can only handle so much stress, and recovery is variable given the nature of the intermittent calorie restriction all of us deal with.  &amp;#x200B;  As far as definition goes, I can't point to any particular exercise group as being more beneficial but I can say that hands down I look the most aesthetic after a heavy push day where I also go heavy on abs, nature of the pump I get from that workout. The shoulder/chest workouts pull my loose skin up and away and the ab/core work gives my midsection definition.  &amp;#x200B;  Also, can't recommend enough supplementing with creatine and citrulline malate. Citrulline malate in particular is amazing for muscular recovery. Long as I take that stuff before spin class I seem to recover in literally 2/3rds of the time.  &amp;#x200B;  Nutrition is important, anyone who does lifting can tell you. Start supplementing with whey shakes, and eat as much protein as humanly possible. Whey is very well studied, there is overwhelming evidence that people who consume whey have more muscle and less fat than people taking in plant-based protein and other protein sources. There is even evidence that it increases fat burning through unknown mechanisms. Just toss it on top of your existing diet, 1-2 a day and try not to worry about calories because it's impossible for your body to store protein as fat anyway.",False,False
