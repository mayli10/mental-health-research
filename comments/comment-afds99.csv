I ate more than I intended to because I've been really stressed lately and I caved but I ended up trying to purge afterwards because I just really wasn't in the mood for having food in my stomach. And I fucked my throat up a bit because it still kind of hurts now even though I was mainly just dry heaving. It's literally like I basically just got all the cons of the situation because nothing even came up last night. Kill me. ,False,False

I ate a big dinner when I was out with friends then came home and ate an entire bag of peppermint bark popcorn from trader Joel’s and the only thing stopping a trip to the bathroom is that my family has heard me purge several times this month and “I’m sick” isn’t cutting it anymore. ,False,False
