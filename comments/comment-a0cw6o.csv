I try to tell them it's okay (because it is!) but obviously they don't stop feeling insecure.   The one advantage I've found with having a huge bum is that I can get comfortable anywhere. ,False,True

I mean bless him for thinking it was a compliment but damn if I didn’t feel like a whale...,False,False

Especially the birth control as an incentive not to purge.  Over thanksgiving my little baby cousin asked me “why are you so skinny” and I nearly tossed him in the air I was so happy lol. Even better all my old aunts thought it was so funny that he was giving such honest assessments of everyone, and kept repeating what label he had given each member of the family (mine, skinny, was the only positive :’D)",False,False

I just told her that ""one day you could have a big bum when you're older"" and when she wouldn't stop looking at it ""it's rude to stare at people's bums!""
