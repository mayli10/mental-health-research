I know all of this is hard on him, and I don’t want to minimize what he’s going through. I just wish he was better about vocalizing it without the guilt trip. He’s supposed to come to therapy with me next week so hopefully my therapist is able to get through to him in ways that I can’t",False,True

If he went into this marriage with that as a deal breaker, IMO it should theoretically be annulled as he lied under oath. You are not a burden. He is guilting you for your illness. That’s one of the shittiest things to do. Imagine you had any other illness, cancer for example. How shitty does he sound now? Men are statistically more likely to abandon a sick spouse than women are anyway. I’m sorry. You do not deserve to be blamed for being sick.",False,False
