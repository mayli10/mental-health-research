It has left me infertile. It has put a HUGE strain on my marriage. I've made more friends in treatment that have died from their eating disorders and attended way more funerals for than I ever thought I would.  I always thought this was just something I'd struggle with when I was younger but this POS disorder just keeps trying to come back and now I'm in my late 30s, fighting this same damn fight. I try to focus on that anger to motivate me but ED is such a seductive little SOB.",False,False

The only thing I've lost is weight, which is why it's so hard to give up, because I didn't lose anything else to it. I had no friends to lose. I had no future prospects or goals it took away from me. In fact, losing weight gave me purpose and something to do, something to focus on. Something I could be good at. Sorry it's different for you.",False,False

It is all hell for a while but it is worth it.  There’s no mystery, no solution that will fix everything. Tbh, it’s a bout hating to gain weight but doing it anyway and eventually you will get used to it till one day, you would never want to go back. I spent years in inpatient care, therapy, hospitals and nothing made me WANT to eat. Something shitty happened along the way and I decided I didn’t want to be told what to do anymore, I didn’t want to be pitied anymore and I didn’t want to be ashamed of myself. Most importantly, I didn’t want to be vulnerable anymore and I knew as long as I was sick, I was putting myself in the firing line for all of that and more. That’s not to say I didn’t once give two shits whether I died, as long as I left a light coffin. But once out of that headspace, I wanted to be free of the sickness that made me a target. And now, I will never. Ever. Go back. I’m telling you all of this, not because I need to tell my story but because you are on the cusp of a whole new, full life. I desperately want  you to have it. The only way is to eat. Then watch things slowly change. It will take years but you will see progress all along. Please. How about even trying it for a few years, really going for it, maintaining a target weight and seeing how you feel. You can always go back to it. You can pack in the job and relationship and just give in. But try it for a while first.",False,False
