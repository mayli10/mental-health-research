I think you can find some for around 100cal per 500ml.  I shouldn't think they would stop your medication if you're responding well to it, but rather help you cope with the side effect. Unless it was doing more harm than good due to the relapse, then maybe. But it's down to when, if at all, you bring up how it's helped one problem but caused another to resurface.  I hope you can find something that helps improve your symptoms.",False,False

Can you (or anyone!) recommend an electrolyte powder or cal free drink that’s good enough on these?   My primary knows about my “past” ED, she doesn’t know how active it is. The cardiologist did not know about that. My psychiatrist theoretically knows about my ED but we have never directly spoken about it. He prescribed me a medication for ADHD that I really need for my cognition and don’t want him to take away (it’s also an appetite suppressant and is involved in my relapse). To top it off I’ve just moved, still intend to see my primary but they are in another city and I won’t have the ability to take a health day for a while. Idk I know I’m a mess.   I DO have indigestion now though so I’m hoping that’s all it is. I really hate this crap and I REALLY hate that I’m still having a hard time eating even w this stuff going on. :/ thank you for your reply",False,True

It could be anything, though with restricting, I'd say an electrolyte imbalance would be the likely culprit. You'd need blood tests done to figure that out. Any chest pain should warrant getting checked out thought.  I've been getting chest pain for the past 3 years, which is more apparent when I'm restricting, and I've only been underweight for a month of that.  I'm currently a healthy bmi and I'm getting the pains right now, on the left side too. Try and incorporate sports drinks into your day if you can to replenish lost electrolytes. All play an important role, but magnesium and potassium can effect the heart if they're low. And get it checked out again. Something may have changed since you had those tests.",False,False
