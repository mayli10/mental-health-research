I was finally ""rewarded"" with a shower and a wheelchair ride (wtf) for good behavior. The nurses were horrible and power-hungry, and they insisted on getting a doctor's permission just so that I could stand up and brush my teeth. The whole thing just seemed excessive.",False,False

Oh, and crying while eating peas, again, in front of the nutritionist. That poor nutritionist tbh. I took a lot of my angst out on her. I'm ashamed of so many memories of being inpatient, I look back and see an irrational, unreasonable brat sometimes. I know I wasn't in my right mind (and even now), but I still cringe.  Just to balance it out, I liked that they let me drink water with crushed ice. That is seriously my fondest memory of my treatment time. Chewing that damn ice.",False,False
