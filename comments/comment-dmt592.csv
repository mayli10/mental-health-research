It made contentment easier and I found joy in little things like going for walks and seeing flowers, or getting a dopamine flush from listening to a nice song. I got off of it because the anxiety was unbearable. I felt like I was a stretched out spring that was about to snap, and I thought everyone was really mad or annoyed by my existence (also was impulsive and suicidal). I got angry easily too.   I'm in buspirone now, which is for anxiety. The buspirone originally helped with the anxiety caused by Wellbutrin, and you might like that combination. I didn't.   After getting off Wellbutrin, the depression is still kind of there but I'm in DBT and I think some of my depression is low self-esteem from years of invalidation and abuse, so i suspect I might be able to correct most of it without medicine. My motivation has tanked since getting off of it, but I'm working in that with vitamins (methyl-B12, methyl folate, vitamin D+K), sleep, light box first thing in the morning, mild exercise, etc. All that stuff sounds scammy/fake, but it really has helped  in my case.      Anyway, I mention all of the above because if you can't be on Wellbutrin, you still might be able to ""soften"" the depression with other stuff. I know we all have different causes/neurochemistry so it might not help for everyone though.",False,False
