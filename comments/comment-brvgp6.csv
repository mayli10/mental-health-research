I think you were trying to justify yourself when there's no need.  &amp;#x200B;  I HATED this guy on the bus a few months ago for scoffing his MacDonalds.  It wasn't the fact he was eating, HE PUT THE GREASY BAG ON THE SEAT NEXT TO HIM.  &amp;#x200B;  I stuff my face when I'm eating.  I'm not an anorexic who cuts her food into tiny pieces and takes forever.  Starvation brings out primal eating style.",False,False

And mcdonalds fries sound good right now (even tho I just b/p)   Enjoy them!!! Try not to feel guilty, like you pointed out, you had lots of reasons to eat em!!",False,False
