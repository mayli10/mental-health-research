Also I can totally relate to your post, I used to have major panic attacks when my boyfriend offered to cook us dinner. I couldn’t stand to be in the kitchen with him while he was cooking because I would tear up at the sight of oil or whenever he added an ungodly amount of cheese, but I’ve since gotten so much better. I felt guilty not appreciating my boyfriend’s food when I know he loves cooking for me, so once a week he makes dinner now and I usually just make it my OMAD :)  ",False,False
