But this is good practice for next time. Maybe next time youâ€™ll be able to go a full day and sit with the fact that the weight fluctuation is normal and that you are still underweight. Either way itâ€™s okay. Just donâ€™t be discouraged to try again. ,False,False

So much so that I often fit it in to my &lt;500 calorie daily limit. Yesterday I had lots of good things. I had salmon in watercress sauce with boiled new potatoes, broccoli, and green beans for breakfast. I had the same thing for lunch. I love salmon and I love broccoli. For dinner I had dried seaweed, some cucumber, baked beans, and a bag of chocolate popcorn. My dinner is normally what I'd have for the whole day, so the salmon and veg at breakfast and lunch were the real new additions. That all took me to exactly 1,000 calories. It felt weird to eat lots but to not be binging. I'm going back to 500 calories now because I've put on a pound and freaked myself out, but I still feel like I achieved something quite big yesterday. I will consider yesterday just dipping my toes into the world of high calorie restriction. Hopefully it won't be my last attempt to do this. ",False,True

You're absolutely right that when upping your calories you should do so _gradually_. I have learned that today. The extra 500 cals has caused me to gain 1lb and push me out of my safe-weight zone, which is massively stressful. I know I'm still underweight but I need this 1lb off me so I'm reverting back to &lt;500 cals until it is. Then I will try upping my calories again. ",False,True

I thought 1,000 calories would be enough to shut down all hunger and cravings but the background cravings for things like chocolate biscuits (which I did _not_ incorporate into my 1,000) were still as strong. I'm pretty good at ignoring those cravings most of the time so it's no big deal, but it's interesting that they didn't go away. I didn't experience less hunger either, but I think that's because I don't really experience hunger even at 500 calories, if I'm honest. That's what makes restriction so easy for me: I have no hunger cues. It also sadly makes binging easy: I have no fullness cues (before pain and the desire to throw up). I have gained exactly a pound, and I wish I could not worry about it, but here I am worrying about it. I'm going back to 500 until this pound is gone. I do wonder if I'll feel better in ballet class today because of yesterday's extra calories.  ",False,True

And I always do the the first-thing-naked weigh. I put on 1lb. I know it must just be bloating and that I shouldn't gain on 1,000 calories, and if I was still in my safe-weight zone I think I could deal with the 1lb gain, but this 1lb knocks me out of the safe zone, although I am still underweight (luckily? thankfully? I dunno). I can't face eating 1,000 calories again today, knowing my weight might go up another 1lb or might stay at this unsafe weight. Back to 500 for me. But I hope my body makes good use of the extra nutrients it got yesterday!  I'm going to try upping my calories again at some point in the future.",False,True

I am only 1lb heavier this morning, but that takes me out of my safe-weight zone (although I'm still underweight). I'm afraid it's back to hard &lt;500 cal restriction for me. I cannot stand to be at this weight. Which is funny/terrifying because it's literally been my UGW for years. At least yesterday's extra cals might give me more energy in ballet class today. I feel like I've failed you all. Sorry. This absolutely won't be my last attempt to up my calories. ",False,True

When I first started upping my calories avocado became my best friend. Itâ€™s so easy to add to salads (which are a safe food) and itâ€™s high in calories. I found adding it to a lunch and dinner salad was really helpful in adding calories without much volume (as my stomach felt so sore and stretched initially - but it does go away). Hopefully you can find a similar food that is helpful for you :) ,False,False

Like everyone said the scale will go up because food weight and water retention. If you can help, i would have someone hide your scale so you donâ€™t get discouraged and fall back into heavy restriction. Your clothes might feel tight during meals as well but I promise you itâ€™ll just be from the bloating. If you are eating at a deficit you wonâ€™t be gaining any sort of fat. Iâ€™m glad you know you are going to be full but it will probably be very uncomfortable at first! You might wanna go a little slower or increase your calories but consuming protein shakes at first so you get comfortable with the feeling again. If it becomes to overwhelming, try doing some yoga or taking a walk after your meals to aid with the digestion. Good luck!!! You got this ðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œ",False,False

Hold back on weighing yourself for as long as you can if it's a trigger for restriction, because the food/water weight you'll have initially will *not* be actual weight but your ED might not let you acknowledge that.   If you're unable to not weigh yourself (it's compulsive for me), something that helped personally was drinking a LOT and trying to hold back until weighing after I'd eaten. For me that made me feel that my weight wasn't trustworthy/real anyway so I could ignore the number better. I still satisfied the itch to step on the scale but it wasn't *as* harmful. These might not work for you. When I had access to a scale I was always the type that weighed before eating, after the loo, naked, etc. That was my Real Weight and I could more or less disregard any other, so I just didn't let myself see my Real Weight while still scratching that need to weigh myself.  You're still going to be losing weight, I promise. Well done for taking this step.",False,False
