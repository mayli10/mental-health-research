I know Christmas dinner and Thanksgiving is a really awful time for loads of people with EDs and it's impressive and heart warming to know you enjoyed it!    I'm going to try nut roast this year.  Nuts are my biggest food phobia but my old favourite.  I'm going to eat it.  It's only a damn nut roast after all.  I'll enjoy it and hopefully be buzzing afterwards (on coffee or natural high, lol).  Your post gave me even more ammunition so thanks for that!  I hope you can carry on having these victories.  Merry Christmas   X  &amp;#x200B;",False,False
