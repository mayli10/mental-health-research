ecxmsds,t3_ab2uxd,t3_ab2uxd,snefferu,1,2018-12-31 02:20:39,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/ab2uxd/new_years/ecxmsds/,"Nope my resolution is to continue a steady gain, my new target is 45 by end of January and ultimate target is 46 by end of feb. Actually my ultimate target is to not freak out and be cool with the higher weight lol.  Do you mean stop eating completely or is that hyperbole?   Complete fasting, besides being unhealthy/dangerous is not sustainable and could lead to bingeing, rebound gain and lowered metabolism etc...  If you want to be more successful with weight loss you should set small goals and have a max deficit of -250 day ;)",False,False
