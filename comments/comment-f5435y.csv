BMIs work different depending on height and if you’re something like 5’0 or 5’2 your maintenance intake will be 1200-1500. That’s mine. And it’s god awful because you can’t eat ‘normally’ or you gain weight like crazy. Unless you’re working out regularly then that changes. You didn’t mention their height, so it’s possible their doc has a good reason to be worried but it’s also possible the doc isn’t paying attention or is biased. Doctors are people, people make mistakes and these things happen often. I have to remind my doc of so many things every time I come in that tbh I wouldn’t trust them in a critical situation because they have so many patients, they can’t even remember what meds they gave me. I’m not trying to be aggressive, I’m saying that it’s good to be cautious and keep in mind that doctors aren’t perfect and can say super insensitive stuff, make mistakes, or sometimes aren’t actually qualified to deal with your particular situation even if they have a license or a specialization. And tbh i’ve had times where i was on the height normal bmi range and was told by a doctor to lose weight. Stuff like this and worse happens to good people who don’t deserve it. You seemed pretty upset in your post, and the way I interpreted the situation was that you were being slighted and whoever you’re seeing needs to account for your mental health when they speak to you, and really look at things like your tdee and bmi before brushing you off for eating 1200-1500.",False,False

The thing is I’m not able to eat properly and ofc my acids gets worse due to empty stomach, I don’t know how to deal with that, I was recommended to eat rice, potato, and stuff like that that usually are groups of fear foods for me so I’m eating even less that when I restrict and my mind is a mess, and I feel awful from the gastritis and don’t really know how to do this",False,True

There’s no single doctor on earth that will tell a normal BMI person to lose weight, so yeah, I don’t wanna be a bitch but your comment is kinda aggressive and out of place. I’m asking how to deal with my fcking ed while trying to recover from an illness that involves eating groups of fear food for me and amount of foods (that my body needs to not produce more acides because of empty stomach) that my ed doesn’t allow me.",False,True

In my case I had to take antibiotics to kill the bacteria in order for the sores to start closing up. The antibiotics usually have to be taken with meals (I suggest an egg if it’s a bad day bc eggs have the lipids necessary to help digest the antibiotics) but I promise it is worth being able to breath or turn your head without being in severe pain.",False,False
