When I was in my teens and early 20s, a lot of people I knew hadn’t even been aware I’d been sick (even though my LW was quite extreme) much less they noticed that I looked normal 😏 people have their own problems, and young people are so busy with studying, partying, dating, having fun etc that you can get away with gaining 20kg and they won’t bat an eyelid 😉",False,False

They didn't really comment on my weight specifically but they did mention not recognizing me, that I should exercise (I gained a lot of weight)",False,False
