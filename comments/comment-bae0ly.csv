No matter how hungry I am, I will fully shower and put on clean clothes before eating.  Before cooking even.  On nights I work late, it can mean dinner is at 10 pm.",False,False

I also relate to the small-cutlery, small-bowl/plate thing  I dislike eating a mixed meal, I’d rather have just one thing, but if it is a mixed meal I’ll eat all of thing A, then all of thing B, and so on ",False,False

I need to feel completely empty to feel the food and only the food inside. I also have to have my nose clean at all time, I'm always blowing my nose empty just in fear of it getting full.

There's an order in my head in which things have to be consumed, and it stresses me out not to follow it. I start with any liquids, followed by vegetables, then fruits, then grains, then proteins. The exception is if any of the above has added fat--then, it has to go last. I don't know exactly when this started, but I think the rituals give me something intense to focus on during the meal so I'm less anxious.",False,False

If this were my list i would add these things: - using the smallest plate/bowl as well as smallest possible cutlery  - everything in the right place on the plate/bowl. I have a meal that i eat that is soggy weetbix and yogurt (sounds yuck but trust me, its good). The weetbix has to be squished(?) Up against the side of the bowl so its kind of like a ""block"" and has to take up about half the bowl. I then fill the other half with yogurt. Weird.  - have to be doing something while eating. Wether it be watching youtube or scrolling through reddit  - to piggyback off the last one, i have this list of foods i call ""picking foods"" and ""video foods"". Ok let me explain. Some foods take 2 hands to eat because i always lay in bed and eat (another weird ritual). These foods are called ""video foods"" because i always have to watch a video while eating them because i can't scroll through reddit or something because i don't have a free hand. The other type of food is ""picking food"" which is essentially the opposite, i eat them while scrolling through something on the internet because i only need 1 hand to eat it.",False,False

I always switch for a teaspoon at home when I'm eating soup etc. I also eat basic donuts or stuff like that with a fork tiny piece at a time while drinking water or tea after every bite. I also eat sweets in really small pieces, I might be eating like 5 pieces of chocolate but I bite small pieces off them (usually like third then half of that half of that etc.) Aand end up spending like an hour just doing that. Also when I'm eating snacks like nuts or dried fruit I either eat one piece at a time or one piece of fruit and one nut in one go, then drink water to flush it down. And I don't know if this is really an eating habit but when I'm cooking and have to taste the food I spit it out immediately after (or just get someone else to try it if possible).",False,False
