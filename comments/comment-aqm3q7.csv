I think that’s why a lot of people don’t like body positivity, because it says that their smaller bodies are worse (less “cute” with less “flavor”).",False,True

I think everyone on Reddit who is big mad about HAES is just pissed seeing overweight people be openly confident and engaging in healthy activities, contradicting their belief that if someone is overweight that makes them a lazy slob. The first step to breaking out of BED especially and getting active again is realizing that you are worth the effort it takes to take care of your body. Coming from someone who used to be obese and is now on the low end of healthy. They’re just mad that many of the moderate HAES supporters don’t fit the stereotypes they use to shame them.

The phrase ""health at every size"" is honestly just really ambiguous, so I feel like people interpret it as just an excuse for overweight people to ignore their health. Which personally I think is kind of fucked on it's own that people would get so worked up over someone else's ""health"". Like I know that's not what HAES is actually about and I'm digressing here but it's almost as if the Reddit-wide hatred of HAES is...just another expression of our societal hatred of fat people...",False,False

No one gets healthy from being ashamed of their body. Being ashamed might make someone lose weight, but as we all know, losing weight doesn't always mean healthy or happy or that you've made any *sustainable* changes. What makes people healthy (long-term) is loving their body enough to take care of it and do things that make it feel good.",False,True

It's *health* at every size, meaning do things that improve your health despite your starting weight.

Like yeah there's the crazy people. But HAES also encouraged me to go to the gym when I was overweight, and to start yoga even though I thought I was too fat. I think for BED people especially, it's encouraging to think life doesn't stop because you're fat, that your worth doesn't diminish. Like you can quote all the crazy people you want, but it's not for them. It's for the people who are just trying to have confidence to go out in their skin. Idk. It's beautiful to see someone confident. I loved seeing the little fatties on Tumblr get all dressed up and post themselves. It's part of what got me into fashion.   Idk. There's good parts of it HAES. Reddit is just a circle jerk. Get in line or get downvoted. ",False,False

There also just isn't really good science to say someone can be healthy at *any* size, which is the message that often gets spread about HAES.   I also think especially in the ED community you have to understand that gaining weight above a restored weight can be legitimately terrifying to people and the idea that a dietcian might even let us get overweight is inconvieable and potentially triggering to those in the beginnings of recovery.

My mom is an RD and even though she preaches about HAES, she also started putting me on diets around age 9 or 10 and her constant hounding for me to be ""healthy"" (aka thin) is a huge factor in my ED.
