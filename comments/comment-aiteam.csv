I can sit down and guesstimate the calories on a plate super fast so I have to stop the thought process actively at all times.,False,False

And it definitely becomes all consuming I swear. I’m trying not to calorie count. It’s a little hard to stop even without MFP because I memorised a lot of foods calorie contents and it feels like whenever I sit down to eat my brain shoves it into my mind anyway. It’s not fun. :( But I’m working on it. ,False,True

MFP was consuming my life and helped develop my ED into the monster it became. I was easily spending 4+ hours a day on that app alone at one point, exporting data, analyzing it vs my weight and trying to see data trends over time. I need way more calories than MFP's BS estimates, plus I was obsessed with not going over my calorie goal, so I basically kept myself metabolically restricted/adapted for the better part of a year.  &amp;#x200B;  Try to resist the urge to do any kind of calorie counting. Even though I stopped with MFP, I never really completely stopped calorie tracking and I still struggle with it. It's not something anyone with a healthy diet and lifestyle needs to do.",False,False

I know recovery is going to be tough. I don’t know if I’ll ever like the way I look. But I want to be able to eat. I want to live. So I’m trying my best. :),False,True

I was initially pretty terrified of intuitive eating but I’m trying my best to follow and understand them.   And that’s really smart! I tend to repeat things in my head for positive affirmation (as I struggle with intrusive thoughts and anxiety as well as an ED) so it’d be interesting to write them down also! Thanks for the advice.   Again thank you! :) ,False,True

It’s hard, it’ll be really hard at first, just listening to your hunger cues, because you might be much hungrier than you expect. But for the sake of recovery, follow them! Follow the hunger cues into recovery!  A tip i’d give is to write down your reasons for recovery. When the ED gets loud, it’ll be useful to remember why you’re pursuing recovery.  Best of luck!! :) &lt;3",False,False
