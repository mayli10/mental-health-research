Sorry you’re faced with that extra stressor when things are plenty stressful already! My policy at this point is to never pay an unexpected medical bill until I’ve talked to the provider’s office and/or my insurance company. I kid you not - tens of thousands of dollars in bills have gone away by making some phone calls and asking ‘why dis bill?’. When something goes awry with a claim (and there’s so many things that can) often insurance and provider make zero effort to resolve that and just send the bill out.   So, I’d set aside a chunk of time that feels manageable, or if that feels overwhelming ask someone to help you make the calls. Call whoever the bill is from and ask what’s up. Explain you were told you weren’t going to be charged. If needed, call the insurance company (the phone number should be on your insurance card) and ask *them* what’s up with the claim. I try to keep notes on a piece of paper during the calls with who I called on what dates and what they told me.   It can be frustrating and slow. Sometimes the person you get on the phone isn’t helpful at all. If I’m getting upset or overwhelmed I take a break and often vent to a friend about the absurdity. It’s definitely a slow and steady wins the race. When the unjust bill finally goes away, it’s a serious moment of relief and victory.   (If you end up having to pay something, ask about payment plans or need-based fee reductions, etc. My understanding is they don’t want to go to collections any more than you do because at that point they only get a small % of whatever is paid.)   Good luck!!! You can do this &lt;3   **tl;dr: start making phone calls and just ask what’s up**",False,False
