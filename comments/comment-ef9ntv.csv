It’s just a lot more upsetting when it comes from family members, but then again we’re not that close anymore. I guess they didn’t notice or pretend not to.  Thank you so much, and happy Christmas if you celebrate!",False,False

He said I’m the “fattest” I’ve been in years (I’m recovering from anorexia nervosa, I’ve been dealing with it for 10 years more or less AND I’m currently 9 months pregnant). When I started silently crying (I hate drama so I tried to cry in the bathroom as much as I could) and not speaking to him he started with his “I mean it in a good way” and my mother started with her “you’re exaggerating” bs. They just don’t know when to shut up, they HAVE to say something. They have to. Not only they’ve never been supportive in my recovery process (for which I thank my SO), they always denied the problem and didn’t want to address it. Earlier this summer he saw the scars I have on my arm from self harming and said “what happened?”, I just replied “you’re 10 years late”. I though I was doing so well eating a balanced diet for my daughter, I’m adamant about not wanting to know my weight but I think I put on something like 5-6kg and it didn’t seem so bad. Thanks to them my Christmas Eve dinner was a salad with apple cider vinegar and some steamed broccoli/cauliflower with no seasoning. Good job.  (also I’m sorry I posted this elsewhere but I guess I just really need to vent/get it out of my system. I’m sorry)",False,False

I think back to a post here someone posted earlier about Eating Disorders being so misunderstood. But it is annoying as hell.
