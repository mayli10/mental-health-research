No one is under the impression that people are 'naturally skinny' and nobody hides their diet and pretends they don't have to work to be slim. Of course, their methods are ridiculously unhealthy.. but at least they're honest about what they're up to.",False,False

The idea of ""face"" and not ""bringing shame"" to yourself and, by extension, your family permeates attitudes to food and appearance. Families will very openly criticize your weight and food intake. Having been over there myself, while in public, most if not all women were very conscious of how much they eat so as to not give the impression that they eat a lot. The body types I noticed were mostly on two extremes: super, super thin because they're too ashamed to eat in general and those who are quite large because they binge in private.  I didn't realize how bad it was until I traveled to China with his family and people in public openly gawked/stared - everyone is judging everyone else, which definitely reinforces ED behaviour and attitudes.   I absolutely do not think ""Asians are naturally thin"".   Although food is ""healthier"" and lower calorie over there, the reason most people are so thin is because of social pressure to be as thin as possible as well as the shame and repercussions of not being thin.",False,False

She said that she naturally lost some weight when she started eating like her korean husband and his parents do. When she compared it to the food that she used to eat in my country, she noticed that she started eating less bread, dairy products, less sausages and nuggets, etc.",False,False

I think it's true that Koreans are healthier than Americans, because there is SO much junk food/fast food here, and even 'traditional' American foods are very unhealthy. Sometimes it even feels like unhealthy eating is encouraged. I think it kind of depends on where you grow up though, because America is so big. I grew up in the Southern US, so here it is very common to eat lots of junk and unhealthy fatty foods. I know people who eat fast food like McDonalds or pizza every single day and also eat lots of junk food, and they don't realize that it is SO unhealthy.  However, most Americans wouldn't know about extreme diets in Korea or about how critical people are about appearances and health. I don't think Americans (again, where I'm from in the South) would know anything about Asian food or diets and would assume that Asian people are just 'naturally' skinny, because they don't know any better.   I did live near New York for a short time and it's not as bad up there. There are more healthy and diverse restaurants, and not as much fast-food. I'm not sure why but I see people cook home-cooked meals more. People also get more exercise, because they can walk to stores or work, and also take public transportation. In the South, everything is pretty far and there are no taxi's or busses, so people almost never walk outside here, they always drive from place to place. There are no sidewalks in my town at all.   I hope I helped a bit!",False,False
