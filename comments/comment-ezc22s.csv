It worked and I pretty much was hooked right away, I loved the feeling of power it gave me and the adrenaline rush. I started vomiting every dinner but still ate lunch &amp; breakfast, within a month I started skipping lunch and vomiting dinner, and after 10 months I was caught vomiting and when they stopped me doing that I just refused to eat at all. It's now been 8 years and I slide between anorexia &amp; bulimia all the time, with some periods of fairly normal eating",False,False

Their stepfather worked in the kitchen upstairs and would call me a sloppy fat pig when I opened the fridge. I avoided the kitchen all day when he was there and only ate quick meals when my partner would come home from work so he wouldn’t see me eat. Lost almost 45 lbs that year. I’ve since “recovered” straight into obesity. I guess I proved him right.,False,False

I’m a failure who keeps fucking up over and over and so I stopped eating to hurt myself and make myself suffer because I don’t deserve to eat.

My family built my identity around how thin I was that I was terrified to ever be otherwise. Puberty was a glooming nightmare I started marching towards the second I became aware of it. I had a problem wearing shoes that were too small because I was self conscious about the size of my little feet and needed them to be the smallest in the class? I remember vividly the first health class we talked calories in. I was weirdly fascinated with like, being punished in jail? And heard jails fed only bread and water, throw in some fresh backwards calorie knowledge and I pulled a stint of trying to live off of only one slice of bread and water for about a week. I would hide snacks and slowly savor them over days because I wanted it to last? Was extraordinarily picky in general. Kind of gross, but I ended up with a parasite in 4th grade and never told my parents because I was scared it was the only thing keeping me not fat? Thank fuck it went away on its own but like a year and a half later, but then on top of my horrifying safety net gone puberty started and I was mortified. I was a normal sized but VERY depressed and painfully insecure 11-15 year old, lots of severe self harm. At 15 I decided I wanted to work out to lose some weight and be healthy/feel better about myself. All good intentions. I was 5’7 ~135 at the time, wanted to be like 125, totally healthy for me. This went okay and I started losing weight, but then started eating significantly less. Out of nowhere my life long very best friend passed away suddenly. I was making microwave burritos at the time. I still can’t stomach the smell of microwave burritos but at the time I couldn’t stomach anything that was in my site or smell range at the time of that phone call, or anything that smelled even remotely like a burrito. I went into a mass depression and hardly ate and didn’t like the feeling of what I did eat in my stomach so I started c/s to satisfy the occasional hunger cues but not deal with the feeling in my gut  Eventually I moved in with my other parent at 17, who took me for a physical for my new school. They told me I had lost a fairly decent amount of weight, and the number they told me shocked me. It was just under the underweight bmi- which led to me being scared of not being underweight, so once I wasn’t just not eating out of depression I couldn’t eat because I was terrified of gaining weight/addicted to watching the number drop. It wasn’t ever about looks really but control and once I realized I could control that it spiraled FAST. And now it’s been 6 years and running of the shit unfortunately",False,False

I just remember wanting a body like a VS model when I was like 11 and I would obsessively measure my body and restrict my food intake to lose some weight and get a smaller waist (why the fuck did I care at 11) then I started binging due to the restricting and yeah now I’m just consistently in a binge-restrict cycle,False,False

Gained a ton of weight after kids and it all resurfaced around 5 years ago and now I'm in my 30s dealing with this crap again. Both times it sort of snuck up on me. The first time I didn't realize what I was doing until I learned about what eating disorders really we're. Skipping meals, tiny portions, purging thinking that erased things. This time I started recognizing the compulsions when I started doing a normal diet to just get to a healthy weight (I was 300lbs and really did need to lose the weight) that ended up getting really out of control. There are times now that I really try to snap out of it and can for a bit but that fucking scale and snug clothes get in the way.",False,False
