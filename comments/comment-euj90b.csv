It also has some studies showing that it improved skin elasticity (especially in the layers where hair follicles are rooted) and contains amino acids used in growing hair and nails. Biotin has been shown in studies to have results with hair loss as well. They’re both far from proven, but have some promising science behind them.  If you have joint issues and also want to improve skin, hair, and nails, collagen is probably the better option. If not, it seems like a toss up. I recently started taking collagen for my RA and to reduce hair loss from chemo. I can’t speak to how effective it is yet though.
