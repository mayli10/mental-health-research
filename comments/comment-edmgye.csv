I'm not on social media, so the whole editing/filters thing just really bothers me. Probably much more than it would if I was on social media to begin with tbh.",False,True

Maybe he holds only good intentions for you? Some of my friends like to put filters over my pictures and to them it's usually just an innocent and harmless thing to do.  He most likely isn't doing it to insult you and doesn't realise that you are triggered by it. Maybe you could casually tell him ""eh, I prefer unfacetuned me. Looks more realistic"" or something along those lines? He might get the hint and not do it again.",False,False

Like, I don't understand the reason he'd feel compelled to send me a selfie of myself back to me--the first part I understand (to a point) because he wanted to post on Facebook. But yeah, thank you for taking the time to read. I'm just... confused and frustrated.",False,True
