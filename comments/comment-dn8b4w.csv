If you don't feel like your appetite is more than it used to be before taking those meds, weight gain probably won't affect u at all.",False,False

However, I started taking Cymbalta in March (after adamantly telling my psychiatrist I would refuse to take ANY medications that would make me gain weight, damn being very depressed) and honestly it’s been pretty great. Side effect for me was a common one, especially in the first couple months, of loss of appetite. I never really regained it but that may just be my ED. (I take cymbalta for depression and anxiety, but mostly anxiety that it’s helped the most with.) highly recommend!",False,False
