You should legally not be allowed to instruct people on making healthy dietary choices without a medical degree specializing in nutrition. It is absolutely not healthy to survive on kale and berries. Kale isn't even the healthiest leaf. Anyone who took even 10 seconds to check the nutritional composition would know that spinach is healthier. If all anyone has to offer is ""superfoods"", restriction, and exercise than they shouldn't be allowed to pretend they're helping people.",False,False

Me and my friend were just talking about this. She’s literally always covered up. Even at the beach she was almost fully clothed.  I don’t know if she’s comfortable with her new body and I don’t know all the way if she actually meant to lose that weight or if it was stress. I know you said u saw her trainer talk about it, but idk the source of that to know if it’s 100% true. I’m just speculating though 🤷‍♀️",False,False

It’s no different than the craze around IF or keto or 80:10:10 or any other fad diet. At the end of the day, the media outlets that publish this kind of stuff aren’t in the business of improving people’s health; they just want those sweet, sweet clicks. Who cares if 1000 cal/day OMAD is healthy if *You Won’t Believe This One Crazy Trick Adele Swore By to Lose X Pounds!* is raking in the ad revenue?   In a perfect world these kinds of articles wouldn’t exist, but as long as there’s a demand for it, they’ll supply.",False,False
