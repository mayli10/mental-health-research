What the fuck. Those guys are definitely clueless dicks. You shouldn‚Äôt have to deal with that kind of inappropriate (absurd!) commentary, and I‚Äôm so sorry.   Shame on the company for potentially not taking this kind of stuff seriously! Just...what? How? Ugh. Sounds like a straight up hostile work environment. :( You deserve better.

It‚Äôs a warehouse style sales office with a bunch of guys who grew up in Brooklyn and Queens and are pretty gruff and blunt with their statements and jokes. They never mean it to be hurtful or anything more than a light joke but they don‚Äôt know my situation so there‚Äôs not much I can do. But that‚Äôs a good point. All of them look like they‚Äôre 2 minutes from a heart attack from ordering Chinese takeout and McDonald‚Äôs and big deli sandwiches everyday. At least I can compare my control to their old stupid selves,False,True

They know what they‚Äôre doing and it‚Äôs bullying. I would say something just as rude back like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre one to talk‚Äù since most middle-aged guys do not take care of themselves.

At work if I am too thin they literally tell me and say it doesn‚Äôt look good.  If I gain 10 lbs another set if guys at work loudly say how I am gaining weight.  WTF.  Assholes.

I don‚Äôt want to start more problems if nothing changes. I had this happen before when I worked at Starbucks and there was video footage of multiple girls myself included being sexually assaulted on camera by a supervisor and the company and the state dismissed it for having not enough evidence despite there being footage of me being cornered and having a mans hand grabbing my ass and worse with other employees.
