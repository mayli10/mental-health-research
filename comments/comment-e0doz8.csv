I feel like shit. On the verge of being shaky. My thoughts are all over the place but I have fucking paper due tomm so I can’t just be useless blob like I normally am after feeling like utter shit. I actually have to be productive and churn out a graduate level, cohesive paper and it’s stressing me out which triggered this THIRD/FOURH b/p bullshit. UGh. My dad went grocery shopping today and like the pig I am, I went through like half? Of it. He spent well over $100 on food just for me to annihilate a couple weeks worth of grocery in just a matter of days? He lowkey came out and called me out. Telling me to keep it under control and not each all the chips he bought.. so I stopped... eating just that one brand of chips but kept eating everything else???? &lt;wtf logic&gt; anyways.... yea feel like shit. Flushed my ass off and all my bodily functions feel off, I feel stupid, brain fog to the max, I just feel like utter shit. Anyways I feel like I ranted in OP’s post when mainly my point was that I relate but I word vomited all my feelings and shittiness on here. Sorry OP. I hope you feel better and are having a better day/night than I currently am.",False,False
