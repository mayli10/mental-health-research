I was arrested for theft in 2011 and it destroyed my life. I only got probation and a fine, but it still haunted me. I was going to join the military and even though I only had a misdemeanor (and got it expunged), they said theft was inexcusable because it shows a character flaw and you're likely to do it again or be a risk for blackmail/bribery.   In my state, background checks only go back 7 years and I had been counting down the days. I never got help for it and I wish someone had told me that it was just a symptom of a bigger problem.

My mom is kinda one of those “came from abusive and became abusive” types. Like her mom was abused by her husbands/bfs who were also abusive towards my mom and aunts. Now my mom is abusive and even when shes not she still has hat “*CONSTANTLY ANGRY*” voice that makes it sound likes shes constantly mad/upset with you even when shes not and now I always feel like everyones upset with me all the time.      Im pretty sure she deals with disordered eating as well and projected it onto me until I developed an ED because of her. Like shes the type that says Im not fat because I eat to much, Im fat because I don’t eat enough.” Shes also constantly cold, and shell take specific portions of certain things (like X number of chips, X being the suggested serving size) and wont weigh it but shell still get really mad when if you take one from the amount shes already counted out.      She used to constantly tell me that I eat so much, why are you eating so much, your wasting all my money, stop eating so much. So I started starving myself, going out for the majority of the day, and then coming home stoned and possible drunk and binging on snacks. I was only like 14-15 at the time. Yet when I didn’t want to eat she would *force me* to eat, once to the point where I actually cried. Add a drug addiction (I wont say which publicly because I don’t want people trying to get their hands on it or thinking Im encouraging it for weight loss) and then an super abusive boyfriend who forced me to stay on the drug even though I knew that my body and mind needed a break, and you have a full blown ED there.",False,False

My mom has always put an emphasis on looking out for herself OR always trying to find a bf!! I had like 5 stepdads and a million of her bfs come through my life and it made me think that was the only important thing to chase after. Appearance and pleasing others. I’ve never considered myself related to her or the rest of my family bc I just feel like she’s so wrong but yet I’m following down her exact same path!?? It’s messed up! ,False,True

I know people who steal because their parents are neglectful and/or abusive and it still triggers me to hear shit like that.      I feel like my mom has contributed to negative habits of mine as well. Like letting me drink young but being very controlling about it. I now have substance abuse problems.      Not bothering to hide her sex toy chest/dildos/anal beads and having really loud sex. Like once I woke up to her yelling “FUCK ME WES! UH! UH! FUCK ME!” Cuz she was super fucking drink and she was falling around in the bathroom and even broke the towel bar that night (they never fucked btw). I believe that and abusive boyfriends contributed to. . . Stuff. . .      She would also shelter me from the wrong stuff. Like, horror movies? Nope! Bringing your 4ish year old into the back of San Francisco (a store like Spencers where they sell random shit and sex toys in the back) and giving your 12 year old with *EXTREME ANXIETY THAT YOU PARTIALLY CAUSED* a lap dance at her grandfathers 50th bday because she wouldn’t go dance?
