Right now, surgeons follow guidelines that set a maximum extraction limit of 5,000 milliliters of fat (11 pounds) for all patients, regardless of variations in weight or body fat status.  Lipo is more of a sculpting tool to get rid of pockets of stubborn fat in people who are already at or near their target weight.",False,False

At the 24 hour mark, I've usually lost 5-7 lbs.    At the 48 hour mark, it's closer to 10 lbs.  At the 72 hour mark, I've usually made it to 12, .maybe 13 lbs.  After that, every 24 hours I lose between 0.7 and 1.1 lbs, pretty much like clockwork.  So I totally believe her results, but I also believe that 10-12 lbs of it is:  1. Water  2. Stored glycogen  3. Urine  4. Faeces  That's just how long fasts go.  You still only burn X calories per day.  She didn't lose 15 lbs of fat, she lost maybe 3 or 4.",False,False

But yeah, lately I’m becoming concerned with how she talks about weightloss. I’m sure she’s probably not being 100% honest.

In the first one the lighting is bad, she's in a more relaxed pose, and maybe even kind of leaning forward a bit?

If she’s doing a water fast then a lot of what she lost wasn’t body fat, it was water weight. Also depending on her starting weight she could have a pretty high bmr, which would burn effortless calories for her and reduce the amount she’d need to supplement with exercise, etc.   Either way it’s disingenuous and dangerous when she’s got so many impressionable followers.",False,False
