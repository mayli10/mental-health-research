I have a boyfriend right now who means the world to me, but I always ask myself if he just thinks he loves me because I'm young and kinda cute, but if when I get old and gross like everybody does eventually, will he still love me? Of course he will, but he won't want to fuck me. And idk, we have an amazing relationship so I try not to think about that, but it feels bad. It's totally my problem, I have bad body image like everyone on this sub, he's perfect and would never ditch me because I'm wrinkly. Find real love, fuck appearances.",False,False
