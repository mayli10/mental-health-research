My outpatient team had a lot of difficulties managing me...it wasn’t that I didn’t want to outwardly recover, but having control taken from me triggered a lot anxiety for me from past trauma; This was to the extent that it actually would impede my progress as time went on. They also described my resistance as apart of treatment fatigue, which a lot of patients can experience throughout recovery. You are not a bad person if you need time away, but I always caution against it if you feel you can’t remain stable. Think about what future you will need, not what present you wants ❤️ pls take care",False,False
