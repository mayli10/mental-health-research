To be clear, I'm finally recovering from an ED in my \*thirties\* and my perspective is coming from the mental anguish and physical destruction I've done to my body to be thin.  When I was young, I would envy the thin girls.  Now I admire the women who are happy and whole and spend their time doing fun and cool things (like write books or go hiking for a month), which means \*not\* spending all their time thinking about food, and losing all their physical energy and health to an ED.  Losing weight is like making minimum wage, whereas being \*comfortable in your own skin\* is like being a millionaire!  If you can stay strong in your previous worldview, YOU will be enviable one in your friend circle (though again, perspective takes years...)  Even if many of us just want to be called pretty/thin and liked in our teens, there's a wake-up later in life where you will value the great relationships you've had, the places you've traveled, the cool or crazy jobs you've had.  And ED holds you back from all that-- it zaps you mentally, destroys your sex hormones which is not so sexy, results in loads of time and money spend on starving/binging which could be spent planning an awesome backpacking trip to another country.  \*Step away\* from the diet culture!  There is tons of evidence that diets/fasting just lead to binging and start a viscous cycle (was mild for me in teens, got worse over the years). Try to make some new friends and maybe spend less time with the others. OR just be strong and insist on: 1) no diet talk, 2) no calories talk, 3) no weight talk.  Seriously, this is only going to help all of you be more interesting and powerful women in the future, if you focus less on disappearing your bodies and more on exploring yourselves and the world!  Much love &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3",False,False

What is your responsibility is setting your own boundaries and asking her to respect them. If she can’t be your friend without halting the AN talk for a while, you have every right to drop her as a friend. You shouldn’t have to suffer for her benefit.",False,False

If you need to take a step back or let them know that some topics of conversation are off the table, then you should tell your friends so. Supporting them with their mental health issues should not come at the cost of your own.",False,False
