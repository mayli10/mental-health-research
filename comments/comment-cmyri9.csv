However, I have experienced all of the symptoms you are describing while I was going through and even after I had finished weight restoration in treatment. They lasted for at least a few months before slowly going away. So, I would not worry about it too much until you get some sort of official confirmation from an MD.",False,False

Have they checked your hormones? Turns out I had high prolactin and it was because of my wonky pituitary gland, which also contributed to other hormonal imbalances and janky bodily responses. Definitely have them check all that out if you have the means to do so. Hopefully it's something hormone therapy can help. Wishing you good luck!",False,False

And I read something about possibly having to gain a little extra than you were before having lost your period. I’ve lost mine for over five years now and I’ve been at a “healthy” BMI for over a year now. My healthy weight according to BMI is between 95 and 115 or 120 and I’m 104.,False,False
