I eat all their food and upset them by purging and harming myself that way. Now I'm just pushing myself further away. It's mainly the eating their food and purging that makes me feel disgusting.",False,True

I promise you that you do not deserve to be hated. You are worthy of love and compassion. This will pass. In the mean time, I hope that you can be kind to yourself. üíú  PS. Sorry for the delayed response, I was driving home from work!",False,False

He helps me a lot. He says she doesn't hate me but to me my actions make me feel like I should be hated. I just wish everyone would pretend it doesn't exist. Like just ignore it all and let me get on with it.,False,True

It sounds like she just wanted to let you know she cares and is there if you needed to talk. But I can understand how you feel. I‚Äôve had bf‚Äôs moms clearly not like me before and it doesn‚Äôt feel great. Does your bf know and can you talk to them about it? Have they ever said anything about their mom not liking you?,False,False

I never realised how much my bulimia affects and hurts others especially my bf. I wanna curl up and die,False,True

How did she bring it up and what did she say? My sense is that she is just concerned.,False,False
