I am on valium still but my antidepressants were taken away because GOD will cure my depression. I code and stuff and play acnl when i can but I am in finals week rn and I am just here. Cannot say anything else. I wake up, take stomach acid pills so i dont vomit bile from not eating and I study and drink gatorade occasionally. I had mashed potatoes this morning but like i said anything more than 4/5  bites sends me to the bathroom to puke up bubbles  and food.  They say psychiatrist/ologists are for the weak and I am ""smart"", so I don't need one. Sometimes i look at the ocean and wish i could submerge myself and stay there. But i just had surgery, so that is not an option. I stay at home and the only time I go out is to accompany them to go shopping(which i STRONGLY dislike)...  Idk I cannot even eat the foods i like anymore and just smelling anything deep fried makes me nauseous.  Thank you for your concern and the solutions you gave for my problems, I truly appreciate the effort you took to respond. I wish you well and happiness in this life we live now üíñ!",False,True

Or maybe pick up a part time job if you don't have one? I think you need something to occupy your thoughts/time and probably some new friends. If your family puts you down or doesn't have time for you, I'd try distancing yourself a little. Most of all if you're not medicated, please talk to your doctor about that. Your post is really worrying to me. I know we're strangers but I wish you the best and I hope you'll find your way. ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False
