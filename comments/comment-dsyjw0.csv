There are a lot of unspoken aspects to it which make it harder to pinpoint  Acceptance applies to everyone, not everyone with an eating disorder accepts it though. It gets reinforced and rewarded, license is given/assumed, it has more payoffs than setbacks, and you end up having to make up your own mind with all of what you have for better or worse.  Society sends contradictory messages to people who attempt recovery on their own and also seek help via conventional means. It can screw you up a lot. Just having one and observing what goes on around you when you do, and what's changed, and how people behave towards each other and themselves.  I think there is a lot of hidden intelligence amongst people about eating disorders and it gets abused, especially within the context of relationships as power trips. They can be hiding, spying, lurking, compiling information, etc because they've been through it, and make you feel like an idiot- or they can be really naive",False,False

People without an ED dont have to stop themselves from, say, purging after eating more than they planned.

What I tell myself as a response is that it's not about lack of control, it's about your brain jumping to the disordered behavior as a first line option.   Similar to self harm- people who self harm can control if they cut or not, but they cant control the part of their brain that keeps telling them too. With time that part wears on you and it's hard to stop the behavior.   Most people's brains dont think ""starve yourself"" or ""purge this"" or ""eat 5k Calories right now"". Its easy to not do that when your brain isn't constantly trying to make you do it",False,True

Being underweight somehow being magical, elegant, sooo desirable and ethereal. I know that my life won't suddenly get better, but weight is a form of social currency. I live in both reality and delusion simultaneously.
