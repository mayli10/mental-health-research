Maybe she wasn't just lying/overexaggerting when she was like *if i eat, i feel nauseous and that makes me actually feel like throwing up* now that's just. Oof, but what did i expect restricting gets easier slowly too so ðŸ—¿",False,True

Thank you for the suggestions tho I'm sure some of them she'd also be willing to work with, my first goal is to stop her purging, she restricts too just like i do but that's not nearly as harmful as actually purging so one demon instead of the bigger demon hah :(",False,True

If you do it enough it becomes babit and gets easier, and in relation to EDs in particular, thats hella scary.   General harm reduction would be to make sure that electrolytes remain stable, so something like hydralyte, not a sports drink but proper rehydration drinks. Looking after teeth, rinsing with water and wait half an hour to an hour after purging to brush teeth as acid will damage enamel.  After repeated purging there are medical risks such as acid relfux, ulcers, and even horrible things  like weakening the stomach so much it can rupture.  Its not fun but no ED is.   Try and get your friend to seek help from a professional who can help with proper harm reduction strategies.  Good luck",False,False
