I know not every dietitian is the same, but mine has been wonderful for me. We’ve really been diving in to like food rules I had growing up and how they impact me now and challenging food thoughts and wow it’s been so helpful. Next week I’m brining in some safe foods listed out and we’re gonna look at what makes them safe and identify other foods that could also fall into that category so I can push myself a little more without feeling too overwhelmed by increasing my intake.",False,False

I had the same kind of “I know what to do, I just don’t do it” thought, but our appointments are really just therapy but we talk about food. We’ve explored safe/fear foods, food rules, triggers, body image, etc. And we do exposure and stuff for food and weight and stuff. If you can find a ED dietitian I highly recommend it",False,False

I think a dietitian who specializes in eating disorders can be really helpful. I'm a dietetic intern, but I spent 2 years in treatment while getting my Bachelor's in dietetics. My dietetian was extremely helpful for helping challenge my fears, set proactive goals, and offer a space to talk about food. No matter how much nutrition knowledge I have, I've never been able to apply it to myself. If you can, a center with a comprehensive team has been the only thing that's ever helped me (i.e. doctor or NP, therapist, dietitian, and maybe group therapy). Some centers offer multiple levels of care so you can stick with the same providers. I hope things go well today, feel free to check back in if you want to let us know how it goes. Best wishes to you!! &lt;3",False,False
