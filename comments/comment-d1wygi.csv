The change in environment was magical for me. My parents would drop me off on, say, a Friday night; I'd spend Saturday lazing around and they'd collect me that evening. I don't know how old you are, but think if maybe some sort of scenery change might help you. Another idea - not sure what you're doing for workouts - is to do a gentler exercise, like yoga. I'm also not really for a ""quit cold turkey"" approach here. If there's a way you can set a time maximum for yourself per day, I think that's something.",False,False

That makes me think that I need to learn to live with it and go for a harm reduction version but I’ve been trying that and it’s become a slippery slope. Ughhhh. Eating disorders suck.,False,True

Urge surfing has really helped me, too. So when you have the urge to exercise, you get out a piece of paper and rate your urge from 0-10. Use a coping skill (like a distraction or a self-soothing activity) and every 5 minutes, rate your urge from 0-10. Keep doing it until you hit zero. It might not work every time, but putting off the urge is a big step.",False,False
