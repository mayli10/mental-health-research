And, although you might find regular tops get in the way, what about a nice little overside button up? Your partner will probably find it either cute or a turn on if it's their button up, too, so that's a bonus.   I mean, I do think this is something that should be overcome eventually only because it's an unhealthy mindset. But we can all relate to this, at least most of us. And it's most likely not something that will go away right away, something that's a work in progress. And so, until that moment comes, maybe my above options will help? Who knows, though. But don't fault yourself for feeling this way. This is mental illness, after all. And it's overwhelming. ",False,False

You just have to believe that no matter what that person find you attractive if they want to have sex with you. Its a hard thought process to get through, but if you can just forget about it, it will change your sex life a lot. ",False,False
