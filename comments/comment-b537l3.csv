Your dentist will not judge you, they only want to help. I guarantee you they've seen dozens of people like you, and dozens far worse. Your best bet is to just be honest and tell them about what's going on, so they can give you the best care possible and tips for taking care of your teeth.  I put off going to the dentist for so long, and it turned out the anticipation was so much worse than just doing it. My dentist thanked me for being honest and then just did their job.  Your teeth are so important!",False,False
