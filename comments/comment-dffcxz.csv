It also gives you several TDEE values based on different formulas and you can read the explanations as to why some of them are considered better and some more outdated. But really, that's as good as it gets. If you're hoping for something where you can plug in specific activity details like minutes and intensity and whatever, then I'm pretty sure that doesn't exist. And even if someone created a calculator like that it would still use all the same formulas and values the existing calculators use anyway. Unfortunately you can't get more specific without undergoing extensive scientific/medical testing.   Another way, that you also kind of mentioned, is to go by the most sedentary TDEE (level 1.1 or 1.16 on the link given) and then calculate the calories burned by walking/running separately and add them on top of that to get a TDEE value for the day/week. And for good measure (if you're a data nut like me) you can also take the average or mean of all the different TDEE values you get. Excessive, but hey, we're not normal here anyway :P",False,False

The activity level is based on how many steps you get in the day unless you’re consistently working out.   Under 10k is sedentary, I think 10-15k is light, beyond that depends on the frequency and intensity of working out.",False,False
