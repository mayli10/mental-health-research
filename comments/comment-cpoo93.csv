Those are so essential for cardiac health. I mean ideally you would be able to go get seen (and I know there are a million reasons why you donâ€™t want to or canâ€™t! But I still would suggest it, you might get a banana bag with electrolytes and rehydrated. Or you could conceivably have a cardiac structural issue that could theoretically not be caused by the disorder that would be worth checking into!)...  I hope you are okay. Harm reduction I guess only goes so far but itâ€™s something! Take it easy ðŸ’•",False,False
