If anyone else was freaking out I would give the same advice. I know everything your saying it’s just when it’s happening you don’t really think straight especially when you’re mind has a disorder like an ED. Seriously though I just needed some reassurance.   I weighed myself this morning and obviously everything was okay. I was just being a dumbass. I think I’m about to get my period so I’m really bloated and retaining some extra water weight from that as well. I just gotta tough it out for a few days. I skipped my period intentionally for like two months cuz I started sleeping with a guy (yeah real smart riiiight?) and eventually my body was like okay dude you need to get your period and I gained like 4 lbs and I was starting to freak out because I was always eating at maintence so I finally took a break from bc and low and behold the few extra pounds were gone in like two days. I was always doubtful when people posted about period weight on this sub but now I’m like okay it’s time for the period weight bring it on!!!!!  Also lol at smurf body. Ty for the laugh.,False,True

And Vegetables are slow to digest so you would feel fuller. And Protein is digested in the stomach and Duodenum only so you will definitely feel like you’ve eaten enough to some degree. If you are a Human older than 4yrs, your BMR is probably higher than 1,200kcal, add exercise and basic moving and you’d be in a deficit 100%   Don’t beat yourself up, just look at the situation one good time  xx",False,False
