Added up all the calories (including a can of soup i haven't even had yet/won't eat until my usual OMAD time) and am still somehow at a net average of &gt;!415-420!&lt;?????   Like, today was excessive as fuck &amp; i feel like shit. But if tomorrow is light, the week overall should round out nicely, somehow.  Also: officially set up my first therapy appointment &amp; took some time today to fill out the intake paperwork, so am pretty stoked on that.  Best!!",False,False

Iâ€™ve never felt this full in a while. BUT I didnâ€™t have the usual self-hatred or urge to purge!!   I mean, the guilt is there and I kinda want to attempt a purge, and I still feel a twinge of guilt that now all my past effort has gone to waste but I feel more satisfied than I have in weeks.

I literally ate mustard mixed with pretzel salt (the kind that comes with big frozen pretzels) until I felt sick the other night so I guess it's technically water weight?? But still it's consuming most of my thoughts :(( and I haven't pooped in three days and I want to drink Senna tea but I shouldn't.,False,False

I couldn't even work out at the gym to exercise purge - left after like 15 minutes of slowly walking on the treadmill because I just couldn't face it. and now i'm curled up in bed, dreading having to wake up tomorrow and make it through another day.  but.. i did it. i did a thing that was hard. that's something.",False,False

I'll do a bit more in a few days, if I evidence suggests that what I've done was insufficient.   This is a huge improvement over this time last year, where I kept going, using scale weight as the be all and end all, even though I 100% knew better.",False,False
