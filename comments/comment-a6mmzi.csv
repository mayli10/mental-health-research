I was pretty freaked out about it when I noticed it for the first time but it's really nothing to worry about. Sometimes it's annoying though, especially when you're lying on your back or something and it's visible and feels really strong. But don't worry, it's just your aorta doing its thing. ",False,False

It's like if you can see/feel a pulse in your wrist or neck. The aorta just happens to be a massive ass vessel that carries a lot of blood. I'm overweight and I can see/feel the pulse sometimes when laying on my back.,False,False

The pulse is easier to notice in your abdomen if you're thin. You might notice that it's just a little left of midline. It might seem weird, but I think it's kinda cool :)",False,False
