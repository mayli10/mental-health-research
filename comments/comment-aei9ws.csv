I was diagnosed and offered all the help in the world but denied it because I felt like it could be worse or more like it should be worse before I can actually accept the help and recover. I've started recovering just recently after pretty much hitting the rock bottom. Honestly I don't want to go inpatient even though I've been told it would only benefit me. Hopefully everything will turn out well for you. ,False,False

I have EDNOS though but damn does it feel like I'm not sick enough because I binge then restrict but stay a healthy weight so I don't wanna recover until I'm a lower weight. I know I've gained so I'm avoiding the scales.,False,False

I went to inpatient against my will. You'd think that would show me that I'm finally Bad Enough. But no. I still feel like I should have been far sicker.  Don't wait to feel like you've done enough. You never will.,False,False

Even when an alarming symptom happens, or I get a bit freaked out by something or other going on in my body, I always forget about it when I'm given meds or whatever to sort it out.  Pretty sure if it caused my intestines to hang out of my ass or my brain to start falling out of my nose I'd just stuff it all back inside and think WELL, I'M STILL ALIVE, SO...  The only thing that's pissed me off is how much my damn bones and joints hurt.  I tell myself it's down to my age now, but it all started in my 20s (years ago).  Sometimes I wonder if there really is a ""rock bottom"" with an ED, where something bad happens and you think, agh , better recover!  Being a self destructive illness, I really don't think a lot of us would care if it killed/almost killed us (?)  We're definitely sick and should recover, but I understand 100% what you're saying.
