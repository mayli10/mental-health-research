It’s been really helpful, ive just been having trouble finding time for it during classes and such. But i dont plan on dropping it entirely, as it’s increased my appetite and just feels satisfying in general. I wish i could see improvement where i want to, but the other benefits make up for that",False,True

It might help you to want to eat more, and putting on muscle/recomping fat to muscle will help you look leaner while putting on weight/mass. Might help with your perception of “problem areas”, plus it’s really fun!",False,False

Ive only been to one session so I haven’t really opened up yet and used them as a therapist, but i hope i muster up the courage to soon.",False,True

You really really should- this problem you’re facing is not just about your physical weight but about your mental health and I’m concerned you aren’t taking care of that. Find a counselor, get in talk therapy. They will be there to make sure you’re doing things right as you’re moving into being a responsible adult human who lives on their own and takes care of themselves",False,False

I’m meeting with a specialist once a week (outside of school) to basically check in on my weight status and keep it stable. She has a lot of resources at her disposal (a nutritionist that can help me pick food!!) so i feel like i have a pretty good safety net.   I think the scary part is that ED thoughts are still controlling my eating to a degree. I still make sure that I am eating 3 meals and snacks, but sometimes they arent as good as they can be. The underlying desire to “look good” still very much has a sway on things, as I don’t really know my limits with food as my metabolism is out of wack.   But to get back to your response... it seems crazy that dysmorphia is that persuasive, but you’re right. When i think about it, i thought i looked really good when i was very skinny, but i can see how malnourished my face  was looking at myself from that time. The same thing’s gotta apply for other parts of my body.   One of the hardest things is that my girlfriend actually LIKES my love handles. The fact that i can’t let that change my opinion on them makes me feel awful. I really like her, and I want her words to validate me... but they don’t. I don’t wanna make her compliments seem worthless to me when they’re really sweet in reality. Body dysmorphia really sucks.   Your post makes a lot of sense, and i’m grateful for it. Thank you again for being so thoughtful.",False,True

That's incredible in and of itself.  I see you completed outpatient, but what's your current mental health regime like? Are you seeing a therapist that specializes in EDs while you're in school? If not, I would recommend you start that process now. There is no safe way for recovering anorexics to lose weight, full stop. So the goal should not be to lose weight, it should be to change how you feel about your weight. It's not ever recommended for recovering ANs to lose weight if they become very overweight during recovery. Your weight needs to be stable for years before any doctor would recommend weight loss to someone recovering.  You were pretty dramatically underweight for your height. If at your lowest weight you still felt you had those love handles than there are only two options. Either you really did still have them (unlikely) and they are apart of your genetic makeup, so there's no getting rid of them. The goal then is to accept your body the way it is and enter therapy with that mindset so you don't die trying to get rid of them. Or your body dysmorphia causes you to see them when they aren't there. That is really common. It happened to me. We fixate on one aspect of ourselves and use it to fuel our ED. We can't see it when that aspect is ""fixed."" I think it's cause if we could see that that aspect didn't exist anymore we wouldn't be able to rationalize our EDs to ourselves. I hate my double chin. I'm convinced it's prominent and awful. At my worst, I used it to justify losing more. After all, I couldn't be that unhealthy or underweight if I still had fat in my face. If I was really that bad, there would be no double chin. I've progressed enough to look at photos of that time and say with 100% certainty that I didn't have a double chin at all. But for years I saw one in the mirror and in photos. Dysmorphia sucks.",False,False
