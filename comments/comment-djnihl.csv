My biggest fear is her making me drink her coffee and OIL concoction which is supposed to help constipation lol.   Yes my family is the same! It usually means they care with a touch of nosy behaviors but hey what can ya do about it ┐( ∵ )┌,False,True

Also nothing can be kept a secret. I went to the bathroom and I come out to everyone asking if I successfully went to the bathroom since it takes a day or two to adjust when traveling...like yes thank you for the concern about my bowel movements!!,False,False

I'm Hispanic and food is literally the thing we live for- there isn't a day that food isn't a topic of discussion. My family is also weirdly obsessed with natural remedies and diets. You're not fat and try to enjoy being with your family! It's hard but you can do it.,False,True

My mom though noticed immediately maybe after 5ish lbs and I told her it was related to work stress. Then I told her that anytime I ate too much I would get sick (like poop sick) so I’ve been eating less and avoiding dairy. Now I have a new job and she’s hoping I’ll gain back the 25lbs I’ve lost but yeah sorry mom it’s an ed!  My whole family has a horrible relationship with food. My mom has done every fad diet and is obsessed with working out.  My family overseas is obsessed with eating and talking about their weight in general but food culture over their is different (middle eastern country). They talk about what’s for lunch before breakfast is even over...I’ve been here only two days and I feel so fucking fat,False,False
