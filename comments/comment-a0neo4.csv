Wow she's the worst I've ever heard of Jesus Christ. Like what model is she operating under? Some outdated circa 2001 refeed the anorexic and suddenly everything is okay??????,False,False

Sorry but she really shouldn't be ignoring you. Can you switch to an ED specialist? Or even someone trauma informed they tend to be way better at this shit ,False,False

Just like you can be malnutrished and over weight.   So at the very least let's talk harm reduction. Are you taking vitamins and supplements? Are you getting enough sodium and potassium? Can you add a protein supplement to your diet? I'm not asking you to gain weight or eat 1500 cals a day because who am I kidding half of us can barely manage 1000 but can you maybe creep up into high restriction? Like 800 a day? At least enough so you can walk and talk.   Are you seeing a therapist? I'm not saying you have to talk about how little you eat but maybe someone to unload the unhappiness with?   What are your coping skills like? What do you do to manage stress other than restrict or purge? Can you distract from purging like go on a walk, play a game on your phone, read a book, watch a movie, draw, write, make EDmemes lol, go to the dog park and pet dogs? Anything? ",False,False

You need to figure out if you can eat more and stop purging. Your body is probably really fucked with electrolytes on top of being starved. Take it from someone who had anorexia binge purge type with severe restriction. If you don't stop you just might actually die.   This is one of the most dangerous combinations of eating disorders you can have. ,False,False
