My really sweet and wonderful boyfriend said : ""Good job"" when I told him I've been doing really well calorically and it has fueled my desire to go even lower in cals (but how could he know?).

It consumed me. So much so that I refused to eat anything but particular foods, and fought with my mom over how I was eating. I would get super fucking angry at her for buying bad foods even though I was only one of the four of us.  Once I moved out, I started to go to propane places and eventually figured out how I could purge. I started heavily restricting and occasionally purging amd then I was like ""huh, I really am fucked up""  So yeah, after a year of disordered behavior, then months of literally browsing/posting to this sub along with other forums, I finally realized I'm probably not okay lmao.",False,False

One of the hardest things when you have disordered eating and get to a higher weight is how much people applaud your weight loss. Like, when everyone around us is reinforcing how great we are for losing weight, it just pushes us further into messy restriction/purge habits.  Losing control is definitely the scariest aspect of it. I got to my HW when I was in an abusive relationship, so losing weight started to help me appreciate my body autonomy, initially. Now I’ve reached my original GW, I’ve tried to stop but can’t. It’s like a bloody pendulum.",False,False

I've managed to lose 60 pounds so far this year through CICO ( I come from a place of obesity with EDNOS ) and the occasional more harsh undereating periods, but now I feel myself slipping into the even lower cal territory, OMAD has been making this too easy, and my thoughts become more obsessive, yet I try to fight this because I'm afraid it will make me gain weight like I have in the past. When I was younger I would diet on and off and lose weight but then gain it all back.
