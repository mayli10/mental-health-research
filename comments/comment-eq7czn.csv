Busy and empty alike. No one cares what you're doing. Wear headphones. Sometimes I take preworkout as a commitment because once that kicks in I basically have to exercise and can't chicken out if the parking lot is kind of full that day.  And also just force yourself to go. You'll see it's no big deal and it gets easier,False,False

If you have a friend you could go with the first couple times, I recommend doing that. Otherwise just abide by general gym rules (wipe your machines, put weights back, etc) and youâ€™ll be totally fine!",False,False

Though it may burn more kcal overall (like, post-run) since it's a more intense workout per km. I'm not sure about that but I know I'm way hungrier after running 10k versus walking. The risk of injury (at least for me) increases with running versus walking too, so that can be a consideration. I run because it gives me more mental benefits than walking, but I have to be really careful not to overdo it (been out with a stupid injury since October sadly).  As far as exercising in public, I try to remind myself a lot that everybody else is just focused on themselves or even as worried about how others see them as I am about me. Everybody be doin' their own thing. It helps that my gym is low-key and has a lot of different ages and body types as members. Plus nobody has ever talked to me and I've never seen anybody talk to anybody else, so that puts me at ease too. And I keep my headphones in and my music going, which somehow helps. Sometimes it's about easing into the situation (going for a short visit and using equipment you're more confident in, and then building from there).",False,False
