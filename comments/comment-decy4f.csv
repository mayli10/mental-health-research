B/ping is a waste of time, life, money, energy, etc. When you think about it, nothing about the disorder makes sense and the sadder you get from how pathetic/nonexistent your life has gotten. A lot of people dissociate when they b/p, otherwise they‚Äôll just drive themselves crazy and become suicidal ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Anyways you got this OP. Don‚Äôt be too down on yourself.",False,False
