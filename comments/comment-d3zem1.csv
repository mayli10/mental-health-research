Sorta quit smoking after meeting my wife and stopped drinking until I blacked out a few months after that.   Unfortunately, once your addicted, it's very easy to fall back into the habit. I still have one every now and then and it's awesome tbh ðŸ˜Ž But I know I'm supposed to be done and that usually stops me.",False,False

As soon as he turned 18 he bought a juul because everyone else told him to. One day he said ""this nicotine curbs my appetite"" and has been hitting bigger mods with higher nicotine since. I started smoking before I started struggling with my weight so vaping is just a different vice for me, not related.",False,False
