I had an amazing therapist earlier this year who I can't go back to because of money reasons but it really brought home to me how trying again and again with different therapists can be so rewarding, so worth it. So if you feel like you don't click with this one, I hope you're in a position to try another and get someone you can gel with. I also think it's such a courageous move in the first place - the self-talk is so smooth and so adept at tricking us into thinking we don't *really* have a problem - it's worth celebrating the decision to seek help, and in my experience that doubting, deceiving voice gets a bit louder during those times but then fades once I get into the swing of therapy. Best of luck 💕",False,False

I understand struggling with the idea of thinking you are faking an “ed” however this is something you can talk about during your appointment. Good luck 👍🏻,False,False
