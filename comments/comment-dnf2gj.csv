I’m at a size now where my tummy is very visible if I eat anything. I look pregnant and it sucks because my ass is gone and I look like a kid.,False,False

A heavier, more muscular body will \*look\* leaner than a super thin body with no tone.     ""Skinny fat"" is so frustrating because, yeah, you're skinny and you're light, but clearly you don't ***actually*** care about the goal weight, you just want to feel and look good.  That means potentially eating a little more but using that energy to buff up.",False,False

I'm sure others would notice your weight-loss and because you're so focused on you body you wont see changes since your view might be messed up. Congrat's on reaching you goal weight tho! Remember that lowering your GW might make you feel the same everytime. Go and celebrate that you've hit your GW cause you deserve it ♡,False,False
