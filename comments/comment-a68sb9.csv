When I was in high school my mom was a teacher, and everyday a flock of boys (mostly from the school soccer team i photographed) would come to her room either at lunch or between classes, before or after school, just to see if i had brought in any  baked goods.  for some reason i always have had a rule that i never eat my own baking. it just takes so much time and then knowing the work that went into it makes it unappetizing to me, and watching people enjoy it is so much more satisfying.

I'll play something on netflix that I can halfway pay attention to, in case I need to focus more on something else for a sec (this is why I'm on my third runthrough of parks and rec lol) and then just.... zone into making things. Downside: I tend to binge on baked goods. So I have to have a way to get rid of them asap, or a reason to keep myself from eating them, such as it being a birthday cake for someone else.
