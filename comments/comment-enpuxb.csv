My friend used to do thse exact same thing to me during school lunches, I felt really awkward around her because she constantly asked why I wasn't eating lunch, why in doing this to myself.  And then one lunch she forced me to have a lollipop.  Like yeah, a lollipop will help.  I stressed about those calories too because suddenly a 35 calorie lollipop was ""too much"" at that time of day.",False,False

ED behaviors aside, it is not her job to help you recover and it is your decision when you want to get help. I’d definitely recommend telling her that this shit needs to stop right now, and she should not need to have a reason or explanation in order to respect that.  My apologies for coming on strong but this kind of shit makes me so angry for you.",False,False

There's no reason you have to eat something you don't want and you shouldn't have to apologize for it. She's not being a good friend if ""I don't want that"" isn't good enough for her to stop.",False,False
