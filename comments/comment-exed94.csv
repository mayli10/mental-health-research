I’m 100% sure whoever made it has an Ed because nothing could be that triggering by accident.,False,False

I binged Cheer last night and then watched that new Taylor Swift doc this morning and I was so motivated today. I only like her music okay but she’s almost the same height as me and her lowest weight is my UGW soooo clearly I need to watch everything she has ever done.,False,False

Haha. Different trigger...  But I strongly relate to feeling like every movie is spoiled because of it. There's a lot of types of violence I can't deal with and people will tell me that there's no applicable scenes in the movie they want to show me....... and then the scenes are there. And they're like oh yeah I guess there is this scene.  Like!!!! people do not realize it's a big deal for me  Shit sucks. Media sucks lmao,False,False
