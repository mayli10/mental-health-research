Depends on your location, but would recommend finding some hippie feminists in your area and doing a naked brunch or something. It's really, really nice to spend time with other body positive people in a low stakes situation (not worried about sexual rejection) and to normalize different naked bodies. I lean into appreciating the older women at the YMCA that let it all hang! It makes me happy that they DGAF.",False,False

Know that there are def people who will enjoy your body with you when you're ready: my partner has given me a lot of access to his thought processes/feelings around bodies and attraction and it's been useful and healing to me. He's not disordered about bodies, so he's an awesome touchstone/example of how I want to think about them. I always recommend that people who have body/food things select for partners who enjoy a range of bodies; I'm going to have feelings if/when my body changes, I want to feel secure that my partner won't mind and/or will enjoy the novelty of the change. Yes, some people have fucked up ideas about how bodies ""have"" to or ""should"" look to be attractive, but it's definitely not all of them, which is enough for me to know it's best for me to find the people who have broader taste ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False

I gained a lot of weight in college (40 lbs) after having a light restriction ED plus exercise abuse throughout high school. The weight came on hard and fast with stress and I basically chose to brainwash myself with body positive images to maintain my mental health. I highly recommend daily doses of plus size model/style blogger instas, even if you're not plus (I was only a size 12 at my biggest, but it helped to expand my mental landscape of attractive bodies so I didn't feel so fringe). I recommend sex, either by yourself or with a sexy friend, because it's a really direct way to connect with your body and it's easy for me to feel appreciative of my body right after an orgasm. It's v nice of my body to give me those. I also recommend looking at your body when you're altered: I always feel super sexy when I've had a couple drinks and when I'm sober I can sometimes tap into those memories and feel those things more. In my experience the alcohol helps me forget to worry about body check things/focus on the negatives, which is basically what people with good body image do.    Dressing up/doing my hair/makeup helps me, so I try to do that regularly. I've also really enjoyed taking some fancy/sexy photos (pay someone or recruit an amateur photographer friend); seeing what a difference good lighting/production is fun because I like seeing myself look good but it's also a great piece of evidence to help remind myself that the images we see are edited and that even models don't really look that way all the time. I think we often have, like, self image imposture syndrome: yeah, everyone else is fine looking but I'm secretly the only hideous person in the world. Not true. ",False,False
