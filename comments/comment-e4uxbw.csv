I was on birth control after 16 and weighed under 115 (mostly 96-104) the entire time. Definitely felt invalidating and was a reason it took me a year to get weight restored.,False,False

I find it funny that they say it requires all the nutrients for the body to ovulate as I almost only ate trash at that time... My guess is that it largely depends on the body fat percentage. When I was normal weight I menstruated pretty regularly for about two years and it got irregular when I lost again. Now it seems to regulate again, maybe as I eat more healthy food and my weight kinda settled. In my case the strength of my period correlates with my weight/fat somehow..",False,False
