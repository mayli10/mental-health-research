I hated who I was after and I thought that the trauma took away from me as a person but it was never true. It’s been years and I still have days where I can’t cope with what happened to me but I also have days where I realize that the way I cope with my trauma has manifested other admirable attributes within me (like an ability to stand up for others or an ability to talk about what I’m feeling) saying that it gets better is a cliche but HOLY fuck it’s true. You’re strong and capable and you can heal on your own terms. Take care of yourself. (And reach out to me if you need help) ❤️",False,False
