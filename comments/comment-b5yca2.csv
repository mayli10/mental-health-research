The gist of it is that all of our various hormones are constantly in flux, and what we define as ""PMS"" is just a label for when someone is unusually sensitive to those normal hormonal fluctuations. Regardless of whether you are ovulating or not, you still have hormones... it's not like your body is totally devoid of all estrogen or whatever. So, my understanding is that it's completely possible to have symptoms related to that hormonal ebb-and-flow, even if you're not literally having a period.",False,False

I do have crazy mood swings, phases of inexplicable bloating/constipation, odd breakouts.
