I was mostly fine at 14-17yrs with a bmi of 14.5-15.5, binging and purging like crazy 3-6x every single day, but I did have about 26 hospital admissions that got me stable and my weight up ~2kg each time, I just lost it instantly though. Hence 26x. So my vitals were shit but I *felt* ok for the most part (from memory anyway)   I'm almost 19 now and my bmi has been around 15.5-16.5 for the past year and I feel like **death**. I'm not every purposefully restricting or even b/ping anymore, I'm just not really trying at recovery nor relapse. My vitals are really shit tho so I just ignore that!    People think I'm doing well though bc I look ""normal"" now  :)",False,False

So Iâ€™m 5â€™ for reference.  When I was 68-69 lbs I *felt energetic enough* to do all my college stuff with a daily 30 min workout. I would get up on time every day and go to my classes (though I skipped some classes since they werenâ€™t helpful). However I would easily get tired when I did other stuff. Once I had to build a trebuchet (Iâ€™m a physics major) and it was so physically taxing just to stand a little more than usual. I didnâ€™t even build the whole trebuchet (I had a partner for the project) and after a short time I was still heavily panting. It was scary since I had already eaten that day.  Anyway, what happened afterwards was I decided to gain a little for health, though I wasnâ€™t comfortable with being in the healthy BMI or even 17-18 BMI range. Right now Iâ€™m 72-73 lbs. I took a rather intensive experimental physics class with hands-on stuff and I didnâ€™t get tired standing a lot in each 3-hour lab session. However Iâ€™m so tired in other aspects. I feel sleepier. I donâ€™t have the energy to go to my lectures. I even had to email my professors telling them about my eating disorder, but they wanted me to tell the school about it, and Iâ€™ve already been forced to go to the hospital by the school (because of non-ED reasons) so I didnâ€™t pursue that avenue further since I didnâ€™t want to be pressured into recovery.  I donâ€™t know when I started noticing symptoms. I feel like I lost weight super quickly, and ever since Iâ€™ve had an eating disorder Iâ€™ve just never had enough energy. X_X",False,False

Iâ€™ve felt more exhausted at BMI of 23 than 16 in the past.  The only thing that Iâ€™ve found to work is if you eat something right before you go out/do whatever you need to do. When I was fasting for prolonged periods what really helped me to keep up with my workouts was coffee.",False,False
