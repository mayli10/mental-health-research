Let's say this person admits to having terrible and debilitating body dysmorphia or that they are restricting to a very low calorie limit. Maybe they do have a diagnosable ED. How will that information be a benefit to you? What will you do next?  I don't think it's really necessary (nor is it helpful) to ask questions about this person's disordered behaviors. Eating disorders are very private and for most of us, getting quizzed on our ED behaviors is our worst nightmare and the least helpful thing. We are very aware of how messed up our eating patterns are and most of us prefer not to discuss them.  I assume you care about your friend and want them to be okay. The first thing you can do is accept that if you friend does have an ED, you can't be the one to fix it. What you can do is show them you care. Compliment them on their non-physical attributes. Spend quality time together. Do your normal thing with food when you're around them and make it available if they're interested. If they decline, do not call them out on it.   Seeing a friend suffer from an eating disorder is scary, but it's important to remember that it's not within your power to cure their disorder. And ultimately, the disorder itself is a symptom of a greater issue. The eating problems are just a coping mechanism for whatever else is going on. As such, the most helpful thing you can do is be a good friend and show them unconditional love and support. ",False,False
