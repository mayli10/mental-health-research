I actually need Adderall but my insurance won't cover it. I don't even get the stupid side effect that people abuse it for. (No appetite suppression at all!) I just want to feel like a functional, normal person.  I know people on here can't know that and aren't thinking rationally, but it always bothers me when they talk about abusing it. So many come off as bragging too.",False,False

Itâ€™s totally relatable to want something that can feel like a solution because it fits within my comfort zone, but is secretly digging me deeper into darkness. The ED issues will be there waiting, doing pushups in the shadows, and those substances are legit physically and mentally addictive. I have issues with addiction in general and my doc swore up and down Vyvanse would not be addictive. Total lie, at least for my personal experience. Substance abuse is a shit road, pinky promise. But dang do I relate to wanting to dive back down it. Hoping things will get easier for you so that it will sound less appealing &lt;3",False,False

You don't get it and never will. Only make it harder for those that legitimately need it. If I got my vyvanse taken off me I'd kill myself.,False,False
