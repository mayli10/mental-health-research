For more than 2 years, I've been experimenting with the long term effects of consuming the same meal replacement shake for every meal and made good progress losing fat and gaining muscle...  https://imgur.com/a/ePa9Fvh  Most people who use these meal replacements don't do every single meal. They just use it when they don't feel like preparing or ordering food.",False,False

I don’t think it’s sustainable for long periods of time tho.  I know someone who was told by doctors to drink Ensure while going through chemo.

I blend it with frozen berries to make a smoothie and it's really nice. I can drink a 200cal cup and it fills me up for ages. The best part is that it's so healthy, all the protein, fibre and vitamins I wouldn't be getting if I just didn't eat. It gets boring if it's your only food source, but it is definitely a healthier option to not eating, or eating low calorie foods that aren't very nutritious.",False,False
