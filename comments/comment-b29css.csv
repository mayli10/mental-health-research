Where is there a diet tip request?  This was not your post implies at all. It did not have a recovery tone at all.   &gt;So everytime I start a **diet**, I end up failing. A large part of this is that I end up focusing so much on how big a **goal** it is instead of just taking it day by day, and then that goal seems impossible and I end up having and eating the foods I crave. Any **advice** on actually being able to take it day by day?   You called it a diet. You stated you had a goal set/in mind. You then asked for tips on how to not eat so much. The sub is not doing that sort of advice because it is a slippery slope to getting it banned again. Then you got defensive and said that you never needed **diet tips** even though you effectively asked for just that.",False,False

You wouldnt be there in the first place if you wouldnt constantly think about it. If you cant accept it, like recovery on your own, all you have left is professionell help.  And, to distract yourself. Stopping your daily routine, like looking at calories or thinpso, or whatever you do. I dont know what youre doing. Changing your life, getting back to old hobbies, staring New one. There is no magic. I am sorry. Meds, therapy, and willpower. Stopping weighting myself daily helped a lot. ",False,False
