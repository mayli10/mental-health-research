I know it's probably going to be my main or only meal for the day. Make it healthy and balanced between carbs fat and protein but get most of your daily calories in there.  In the evening after it wears off I am still pretty hangry. I recommend looking for a snack during the day that you can stomach, I'm still looking for something but a lot of people have success with string cheese?  Then for dinner I have something pretty small or snacky but make sure I'll be hungry enough in the AM for megabreakfast.",False,False

Never heard of that, usually, actual binging stems from some sort of restriction (real compulsive BED, not binging as in eating a lot because you are actually hungry).   I started with a lower dose and it had the same effect with less appetite, but I could still have some lunch, now it's just a bit higher and I don't really want any during the day but suddenly much at night - maybe that's also because I've just not been eating, I mean, there are people who do OMAD and their dinners are rather big simply because it's their main time to eat and they're hungry, I'm just not used to eating much at night and going to bed with a full stomach and this makes me feel SO guilty!     Otherwise, I love vyvanse. I hope it doesn't wear off like it does for most people, but it's not only helping my add (wow, I can read a whole page or just DO something without being a depressive slug all day and I'm starting to feel like I think humans are supposed to feel, I swear it's not like the other meds that make me feel like I 'took' something, it's rather that a heavy curtain of 'I won't do anything today because I hate everything and then, I 'll hate everything even more' is lifted), but it's helping with the binging (during the day, duh), and compulsive/obsessiveness in general. My mood isn't changed much, but I don't care as long as it helps me doing the things I actually want to do for the first time in my life!   What's IEP, anyways?",False,True

They lose weight at first but then regain and more around the second to third year.   Possibility the dose it high which causing you to feel the cash. However, it may be ""high"" because of your ADHD. I work with children in IEPs it's not frequently as perscribed with them.  Don't be so hard on yourself you just started the drug.",False,False
