It's unnatural stimulants or and unnatural amount of stimulants all at once that's the issue.   Like senna tablets are natural but you wouldn't get that much stimulant from eating a bunch of prunes all in one go.,False,True

I only recently dove into lax use but other than a solid week of definitely overdoing it I haven‚Äôt touched it since. I think my brain is a lot calmer when I‚Äôm just restricting and exercising. Purging and lax sends me spiralling even worse.   I hope you heal well.,False,False

I still use it because I am a freekin' idiot.  Prolapsed idiot at that. But honestly, don't feel bad. I've been in ED forums and groups for the last 10yrs completely oblivious - I definitely don't take it personally or see it as a trigger if anyone here talks about lax.
