Iâ€™ve actually told one of my close friends who is like my second mom and she forgot. Itâ€™s like people wonâ€™t take me seriously until Iâ€™m skeletal ,False,True

I used to be pretty upset by it, but one of the most valuable lessons that my mom has taught me (indirectly) is that, I need to save certain subjects and topics for certain people. There are some people that just wont be able to help me with issues, and I need to recognize who can and cannot listen. Unfortunately my mom is one of the people who cannot and will not listen, she actually told me this once face to face, and ive accepted it. The only time I ever talk to her about my ED is when i need to use her insurance, which I did the other day to get bloodwork done. So yeah, even after being clinically diagnosed, she still doesnt get it, doesnt ask, and doesnt want to learn whats going on. But on the other hand I have a very supportive bf, cousin who goes through the same thing, and friends who I can talk to. :)",False,False

Im kinda jealous tbh, I've straight up told my mom about purging, but she still thinks I'm just dieting or something, and just reminded me on the phone to ""try not to eat foods that upset your stomach"" lol.",False,False
