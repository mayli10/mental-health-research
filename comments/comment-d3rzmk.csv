Deep down, beneath our warped thoughts and feelings and overly critical self judgements that tell us we aReN‚Äôt sICk eNoUgH or that we‚Äôre FiNE, I‚Äòm sure we all know we are unwell.  But it feels incredibly invalidating when we finally break and admit this out loud to not only ourselves but to others, only for it to again be invalidated, but this time by someone else. It hurts and the only thing it does validate is our disordered ideas that we are ok.

My dad has always been orthorexic growing up and Ive seen him struggle with b/p issues. He would NEVER admit to having an eating disorder or needing help.
