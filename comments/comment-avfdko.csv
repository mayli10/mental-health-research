BUTTTT it gave me a lot of thoughts. Ever since I've developed a legitimate death wish I've been trying to see the positive side of everything because, well, fuck it, nothing matters anyway, so here's my take on the \~silver lining\~ of what she said if it would make you feel better. Totally feel free not to read on:  &amp;#x200B;  From the way the quote is written your mom's friend sounds like an older, kind of brash, foreign lady. Could be wrong, but regardless, a lot of people like that and even some people who are just kind of gruff by nature see ""fat"" as a descriptor with no negative connotation. ""Getting fat"" and ""getting skinny"" are, to some people, just things that happen during life without all the emotional weight we (people with EDs) attach to them. I emphasize so deeply with how shitty it must have felt to have someone imply that you're ""fat"", and you probably aren't anywhere near ""fat"", but imagine how free you (all of us here actually) would feel if ""fat"" didn't really mean anything bad to you until it was at the point of actually negatively impacting your health? What if someone telling you you're too ""fat"" for a pair of pants was just like someone telling you you probably shouldn't use their dry shampoo because it's tinted for brunettes and you're a blonde? Of course this assumes she said it without the intention to hurt your feelings, but if it is the case that she just said it as an off-hand remark, maybe it can be kind of comforting to think about the fact that some people genuinely see ""gotten fat"" as just a phrase that means ""curvier than you may have been in the past"" rather than ""gross, ugly, etc."". And if you think about it that way, it may help you to feel less anger towards her, although I know it's way easier said than done.  &amp;#x200B;  In any case, I hope you're feeling better, and I hope you either fit the pants of found a pair even cuter xx ",False,False

My aunt used to say stuff like that and try to give me her clothes that were ""too big"", and it was really just because she dealt with low self esteem and her own disordered eating.
