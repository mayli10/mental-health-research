I get it off amazon and it’s like a miracle...I’ve seen it at grocery stores. I can’t take regular laxatives/don’t want to but this will make u go if u need to go without fail. I got it when I was fasting constantly and getting really deficient in electrolytes, but it will make u poop and quickly too. Oh also a product called calm has helped a lot of people (it’s the same ingredient, magnesium). Just make sure U take enough.",False,False

Gave me a lotttt of really painful intestinal distress but did get things moving. I guess it works by irritating your colon to such an extent that it induces muscle contractions.   Potassium chloride in salt substitutes gets things moving for me too (found this out by accident when trying to replenish electrolytes). Turns out a “salt flush” is a thing and I guess my body is super sensitive.   There’s a bunch of forms of magnesium on the market too (citrate, oxide, glycinate) dunno which form you tried but I think the citrate form is most common for constipation.   Aaand at a certain point getting input from your doctor is probably prudent since complications can arise with too much backup.",False,False
