I was going to be around 500 but literally as I was falling asleep I was craving a protein bar and mindlessly got up and ate it. I was still under 800 for the day after but felt like crap because I knew if I had just gone to sleep I could have been 200 cals laughter for the day.   All I can say is that there is nothing wrong with us, it’s just our disordered thinking. That is still way less than a normal person or a healthy amount and it’s just our stupid brains. It can be really frustrating and I’m sorry you’re feeling that way ❤️",False,False
