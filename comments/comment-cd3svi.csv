I'm staying at my parent's for a few days and my dad was nipping out to pick something up from the shop and I asked if he'd get me some Coke while he's here.   He rolls his eyes at the mention of ""diet"" or ""zero"" but he came back with some zero.  I was so so so so so so so paranoid that on the way home he'd tip some out and stick loads of sugar in it, or replace it with normal coke.  (To be honest, I'm still wondering if he did but it doesn't taste sweet but still...)  &amp;#x200B;  I once watched a docu about a girl with anorexia and her parents said they put sugar and cream in her rice pudding without her knowing.  Yeah, so I'm paranoid about anything not sealed.  I would definitely NOT ever buy a diet coke in a cup from anywhere.    &amp;#x200B;  Sometimes I think that other people are sneaky because I'm one sneaky biatch because if the ED.    &amp;#x200B;  Bit of a ramble, but I don't understand why people even drink regular coke.  Why rot your teeth with all that sugar?  They put something in the mix to stop people gagging because if we tasted the sweetness without it we WOULD gag.  Zero tastes great.",False,False
