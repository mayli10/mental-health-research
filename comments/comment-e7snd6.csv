Honestly didn't even look at the subreddit, just saw the post and considered a comment since sometimes people need a hit of ""stop victimizing yourself and just get the job done"".  You may read it as acting superior, but it is more like echoing a truth that most people know to be true but it hurts to hear. Personally I've gone through a lot of this emotional garbage before I started to actually get shit done and your life really starts coming together and you become MUCH happier. We all need to let go of our ego in the sense that we shouldn't need to be told that we're perfect in every way at all times, we're constantly learning and adapting and if you truely have no ego, moments like you described are not traumatic, they are moments of solution seeking.",False,False

It's basically saying you should have additional verbal protection because you're a woman even though you are asking for other's thoughts on your situation - I'm just delivering concepts that are difficult to accept because they require change by you - the hardest and most insulting thing to tell someone to do. Most of the time people just want to have a bubble here for people to tell them that the problem isn't them.  Doesn't really matter if you're a normal weight (body composition matters way more than weight does - muscle=weight), If you don't want to lose weight or go to the gym to earn a better body and it bothers you a lot that your boyfriend struggles to find your body attractive, it's time to move on. Just laying out the reality as it is, no fantasy fluff. If I were speaking to you as a man I'd just say stop being a pussy about it and go to the gym if you care so much - generally women are insulted by being treated like that though because they're used to being treated like fragile creatures that need to be spoken to in the least offending and most empowering way possible.  Is he fit? Because if he is, he's justified in requiring his partner be fit if that's a big attraction trigger for him, equal investment into the relationship and he has lead by example. If he's a slob, well, I'm sure you would have roasted him back already - in that case just go to the gym together and make it a team building thing. Ask him for an example of a body he'd like you to work towards and make a plan to move in that direction. Worst case scenario you get a bangin bod and you have much better sexual prospects.   The standards of society is also going up with social media and Instagram models everywhere - for men too, but men are slightly less impacted because female attraction also triggers from other factors that are not strictly physical, although it remains a majority factor.",False,False

He thinks your fat 2. You are going to be distracted during sex because you want to feel sexy and you now believe you aren't sexy to him.  Well, I'm going to answer this as I would anyone else, men included and it's not PC, but it's the truth.  He has been holding this thought for probably months and hasn't been sure how to tell you that he a. Wants you to lose weight so that he is more attracted to you and more excited about sex with you, and b. Wear things that make you AND HIM look better in public (almost nobody wants to show off a partner who they don't think people will think highly of) - he should want to be your trophy to show off as much as you for him.  Sound bad? Well it's not, we all do this and have certain standards on our partners. What if a partner took up smoking and you can't stand it, but they are amazing in every other way? Leave suddenly, or see if you can help them solve the issue? Can you force someone to change? No, but you can certainly insist.  MEN AND WOMEN CANNOT CHANGE THEIR PHYSICAL ATTRACTION TO CERTAIN BODY TYPES OR PERSONALITIES AND IT IS CRUCIAL TO HAVE BOTH BODY AND MENTAL ATTRACTION OR THE RELATIONSHIP WILL FAIL.  Same thing with weight gain, he might think you're AMAZING, but your health is an issue that he thinks he needs to bring up for the relationship to be a success long term.   If he was thinking short term he'd just leave.  If he's still initiating sex without you pushing for it, he still is sexually aroused by your body shape. KNOW THAT AND BELIEVE IT - coming from a man, this is 100% true, if I don't find a girl attractive I find it VERY hard to motivate myself to initiate regularly, just biology.  Think about if something you find attractive about a man (usually for men it's a fit body on a woman), and imagine your boyfriend was going further and further away from that and towards something you find very unattractive, eventually you'd either bring it up or leave.  YOU NEED TO START FIXING THE ISSUE AND STOP WORRYING ABOUT IT. If you want this guy, don't victimize yourself and do what it takes to make it work.  It is unhealthy to be overweight, you should be taking care of yourself regardless.",False,False

This is pretth concerning since he doesnt seem to understand if you say something that upsets someone it does t matter how you meant it you upset them therefore you should apologize for your actions hurting them. And if you dk r understand why this is a time for a conversation and it seems like he doesnt get it. Id keep your eyes peeled for similar behavior in the futurr,False,False

My boyfriend has nothing but concern. He understands how much these diseases rot my brain and my logic. When he knows I’m restricting or body checking too much, he hides the scales and lets me have them once every three days.   He knows nothing about this disease but he knows I and my mind need support to get rid of the illogical infection.   OP, I’m so sorry your bf has said this. You are absolutely right to feel so hurt. He said something hurtful.  We are just internet strangers, it’s difficult for us to fully assess your relationship, only you can do that.   If this was my relationship (which is pretty solid after a few years) I’d be having a discussion to ask him his understanding of this disease. That it’s of the mind, not just the food, and how his words played into that as well as were just hurtful body shaming comments that I don’t agree with.  If he loves me and supports me then that includes my mind when it is sick and my body when it changes.   If you can’t even have that conversation or something like it, it sounds like you are walking on eggshells. That is a red flag, so figure out a plan to love yourself.",False,False

HUH????????  He NEEDS to be GONE. These two comments together are EXTREMELY worrying for me. Was this something he'd said already at some other time, or did he say this in response to you trying to talk to him just now!? Either way, having a boyfriend who tells you that any eating disorder isn't really a big deal (which is already bad) and THEN goes on to make disparaging comments about how your body looks is a BIG! RED! FLAG!  Speaking of red flags, this:  &gt;promise \[you\] won’t take it personally   ... is like Manipulation 101. I'm not saying your boyfriend is definitely manipulating you, or abusive, but this train of ""logic"" - telling you something upsetting, but also making you promise you won't get upset, so that they can basically insult you without repercussions and chip away at your self-esteem or make you look irrational/unfair if you DO get upset by the upsetting thing they said - is certainly a tactic used by many abusive partners. It's often them ""testing the waters"", so to speak. If you let them get away with brazenly insulting you and undermining you to your face simply because they told you that you had to, then they'll know they can get away with more in the future. Soon, they won't even make you promise not to get upset before they insult you, they'll just insult you, because they already know you won't get upset.  Again. Not saying your bf is 100% for-sure trying intentionally to manipulate you this way because that gets thrown around a lot on this website. But it is a red flag and you shouldn't have to put up with someone who makes you feel like this.  Also I bet you look amazing in crop tops, just saying.",False,False

Your bf shouldn't be saying that bulimia isn't the worst to deal with. He should be concerned that he is triggering/encouraging behavior that is harmful to yourself.   When I told my Bf he was concerned. When I accidentally make ed jokes to him without thinking he's concerned. When I actively am debating foods or am triggered over something he's concerned.
