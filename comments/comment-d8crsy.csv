Maybe you traded one unhealthy relationship for another?,False,False

You've been through a lot of trauma, especially with regards to your previous relationship. I'm worried about your current relationship as well; I'm not going to jump to conclusions, but it sounds like you're being gaslighted for your own eating disorder by your current boyfriend. My (23M) current partner (21M) is understandably concerned for my health, but would _never_ force me to eat if I wasn't comfortable or gaslight me by saying I've hurt him by having an eating disorder. You need support and you're getting blame and anger instead, which isn't what you need to feel comfortable while you're trying to recover.   If you need advice/support, feel free to reach out and message me!",False,False

I think that, however sick it is, this disorder is a part of who I am now. And I’m not ready to let go of it yet. Does that maybe ring true for you too?",False,False
