I don´t really want to go to the doctors because my doctor is kind of weird, the last time I had to go there (which also was the first time i met the doctor cuz i  switched doctors) he told me i should ""heal my inner child"" when i just wanted to get my bloodwork done and leave lol  But now that you said it I´m considering it because at least I don´t have to deal with my anxiety when I go to the doctors... so thx for the idea :)",False,True
