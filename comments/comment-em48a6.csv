Yeah a few of you have mentioned it should come up much later which is fair. I guess I have to shake the feeling that I'm lying/hiding by not revealing relatively early.  I guess it's also because I don't want to get hurt? So if I start seeing someone for months and really like them, then mention it and they do a runner - I'd be broken. Whereas if it is mentioned after a couple dates and they are still around, it gives me the ""freedom"" to fall for them",False,True

Yeah I guess I should wait but I always felt like I was being deceiving by not telling them? Like I kind of got them under a false pretence and then hit them with something from almost out of nowhere unless I try and phase it in.  I guess I have to be trusting of people to not run away after they know me and I tell them,False,True

But at some point it has to come out and usually feel I wait for the right cue but clearly.... I need to learn when,False,True

It makes most women really uncomfortable, especially with the fact that it's seen as very strange/shameful for a man to have.   I haven't dated since it started, but i have had to tell a few girls (was obvious due to my body) They were all supportive but they found it weird.",False,False

Now he's special ops in the military and was honestly the last person I expected to have an ED. I found out about 4 months about his ED and he found out about mine about a month later. I think this was a good time to bring it up, we had solidified that we cared about each other enough to deal with this kind of ""baggage.""   Honestly his ED wasn't a deal breaker for me, but I would have been very uncomfortable had it come up on a first date. Waiting until there is a bond or connection is very important, it can be hard to care about someone you just met sometimes but after a few months its less scary and more about support than anything.",False,False

All mental problems scare me off.   My ex was chronically depressed/suicidal and now I'm more hesitant to start a relationship again with someone that has mental problems. It was heavy those years.   I have now been on first dates with men who said they were : schizophrenic, bipolar or depressed. All of them I did not pursue. I'm not perfect, I have my own problems, but I'm scared to dive in with a partner who has it because I experienced how heavy it can be and immediately get scarred.  However, I had great months /years with people who did not talk about it the first dates but as we get to know each other later on talked about their problems. As you said it's more in the past with you, I would wait a while.",False,False
