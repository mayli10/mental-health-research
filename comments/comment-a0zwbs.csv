Where do you work? Haha I feel like I have to know what place throws a holiday party where you have to wear long gowns. ,False,False

I‚Äôve known for a couple weeks now and boyyyy have I been planning for it (bc I cant be fat af for the 3rd party)  1st party - At a buffet restaurant. They rented out a section of the place. Probably gonna be 50 people there. My plan so far: I figured if I just keep getting up and get small portions of salad or lettuce or some low cal thing they won‚Äôt notice I‚Äôm not eating a lot. Lol I feel bad tho bc the buffet is pretty expensive per person but UGH I don‚Äôt need it.   2nd party - At some huge function room in the office. Probably 100+ people. I think they‚Äôre ordering food from a caterer. My plan: Pull the keto card since they usually don‚Äôt get healthy or low carb food anyway. Also there‚Äôs less people so it‚Äôs easier to not get noticed.   3rd party - Fancy event in a hotel ballroom. We have to wear formal long gowns and stuff. The entire company (400-500 people?) is coming. So it‚Äôll probably be catered by the hotel and be a buffet set up. Might just fill up my plate with something low cal or low carb and push it around. It‚Äôs gonna be dark and there‚Äôs a lot of people sooo I‚Äôm hoping no one cares if I don‚Äôt actually eat much. ,False,False

I was the weird one who would order something small and eat all of it, and I was the one who drew the most attention.
