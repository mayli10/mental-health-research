I think it's because certain emotional needs weren't met as a child and people being concerned about me makes me... happy in a sense? It's validating, certainly. I'm noticed, but because people are worried, not because I'm weird. I've only ever been not noticed, or noticed because I'm weird. Concern is nice.",False,False

I don’t think it’s a cry for attention at all but I think ppl’s concerns or even saying you’re too skinny feels nice. I feel like if ppl really wanted to help they would completely stop taking about my weight loss,False,True

I love it so much too when I am thin and my husband will like just touch my hip bone or something. The other night that happened, I was on my back and he ran his hand on my hipbone and he said I was seeming thinner and it sadly imbues a feeling of success in me especially because he said it concerned. :/ for me, weight comments only fuel me if they come form concern and love. Maybe ultimately my ed is about feeling more loved anyway...",False,False
