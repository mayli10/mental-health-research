Add spring or red onions, bell pepper, bean sprouts, and sliced radish for crunch.  For dressing I either add a bunch of hummus, which bulks the calorie and protein count nicely, then crumble in a couple of falafel balls, or I make a Vietnamese goi-inspired dressing with soy sauce, sweet chili sauce, garlic/chili paste, lime juice, and liquid stock/""fish"" sauce, then toss in some thin rice noodles and tofu cubes (I usually lightly fry mine but you can also bake them).  They are light, easy meals that can still fill you up!",False,False

I don't think the other person was telling you how to think or speak about these foods in general, or that foods like donuts or cakes are ""good"", but offering some alternative descriptions for this specific subreddit to lessen a chance of triggering someone else's purge or binge.  Since the last sub got demolished for ""encouraging"" EDs we have to be extra careful about the langauge we use here.",False,False

I top it with either granola or puffed cereal to make it a little more significant.   Fish is also a great way to switch up your protein. I buy frozen pollock, cook it in the oven until it's flaky but not falling apart and have it over a bed of mixed veggies and rice/couscous.",False,False

Not sure what your budget is, frozen cooked rice is def more expensive that making it yourself but the convenience/portion control is nice enough that I splurge for it. Frozen component meals are the perfect mix of nutrient density, variety, and laziness for me. If it's warm outside I start making some salads: just use a bed of greens instead of frozen veggies and change out the sauces for dressings.",False,False

Also, I don't buy the whole ""there is no such thing as bad food"" thing. Bullshit. Donuts, cake, anything that's essentially just refined sugars is devoid of any real nutritional value and loaded with calories. You can still eat those things if you want by all means, nothing wrong with that. But when my nutritionist was like ""oh yeah, you *need* to eat things like poptarts"" I lost all respect for her.
