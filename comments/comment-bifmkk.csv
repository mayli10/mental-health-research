I can sometimes really struggle to enjoy a film or a game more when the women in it are really beautiful and thin. Especially if I am watching with someone else, it can make me feel like they are comparing me even though the chance of that actually being a thing is probably nonexistent.   The most recent media I have missed out on due to my ED was Case 39. I actually really enjoyed the film but kept checking my body against Ren√© Zwelleger‚Äôs.",False,False

It sucks bc I love the shows and now I just think of how skinny they all are and how I won‚Äôt ever look like that,False,False

Missandei and Sansa make me SO self-conscious. Margaery Tyrell in the earlier seasons too. I wish I was tall so I could be truly thin.   All that said, I could never actually stop watching GoT because I love it so much, but I definitely enjoy it less due to my messed up body image.",False,False

I sat through the whole thing in the theatre and I was seething the whole time. Her bobble head is way too big for her body, she goes on about chocolate being her favourite food, she has a concave stomach and protruding ribs and hips when SHE‚ÄôS A FUCKING ROBOT and there‚Äôs no reason for her to look that way and when she gets her ‚Äúnew body‚Äù it‚Äôs bigger and needs to ‚Äúreshape itself to match her internal image of herself‚Äù so it shrinks down to being painfully thin and bony again?
