And you didn‚Äôt sound preach at all. Just knowing someone else understands is huge. I managed to keep myself from purging it this morning only be reminding myself of how miserable I was during my bulimic phase and how crappy I would feel afterwards. Everything you said plus the dehydration and also it‚Äôs been 10+ hours what‚Äôs would even be left in my stomach. I‚Äôve been back to restricting since September last year and omfg I just realized I‚Äôve gone an entire year without bingeing and purging. Like I realized this RIGHT NOW typing this.   Holy fucking shit.   I was gonna say I‚Äôm working through this by having some coffee and trying to remind myself that it‚Äôs one meal and that I‚Äôll be okay but literally having this epiphany is helping a ton more. I‚Äôm right there with you in the less destructive but still hellish restricting phase - trying to feed myself enough to live and little enough to keep from feeling like trash all the time. Thank you so much for reaching out to type a reply and definitely reach out if you need a boost yourself. We are all in this together whether we feel like we are or not. God it just helps to have people who understand.,False,True

It's never worth it. Bloated belly, raspy throat, shaky, dizzy. That's what will happen. Only to maybe scarf up half of ur calories (we all know how hard pizza is to purge). Just drink water, and listen to ur body. It's full. Drink water. Help it digest. You won't be as bloated tomorrow. Have a small dinner later. Have a snack in a little while. Drink more water.   Please. I'm stuck in a less destructive yet still hellish restrictive phase, and I look back at my bulimic days and wonder what the hell it was all for. I only maintained.",False,False
