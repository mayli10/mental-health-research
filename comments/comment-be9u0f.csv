I think it's the fact that baked goods are my main binge food, but it's so much more fun to bake than to cook imo. It's like, everything comes together in this sweet, bready thing that resembles none of the ingredients you put into it. With cooking, you put a chicken in the oven and get a chicken out. But with baking, you put powders and liquids together and get, BREAD?!?!Â¿Â¿???!!?  Unfortunately, I binge on whatever I make every time I bake, so I can't do it anymore. But one of my reasons to recover is to get back in the kitchen and start practicing that passion again.  I just wish they weren't so unhealthy for you. Even when I give away my treats, I feel guilty for giving people diabetes in a bag.  I can do ""healthier"" versions of things too, but it just really isn't as fun or tastes as good tbh. It took me a long time to come away from orthorexia as well, and I do think it's healthier to mindfully eat a piece of birthday cake than it is to eat a piece of paleo cake every day.",False,False

One option you could look into is local charities that feed the homeless or elderly. I bake for a local â€˜meals on wheelsâ€™ that feeds elderly. Iâ€™d also say it canâ€™t hurt to offer your neighbors. Most will probably accept, then itâ€™s up to them whether they eat or not.  I also freeze a small portion of everything I bake, to aliquot out over time when I convince myself I deserve a treat.",False,False
