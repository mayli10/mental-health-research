I remember reading ages ago that your waist measurement shouldn't exceed half of your height or else your health risks increase from too much fat around your organs, but my waist is currently 90% of that number and I'm still at the high end of a 27 bmi, so by the time it got anywhere near that measurement I was already pretty solidly obese. Same with waist to hip measurements -- 0.7 is supposed to be healthiest for women and I maintained a .68-.72 range all the way up to a 36 BMI which made it a lot easier to lie to myself about how serious my binging was getting. Is this a good thing because my risks were lower at my high weight than other people's might be, sure, but I have no fucking clue what I look like or what is a normal size to be okay with being so I spent waaay too long saying everything was fine because I was still ""proportional"". I wish I had been able to rein it in sooner (believe me I tried) instead of having so much to lose at once, I'm somewhere between 50-70% done and I'm so damn tired of restricting but I know I need to just do it now while I'm in the right mental space to lose so I can stabilize at a healthy weight and try to get off this roller coaster once and for all",False,False

My therapist once asked if I knew any women growing up who were my height, i.e. my height and a normal weight. And I didn't. My only point of reference for women my height growing up was runway models, girls on Top Model, etc., which ofc was super damaging. I thought at my height I was supposed to not just be tall, but tall \*and\* really, really thin.   I think it's interesting because when I talk with people who have ED's and are short or average height, they often feel like the ""wanting to look like a model"" thing is a stereotype, but it was very real for me lmao.",False,False

I think I maybe was wearing my pants too tight before I relapsed last year, but I lost somewhere between 25 and 30 pounds (too scared to weigh myself recently lol) and only down a pants size. The weight loss is really, really hard to see, and combined with body dysmorphia there've been times I was \*convinced\* I'd gained or stalled out when I was still steadily losing.

Like, that's what's on my ID. Why would I lie *up* lol. But now that I've lost \~30 lbs I look nearly the same and no one has noticed.

I think our (tall people lol) issue is just when our issues are invalidated by using this examples I gave.

I kind of feel you though, but sometimes people do notice and I either get told that I'm to fat when I gain weight or to skinny when I lose weight.

When I lose weight (10-20 lbs) people either don't notice or if they do, they say that I'm to skinny but when I gain that many lbs (10-20 lbs) people kind of imply that I'm fat or they ignore it. I know that feeling of when people don't notice your weight loss or when people say that you hold your weight well. People in general suck, especially when it comes to weight.
