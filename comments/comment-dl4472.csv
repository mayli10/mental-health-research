I was born with a shitty (pun intended) system and always had issues with stools anyways so i think I can say Iâ€™m not a stranger to Miralax, part of it taking awhile to kick in on my part could be due to some other issues anyways considering things.  Since itâ€™s a stool softener and not a hard laxative at the very least I think itâ€™s still giving your body a more active role in the process. Iâ€™ve had to take it daily for a week sometimes here and there just to get my system on track and functioning but I havenâ€™t noticed any dependency issues since Iâ€™ve had times where I could go a long while without any need for it.  In general to anyone out there though itâ€™s best to consult your doctor if you need to use it longer than what it says itâ€™s fine by.",False,False
