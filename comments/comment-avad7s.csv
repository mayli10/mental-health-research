But my perspective on zero waste has always been that individual environmental responsibility first falls to people in good financial, physical, and mental health. I'd never blame someone in poverty buying pre-packaged food or someone with a disability that necessitates certain items for not ""doing their part"". Right now I'm living with a limited income for the rest of the year and my mental health has gone down the drain. I won't be mad at myself for producing more plastic than normal, even if it's not ideal.",False,False

I'm an environmentalist to the point that t manifests in my OCD and I get anxiety attacks if I do *anything* to produce waste. I'm also vegan and reuse allll the things. But I'll be damned if a safe food comes in plastic packaging or I need a La Croix. There are times when the ED wins out and I just feel guilty from the OCD, and vice versa when I just go hungry instead of hurt the environment.",False,False

I feel so fucking awful. I haven‚Äôt had any meat in years and I‚Äôm not tempted at all, but when I‚Äôm binging, I order all of the pizza, all of the cheese sticks, and all of the milk chocolate that I can afford.  It sickens me.  I went vegan for the animals, and here I am now, contributing to their suffering. When I buy Nestle products, not only am I paying someone to do harm to animals, but the environment as well.  I hate myself for it, but I‚Äôm really trying to go back to being good. When I‚Äôm restricting, I don‚Äôt have as much of a problem, but even then, I try to fit at least one stupid candy bar into my calorie limit.  I hate it so much, I was doing so well, and now I‚Äôm a fat, greedy, monster. ",False,False

I don't buy soda often but when I do I'm seriously overwhelmed with guilt over the plastic that I'm using that it hurts my stomach. Constant cognitive dissonance.  Wasting food is a big no-no for me when I'm not knee-deep in my ED. I put away my leftover everything and eat it later in the week. When I'm struggling a lot leftover food is a challenge for me, so I tend to not keep it when I have extras. I have pet rats so they help with some of the food waste, but the amount I throw away hurts me. The next time I get paid I'm going to look into starting to compost for this reason",False,False

No animal products, gluten, soy, dairy, processed food (mostly) etc. Only whole foods plant based. Then I get shit hammered on the weekends. Sometimes a few days in a row. Usually end up binge eating a jar of honey or a few pounds of figs or something and destroying my blood sugar. Cue edema and palpitations and generally feeling like I'm going to die. If booze wasn't involved I probably wouldn't. Kinda weird that I'm afraid of eating too many beans, grains, or fruit, and God forbid a damn muffin but I'll sure as shit get wasted in my meds and fuck my liver.",False,False

Buying everything fresh and from bulk bins was time consuming but at the same time I liked being able to buy just two fig bars at a time, rather than a whole package. It also limited the things I could buy (and I am all about restricting options!) - can‚Äôt purchase crisps because they come in trash. I‚Äôm not encouraging you to use your eco-guilt to fuel your ED, nor am I trying to brag about how ‚Äúclean‚Äù our groceries were. I also realise we were quite privledged to have access to an amazing grocery store, time to shop frequently, and the money to opt for more expensive green versions. Anyway, I think being aware of ones impact is admirable, even if right now you‚Äôre not taking every step to minimize your footprint.  To answer your last question: I am tied up in so many contradictions! I have always wanted to live effortlessly and not care about my appearance and yet I devote so much attention to my body and looks. My mother is naturally slender and has a healthy self-image (I know this because we‚Äôve talked a lot about how she can‚Äôt comprehend my struggle) and while I don‚Äôt recall her ever saying anything negative about dieting or trying to lose weight, I think I inherited this idea that those things are lame, ‚Äúbeneath us‚Äù, shameful. I have wondered if maybe that contributed to my ED initially: I was scared of my changing body but couldn‚Äôt diet so I developed a medical condition with the same result. As a feminist I don‚Äôt want my looks to define my worth and yet *I judge myself* based on my looks, numbers. I theoretically reject many societal beauty ideals, disgusted by skinny celeb culture, etc etc whatever, and yet I am obsessed with my weight and myself being skinny. So at the end of the day I‚Äôm pretty disgusted with myself and feel like a complete hypocrite. ",False,False

I'm fussy with what I eat most of the time, but I often cook my own low cal versions of things instead of buying them.
