But today I realized that I might have a problem. Using this thread (as always) as my personal diary cuz I won't meet with my therapist until Friday.   &amp;#x200B;  I was talking about a kpop group with online strangers, right. And then I realized that I don't really trust any of the kpop idols or anyone in the kpop industry. Like. I'm high-key paranoid over EVERYTHING. Everyone has an ulterior motive, there's a grand scheme behind everything.  &amp;#x200B;  And, what the fuck. It scared me because I finally saw, with clarity, that it's how I perceive everything. X TV show has advertisements hidden, but still subliminally there. Y video game is working with an airplane company to normalize airplane miles as a concept among youth. He made that youtube video because he wants to keep the fans watching and the sponsorships incoming.  &amp;#x200B;  He responded to my snapchat because I'm on the same team as him and he wants me to feel welcome. She listened to my story because she wants to get closer to me because I'm friends with her boyfriend. She responded to my groupme group message because shes the team captain and wants to come off as friendly.  &amp;#x200B;  My brain. It does not turn off. I'm CONSTANTLY assuming motives behind actions and it makes me feel disengaged from reality. I'm obsessed about animals because their intentions are easily teased out of their actions. People? I feed off of what I assume they get out of our relationship and keep building that usefulness. Once I know that they get out of knowing me, I keep that.   &amp;#x200B;  Sitting down with myself and questioning my line of thinking makes me nauseated.  &amp;#x200B;  hhkjhsdjkhksdg I have friends who LOVE me and want to talk to me and I have professors who want me in their class why is my brain so fucking broken!!!!!!!! It's an ED it's OCD it's DEPRESSION it's INSOMNIA it's bouncing from mental illness to mental illness because as soon as I get over one another one comes to fill the void.   &amp;#x200B;  I have panic attacks every other day and I don't get it. I'm so normal and happy around people. I have so many great friendships and support systems. But as soon as I'm alone I forget how to exist as Me.
