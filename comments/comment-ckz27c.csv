Yes i experience both, no matter what my weight is, or whether I’m in remission or not. When I’m not well they are both much less frequent and intense, and  I’m much less inclined to notice them and much more comfortable with ignoring them; but they’re both still there.",False,False

If you’ve been eating disordered for any length of time, just being a “normal” BMI doesn’t make you healthy. Your body (AND BRAIN) needs a lot of time to actually repair and recover from the damage of starvation/malnutrition/abuse.   When I allowed myself to fully attempt recovery, not controlling my weight at all, i experienced that extreme hunger, nutrient hunger, for something like 1-3 months. Decreasingly intense after a month or so. But during that time I ate so so so much. Until I felt sick I was so full. But it was necessary for my body. Eventually that feeling went away and I stayed at my body’s natural happy weight without having to monitor my intake or exercise at all.   I allowed myself to not worry about losing weight for a long while. A few years. Stepping away from all the behaviors and destructive thoughts allowed me to heal. Now I’m able to exercise and make changes to my diet without going off the deep end and making myself sick. I can lose weight more healthily now when I want to.   Be compassionate with yourself. Eat when your body tells you it needs more. Allow yourself to overeat a little when you really want it. Don’t worry about gaining weight. That’s what happens in recovery and it’s normal. Your body might be happiest and healthiest above a BMI of 20! Let your body guide you to what it needs. It knows best, don’t let your pesky brain sabotage your body’s healing.",False,False

I can't say that it went away at a particular weight, more so went away when I just fed my body what it wanted. When I introduce a new food, I crave it incessantly because it's like my body is making up for not having it. Once I have it regularly, that craving really seems to go away.",False,False
