The earliest memory I have of binge eating is at 5/6 when I hid from my mother and ate margarine from the tub.  I can divide my life into phases of binge eating and binge eating/reactive restricting. At 15 I was able to lose from 190 to 160 and then maintained for quite some time, but I still binged and restricted.  If I look back, the times I would gain rapidly were the times I would not try to track at all after binge eating episodes. Other times the ""restricting"" would not touch anything the binges did and I would still gain, or I would maybe maintain, but, more like- gain 15lbs lose 15lbs for years at a time.   All the while having awful episodes if binge eating, often daily but at least 3-4x a week.   As for eating ""healthy"" I did start eating better foods around 17/18 when I started cooking for myself after learning to cook a lot of stuff in the group home I worked at. However, I would still have episodes of binge eating. I could eat all the health food in the world, hell I can binge on health food. I have at times simply been over eating (or just eating fast food meals too frequently) AND also binge eating on top of it.  Binges are emotionally exhausting. ",False,False

I too spent my teens overweight, like, literally from the ages of 12-19/20, so I know exactly what you're talking about (though I wasn't obese as a child, but I definitely think that's a lot worse and am very grateful I didn't become overweight until I developed BED at least at 12).  But, when you gained the weight, 1) Were you bingeing? And 2) Were you eating healthy? Like actually healthy?  I ask this because my hunger cues were out of whack after all the years of bingeing as well, but I somehow reset them when I thought I never would. That being said though, again, I wasn't an obese child, so I'm curious with you.",False,False

I'm not trying to be argumentitive, I've just seen a lot of (specifically anorexia) recovery blogs conflating binge eating after restricting/anorexia with BED. Living through being obese/overweight for most of your life is just a different experience for your body, and I have never experienced real starvation. My body isn't binge eating to heal(which is what a lot of recovery blogs discuss).   My brain is fucked. I don't do myself any favors when I restrict obsessively and I don't do myself any favors by trying to maintain at a low normal bmi(19). I could be and probably should be content at a slightly higher weight ( think BMI 22-23)   Like, if I could just stop obsessing over my weight at this point I could join the ranks of people who successfully dieted out of obesity, but I am so fucking terrified of gaining it back (because I did that from 18-24) that I can't let go.",False,False

I'm talking 15-20lbs in a couple months. Once it was 30lbs in 2-3 months.    I am at a normal weight now, but I think childhood obesity fucked up my ""intuition"" and I will never be able to achieve that. Which is something I've been able to discuss with my BIL because he grew up obese too. But I can't be quite as candid as I'd like to be with him.

Perhaps counting Calories is okay just to learn what is a serving size, but eventually, binge eaters in recovery will probably have to quit counting as well. It's easy to get obsessive and unhealthy over it. Personally for me, things didn't get better until I stopped obsessively weighing every morsel of food I ate, but I still eyeball Calories quite often. But tbh, perhaps other than just to learn appropriate servings sizes, almost no ED therapist would recommend even a binge eater to count Calories. It's usually a recipe for disaster for us.  Also, ThisSoCalledBingeEater was one, but he had a big freak out and deleted all of his videos a couple days ago.. but yeah, he was trying to count Calories for recovery as well, though he was a novice at it.",False,False

Well, Follow The Intuition recently made a video about binging and Kayla Rose Kotecki has addressed the topic several times. However I think it's Tabitha Farrar who touches the most on this topic. She's addressed both binging after a restrictive ED and binging without ever having had a restrictive ED (she specifically mentioned this study in which pregnant rats were fed calorie-restrictive diets and as a result their offspring consumed what was considered an excess of calories. Not saying that this study is conclusive and many of her ideas are very pseudo-science-y and oversimplified but it may be a start). I think the video title was something about obesity? Anyway, she also addressed it in her second to last podcast, which is up on her youtube. Apart from that, Jessica Marie Harding made a video specifically on how to stop a binge, if I remember correctly. Hope that helped, best of luck!",False,True
