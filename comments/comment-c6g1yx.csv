Just be honest with him and tell him when you’re struggling and how he can help you. The worst part of being a partner with someone who is struggling is feeling helpless.

If you’re helping yourself, if your partner is resilient enough, they can at least hold out hope that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. They can cope with supporting you, holding you accountable, trying to wrap their head around something that is unfathomable to them, only if they can look at you and think “she is trying so hard and one day she will beat this and we can be both happy together.”  However he cannot deal with all that if all you have to offer them is “you can just stand by helplessly and watch me kill myself.” No one is equipped to be able to stay with someone who is slowly destroying themselves. They cannot come away unscathed as you self destruct. People leave for way less. Or if his self-esteem sucks, he’ll stay and let your deterioration completely destroy him.   If you really love him and want to stay, you have to save yourself. Otherwise you’re only going to give him a corpse to love. I urge you to please get in touch with a therapist. The only way to stop someone who loves you from worrying is to get better, or at least try to.",False,False

So I’m just open and honest with my husband. Also helps having additional support outside of the relationship; a romantic partner might feel really overwhelmed if they feel they’re the only person supporting someone.,False,False
