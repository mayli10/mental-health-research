This, but I can’t imagine it with PCOS so bless you and your strength. My parents have both gained weight in their older years. My dad has drank 1 coke a day since I was born basically. He cut it out - dropped like 20lbs. Doing NOTHING else different. My mom, a healthy angel, eats literally 1 80 cal yogurt per day and a normal dinner. Gained about 15lbs. Probably just from THINKING about a cookie. It’s so hard. I have my own issues too. You’re not alone. I wish it was that easy too. I’m hungry. The scale isn’t moving.",False,False
