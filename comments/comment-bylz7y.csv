Bingeing and restricting can be a particularly vicious cycle. This may not be very helpful, but you really should reach out and seek treatment. You are far from the only one who experiences this kind of thing--lots of people having disordered eating, lots of people who were formerly overweight fail to achieve a positive body image even after they lose weight, lots of people find themselves in the nasty cycle of ""I hate my body, I need to lose weight as quickly as possible"" and ""Fuck it, let me eat this entire bag of cookies"". That's why there are resources out there to help you.  Your mental health is important and you deserve to have a positive image of yourself. You did the right thing by coming here and venting your worries and frustrations; a lot of people who struggle with eating disorders feel ashamed of what they're thinking but just being honest about how you are thinking and feeling is absolutely crucial to recovery.   I think that maybe the next step for you is talking to your mom. I'm not sure what type of relationship you have with her but it's evident that she was concerned about you before so perhaps she could help you find the help that you need to recover. Another good thing to do is to talk your friends about what you're going through; having support is also really important to recovery. And if you feel like you don't have anybody that you can go to, there are always people right here who understand. Feel free to message me absolutely anytime if you feel like you need somebody to talk to.",False,False
