You don't have to talk about anything deep and if you're near her just hang around. You don't need to talk about food or eat food with her if you can't bring yourself to do so. I used to live with my grandma and she was my rock but she unfortunately passed when we were in a car accident and I've missed her everyday and I regret me turning down some of the dinners she made some days and I can hear her being upset with me anytime I'm worrying about calories or the scale after some bad days. She had her own weight issues and would be off and on keto so we had some disagreements but she did all she could for me.,False,False

My grandma and I are So Close, she is the person in my life that I connect with more than anyone else. When I relapsed badly a year ago and isolated myself completely, I even avoided her. It was too painful to see her, and to admit to her that I wasn‚Äôt doing well. I felt so much shame I couldn‚Äôt bare for her to see me. After two months of avoiding her she came to see me out of the blue, and told me that I didn‚Äôt need to apologize for my life, and that she just wanted to be there with me, no matter what I was going through. Her unconditional love is something that my ED and anxiety had convinced me didn‚Äôt exist, but I know now that she‚Äôs one person that I never need to feel shame around. I really hope you can text your grandma back and maybe talk with her a little. It doesn‚Äôt need to be anything deep, just chatting about light stuff is good too. Some relationships are too special to miss out on, and if your relationship with your grandma is anything like mine with my grandma I really hope for the best for you. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False
