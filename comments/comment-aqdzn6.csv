Gerber Baby's Hawaiian Delight is lit af and it's so filling but simultaneously bordering along sickeningly sweet that I can only ever finish 1/2 of the tub at once. It's ridiculous how good it is. I have yet to try the Puffs, though.",False,False

My roommate sophomore year saw it in my fridge and made so much fun of me for it, and still brings it up over a year later to poke fun at me in front of people. I told her I just like the taste - it’s not like I can scream “I HAVE AN ED” at her. Love the girl but damn I can’t eat it anymore ",False,False
