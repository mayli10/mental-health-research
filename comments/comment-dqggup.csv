BUT once that initial dust settled, I feel good. There's another side to get to. Its okay.  I called friends and called in support. I made lists and took care if my business (bank accounts, phone lines, locks etc) and got things done. I hugged my daughter and loved her as hard as I could. We will get through this.  So if anyone is reading this someday, feeling like the world is ending, don't worry. It is :)  And there is freedom and beauty somewhere on the other side.    If I got this, you got this.",False,True

Apparently I was too ""fat"" (BMI 19 then) and I made him cheat as well. TF? And he started to lie that his uncle gifted him all the money he stole from me, but his story leaked.   Heal and focus on your life, your child, your goals. It took me 3 years to truly appreciate the tearing down of my life and self esteem. Watching Fight Club helped me to pull through a lot of darkness.  You will come out soo much stronger and girl, you have us to rant to. (:",False,False

I spent the day at a friends house ugly crying and watching nature documentaries. Im at home, he has not been back here, but I have friends staying with me because apparently I'm surrounded by kick ass people who really turn out. I'm so greatful for everyone.  I feel like I'm going through an exorcism. Its unreal. I thought we were it...8 years and a child is a lot. There isn't a way to untangle our life. We had one life.   Meanwhile, I had not eaten since Thursday and successfully had some instant mashed potatoes tonite. Because what's a good crisis without stress induced fasting, amirite? Hey at least I wasn't home alone all day to binge on my daughters like 9 pounds of trick or treating candy.   I can't believe I'm supposed to do homework and go to class like nothings happening and my life didn't just self destruct.  I'm told it will get easier. But god damn.",False,True

I contacted the legal council on campus but they can't advise either of us because we are both students. Some conflict of interest policy.  I am really not a fan of police. I compromised with my sister and agreed to contact the doymestic abuse survivor legal people. While I'm still in enough denial to think that maaaaybe this wasn't Abuse, I admit that he's acting so irrationally that it easily could become abusive.",False,True
