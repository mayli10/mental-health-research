Normally I try to get back on track after a day of overeating which is often twice as much as my maintenance but I feel so awful cause I ate so much that I have to eat more the next few days (or even weeks) and itâ€™s a repeated cycle so I keep overeating until I see the number on the scale go back up to what I started with. This cycle keeps repeating and Iâ€™ve been losing the same 10 lbs for a year now. I wish it would stop because clearly this weight loss thing isnâ€™t working for me and Iâ€™m just gaining it all right back so why am I not ready to end this yet?? ðŸ™ƒðŸ™ƒ,False,False
