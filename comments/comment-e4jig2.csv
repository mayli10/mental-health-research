I got up to about a gram and a half a week, and on top of being way too expensive for how little I was making at my job I was also running into issues socially and in college. I felt like I couldn‚Äôt be a full person without it - couldn‚Äôt write my papers for class, couldn‚Äôt leave my house to see friends, couldn‚Äôt look myself in the eyes anymore. I finally had enough when I finished about a G by myself and fucked some dude who didn‚Äôt even seem to care about who he happened to be having sex with - I‚Äôd been having a lot of casual sex on coke and couldn‚Äôt do it anymore after that. I met my current partner around that time and he helped me see how little I was benefiting from the coke, and it really changed my life.  You may feel like you would never get addicted, never depend on it, but I think that all people who struggle with substance abuse once start off thinking that way. The high will never ever be worth the chase if you‚Äôre sacrificing happiness and health for yourself in the process. Don‚Äôt buy anymore. Put your money away somewhere, delete your dealer‚Äôs number, confide in a friend who can help you stay on track. All you‚Äôre doing right now is running away from your eating disorder and the pain in your life that coke helps you numb. At some point you‚Äôll have to face it, and you don‚Äôt want to do that when you‚Äôre rock-bottom in the midst of a drug addiction.  Best of luck, love. ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False

I bought it sort of on an impulse but I‚Äôm realizing the slippery slope it could lead me down if I continue. It‚Äôs a great idea to put that money aside if I do feel tempted to get more to seeing a psychiatrist, I think I‚Äôll do that. Thanks so much‚Äî this is really helpful! üíï",False,True

I‚Äôve received a lot of comments telling me it‚Äôs not worth it, and it isn‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt even afford it, really. I don‚Äôt plan on buying anymore.

If you feel like buying more put that money towards a trip to the doctor to get a prescription. I know what a slippery slope using drugs as a coping mechanism can be but the good news is it sounds like you‚Äôve already realized this yourself. Now is the time to come up with a plan to find a healthier and legal alternative. I don‚Äôt feel comfortable putting it in a post but a counselor (of all people) I saw once told me about a prescription medication that is similar to adderal/Ritalin but is also prescribed for binge eating disorders because it curbs apatite. I know it‚Äôs still technically drug use but at least this way you aren‚Äôt running the risk of being caught with/ being on illegal substances and fucking up your future with a criminal record. My biggest suggestion though is to make sure buying this coke is a one time thing. Once you start making excuses for buying it a second time it‚Äôs so much easier to allow yourself a third and fourth time until it becomes a true habit. Hang in there. I know the pressure of college can really suck the life out of you but you just need to push through and get that degree.,False,False

Literally up to like 10 ish bumps or 3 lines a day (depending on if I was working or not) for over a year. Weight stagnated, constant runny nose, I started getting nosebleeds when I had never had one in my life. I only stopped because I straight up got caught with my hand in the cookie jar. Now looking back I wish I had gotten caught sooner because all the sneaking around was so not me. Also I thought I was more social too. Turns out I was just talking everyone's ears off. It was a huge waste of money, time, and I made other questionable decisions while on it. You do you, but seriously be careful. That shit isn't pure anymore. If you really believe you CAN stop, you absolutely should.",False,False
