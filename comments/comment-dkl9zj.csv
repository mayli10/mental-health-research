It's not, and it comes from a sincere place. I share links because hearing different opinions and advice always helps me, except in cases like yours, in which you intentionally try to hurt the person with words like ""weird."" What the fuck is that anyway? Isn't this supposed to be a group to combat all the trauma that we might have felt when other people insulted us?   And speaking of words-- you don't use ""disingenuous"" well here; its definition states that it's meant to be used in situations in which people trick others by pretending to know less than they do. Where do I feign some kind of ignorance here?  If you're going to criticize, at least check the dictionary. Thank you.",False,False

And itÂ´s funny how this word sounds exactly the same as lessons.  It really began lessening with me when I started to consume my mind not with things I could control more easily (like school for example), but when I started intentionally trying to make myself more flexible for things that are harder to predict, like people.   This is pretty extreme, but one challenge I gave myself (already a few years into recovery) was to live with a host family in a different country. Now, this host family makes YOU food. YOU HAVE NO CONTROL, except over trying to sense when youÂ´re hungry and when youÂ´re full. Sometimes this means that youÂ´re going to have to eat when itÂ´s scary and stop eating when you want to keep eating and just restrict tomorrow, but try to tell yourself when you have these impulses that the PEOPLE you are around and the THINGS you do are far more important than FOOD.   You can make up many strategies for this- I like to, at the table, when I have an impulse to keep eating even though I know IÂ´m feeling satiated, close my eyes and imagine a woman (an ideal version of myself, if you will) present in the moment, sitting back with the untouched remains lef ton her plate, and enjoying the company and or moment. My friend, on the other hand, personifies her ED, and sets up a place for her at the dinner table. She even has a name -- Ivy, like the poison. Try these two and see how you experience them. You could also try to distract yourself by thinking of the next meal youÂ´ll make (this could decrease a perceived need to binge) or even just hold and sip a warm cup of tea.   Let me know how it goes--try these thigns when you can. You must get out of this cycle, however slow it can be.  Writing this post is a victory. Now arm yourself with tools. The first article was written by me. Let me know if youÂ´d ever like to chat.
