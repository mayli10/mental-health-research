I usually eat home baked cookies or cakes with lots of chocolate. I don't know how to stop. It's like I lose all my willpower on the weekends.

I would like to get to a point where I have one cheat MEAL on Friday and that's it. I struggle badly with sweets, so at the very least I am trying to save healthy, plant based sweet recipes on Pinterest as a compromise.
