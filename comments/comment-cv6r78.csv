I mean, as ED sufferers, we know how easy it is to gain/lose weight. I put on 70 pounds at one point in my life- and lost around 75 lbs another time. All within the same time span (6 months). It's so temporary, it's meaningless. But the time you have to achieve and work hard? That's so valuable. It's so limited.  To most people, 42 kilos and 46 kilos looks the same. But not to ED sufferers. Even if you put on a ton of weight, people probably don't even notice. They'll look at your achievements.  Unless you're a Kpop idol or a celeb or smth, you don;t ***need*** to be rail-thin for success. You aren't a better person for being thinner/heavier. As long as you're a healthy BMI, you're good!",False,True

I've got friends even after literally ghosting everyone for two years (so fucking embarrassed, no comment), I can make a roomful of people laugh, I've made a good impression on every new person lately (besides accidentally trying to drink out of someone else's glass while blazed 20 secs after meeting them - *oof*)...  ...but as soon as I stop supplementing my sanity with antidepressants, my brain starts trying to convince me that I'm a weird unlikeable loser who should stay away from people for everyone's good.  And then you can't even complain about how irrational it is, because the reasons you know it's irrational sound like you're humblebragging.  But I *know* you're not humblebragging, because what you're really trying to say is how upsetting it is that the obvious objective accomplishments don't have shit on the way your brain's determined to take it.

Since most of us with eating-disorders have a type of personality that tends to fixate on one aspect of our lives, I transferred that from food and my body, to my grades. Turns out that obsessing over your weight takes a lot of time that could be spent studying/ working on your passion!   It helps to be confident about your classes! I used to think I was bad at math... BS because I spent all my study time working out or doing body checks. When I did study, my brain was foggy. Now I'm focused and just eat a small snack if I get foggy. I get 7s/ 'A' -' A+'s in Math now. That's all it took. A little confidence and effort.   Also, only doing extracurriculars you love! That's why I do well in debate/speech/MUN. If you are a more art-inclined or sports-inclined person, focus on those! They'll require less time to achieve more, than if you chose something you aren't a natural at. You can't force these things.  Right now I'm maintaining a weight of 115 lbs and I look relatively slim at 167 cm. I can't help but worry that people look at me and think I'm fat.   Some of my friends who are a little thinner tend to drop comments, but they're failing their classes and don't care about extracurriculars, so I try not to give myself a hard time. I also think that weight can be dropped whenever I feel like it, but my time to work hard and take opportunities is limited, so I prioritise lol",False,True
