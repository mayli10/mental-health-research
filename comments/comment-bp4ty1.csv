You will lose the ability to poop naturally, and as a result that poop will stay in your body, become impacted, and by the time it eventually comes out it’ll feel like shitting rocks. You could damage your internal organs so severely that you’ll just have to have them removed with surgery. You could end up with a colostomy bag. Throw your lax away, now, before you do irreversible damage.",False,False
