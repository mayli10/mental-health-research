It‚Äôs like why couldn‚Äôt we hoard something that at least won‚Äôt rot üòë or like at least eat the food and then feel bad later :(   Maybe we should all work at a soup kitchen or a food bank so I can be around all the food I want and then give it away,False,True

For someone with an ed I have an insane amount of food. When my ed started to flair up my fridge was empty and I was so proud. Then I started figuring out things I could eat and not gain. But now....I could feed a family of 4. I think I have a shopping addiction. I‚Äôve always loved online shopping and it gave me a sense of comfort. But it‚Äôs turned into a grocery shopping addiction. My goal rn is to not shop for a week or so and try to finish what I have. Luckily it‚Äôs filled with my safe foods besides trail mix but I got that the other night as a cheat because I quit my job and I plan on giving most of it away to the guy I‚Äôm sleep with because he also loves trail mix lol.   But for real it‚Äôs a serious problem.,False,False
