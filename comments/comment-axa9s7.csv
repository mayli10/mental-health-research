It seems to me there's a lag of sorts between what your body's going through and the actual effects (i.e., hair loss... often happens a few months *after* stress/trauma/onset of nutrient deficiencies). Takes a surprising amount of time and calories for your body to heal and stabilize. So, you never know... be patient, you may be laying the groundwork for its return!   I know gaining weight absolutely sucks, but I hope you can see it as caring for your body. Be kind to yourself.  &amp;#x200B;",False,False

My weight has shot up in the past few months as I've been eating constantly and all but stopped exercising, but still no sign of my period. Everything I've read indicates that it can take a long time to regain your period... I'm going to see my ob-gyn this week and slightly dreading her verdict. Good luck to you!",False,False
