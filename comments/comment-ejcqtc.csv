You're absolutely right that the taste of food is only with for a matter of seconds but unfortunately foods like xmas cookies and chips are loaded with chemicals and poisons that keep our disordered brains completely bent out of shape. Don't spin in negativity today because you're so much better than that &lt;3",False,False

Like I do it to relieve a negative sensation more than to induce a positive sensation. And in fact I know even before binging that Iâ€™m going to feel shit and disappointed in myself afterwards :-/ but it doesnâ€™t stop me lol so idk what this insight can give me ðŸ¤¡",False,False
