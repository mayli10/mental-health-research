One of my best h.s. friends was just a tall twig but her whole family everyone was a ectomorph and very tall. They all ate like teenage boys she even drank ensures with her meals cause she was teased constantly. The human body is a diverse and amazing thing. She did finally ""get a booty"" lol as she referred to fitting in adult size 4s in her early 20s and now in her 30s is still an easy 4-6 and runner like me. She just is a slim woman. I can't hate on her that im built to be more muscular and im short. That's just genetics. But with proper training (especially weights or sport specific) you can do a lot in regards to physique changes",False,False

Just like someone else in this same thread said, some people need to eat more to sustain themselves and that's just how it is. I don't know how to put it into words in english but it makes me really uncomfortable that people deny that metabolic differences exist and can affect weight, especially in a subreddit for people suffering from eating disorders.

I posted in a daily thread venting about this but regardless of context it just hurts in the moment seeing someone really skinny talking about trouble gaining weight and supplementing with heavy cream and peanut butter.  Like what??????  My ex was like this too. He weighs 10-15 pounds less than me, is borderline underweight, and at one point drank multiple mass gainer shakes to try and gain weight as a bet from his friends.
