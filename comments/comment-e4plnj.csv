I never understood how people in the service industry think itâ€™s okay to make comments about eating habits to customers.

She was so matter of fact about it- like itâ€™s normal to eat under 1000 cals and she says it every day.   Iâ€™m not even underweight (19 BMI).  Iâ€™m a grown ass woman too (40).

I'm shocked by her lack of tactfulness ðŸ˜¤, especially as she doesn't know you, let alone the reason for your hair thinning. Plus it's so naive of her to believe that the number of calories determines the state of the hair UGH",False,False
