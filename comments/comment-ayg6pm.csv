God forbid you say anything negative about cancer or show anything other than complete positivity. Or God forbid you gain weight during treatment.   Society loves positive and happy cancer survivors to teach everyone about the power of positivity. And society loves cancer patients who become sick and immaciated because it justifies the inhumanity of treatment in ways that gaining weight just doesn't.   If you are a cancer patient who is angry, gtfo. Mind over matter. You gotta be positive. And if you are a cancer patient who gained weight, gtfo.  You're doing it wrong. Why are you eating? Oh it's so good you have an appetite! Oh it's so good you aren't skinny! As you, the patient, slowly die inside as you watch your body act and react in ways you don't understand.   I had BDD for years but never turned to ED until I finished cancer treatment. I believe that the proportion of cancer survivors with new onset BDD and ED is far more than oncologists are willing to admit. And until the medical community admits this, they will continue to fail their oncology patients and contribute to a cycle of unhealthy behaviors and emotional instability.   Every oncology appointment goes the same way. ""You're underweight. You need to gain weight. Drink some shakes."" without a single thought given to the physiological and psychological reasons why I am underweight or won't eat. Every oncology nutrition problem is treated by throwing shakes at it üò°",False,False

I get it's a public profile on the internet, but maybe I am just less of a creep and don't go out of my way to go through all the comments of the people who I come across. I don't use an alt, so sometimes I get weird messages from people where I have replied to their comment, but it's about something totally different from my post history in a different sub which weirds me out.   My bf showed me a screenshot of something from reddit the other day and I was like 'oh is that you' and he seemed hesitant, and I realised it was probably cause he realised I could go look through all his comments and stuff but that thought didn't even cross my mind - I get that this stuff is public, but I am super private and wouldn't really want other people I know looking at all my stuff so I don't do it to them. Internet stalking is weird. ",False,False
