I did it for like 4 days and then panicked about how it was too high and too normal of a number and everyone eats like this and now I’m back down to 200-300. Like a part of me knows his is stupid, but a part of me fully believes it? I don’t get it smh",False,False

It’s also worse because I ate snacks throughout the day instead of one or two “meals” so I feel like I’ve been nonstop eating it feels gross.",False,False

I had 1 extra serving of the vegetable soup I made and it took all of my willpower to not purge it even though I was well below my limit for the day. But if I'm in binge phase? I'll down an entire pizza and keep it. I make no sense.,False,False
