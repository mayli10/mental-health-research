Put their hand up to half wave when I catch them looking at me on the street instead of just creep staring and it makes me so uncomfortable. Like at least back home creeps were creeps and I could glare at them and they'd look away like they weren't but here its like they just fucking own it and I should be happy for their gross middle aged man attention.
