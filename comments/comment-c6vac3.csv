I was feeling stressy anyways for other reasons, but was just gonna chill out today, it's the hottest day of the year so far here, was gonna go and sit in the sun and read or paint or just relax. I spent a good hour or two making a nice long list of how many calories were in each item I bought yesterday, then how much in a portion, etc etc, and it sounds bad but it was allowing me to actually figure out something to eat for lunch for a change. So I did that, and I started cooking my lunch, and I set off the fucking fire alarm in my accommodation (at uni). I've been here four years, doing my masters, and this is the first time I've set off a fire alarm either in halls or in private accommodation and I'm so embarrassed. I was making scrambled eggs (well, egg). There wasn't even any smoke to speak of, and I had the extractor fan turned on, but the fucking thing went off anyway.  The whole building had to evacuate, luckily only about ten people staying here over summer (all the undergrads went home after exams), but the cleaning staff had to evacuate too and they got outside first and were bitching fiercely about the fire alarm going off, which just made me cry and feel like an idiot even more. Then I was kind of a bitch to my bf about it because he was messaging me whilst I was trying to deal with it, which was horrid of me, and argh.  The worst thing though? I didn't even wanna eat the gross disgusting food I cooked when I got back to my flat, but I'd already injected the right amount of insulin for it (type one diabetes), so I had to.  This puts me at just over 500 kcal for the day when I prefer to restrict to 400 and it does not feel worth it at ALL.
