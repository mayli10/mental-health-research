She kept asking me if I wanted *anything* (dresses, jewelry, etc.) and I said no because I didn't want her to spend loads of money on me. Eventually, we went to a bakery, and everyone in the family knows my favorite flavor is cherry. So, I told my SIL if she wants to get me something, get me a cherry pastry. It's a done deal. But she also ends up buying a huge bag of different sweets for everyone else back home.  Hours later, we head towards Albany and--mind you--I haven't eaten all day. I'm fixated on that cherry pastry. I can't wait to eat it. But as soon as we get to her house, she drops off the bag in the kitchen first. Next, she tells me to help her unload the rest of the stuff from her car and I do.  And as soon as we're done, I run back to the kitchen, open the bakery bag, and stare down in horror. My motherfucking cherry pastry was gone! Gone! Turns out, her husband (who had been home all day) ambled from out of his bedroom, looking for something to eat. He came into the kitchen, saw the sweets, and grabbed the only thing I got for myself during an all-day trip to NYC.  Well, I just turned around, went to the guest room, and cried lmao.",False,False

I have had breakdowns about far pettier things. When you get your mind set on a treat, and plan around it, and basically orient your whole week around it, it's INCREDIBLY upsetting to be foiled. Not least bc it's a pretty painful reminder that your ED does not, in fact, give you total control over your life.   Just last week I watched as someone took the last 5 jars of rhubarb preserves, and kinda cried. Because I love rhubarb, and can't get it where I live. Because I was so looking forward to eating it after days of anticipation. I even got up super early just to be SURE I could get rhubarb at that one amazing shop, which is in a faraway town I will likely never go back to. And ugh, I know the person who bought it was just a fine innocent lady who needed the preserves for some reason or another, but man...I LOATHED her at that moment.",False,False
