I go to Starbucks.... A lot. I lurk on the Starbucks sun, a lot. The vast majority of baristas are super nice and really don't care about ""complicated"" drinks as long as you know, treat them like their human not like Gertrude and Karen and weird creepy old men. :( but there are bad apples in every group.   But I understand feeling awkward about weird orders. Whenever a order a London fog with almond milk and sugar free vanilla I preface it with a ""sorry, my order is a bit fussy.""",False,False

I‚Äôve tried to order the extreme low calorie coffees and sweeten them to my taste and every single time it just tastes so bad that I toss it or I hate it.   I‚Äôll give this one a try! ,False,True

I tried to order one of the complicated macrobarista drinks one time through the app, (because I‚Äôd choke trying to order one of those face to face), and when I walked in to grab it the barista that I assume made it threw a snarky comment about my overly-complicated cold brew as I was walking out.

If I count coffee as being 5, if I get a venti with 4 pumps (5 cals each so 20) and add 1T soy (i count 2 tb for 17 cals) gets me at 42 what I round up to 50.  I‚Äôm used to it so I can tell if they mess it up. The first few times I was convinced they used the regular syrup and I dumped it. Next time I watched the barista make it (i was at a different location) and tasted the same.   Maybe they‚Äôre fucking with me maybe they‚Äôre not.

I am guilty of getting milky, sugary coffee sometimes when I have deluded myself into thinking that I am ~recovered~.  Forgot to mention this calorie saying idea. If you want to do lattes, you can ask for half hot water/half milk of your choice. Doesn't taste as good but saves some cals. Unfortunately, can't mobile order that, gotta make that order eye to eye haha. (it's the only way I can justify some of those seasonal beverages). ",False,False

So I am probably no help.  I am a bux drinker.   I usually just get americano with just a splash of almond milk. That is usually too bitter for most people.

A tall is under 200 calories but you're stressed and your body is gonna need some fat and protein.  I dunno how much you plan to stop. But definitely don't go too hard on the caffeine.
