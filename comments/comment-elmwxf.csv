I came to this realization recently when I went to an ED group therapy last month for the first time. It was a small group, but everyone else was much older than me. Like there were 2 people in their 50s and another one in her like 70s... And I am fairly certain they were not recovered--it seemed like they had definitely relapsed.. My ED surfaced as an adult (at least from what I'm aware), so I've ""only"" been struggling for a few years.. I can't imagine dealing with this bullshit for all my life. I hope 2020 is the year I can recover though.. eventually..",False,False
