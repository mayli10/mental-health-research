It's a pretty common experience for others in this sub to think about food constantly, even if it's the last thing they want on their mind. If you tell yourself not to think about a frog smoking a cigar, then you will immediately picture that. For me, it's about overthinking every single aspect of eating, despite wishing I could just forget about food. Even then, I can't say that I'm a 100% certified ED sufferer, because I've never told anyone what I'm going through or sought help from a professional, and often it feels like my own analysis of the situation isn't enough to rely on. From what I've heard, people who do have a formal diagnosis still feel this way, because most of us doubt our own validity.    If someone you care about told you that they eat less than 200kcal a day, work out to the point of collapsing, they lost 9 pounds in a week and they still ""feel fat"", would you tell them they're a failure?? Maybe try to see it from an outsider's perspective, and you will see unequivocally that you are suffering and you do deserve help and support.",False,False
