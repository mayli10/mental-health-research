Tbh it sounds like this trigger friend has a lot of her own issues about weight etc. So if you can't bring yourself to clap back maybe just try to remember that this girl is just trying to justify or normalize her own messed up body issues by commenting on other people's weights. ,False,False

But also worth remembering, sometimes people gain a lot of weight as they become adults. I imagine it would be extra humiliating to somebody who makes fun of others for their weight if they grew up and become overweight themself. And yeah, 100 lbs is nothing. I weight over 100 lbs and I'm underweight. For most people being under 100 lbs is unhealthy. Hopefully she learns this, because it's not going to go well for her or the people she makes fun of if none of them know that. Like, anything under 119 lbs is unhealthy for someone of my height (169cm) and it's not like I'm super tall or anything. At 13 it's really possible that none of you girls are going to get any taller. Some of you will for sure, but my last growth spurt was at 13. Making fun of people for being over 100lbs at that age is really messed up.",False,False
