But I lost about what you did and got mild refeeding just from eating half of the melplan treatment put me on. Bodies are all different and it‚Äôs better to be safe than sorry. Even if you‚Äôre just working with a doctor and dietitian outpatient who know what tests to order and how often...,False,False

Some people end up neglecting their hair because it‚Äôs too depressing to acknowledge it or don‚Äôt want more to fall out from touching it. It‚Äôll keep it healthy and look fuller. You can also try minoxidil (they have male and female) and derma roll your scalp (0.5mm) if you‚Äôre feeling desperate. A lot of people swear by food grade diatomaceous earth but that‚Äôs the one suggestion of mine that‚Äôs slightly controversial. If anything it‚Äôll help regulate your bms lol,False,False

I feel like it‚Äôs hopeless in terms of recovery, and because of that, a waste of money. :/ Does the risk of refeeding syndrome go away if I‚Äôve been binging at least once every week or two? I‚Äôve only lost 50 lbs since May.",False,True

Too much shampooing can make your hair dry and prone to breakage. If you feel like it‚Äôs getting greasy in between washes, dry shampoo can help or diluted apple cider vinegar.

If you‚Äôre still overweight, they likely will put you on a maintenance plan, not weight gain. Rehab your body and your metabolism, and if you want to go back to your bullshit, it‚Äôll be there waiting for you. I say treatment specifically because if you‚Äôve been restricting since May, and especially if it‚Äôs heavy and/or low carb, you might be at risk for refeeding syndrome EVEN THOUGH YOURE OVERWEIGHT, and that shit can get dangerous fast. Think of treatment and eating like a tuneup for your metabolism so you can burn more efficiently later. Idk. I‚Äôm losing weight on a shit ton of calories still. Slowly and steadily. Thank you treatment because I used to maintain on lower than this.",False,False
