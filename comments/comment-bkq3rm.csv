When meds make a person gain weight, it’s because they have an increased appetite and thus eat more. Just ignore them and keep your head up &lt;3",False,False

Lamictal IS the most weight neutral. And I was also on it for years like others have said and had no side effects of weight gain due to it.,False,False

The medication is so important for people with mood disorders, and the fact that she said it could alter your weight to discourage you from taking it is such a shitty thing to do. I usually binge less when I take my medication, so if anything it helps me keep my weight down.",False,False

It irks me when people make dire side effect prognostications about my meds! Like, s’okay if they wanna share their experience and speak from the “I”, but I don’t need them to try to write my story.
