It’s the same technique used in cults. Not working for you?? Must be a personal failing or lack of discipline, not the fault of the fasting. All positive experiences are evidence it works, all negative experiences are flawed or discounted. And so the circle jerk continues.",False,False

New research has come out showing that anorexics have some sort of metabolic disorder that allows their body to keep losing weight easier than others even when already underweight.,False,False
