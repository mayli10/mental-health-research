You’re a person who by the sounds of it has been through an unbelievable hell. Inflicted by others.   You are a person expressing emotion. You are a person who has been hurt and what you have written above, a person who has been wronged.  You have no obligation to fulfill any social contract to anyone. If your family don’t provide a loving and safe relationship. I don’t see any reason why you should provide anything outside of a formal hello and goodbye or even this.   I would say for your own well being &amp; for yourself &amp; no one else, definitely not your family, try and work through it with someone so you can live your life and be happy. You can heal and soar. You deserve to be happy, you will be happy and happiness will come. You are strong. You are a person. You are valuable.",False,False
