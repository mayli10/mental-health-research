This shit absolutely sucks, I'm glad that I ended up falling in front of a bunch of random people and only two of them were asking me if I was alright. I immediately got back up and was like I'm fine thank you and left. Then checked my case to make sure, ironically anxious about my instrument but not about staring people, and surprise! :( I hope you've finished the course since then at least, this for me has been the biggest 'i am a faker' issue in my eating disorder. Even the counselor person I was speaking to was like oh yeah if you let things go for too long they'll control you and I'm SITTING THERE LIKE 'girl i've had this eating disorder for ten years now and just recently relapsed AGAIN.' but I didn't say anything because I REALLY don't want to be hospitalized. :(((( Though I have to eat at least 800-1000kcal or risk it happening again. I was 'managing' on 500 but I was also exercising and studying sooooo = pass out in public.",False,True

Iâ€™m sorry you broke your instrument. Iâ€™ve totally been there in a similar way. I passed out right before taking my final, and I hit my head and ended up forfeiting the exam. It was embarrassing as fuck and then I needed to take the entire course again ðŸ™ƒ I also wasnâ€™t underweight when this happened so I was so incredibly pissed at this meat prison I call a body, because wtf, why am I passing out rn before a fucking final exam!!",False,False
