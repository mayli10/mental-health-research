I've tried so many different medications in the past and the only thing that ever helped gave me memory problems. So I haven't tried anything new in over 4 years. I'm really hoping this will work.,False,True

The theory is that your brain has more energy than before so the negative feelings are more intense until the chemicals kick in to balance them out (not a scientist in any form, I've just been on a shitton of different antidepressants and so have a fair experience with them)  Stick with it, but maybe keep a record of how your depression is. If it hasn't levelled out in a month then it may just be that that particular medication doesn't work well for you and you need to try another one. It's tough and frustrating but definitely worth it in the end so stick with it and be kind to yourself!",False,False

I don't work. I only ever think about food. I don't care about anything else. I'm miserable to be around so I avoid people. I feel like such a waste of space.",False,True

When I took Prozac it killed my appetite too and I loved it! Unfortunately I ended up switching to Lexapro and it doesn’t have the effect on me. Stick with it! I know how frustrating it is waiting for them to kick in. Currently going through it myself so you’re not alone. ❤️,False,False
