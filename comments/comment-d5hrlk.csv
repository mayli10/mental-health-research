This can especially happen if you have a lot of actives or anything drying in your routine.  When I'm restricting I need like 10 times the moisture for some reason or else I look like death warmed over. I dont breakout but it just gets dry and the texture turns to shit.  Fat also plays a role in hormone regulation so if you lost it really fast maybe your hormones are wacking out?,False,False

I mean, dry, cracking, bad breakouts, it hurts and it looks gross. My saving grace is a honey healing lotion. I use it on my face mostly, but it works wonderfully for my scars too. I'm not good at drinking water. At all. (Like I struggle with a cup a day type shit, I'm working on it) but it's a try fail try again cycle.",False,False
