It was so peaceful.  My fiance cooks (with a LOT of oil) and doesn't measure shit at all, buys a LOT of food, insists on snacks everywhere, commented on what/when I ate, and likes to hang over my shoulder in the kitchen. Pretty much my worst nightmare when I was at my worst with my ED and restricting. I'm working on recovery now, but I just wanted to let you know you're not alone with having a ROUGH go of it.",False,False

My dude just proposed we run trials of him staying at my place for extended periods.   Happened to be the same day I made chili in the crock pot and almost had a severe mental breakdown because I kept losing count of the ‘servings’ while trying to make sure my calorie counts were accurate. In my defense he wouldn’t stop talking and trying to give me a back rub.   I’m fucking terrified of losing my freedom. I am terrified he’s going to figure it out. I’m terrified to gain weight. I’m also terrified I’m going to lose him. Someone please slap me because I’m frozen in place.   As far as the birth control goes, have you tried asking for a different one? I went back on for this guy too and my PMS moods got so bad he nearly left me... twice.  It took 2 more switches before I landed on one that pretty much ticked all the boxes (this one has more inactive pills so I bleed longer which is shit but at least I’m not trying to emotionally spear him with my hormones).   I’m sorry you guys haven’t found your ‘groove’. The only way to really work through stuff like that is open communication. Everything may start falling back into place with a few compromises. Good luck ❤️",False,False
