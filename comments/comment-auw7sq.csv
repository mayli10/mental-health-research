And yeah, it's definitely hard because as you said, it's not really something we can talk about with average friends. So it's really nice that this community exists as a place for ED sufferers to share their experiences and support one another without fear of judgement.  Anyway, I really do hope that the slow increase approach will be able to help you, even just a little bit. Slow progress is still progress, and it's also important to know that even if you slip up, that's okay too. Mistakes can and will happen, the key is to remember to breathe and pick yourself back up again.  This sort of thing isn't linear - imo it's more like a maze! Sometimes you get lost, sometimes it seems like you're going backwards, sometimes you'll hit a dead end. But there's always a way out. You just have to be patient with yourself and keep trying.",False,False

I think the slow increase could really help, because if I get scared of gaining I can at least reassure myself that it wouldnâ€™t be too much more / enough significantly each time until i can feel okay with it.  im so grateful for your kind words . I did feel so lonely, this isnâ€™t something we can talk to avg friends about. this helped. thank you",False,True

I understand the feeling of wondering whether or not one's ED is real or not, but having an eating disorder isn't as cut and dry as most people make it out to be. ED is a horrible struggle that can happen to anyone at any size, any weight, and any time. It's complex, and your experience with ED is as real as anyone else'.  I can't offer a ton of insight as I'm at a higher weight (198 atm) and have never experienced being underweight, so I can't draw from experience to help you on that front.  But with regards to ""safe"" foods - that can be an individual thing, so it's hard to say for certain. For example, mangoes are my favourite fruit and are low-ish in calories in small portions. So they could be considered safe - except I love them so much that one slice of mango is enough to make me go hog wild and next thing I know I've devoured three whole mangoes lmao.  But when I was restricting to less than 400 calories a day a couple of years back, one thing that helped me try to get back to ""healthier"" eating for a while was to try and approach it as a process with baby steps. So instead of immediately trying to eat 1200 or more in one day and inadvertently starting a binge and purge cycle, I tried to up my intake by 50 - 100 calories per day in an attempt to not overwhelm myself. I would do this by adding a little more oil in my salad dressings, or putting nuts and seeds in my yogurt, eating a couple of spoons of peanut butter with my apples for a snack (instead of just an apple), etc etc.  I realize that this won't do much to help you weigh more by your next doctor visit, but maybe that approach could at least work as a start to try and combat the anxiety that comes with the thought of eating.  I know ED is stressful, painful, scary, and can feel so isolating and lonely. But you're not alone. We're all here struggling with this terrible thing, and we're all trying to support one another and survive one day at a time. ðŸ’—",False,False

I lost it once in 7th-8th grade. I donâ€™t want it to happen again ",False,True
