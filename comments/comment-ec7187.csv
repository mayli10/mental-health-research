I was super strict with her growing up. She only got a set amount of the best balanced cat food.  Now due to some income changes she eats shittier food and its affecting her ponch but she is still healthy and happy.   TBH if i tried to CONSIDER fasting my cats they'd go about 4 hours and find any food available and tear it open. We had to lock the pantry for theirs and my sake lol,False,False
