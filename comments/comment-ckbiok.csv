It's great that you're reaching out looking to help your friend, it sounds like she has been dealing with a lot. You might gain something from these resources, or maybe you can share them with her if you think it will be helpful. I don't know much about diabetes management but these two podcasts both deal with the issue from a weight-neutral perspective, which it sounds like could be valuable for your friend in working on/preserving her recovery. It sounds like her endocrinologist is really misguided in his advice and tbh the safest thing seems to be following the advice of her treatment team not to diet or exercise.   This first podcast is Christy Harrison, a registered dietician, and it starts with her answering a listener question regarding a situation that sounds similar to your friend. She specifically discusses the diagnosis of pre-diabetes, and how dieting can exacerbate cycles of restriction and bingeing which can lead to elevated blood sugar.  [https://christyharrison.com/foodpsych/6/tag/prediabetes](https://christyharrison.com/foodpsych/6/tag/prediabetes)  This second one is more in-depth  and takes a broader look at weight-independent diabetes care, although considering your friend was diagnosed as pre-diabetic, it may not completely apply to her.   [https://www.donoharmpodcast.org/episodes/2018/3/16/s2e3-weight-independent-diabetes-care-with-megrette-fletcher-med-rd-cde-1](https://www.donoharmpodcast.org/episodes/2018/3/16/s2e3-weight-independent-diabetes-care-with-megrette-fletcher-med-rd-cde-1)  It sounds like due to your friend's ED history, following advice like 'diet and exercise' is likely to exacerbate her ED behaviors and worsen her health overall. I hope any of this info can be helpful and maybe help you to point her in the right direction. take care &lt;3",False,False
