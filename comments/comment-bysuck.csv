I know my reply is late, but just know it's not realistic pal. Instead of yourself, try and hate the game for it's limited customization. I've watched videos of people making Sims characters because I'm YouTube trash and everyone makes them super attractive with perfect bodies and it just seems toxic (for the viewers since they're probably young and impressionable) and representative of the games limited and unrepresentational customization mechanics",False,False

That's what got me. I know it's just a game and games are not super realistic, but the fact that I can't even accurately create myself in the Sims even after fucking with the shaping/sliders for like a half hour just kinda made me feel a bit shitty.",False,True

I get that the Sims is a video game but considering how customizable it is and how it keeps getting more realistic, you'd think they'd allow you to give the characters more proportioned features. It's always bothered me",False,False

But other stuff could be going on to make this comment seem insensitive.  1. OP could have very bad dysmorphia. 2. Regaining weight if you're underweight can cause weird fat distribution, the perception of it, or both. 3. Rapid fat and muscle loss can do weird stuff to your body that a video game might not account for. 4. Other stuff that I haven't considered  I'm not trying to be condescending, I'm just assuming your comment was in good faith and I want to explain why it might come off badly",False,False
