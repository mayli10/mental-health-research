""bUt it's so bLaNd"" SORRY BUT NOT ALL OF US WANT A DRESSING SANDWICH WHERE ONE CAN ONLY TASTE THE SWEET ONION TERIYAKI. If that were the mf case then why even bother getting filler between the fucking bread and the dressing? Just get bread and dressing then and you'll have the least bland sandwich of them all, sweaty.   End rant. Sorry. This shouldn't have made me as mad as it did but I just can't stand people having this unwarranted audacity to be like that to someone's face. Like, if someone is within earshot don't talk shit about them. That's so rude.",False,False

But yeah some people should be careful what they say in line. I remember I was buying monster and Diet Coke and a girl goes to her friend ‚Äúhow does she drink those. Diet cokes disgusting‚Äù and it made me feel bad even though she said it about the food and not me üò©",False,False
