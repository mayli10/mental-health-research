Like theyre supposed to be inspirational or some shit, but to my pessimistic mind I'm like ""they will ALWAYS have disordered thoughts no matter how they look, might as well keep it up"". I dunno. Also while they're recovering they tend to talk about what they ""used to do"" and I'm like ""write that down, write that down!!"" So. Yeah not helpful lol",False,False

Her videos were seemingly unrelated to her ED, but to me it's obvious that they were just public body checks. I'm scared for her. Especially with people screaming ""MUCH HEALTHIER"" for every 10 grams gained. But she's too nice to ever tell them not to comment on her body.   Maybe I'm wrong, I'm just the type of person that can't stand being the centre of attention.   She seems so wonderful and kind, I'm sad that she has to go through all of this.",False,False

I don't think people without eating disorders realize that seeing media pertaining to eating disorders can actually be a trigger; I don't care if it's the most positive and happy video about how someone who was so far down a rabbit hole is in recovery or someone who was so sick that they suffered greatly and died. How about instead of giving me more content for my obviously very *unhealthy* mind to twist into another reason I should give in to my ED, you show me how much you care about me? Distract me. Get me offline for a bit. I don't know who they think they're helping.",False,False

Like 6 or 7 people (just the people who know about my ed or saw me during that time) have HMU about the video. Still very annoyed :/  Eugenia is amazing though. Hearing her story sent me to tears. Sheâ€™s so wonderful and kind, I love her so much.",False,True
