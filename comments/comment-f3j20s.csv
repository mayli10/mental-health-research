Please acknowledge how awesome you are to have found the strength (even if it's subconsciously) to get here. Your ed may have left this bug hole in your life but that just goes to show how much it took from you in the first place.  I guess it's kind of like a grieving process for a lost relationship (corny, I know). It's going to feel weird and sad and you're going to feel lost, but you can move on from this point. This is an opportunity to fill the gap with the things you want in your life. Sending good vibes your way ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False

A surprising number of cases actually got better without formal intervention... not the majority, but more than I would have expected. So you're not alone, that happens!  You know that famous opening line by Tolstoy ‚Äî¬†all happy families are alike, but all unhappy families are miserable in their own special way? Eating disorders are not that unique, they're not a substitute for a personality. This is an incredible opportunity for you to reinvent yourself and to be whoever you want to be!
