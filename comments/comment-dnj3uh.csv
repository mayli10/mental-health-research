The longer an ED continues untreated the more things you will lose. You can lose your hair. Your job. Your ability to get out of bed. You can lose all sorts of things due to ED's.,False,False

Or more politely at least!",False,False

It's like people don't even consider how much worse it is to actually be going through it.,False,False

It hurts because they know what I'm going through but most people don't try to relate. The only time I hang out with people now is at the gym when I go to jiu jitsu practice, and I have a workout buddy. Everyone else has faded away.",False,False

When I went though a ED phase where I’d not leave bed or cancel with friends bc I was afraid about food and all, it was rough.   My friends didn’t understand what was going on and just really missed me. They felt like I was blowing them off by cancelling plans and just not being there.   ED’s are quite isolating. Sometimes it’s the ED pushing ppl away. Sometimes it’s people running away from you bc they don’t know how to handle the ED.   I’m sorry for your loss.",False,False

She called my mother, explained what was going on, that she thought I needed help, etc. My parents drove to my college that night without telling me and brought me back to my hometown for treatment. I was mad in the moment, but I apologized and thanked my friend a few days later. After that, she and my other two best friends kinda ghosted me, and when I found out they’d made housing plans for next year and confronted them about it, they explained that I was “too much to handle,” and that “You never think about how your eating disorder affects us!!” They haven’t talked to me since!",False,False
