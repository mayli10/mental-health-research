Yeah, that's going to help getting my head around them.  Definitely going to up the banana intake.  I love fruit so fucking much (except mangoes).  I need to buy a mixed bag and dip into it.  Sometimes I think a peach would be worth a panic.  (Kiwi's are pretty great as well!)  Ta for that.  x",False,False

Took a while to eat a full one and started off sharing half.  NO idea why they give me the chills because the texture, smell and taste are mmMmm.  Probably because **they feel dense to eat, as opposed to feeling ""light"" like an apple.**   &amp;#x200B;  I've been making a kind of desert mashing a banana, sprinkling cinnamon on and nuking it for a short time.  Because it looks smaller I find it easier.  It's irrational like all food hang ups with EDs.  They're good for you.  Fruit's good for you, I know this, but still I limit to apples and bananas.
