And almost every time, at least one person successfully hid their dehydration, heat issues, or exhaustion from us to the point that they needed some medical attention on the trail. (I'm not saying you were hiding anything, I'm just saying we were very attentive to people showing distress. But these were high schoolers and there was ALWAYS some guy who was too manly to show symptoms until he just started practically falling over.) We weren't even really doing uphill stuff, and this still happened.   The point is, in outdoor groups like this, incident like this are a regular occurrence. Please don't be embarrassed. I would bet solid money at least one other person in the group was really struggling but was just able to conceal it a lot better. And was thanking god the second the class ended.   Just try to eat beforehand, and drink plenty of water. Wear a hat, even if this is the UK and you think you don't need one. (Also, here's my bias as an asthmatic: if you have even an inkling that you might have exercise-induced asthma, get that checked out; it's quite impairing even during light activity, and most sufferers don't know they have it.)  Alternately, do it the American way: find whichever office you need to harass, and then stand in their lobby and smile charmingly at them like you're not plotting a medical lawsuit if they don't switch you into chess.",False,False

Last semester we were guided through an archive and explained shit for how to use it etc. and it was 2 Hours of standing in one place and my starved ass actually blacked out and had to lay on the fucking floor while everyone was watching me. My prof and the guides made such a fuss and called it an medical emergency and I just wanted to die. And it was a group of 20 people so it wasn’t exactly like they don’t know me. I was super embarrassed but nobody even looked at me weird after that.",False,False
