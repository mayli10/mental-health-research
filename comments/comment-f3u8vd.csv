Chicken liver is also a really goof safe food because it has so many micronutrients and is relatively low calorie and highly absorbed nutrients are really health for you.   I wish you all the best on your journey and know it gets better. I recovered and my hair is back to being mega thick again and my situation is just like yours  ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False

I was so skinny and so mf'ing curly. I started restricting my senior spring of HS, so I don't think the nutrition issues had set in yet. I thought I was so fat and was only just learning to love my hair. I'm not glad I have an eating disorder, and I'm glad I purge way less (though restricting isn't great, obviously), but I would kill for that young skinny bitch's hair lol",False,False

I've been committed to growing my curls for ~2 years, still getting regular maintenance trims but determined to reach those length goals.  Don't see it happening anymore though, I loose so much now when I wash. Cut down on number of washes per week, deep moisturising masks, oil masks, supplements nothing works.

Really I think I need to readjust my expectations. I‚Äôm mixed white/Latinx and won‚Äôt pretend to have had the hair type or texture common with natural hair, but it was so thick it really could withstand anything.

You can get a thing of ""Blue Magic"" coconut oil in the hair care aisle for $2 instead of having to pay for legit food-grade coco oil. It doesn't fix it entirely but it makes a bit of difference with frizz, especially if you throw some in and *then* do the gel, and then the next morning you use a bit more of the cocoil. I personally only did this for like two months cause my OCD did *not* like the feeling of oil on my hands and hair every morning but it was real effective while I did it lol  And I generally go with thicker ones just cause I'm afraid of them being blown off my head despite that never having happened lol. So no I don't know any sadly :( I know that Love Your Melon beanies are fuckn fantastic tho.

LA Looks and then scrunch that crunch bay BEE  For real though we do care so much more :( It's why the straight-haireds are always confused why a flattened-out-cut-across haircut is a terrible experience.  And fucking saaaaame. I only really feel okay about my hair for the latter part of the day that it's dried and then like, the early part of day two.

I miss it every single day.  Just to double check: have you heard about the devacurl lawsuit?
