My user account is only connected to my Fitbit account so when my dad and I were sharing the scale I was never able to see his weight in my app because it was sent to his user account. ,False,False

Tons of scales just have internal programming that lets you track up to 6 people's weight (or around that number) in order to track it. It stays on the scale, and isn't connected to anything!  If it really bothers you that you're being spied on, you could carry an object that you know it's weight (say 15lb vase) and weigh yourself with it. Then you could just subtract that number from what the scale says you weigh, and to anyone else it looks like you weigh 15lbs more than you do.",False,False

If your dad asks about it, you can say that the scale must've misread the first weight or that you were leaning against the wall or something dumb idk.  But you probably shouldn't listen to me because I'm kind of a compulsive liar at this point.",False,False

I don't see why your dad would bring it up and make it a Thing unless he had a reason to be concerned for your health :/ Plenty of  non-disordered people weigh themselves when there's a scale around just out of curiosity. It's v easy to feel paranoid but if I were you I'd cut myself some slack and try not to think too much of it!!! xxxxx,False,False
