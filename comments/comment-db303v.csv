I'm working on the two meals a day thing, but the food here is just so... meh, that it's hard to make myself it it when I already don't want to eat. Hopefully personal dates will be more accessible once work starts :P  best of luck to you &lt;3",False,True

I don‚Äôt have a ton of friends now either, but I‚Äôm trying. It‚Äôs hard to feel so isolated from everyone around you. A nice thing is that I did kind of become my own best friend. Like instead of thinking ‚Äúoh I can‚Äôt do x thing because I don‚Äôt have people to go with‚Äù I‚Äôd just take myself on a little date. I‚Äôd also call your friends and family back home a lot. My mental health got so bad last year that I cut myself off from everyone, which just made things worse.   I know that it sucks to feel like you‚Äôre all alone, but there are other people going through the same thing. Just keep talking to people and hopefully you‚Äôll click with some of them soon. College is rough for everyone, even if you might not see it. Try not to get in your own way, even though that can be hard sometimes.   Also, it is so so easy to get away with ed behaviors in college, but definitely try to eat one or two meals a day. Your brain needs that to do well in your classes and function properly. Sorry if that sounds condescending but I know I needed to be reminded that yeah food is kind of important to not being a brainless zombie!   I hope your experience gets better. Good luck with your classes, and I‚Äôm sure the social stuff will pick up soon! &lt;3  edit: Also sorry I did check your post history. I‚Äôd really recommend hanging around your college‚Äôs lgbt center!! Usually the people there are nice and I‚Äôve met a lot of really nice people through the center. Also maybe check out support groups/fraternities if there are lgbt centered ones? Like I know my college specifically has a frat for lgbt guys and a sorority for anyone on the spectrum. Those might be some good ideas for finding more people to hang with!",False,False

I know how hard it is to be inmersed with people who think mental illness is a badge to wear proudly and who glamorise it so you hide it away. To be thrown in a college environment and feel so lonely. Im glad you havent purged and I highly reccomend you dont go down that road again if you can help it. If you feel like getting to a weight youre comfortable at (safely) in order to gain some control, I get it. It does help. It was my only solice for a while as a first year. But I want to share something with you that I wish someone had reminded me; its okay to feel like youre not living the cliche college experience. Everyone is different and just because things arent going the way you think it should, doesn't mean its wrong. This is only a small part of your life, stick with it and get that degree girl. Because even if its only you who knows, you will know how hard it was for you to get through college despite how shit you felt but you did it anyway. If you can tackle this, you can tackle anything. I really hope you feel better soon and I wish you all the best üíï",False,False
