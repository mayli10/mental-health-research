I was beating myself up yesterday for eating, what I imagine, was around 1500 calories. Now, I know I burned over 100 calories yesterday walking around, so that 100 calories I ate that's above my bmr means nothing. I'm not going to get fat for eating maintenance calories, paired with exercising. I sure feel like I will, but it's just not true. I've been trying to outsmart my ED lately, maybe this will help you too.",False,False

Especially when I compare what I eat now to what I used to eat, and somehow I wasn't gaining every single day back then. I was relatively slim for most of my pre-relapse phase, at a normal BMI. One of my highest days last week was 2k, so 200 calories above what my body needs -- a gain-weight day. I had coffees with oat milk and a salad at work, a banana before leaving and then red wine and dinner with my sister. I might've overshot the dinner, but it would only have been off by 200 calories, bringing me down to maintenance number of calories.  Then I compare that too my high calorie days before, or even just what I observe others eat, and I just... How??? I feel like every non-ED person should be like the humans in WALL-E, but they're not.",False,False

The guy I hang out with/ sleeping with will eat a whole box of fruity pebbles or like a whole pizza some nights and is completely fine. I mean not weekly but that would freak me the fuck out. I could easily do the same but I feel like I would quickly gain. We went out to dinner once and he ordered a sushi platter for two and ate the whole thing and we both got a few drinks. My meal was miso soup, a cucumber roll and we split a fried spring roll. All that with three drinks but I didn‚Äôt eat all day and I consider that a decent binge/treat since it was a ‚Äúdate‚Äù.
