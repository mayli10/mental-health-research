A pound more than last time. But my weight can fluctuate as much as 8 lbs even if I'm strictly maintaining. So I'm not concerned.   I've been successfully cutting weight without relapsing, but if I don't get comfortable with weighing myself again, I probably will relapse, because I'll be like, ""eh, another week and then I'll check"" for fuck knows how long. I'm still relatively light, so this could result in my beloved stimulant meds getting taken away. Not to mention regressing lifts, heaven forbid XD",False,False

I don't have many staples or much stability in my diet. Even while restricting, i want something different all the time so i have some excitement/something to look forward to, but over time, coming up with something new every day becomes stressful.   Two things i really like-- scrambled eggs with queso, and buttered toast. I also like cottage cheese on toast with black pepper.  I want to be an oatmeal hoe but haven't found any healthy ways i like it that i find acceptable to eat every day (big on dessert bowls). Like yeah i can have my oatmeal with almond milk, chia seeds, honey, and sliced banana, but I'm pretty indifferent (and stubborn about just getting instant oatmeal packets even though i love them). Should i go the savory route?  I love cereal. Currently my jam is raisin bran and letting it get soggy. I don't get cereal too often though because one bowl is never enough and i always feel sad that i can't have more. ): I like pancakes and bagels, but carbs alone are a no-go for me for similar reasons.   I really love bananas, but so does my dad, so when we buy them, they last for a couple of days until we go grocery shopping again.",False,False

No bingeing, just eating at a realistic deficit and staying active. If I could just stay like this, I know I could get to where I want in a healthy way, without extreme restriction and constant mental distress. I'm seeing my family this weekend, and being around all the food always triggers me. That, and my progress is kind of triggering me.   I'm committing to staying strong through this. Telling myself I got this. By next Saturday, I want to be on this continued streak of progress.",False,False

Me and SO went out to a buffet cuz I figure I have more control over my food choices that way.  I estimated I ate about 2000 calories......LOL but the food was really good and I was able to stop myself.  I have a history of 5000+ calorie binges after fasting so I guess this is a victory?  Still sitting here in pain and feeling like a fat fuck but I guess it will pass.  Went to walmart later and eyefucked the oreo cookies really hard but was able to resist.  Being in so much pain from 2000 calories helped with that.  Now back to fasting...yay...",False,False
