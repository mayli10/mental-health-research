It felt like, ""look, a black girl!! And she's not conventionally attractive!!! Arent we great!!"" Oh and she was a lesbian, which plays into the fat butch lesbian stereotype.  But I agree, black people dont exist in ED culture very much and that's kind of the point, people act like only the wealthy can willingly starve themselves, like you said.

There‚Äôs a whole lotta bullshit around eating disorders so I‚Äôm really sorry that race has to cross into it for some people. It‚Äôs stressful enough as it.  If it makes y‚Äôall feel better, I like to give people the benefit of the doubt, because I struggle so badly with food and body image that my first assumption is that most other people probably feel similarly to some degree.
