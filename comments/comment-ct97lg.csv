I used to eat them thinking it was what ""skinny girls"" did, but now, I actually really would prefer them over a sandwich or pasta. I just love the variety between every bite, unlike something that's carby and cheesy and meaty (which tastes great, but is pretty 1 note). I also love that salads actually LAST while you eat them, it's not just 2 bites and it's over. I think more people should eat salads regularly with some protein and dank dressings that aren't over the top.",False,False
