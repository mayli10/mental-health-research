I’ve been weight lifting for over a year now, and when I don’t purge/binge-purge, I keep looking better and better. Though note that there will likely be a period of time where your body holds onto more water than usual and looks even “worse” so to speak (+possibly digestion issues which will get better with time). Make sure to drink lots of water and if you can, drink Pedialyte or Hydralite. I was sipping on Hydralite all through yesterday, and it made an astonishing difference in how I both look and feel today!",False,False
