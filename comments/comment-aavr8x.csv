ED is such a burden to keep to yourself. Just be candid, maybe start by telling them you have ED and feeling ready to talk about it but you’re not sure where to start, and let them ask questions. If you’re not comfortable about answering some of them just tell them that you’re not ready to answer that yet. A good therapist will work with what you give them and go at your own pace. Best of luck!",False,False

How do you like your psychologist in general? Do you feel like you can trust them and open up about other issues? Have they been helpful in treating your anxiety/depression? If you feel even neutral or they are just “okay” it may be worth finding a provider that specializes specifically in EDs.   If they are good, they should be able to help ask the right questions once you bring it up. Is there a point in the session where they typically ask “is there anything you wanted to talk about/make sure we get to today?” That would be a good time. Then you can start by saying something along the lines of having concerns about your eating. You can tell them how hard it is for you to talk about and they can help you go at your own pace. Trust me there is nothing your psychologist hasn’t heard before (and it is possible they suspect/will not be surprised if they have known you this long).  ",False,False
