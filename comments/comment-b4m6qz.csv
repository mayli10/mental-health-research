Plus snacks if that's something you like to buy. Some safe stuff:  \- Rice/corn cakes or crackers  \- Canned or powdered soups  \- Yoghurts  Also general kitchen-y stuff like cling wrap, baking paper, aluminium foil!",False,False

Are you okay with having bulk quantities of some items around? These are questions to ask yourself to figure out your core ingredient list. Then add on spices, herbs, etc because they're low cal but can make or break a dish.   I usually have pantry staples like flour, oatmeal, milk powder, baking soda/baking powder, stevia, salt+spices+herbs, canned tuna, chia seeds, psyllium husk, cashew butter, nutritional yeast, EVOO, protein powder, cocoa powder and popcorn.   In my fridge there's hot sauce/chutney, yogurt, rye bread, tofu, pollock fillets, nut milk, cheese, avocado, spinach, frozen fruit, fresh fruit, canned tomato,margarine and kombucha.

Other than that I try to keep only veggies/fruits/juice/alcohol in my fridge for ed reasons.   Pantry I like keeping dry and canned beans because those are basically my only source of protein. I also love having soup broth. So just packs of veggie stock usually is the choice I have. ,False,False
