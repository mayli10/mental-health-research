You can drift between hard restricting and binging and still be Anorexic. You can Purge and Binge and still find yourself anorexic. It is a very complex dense thing with many levels. Where you find yourself living on different floors of the ED building.   It seems you feel a little guilty, even a little shame. Maybe you took pride in your ability to restrict and now it feels like you have given it all way but take it from me. I have gone up two stone and dropped back down to 9 stone in body weight.   There are many thorns on a rose. Though you may prick your hand on one thorn. It doesn’t mean you will not prick your hand again.     Don’t Leave the group. Keep posting and keep talking. I hope your finding the help you need with your ED.",False,False
