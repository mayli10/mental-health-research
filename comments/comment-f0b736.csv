She might feel somewhat threatened by you doing something active towards weight control and working out and subtly puts you down in a jokingly manner to feel better about herself. Might very well be unaware of it as well.  With this subreddit being so supportive and people so lovely, it is easy to forget that most eating disorders have an area of competitiveness to them. Some people suffering from them can be quite nasty when they feel insecure/threatened, especially really deep into an eating disorder when they define themselves through it.  Don’t know what to say to make you feel better except that you are better off celebrating your victories and comparing yourself not to her but your past self.",False,False
