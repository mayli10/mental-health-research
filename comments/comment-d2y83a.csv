I have a big bag that's almost 60g of thick white noodles and the whole thing is 200 calories. Sounds like a small amount but it's actually a lot and stuffing,False,False
ezyjt42,t3_d2y83a,t3_d2y83a,FoofyFoof,1,2019-09-12 01:23:38,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/d2y83a/shirataki_noodles/ezyjt42/,"I prefer spaghetti squash. Cheaper and more filling. Jam a sturdy knife hard into the center, several times. Throw it in the microwave on high for 12 minutes, then on 20 percent for 20 minutes. Take it out. Let it sit for a half hour. Cut the top with the stem off. Then stand it up and cut down the middle. Remove the seeds and brown stringy parts. Now scoop out the sides, which turn to spaghetti when you scoop them. A large one for $3 will make 20 servings, you can freeze part for up to 6 months. It takes about 10 minutes other than the waiting, and 20 servings means it's super time efficient.  I add 1/4 can of S&amp;W diced tomatos with garlic and onions, which can also be frozen if you won't have the whole can soon, and a little bit of sauteed ground turkey. Total cost is about $1 per serving and it tastes great. 20 calories from the squash, 35 from tomatoes, and 130 from the turkey.  Those noodles taste better, but they don't fill me up and are expensive outside of specialty markets.",False,False
