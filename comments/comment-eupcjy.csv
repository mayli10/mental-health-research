If going out to eat is scary and they know youre freaked out by it maybe eat a safe meal before it? Or suggest sort of a potluck at a friends so you can bring a plate of veggies and hummus or fruit salad? If theyre aware you have these issues and are still inviting you out theyre probably just trying to encourage you out of your comfort zone since restaurants are so scary. Dont sacrifice your friendships for this if they know id be honest with them because trust me theyd 100% take being your friend over going out to eat,False,False

Do they turn you down when you suggest coffee/gym class/outside?   I have a suggestion if you still want to do things, there are lots of meetup groups and You could find one for hiking or an outdoor trip! Those are usually a ‚Äúbring your own food‚Äù type deal and you can always drive yourself so you don‚Äôt have to deal with people wanting to do food after. It‚Äôs so frustrating how food-centric social events are. But it‚Äôs totally ok to want to have boundaries or not being ok eating out and I‚Äôm so sorry your friends don‚Äôt seem to respect that :(",False,False
