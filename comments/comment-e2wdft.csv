Plus, when you make it into a paste, it comes out with the consistency of something almost like marshmellow fluff. Its rock bottom level but, damn, it does satisfy that need.",False,False

I can't keep pasta in the house anymore because I eat that. Fizzy vitamin tablets? I have favourite brands with the best textures and favourite flavours. I've also googled if you can overdose for practically any vitamin/mineral there is. Gotta be careful with those magnesium tablets. I though I was the only one! Also, when I used to keep protein powder at home I would sometimes mix it into a paste with some sugar free syrup and eat it like pudding.  On a more normal note - I used to hate bananas. I still don't love them but they're a practical and safe snack.",False,False

Let me know if this isn't what you were meaning but I feel like it does relate. Im known for being a low key a food snob and hate processed foods, I would bin anything too sweet or fake tasting. Which works to my advantage when restricting. I literally avoid them like the plague until it hit 1am depression hours, then the binge gremlin came out.  I used to make the most bullshit midnight binge food just for the hell of it. Some memorable moments: an instant caramel latte sachet that i made into a paste and dead ass spread that on white bread, makeshift pizza out of a stale tortilla, pasta sauce and a slice of kraft cheese (not microwaved mind you because that would make noise) and my lowest point (where I literally stopped half way through and said ""oh my god what are you doing?"" and poured it down the sink) cocoa powder, butter, icing sugar, heavy whipping cream and vanilla essence, all in an attempt to make something like frosting without the effort.   Confessing this here because I want to see if any other binge eaters can relate to making the most obscene food that they wouldnt touch in the light of day.",False,False
