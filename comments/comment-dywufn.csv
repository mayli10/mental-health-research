If you have to eat animal products to recover in IP, you’re still vegan by definition imo. It’s something you may want to consider.",False,False

If you’re underage your parents *might* be able to advocate for your dietary restrictions.,False,False

Some places will allow you to be vegan if they're able to safely manage it, however depending on the severity of your behaviours (refusing food etc) they could push at least a vegetarian diet on you.   Additionally, a lot of nutrient supplement drinks like Ensure contain dairy. It's best to speak with your treatment team asap about it as they will be able to help. If you are willing to commit to recovery and IP is helpful in that journey, I'd say that it's worth it even if you have to consume some animal products.",False,False
