It's rather disorienting when watching shows, and the characters are playing older teens or adults under age 24, while being younger than you, but like... They look/are sooo much older. Especially, when you don't know their ages, from the start. It can work, but sometimes it's comically disturbing.   A good, current example may be the show 'Dollface.' Sorry, I'm getting kind of off-topic. Although, it can change how some viewers think they are supposed to look like, at a certain age.",False,False

With Degrassi, that seemed to get worse and worse as the show progressed. Toward the end of my watching it, a character was basically bipolar I for one or two episodes. \*poof\* Never brought up again.  Even 90210 did a better job with bipolar disorder than that.",False,False
