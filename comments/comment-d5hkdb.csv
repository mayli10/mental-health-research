Eat less!”      Ugh, seriously. There was a progress pic from someone who was recovering from anorexia a while ago, and there were a ton of comments about how she was eating too little. Like no shit, she had/has an ED? I'd love to see people go ""wow, you were eating way too much! you're way too fat!"" lmao       Also people always get downvoted to hell for asking questions about getting a flat stomach or wanting insta model bodies, but people who are overweight and strong get praised. It really does not feel like a place where you can get support no matter what your goals are now       And don't even get me started on the threads where everyone flexes about losing weight on 2500 calories a day and mocks people who eat anything less than 1500. Not all of us are 6'1 triathletes, Karen.      /rant",False,False
