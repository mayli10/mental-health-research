The past 3 months have been constant binge drinking for me and I even gained like 3 pounds from it. Sometimes I'll have days where I'll try to stop drinking, but after 2-3 days I just end up caving and drinking again. My tolerance is pretty high now so I don't eat much on days that I'm drinking.  &amp;#x200B;  But to answer the question, yes. As one person mentioned, it's actually pretty common among anorexics. Hope that you're doing a little better now and I'm rooting for you.",False,False
