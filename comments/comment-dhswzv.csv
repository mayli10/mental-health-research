We worked really early in the morning at this strip mall. Nothing else was open for several hours while we were there.  One day we go out for a smoke break pretty early (like 7 am or so) and this nicely dressed woman pulls up at the far end of the parking lot, vomits A LOT, ditches a giant doughnut box (the kind you get for a catering event or, ohhh... I dunno, a good anxiety-fueled binge before a big meeting) and then drives off.  It wasnt the act of puking that tipped it off to me (maybe she was nervous/pregnant/sick etc.) It was the fact that she clearly ate all the fucking doughnuts.    I was sad for her and wondered how her day went. My coworkers thought she was a POS for puking in our lot and didnt get why I was sympathetic.  #EDinthewild",False,False

So, while it could be your idea, it could also be that's she's sensitive to that.   It is very rude to go behind some cars...
