I try to tell him that he's a normal kid and he isn't fat/too big or any of that, but it's so tough to live so far away. And he's absolutely awful at talking on the phone/facetiming so it's so hard to talk about serious things with him at a distance ðŸ˜¢ But yes, I just hope that he will not be too impacted by what they are saying. He has a stronger character and isn't as influenced by words as I am, so perhaps he will be able to go through all of this without being harmed in the same way I was.",False,True

Right now I think all you can do is be there for him as an older sister and try to mitigate some of the impact your mother (and stepdad) might be having on him. Give him positive reinforcement, let him know that their opinions are extreme, offer some kind of alternate view that says certain foods aren't disgusting or bad and that it's not wrong to eat them sometimes, etc. I'm guessing you don't live that close to him but you could set up frequent facetime sessions etc. if you guys don't arleady do something like that.  All you can really hope to do is to try and counteract/balance out some of your mother's influence, and hope that he isn't so impacted by their extremes.",False,False
