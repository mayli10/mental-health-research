It happens when my blood sugar is low, so it's really bad in the mornings. If you can eat something small quick (literally a bite of something, or some milk, whatever) it can make it stop. Sometimes it's so bad I have to focus on not vomiting....it's never made me actually gag, but I feel I go cross eyed trying not to hurl lol",False,False

I definitely wouldn’t describe my body as “used to eating” but that explanation definitely makes sense.   I had a couple of fruit flavored melatonin pills last night so maybe that fucked with my stomach acid lol,False,True

When I first started dieting (before my relapse) getting over the blood sugar roller coaster and the hunger nausea took such a long time.   Thank you for coming to my misinformed fake news ted talk.,False,False

If I’m not fasting (just eating low cal), a few bites of a banana, 1 or 2 saltines, or literally the smallest piece of chicken really helps. Goodluck:)",False,False
