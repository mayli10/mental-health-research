Mushrooms are pretty neat because they emit a lot of liquid when pan fried and can cook in that.  zucchini and especially eggplant i've struggled with because i love them on the BBQ, but they dry up without oil. So my solution was to basically bake them whole on the BBQ with no oil. Once done, they retain the BBQ flavor somewhat and i can slice them up and salt them and they are nice and juicy. if you want you can slice them and give them a quick sear on the BBQ for extra flavor.  my go-to subs for oil are  \- soy sauce  \- (thai or vietnamese) fish sauce  \- tomato sauce  \- straight up water.",False,False

It’s helpful for spraying baking sheets though but I’ll usually use low calorie butter substitutes or Amish butter for sautéing. A huge block of butter lasts me months cooking for two.

Basically, instead of oil, I use water. I usually add around half a cup of water, depending on what I am cooking, and as soon as it evaporates, I add more. I repeat this process until I get the desired texture. It works just like oil for me.  2. **meats**: Usually the meat has its own fat that you can use to cook it. If I use the pan and if the situation calls for it, I may add a little bit of water to cook it in. Meats can also be dry-fried.   3. anything related to **eggs**: nothing and I hope for the best .   Using a non-stick pan will make your job easier, but you can get around with an ordinary pan too. The trick is simple: just use water to prevent food from sticking to the pan.   If you're having troubles, I highly suggest you **grilled** or **baked** your vegetables/meats, using baking paper. You won't have any problems with sticking in those scenarios.",False,False
