I‚Äôve had an eating disorder for about 10 years now. I‚Äôve learned to cope with it and not have it affect my whole day. But major life stressors also trigger a relapse. It‚Äôs one way to try to ‚Äúgain control‚Äù of a situation. It‚Äôs my way of seeing it. In a relapse a eating disorder take over your whole thoughts and your whole life too. I seriously thought I was the only one that went through this eating disorder cycles but it helps me feel better I‚Äôm not the only one. Sorry about your situation, but you can dm any time if you need to talk about it sweets üíôüíô",False,False
