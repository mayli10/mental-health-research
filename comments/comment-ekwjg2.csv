They helped, at least in some ways. Starving myself. Hurting myself. Hating myself. That's not how I would necessarily have named those actions at the time, but it's what they were. I chased myself in an endless spiral of trying to be 'enough'. But when my definition of 'enough' is 'a little more than now' - a little thinner, a little more acclaim, a little nicer apartment, a little more time at work - I couldn't possibly ever *get* to 'enough'. It was the horizon...an imaginary line that recedes as you approach it. It was a fiction based on fear that kept me struggling onward but never really forward.  Eventually, disordered and maladaptive things stop working. I think that's part of what *makes* them disordered and maladaptive. For some reason it can be really hard to honestly see that they've stopped working. I'll keep thinking...if I could just get back to how it used to be. If I could just get it *right*. Just once more. But I can't. The positive side effects are almost entirely gone, and what remains are mounting negative consequences.  There are two lines from poet Rudy Francisco that are really perching in my soul of late.  *""Perhaps we should love ourselves so fiercely, that when others see us they know exactly how it should be done.""*  and  *""I'm still learning to love the parts of me that no one claps for.""*",False,False
