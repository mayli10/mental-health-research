I absolutely use food as punishment when i feel this way- i don’t eat and berate myself when i do. I totally relate to the things you said. All i can offer is that it’s not forever, this will pass, and if you are very worried about feeling unlovable- cultivate a few things in your life that give it meaning and that will possibly be valuable to a future partner. This will absolutely pass. I hope you are able to one day find what you are looking for.",False,False
