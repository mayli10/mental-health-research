People who have eating disorders are famously terrible judges of what their bodies look like. I think you'd have to be recovered to be able to know what your body really looks like. For now, I'd try to resist doing body checks. It's an unhealthy behavior, just like drinking or smoking, and ultimately has negative effects on your health (leading you to binge, purge, restrict, or just generally feel like shit). Maybe create a substitution behavior. Like, ""every time I want to body check, instead I'll (read a chapter in a book, text a friend, answer an email, watch gifs of puppies...)"" Anyways, you're not alone! I hope you're able to see your body in a more positive light someday.",False,False
