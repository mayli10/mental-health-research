A lot of people act like it has to be done right away. And I may be traditional in that sense, but my bf isnt. He's struggled with bpd and depression his whole life and never thought he'd grow up. But he's 21 now and making tentative plans to go to college. I'm so proud of him overcoming his disorders, and proud of you too! I hope that doesnt seem silly or weird. I'm just an emotional person.  Have a good day!!!",False,False

I made a rule that I had to eat a normal amount during finals weeks, days before papers were due, etc, but I just ended up anxious and miserable making myself eat. And I bought a dollar cup of water from starbucks so I could use it to purge in a single person bathroom before class once lmao.   Overall yeah it negatively affects my grades, concentration, etc. Would not recommend. ",False,False

At parties I hovered around the snack table stuffing myself and drinking excessively to convince myself it wasn't happening.  When I went out to eat with people, I was focused on what they were eating and not the conversation, and if someone ate less than me it was like a personal affront that fucked me up for days.  My grades suffered and as a result i'd binge to feel better so my grades suffered more and you get the idea.  Instead of building skills and investing in my future, I invested in the idea of getting thinner, so my grad school apps were all shit because i didnt care about grad school nearly as much as i cared about losing weight.  I had enough and went into IOP my senior year, but had to drop a class to make time. As a result I graduated three months late.
