Idk I noticed when I did IF I was able to eat a lot more per meal and now that I eat more frequently I find it easier to stop when I’m satisfied. And the other thing that helped me is kind of eating the same thing every day/ meal prepping so I don’t have any choice in what to eat. It makes me care less about food since I don’t have to think about it as much. And I see it more as fuel than a source of pleasure now. I’m not really sure if that’s a healthy mindset?  I mean idk if that actually helpful advice, it’s just what helped me. Did you ever have someone write a meal plan for you? That kind of takes the thinking out of it a little bit, too.",False,False
