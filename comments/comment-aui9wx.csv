I haven't had alcohol since October 2014. I was never an alcoholic nor ever drank with someone. That fall, I hit a new mental low and was desperate for something to make me numb. I would sit in my rented bedroom alone in a foreign country. I'd go to the corner shop and buy a huge bottle of vodka.  Drinking never appealed to me simply because I'm picky about tastes and hate nausea. Alcohol is disgusting and makes me nauseous (not to mention it has calories...fuck that). For about a month, I got hammered almost every night. I was planning on killing myself by throwing myself off my balcony.   Each night, I'd put out shots of vodka along my dresser. I'd sit on my bed and watch NCIS and have a google document open. For each shot, I'd write whatever I was thinking or feeling. It was a personal experiment to see what my blacked-out self was thinking.  It was terrifying. These documents turned into horror stories from r/nosleep. A lot of it was jumbled and messy, but my drunk brain was very scared. Sometimes in books, the main character sees a version of themselves that says it's their subconscious. That's how it felt and I didn't like it. Within a week, I was on a plane to my hometown.   Last night, I had 3.25 shots of vodka alone in my bedroom. This time it was in my home. I felt great and listened to music and cried over the death of a family member who died in September and I had never allowed myself to deeply grieve.   I don't want to start drinking. First off, it wasn't my vodka so I'm not going to have any more. Secondly, I have zero money to buy booze and that's good. Thirdly, that stuff tastes so disgusting and I don't want to do that again.  I never had *tried* to not drink. I just didn't because it wasn't appealing. But I still thought about it as a possible escape. I'm a lightweight and a few shots have left me with a raging hangover despite advil and food and hydration, so I think that's enough to keep me from drinking for a long time.",False,False

I didn't have a weight goal, my goal was death. Well I got to death's door and I was ready - notes for loved ones, how I want my body to be disposed  and all that jazz.  I was having the classic heart attack symptoms for a week, they found arrhythmias. I was finally there, but nope a stupid ng tube is feeding me poison and keeping me alive. I have tampered a lot with them in previous admissions.  I only purged once this time.   I'm really struggling with coming back from the near dead. I really thought I should've died and I would've if I was hospitalized so quickly. (I always seem to go right to the top of the wait lists). But now I'm stuck with the overwhelming desire to die and the only way I could do it here is to start aggressively purging again, if I get caught then I get a constant watch. So I guess I don't have any other options except compliance.  But if I comply I lose every single coping skill I've ever had  (ED, self-harm, cigarettes, drugs).   I have zero control of my body here. Not even my hydration. I've started stealing coffee from other patients  (oops)  I'm just a shell of a person, my soul died a long time ago, and whatever was left of me died when I prepared my death.
