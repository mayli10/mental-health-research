Don‚Äôt drink as much, no more acid (even tho I‚Äôve only done it a few times), and I always ask doctors how new medications will interact with current ones because the only reason it happen was because I had one seizure before starting Wellbutrin and he prescribed it knowing welbutrin can lower your seizure threshold (and knew I had the previous seizure). I obvious never went back to him...  But for real that seizure fucked me up. I landed on my face, broke my jaw, smash 3 of my teeth and had a years worth of cosmetic surgery that insurance didn‚Äôt cover. It was so painful and just very embarrassing to basically wear a ‚Äúflipper‚Äù (a weird denture thing). I don‚Äôt wanna scare you but you can go to a neurologist and have scans done to see if you have any seizure activity going on. That may be an over kill but idk. I just would never want anyone to go through what I did. I can feel the effects of those seizures. Loss of memory for sure. Just be safe and while you‚Äôre on basically any psych meds take care of you‚Äôre body as best as you can especially with other drugs!!",False,False

But I just... I never would've imagined that it would've been such a dealbreaker for me, but I can't gain weight like that right now. If I noticed it happening I would probably change meds immediately. I will absolutely try everything though. Also, who knows how I would actually feel or react once I found meds that worked?  Thank you for the support. ‚ô• And I'm glad you've found meds that worked for you!",False,False

Which ""caused"" my relapse 2 years ago when I started taking it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I was surprised my GP put me on it considering he vaguely knew about my history of EDs, but I think at the time it had been long enough since I had ""recovered"". And in all honesty, I totally forgot about the seizure-risk until right this second. It was also largely because we had cycled through like *five* SSRIs and none of them worked for me (TMI maybe - especially because both my doctor and I refused to keep me on something that gave me adverse sexual side effects).   I should probably get off of the wellbutrin now that it's been determined my ""anxiety"" was not necessarily what we thought it was.......but I just haven't gotten around to it.",False,False

I‚Äôve been on like a gazillion meds and only one made me gain weight, and as soon as I told my doctor he took me off of it.
