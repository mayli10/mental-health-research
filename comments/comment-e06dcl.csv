Idk if you are, but if so, the constant irritation to that area of the mouth (side cheek area/ throat) is naturally going to be in a constant state of inflammation. It is only your body trying to do its job, so by stopping the cause, you can stop the effect. Also, emphasizing that this can take a long time- months or years of recovery. Otherwise, yes, the protein will help the entire body- not just the face- utilize the water for cellular processes rather than hanging around being useless. This bloat is anywhere in the body- not solely the face- but with time and consistency it will likely have an effect. The drinking-water will also help rid of any bloat and help move along the fluid in both the musculocellular system and the lymphatic system. Exercise will help the move along the lymph since it relies on muscles to pump it through and it will also have the muscles file through the water by having their cells use it. It doesn't have to be hours on end of crazy intense stuff- just do something you like that can get these muscles pumping a little  bit a few times everyday: walk around your block, lift some weights, do random spurts of jumping jacks, etc). I want to emphasize that these are all things that can contribute help, but they all will take time and consistency to actual give ""results"". And as in any case these results may be small and insignificant, but again, it's not like any of these things hurt you or make it worse, either. So it's either a win or a win-win, I suppose. Like me, too, you may just not be blessed with that chiseled face and that sucks (at least I feel like it sucks for me), but I do know enough to be able to depict my face from a bloated Mrs. Puff from Spongebob and a maybe-not-so-bad face some days. Hope this helped and I don't mean any rudeness in anything I said- I am a puffy-faced person, too, trying to fix it through trial and error and in no means perfect at any or all of these efforts everyday. That being said, knowledge is power and maybe some of this knowledge can help you because even the smallest things are more than nothing. :)",False,False

So... basically if I feel my face is ‚Äúfat‚Äù... it is because I need more protein in my diet, need to drink more water to ‚Äúflush‚Äù, and possibly exercise to move things around??",False,False

I for one, used to be much prettier than i am now and my face was more defined, but i certainly am not like a jawline-model (lol). unfortunately, i am cursed with a hideous fat face now, too. i find that when i don't purge it takes a long time to start to get better and i'm talking weeks or months... and since i am not really doing great right now and b/p-ing every week a few times i remain with my fugliness. sorry, just being honest about my experience. hope that kinda made more sense in the science stuff?",False,False
