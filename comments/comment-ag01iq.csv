Just remember that ED overlaps much with anxiety/depression/neuroticism. I would recommend looking into the Big 5 personality traits and understanding how you process your own emotions and thoughts based on the way you are. Half of it is chemicals in your body/brain, the other half is how you react and manage those chemicals. Good luck!",False,False

I think you really have to work with your psychiatrist over a span of months/weeks, but most importantly realize that psychoactive drugs require this timeframe to accumulate in your body and make chemical changes in your brain. SSRIs like Lexapro allow seratonin, the pleasure chemical, to stick around longer in your brain chemistry. I thought this was bullshit, especially starting at 5/10mg, but if you give it chance and allow some time to build up, then it could simply make you think &amp; feel ""normally."" You might become slightly more rational, calm, articulate, reasonable, mature, and present. All of these effective are imperceptible initially, but looking back it did make a huge difference for me because you begin to gain a level of confidence that normally isn't there due to the usual lack of self-esteem/worth.  There are some negatives: losing massive amounts of libido (could be positive), the need to ""taper"" off the medication, reduction of appetite (when you want to binge)/gastro problems, and general frustration that you're trying everything to curb your ED/depression/anxiety but then realizing there's no miracle drug. Oh well, hope this rant helps in someway.",False,False

I read ""horror"" stories of people gaining 10-40lbs within a year due to paxil. I been on it for a while. I had trouble sleeping (insomnia), so my doctor told me to take it at night. It helps me fall asleep. it helped me have my first regular sleep in a long long time. I never gained weight on it which I'm thankful for. I was worried it would be too similar to lexapro (super similar antidepressants), thus it wouldn't help my anxiety or depression. It's helped a ton reguarding both my anxiet and mood! I use to have to take xanax nearly daily to not feel super anxious, now I don't even really need my xanax. It calms me more than xanax and lexapro ever have. Some people have it really rough with paxil, especially the first two weeks. I didn't, which was nice. As of right now, I really enjoy being on it... I feel 'normal.' ",False,False
