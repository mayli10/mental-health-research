They source nutritional information from various agencies. I can't remember the acronyms for all of them, but the one that recorded most of the McDonald's stuff they have checks 74 different micronutrients. This includes various types of fats and proteins, fiber, starch, sugar, various vitamins, and various minerals. The macronutrient amounts are calculated from the micronutrients as is fitting. They even show alcohol as a macronutrient which is very interesting since it's often not regarded as one. I don't know if that's good or bad. Probably good since alcoholic drinks still have carbs listed.",False,False

You should totally make that public in MFP so other people can have the same peace of mind. Also... not as bad as I thought, I'll have to see if the McD's here offer it.",False,False
