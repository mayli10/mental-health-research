Been a freeing two years since. I still exert control over the walking and I'm kind of obsessed with getting all my steps in but not having to ""make time"" to get sweaty, lose so much energy to cardio, and then deal with my sweaty body and hair and become presentable...well, it just made dieting seem like a breeze!!!",False,False

I have a bit more muscle definition I suppose.   My day will be going really well...Until I bake a cake that is over 2000kcal and eat it in 24 hours along with my regular meals...Or eat a 500kcal chocolate bar straight after my run which automatically negates the calories I've burnt...  Why am I like this.,False,False

I was relentless in my diet and 1+ hr a day exercise for over 20 years. I thought exercise was the difference between being skinny and not. Lost countless hours of my life to it. When I finally did gain weight because of pregnancy, of course I ramped up the exercise. One and a half years post partum with not enough progress made, I stopped exercising cold turkey. Started dropping weight more easily once I did that bc I could finally focus on CICO without lying to myself that all my running and HIIT would make up for these few extra bites. I still walk a lot, 6-8 miles a day and I do planks. I'm not quite as thin as my old average weight... I'm 108 instead of 104. That's right. 4 pounds. That's the difference between uber cardio and strength training girl and just walks around the city and does planks girl. That's my story and everyone is different, just sharing my experience.",False,False
