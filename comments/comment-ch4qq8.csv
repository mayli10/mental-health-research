I'm definitely not saying it's good to treat a person with an ED this way - it's still asshole behaviour, but at least you could sort of see their intents and reasoning in that case.    But in my opinion, even a hopelessly uneducated person would surely realize that poking fun at you for being a ""big eater"" kind of undermines the whole ""forced recovery"" plan? This is honestly baffling. I can't tell what they're trying to accomplish.  Regardless of their intent, they're still being absolute dickheads.

The second possibility is, they are ""feeders"" (people who wants to feed other people to make them fat). And your story really sounds like that.
