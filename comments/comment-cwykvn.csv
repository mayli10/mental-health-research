(she's 4,so it's a simple one). Do a face mask, soak our feet, paint toes (and fingernails if she's managed to not bite them. Work in progress there lol) and do a hair mask treatment. It's not a ton, but it's an enjoyable experience creating memories with her.",False,False

Iâ€™m obsessed with Origins Rose Clay Retexturizing Mask and use it 1x a week, and since my skin has gotten drier in the past few years, sometimes Iâ€™ll follow it up with the Fresh Rose Mask for hydration. During the day, I use Andalou Naturals Argan Benefit Balm for SPF/moisture, and at night, I use Living Libations Rose Best Skin Ever and PerriconeMD eye cream. When I want to depuff, I massage my face with a jade roller.  I have to exfoliate regularly, so I rotate between The Body Shop Vit C Liquid Peel and Paulaâ€™s Choice AHA, and for a deep clean 1x a week, I use the Aztec Clay Mask (like $8 at Whole Foods for a huge jar) and sometimes mix in shungite powder. Itâ€™s been ages since Iâ€™ve done a full face of makeup, but Iâ€™m going out tomorrow for my anniversary and Iâ€™ve realized that my makeup applies much better when I focus on skincare, so Iâ€™m swapping my primer and setting spray for rosewater + glycerin for a dewy look.",False,False

I dry brush, then take a long warm bath with coconut oil (moisturizes the skin), i put on a face mask, tint my eyebrows and paint my nails.  I also wear sunscreen every day and never sleep with makeup on. I take good care of my skin.",False,False

Its the only thing I genuinely like about my physical being. The reason for this is because I use it to protect myself from the eyes of others.
