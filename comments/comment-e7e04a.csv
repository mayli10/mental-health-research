I’ve written about it before so if you go through my posts you’ll find a longer thing but some tips:  -	Don’t try and compensate for your binges; focus on getting back to “normal”, not restricting. Set your goal to maintenance for now. Trying to restrict too fast will just lead to more binges when you go over your goal.  -	Track everything, even if you’re still binging. My binges were at their worst and longest when I stopped tracking because I’d literally forget foods.  -	Don’t fight it. Work with it. Don’t deny that you want to binge; see if you can work on a compromise with yourself.   Basically, just focus on getting control over your eating, not how much you eat. Prioritise making conscious decisions, even if you have to choose to overeat at first.   Good luck, it’s hard but completely doable.",False,False
