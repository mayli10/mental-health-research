Oh same I can't eat before a workout tho, I just feel sick. That's quite a lot for a day eh, but same tbh lol. Definitely focusing on more protein in my diet tho! xD",False,True

Thank you :D",False,True

Hmm I get what you mean though for sure, it's easy to think you're eating enough and everything is normal when you don't consider how much you're burning as well!",False,True

I try to make sure at least 20% of my calories come from protein, which can be a struggle some days. It sounds like a lot of calories, but I’m losing weight more quickly than I thought.  Sometimes I feel like I don’t have an ED because of how much I’m eating, then I realize I spend all of my time on subs like this, weighing myself, and checking MyFitnessPal.",False,False

Weight lifting does burn a lot of cals by itself and afterwards to repair the muscles. Use lighter weights if you can, like 5 lbs, because it’s likely you’ll lose muscle anyway if you restrict too heavily while doing that, so it’s a waste of your time to try and up the weights unless you’re eating at least 1400-1500 a day. The best you can hope for, I’ve found, is to try and maintain as much muscle as possible.",False,False
