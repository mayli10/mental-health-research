To me, I have a huge nose with bumps on the side, making it crooked. One brow bone is worse than the other, making my brows never match.

Well, at least I thought it was really bad. Turns out it was dismorphia. It was actually pretty mild acne but i thought it was horrible despite everyone telling me it wasn‚Äôt noticeable. Interestingly enough, that time in my life with acne was a really good point in my ED recovery. I wasnt tracking food or anything, I was eating like a normal person. When my acne eventually cleared a few months later, boom, ED is back full force. It‚Äôs almost like I can‚Äôt just allow myself to be content with my appearance!",False,False

It's especially bad when people say oh what a nice photo of you, but it objectively is not a nice photo and my face looks awful. Is that actually what I look like? It kind of blows my mind sometimes.",False,False

Several months ago, I was having a breakdown about how puffy my face looked and I saw my reflection morphing into a literal pig face and it terrified me. I‚Äôve honestly just learned to live with my ED at this point, but my BDD causes me a lot more anguish.",False,False

One of my big come to Jesus moments was when I figured out if I really really tried to make myself believe I was looking at MY face when looking at pics of celebrities, they instantly turned ugly. It was both terrifying and comforting.   Buuut I still refuse random photos bc I‚Äôm honestly unphotogenic in still pictures (unless the photog is extremely talented and understands light, depth, etc).
