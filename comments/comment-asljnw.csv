It’s around 25 calories a serving and really hits that snack spot. It’s quite salty though so might want to look out for any potential bloating.,False,False

I like the popcorn bars (the PB one esp tastes magically buttery) more than the squares. I taste more of the chicory root (?) and the sweetness factor is through the roof, and surprisingly for a sweet tooth like myself, I find I don't like them as much. Huh",False,False

Also all the Alpen Light bars are 65-70 I would recommend the Jaffa cake ones and the chocolate and fudge ones!  Some of the activia light no added sugar yogurts are only 60 if you’re a yogurt person, I would recommend the peach     I’ll second the recc for hartleys 10cal jelly I smash those regularly   Also one of my fave snacks is mashes raspberries on rice cakes with a little salt on top to bring out the flavour, can come our way under 100 depending on what brand rice/corn cakes you use!   Also a use for the fibre 1 brownies: break one up, microwave it for 20 second and put it on halo top and boom you basically have a sundae, sure you could find sugar free syrup too but the ice cream/brownie combo is enough for me for a decadent low cal treat!!",False,False
