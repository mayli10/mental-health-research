I know it varies for different people so don't compare yourself or freak out if it takes longer, but in my experience it took about a month and at some point in the past week tapered off, to the point where yesterday I realized I can eat normal-sized meals like a normal person and feel full!  The discomfort and hunger will pass! The extreme hunger is your metabolism ""waking up"" fully and your body getting itself out of any sort of malnourished state it was in. Your digestive system also takes a bit of time to adjust, but after a week or two I finally stopped being in pain with regular-ass amounts of food.",False,False

The spoiler alert is that her weight gain plateaued after a couple of months, just in case you’re particularly frightened of never ending weight gain. She’s brutally honest about the process and shows her bad moments as well as her good so it’s a really decent portrayal of her kind of recovery.",False,False

It is a good thing you're being supervised by a dietitian...trust them! I know it is scary experiencing extreme hunger and at the same time giving up some of the control to a dietitian, but it is truly truly *truly* the best thing for you! They will make sure that you have enough to meet your needs, and to make sure you don't start the pattern of bingeing and restricting, which is what happened to me. It was absolute HELL. If there's one thing I would go back and tell myself, it would be to just trust the process!   Best of luck to you, you can do this!!!",False,False

Started watching her videos and not going to lie, it scares the SHIT out of me, but maybe this will be good? Like maybe it'll help with the physical side effects I've been having, I'm just scared of super intense rapid weight gain.",False,True
