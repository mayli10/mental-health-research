As hard as it can be, donâ€™t compare yourself to other people and just focus on you. Recovering is going to be extremely difficult if youâ€™re surrounded people who are struggling with the same thing. Also, your ED is whats making you feel jealousy towards your friends, but you yourself know that it is an unhealthy and miserable disease that no one deserves to go through. You are not a bad person, I hope all goes well for you in the future",False,True

I want to help her but it's hard because I also have an Ed. But it just makes me feel like a bad person for having a part of me that just want her to be some kind of ana buddy, it makes me sick how selfish I am. I also have another friend who has mostly recovered from her Ed, but sometimes I notice she denies food or only eats half, she doesn't know abt my Ed but sometimes I rlly wish I could tell her that I understand what it's like to some extent, that I'm there for her but I know she would force me into recovery and while I want others to recover sometimes I feel like I'm not thin enough to be sick, that I haven't been doing it long enough, that I'm not valid enough to recover, she would tell my mum (I'm 14 and she's 16) and while I want to help her I can't because I hardly see her or talk to her, and I would only make it worse if I told her abt my Ed, and even tho I know she's struggled for 3 years with the disorder I'm jealous of her body, she can wear crop tips and skinny jeans, she has a flat stomach and a thigh gap, her skin is clear and she's dainty and pretty and I feel jealous but also know that that makes me a horrible person because it's not beautiful, what she did to herself to get that body was unhealthy and not pretty, and I'm a bad person for still looking at her and being jealous of how thin she is and it frustrates me so much.  Sorry for the long comment, just venting I guess.",False,False

I do mention it to some close friends, but speak of it in a past sense. I have a really slow metabolism and low TDEE so me restricting doesnâ€™t really show up on my body and no one can tell I still struggle with it. I only share because Iâ€™m trying to reduce harm and not get triggered by my friends, so they know what to not talk about around me.   I just need to untangle the threads on my own first before I ask for help tbh",False,False

Plus I'm horrible at opening up and sharing my issues so I know I haven't done a great job at explaining my anxieties to him. The only person who really has an idea that I'm struggling is my boss, and that's just because she is encouraging me to seek treatment. I made an appt with an eating disorder clinic for next week, I haven't even told my husband about the appointment. Honestly, I don't know how I an going to tell him. It's so hard for me to be open about things that cause me anxiety or stress. He knows how meticulous I calorie count, how I can't eat anything without weighing it, my drastic weight loss last year, and my self hatres towards my body, yet he doesn't see the issue.",False,False
