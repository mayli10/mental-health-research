Iâ€™m having a similar but sort of opposite experience. One shitty part of my ED was(/is) the panic that would come up sometimes when I was trying to decide whether or not to eat, or when I was trying to stop myself from eating. That panic would often lead to a binge. When I try to not smoke, I have the same feeling of panic â€” but I donâ€™t hate myself when I give in. (At least, not yet, because I havenâ€™t ever tried that hard to stop.) So rather than using my restricting skills to quit, Iâ€™m using my lack of willpower as an excuse to keep going sort of. I figure if Iâ€™m gonna inevitably do something thatâ€™s bad for me, Iâ€™d rather do the thing I donâ€™t hate myself for. (But I def should try to quit lol.)",False,False

I think my years of experience denying myself food helped me quit opiates. And aiming my ED brain on alcohol produces periods of sobriety, when my fear of calories outweighs my desire to get drunk.  When Iâ€™m feeling optimistic I tell myself I can do anything, itâ€™s just a matter of focusing my mind.",False,False
