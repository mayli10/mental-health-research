That’s why I said I haven’t restricted lower than 800, 800 is not a low restriction for my measurements. So I can’t tell you what the depth of weight gain is from a very low restriction Bc I haven’t done it. I was just trying to say other factors can cause poor metabolism like pcos! And that I started so low calorie when I was extremely overweight that as you lose, that calorie deficit is no longer helping as it would if you were heavier (common sense). Yes water weight is what you gain and lose first. I don’t I’ve been checked for it tho. Starvation mode is described clinically as what I said, you can look it up. When you don’t have any more stores left that’s when your body feeds on it self muscles, bones etc. you are describing a near death end of starvation mode. You can be overweight and go into starvation mode if you were to not eat point blank. Now if starvation mode has multiple definitions then dismiss what I said.",False,False

Starvation mode is when someone has been starving for an extended period of time and their body fat percentage becomes so low that their body starts shutting down systems which results in a decreased metabolism. Yes the metabolism decreased when you lose weight since you have less mass/ fewer cells, but that’s not what people mean by starvation mode. Also, your example of not losing much weight at 135 is pretty normal tbh if you’re sedentary. You would lose less than a lb per week or maybe even less than half a lb if you’re really sedentary and especially if you’re not extremely precise about tracking calories, like most people. Remember if you eat packaged food that it can be off by 20% which will make a huge difference if you eat a lot of it and mean you are in an even smaller deficit if not even in one at all. Furthermore weight loss can be masked easily by fluctuations in water weight and of course stool. It’s really unlikely that you  are in “starvation mode” at your BMI. You could have hypothyroidism though. And you’re probably more sedentary than you think.",False,False

They don’t want to hear the truth, even though we all continue to damage ourselves in spite of it. I’m obviously not the most knowledgeable, and not fully aware of everything but I’ve been overweight since I was 4 yrs old and have been practically binging and restricting all my life, so I have more experience with such and how the body reacts. As well as done my own research and took college classes on it.   Okay so all of the cells in our body need energy right? As we know carbs are our body’s first source, then fat, and then protein (protein should never be used for energy only when you are in absence of the other two= loss of muscle during high restriction) None of these macromolecules can be directly absorbed into our body’s cells from the food you’ve eaten. You need certain mechanisms to break the food into the molecules and into polysaccharides disaccharides etc. So once you ingest food, we want sugar (carbs is our first source of energy remember, and carbs turn into sugar) going into our cells.  Once we eat our blood sugar levels increase (highest inc from carbs) which tells the beta cells within our pancreas to secrete the hormone insulin into the blood stream. This insulin tells the cells to open up as it attaches on the outside to insulin receptors (think of a key and lock fit) allowing a opening for the sugar(glucose) to go into cells.   So insulin’s role is to decrease blood sugar levels by releasing such into cells and therefore storing it as energy for later use. This is a normal bodily process that you are supposed to undergo. Which is why if you’re insulin resistant or diabetic you have high blood sugar. This is Bc the insulin is not being produced properly/not enough, and when there isn’t a proper amount to open the cells no glucose can leave the blood. If you constantly expose yourself to high carb/sugary foods/you are eating more than you need =that’s when the blood sugar gets stored as fat (at a abnormally high rate) = fat gain. You don’t need this excess as energy requirements are fulfilled as of now, so we keep it for later. Spiking of insulin indicates you have eaten a fairly large amount of sugar/carbs or more than one is used to, and the insulin is trying to lower this level so more will be produced in response.  So from what I gather when you do not meet your energy needs, you go into starvation mode. When we are in starvation mode or under our calories our metabolism drops. Everyone knows someone who is of higher weight than someone else, will burn more calories as they have a higher energy expenditure. Therefore when you lose weight from restricting you’re lowering your expenditure directly lowering the metabolism. Why would someone who is 100 lbs need the metabolic power of someone who is 600 lbs? Do you get what I’m trying to say here? Obviously I’m not sure as to what caliber it decreases based on how much lost or other physical components but that’s the gist. From even something as simple as just an evolutionary perspective here our body is made to survive! And surviving means storing whatever we ingest, so we do not die or do damage to ourselves! So during starvation our insulin levels are low, there’s no glucose intake essentially not needing insulin to be made. The next important hormone here is glucagon. Glucagon is released in response to starvation vs insulin during a fed state. A negative feedback loop if you will. This hormone releases glycogen (stored form of glucose) to give us energy while in the absence of intake of glucose. Think of insulin making these stored forms (going into cells for later use) and glucagon breaking them down in the liver to be released into the blood stream.  Once you eat you are going to increase blood levels, increase insulin in response, and what does insulin do?? STORE ENERGY!!!   So yes you will gain once your metabolism is lowered because you aren’t burning as much, leaving excess in the blood to be stored by insulin (once you do eat) but the amount of weight gain is overly dramatized. If you restrict so highly even if you do store whatever little you eat you will be dipping into the stores within moments to keep your body alive regardless, resulting in further weight loss. In my personal experience once you start to increase and stabilize that increase (I want to increase cals by 300 let’s say) as long as you do it in a regulated manner you’re metabolism will adapt to it to an extent. I have never restricted more than 800 so I can’t tell you from that end, but Jump from binge to restriction and my metabolism is somewhat bad due a)genetics b)pcos c) because I have lost 50 lbs in a very quick manner and now eating 1200 doesn’t make me lose anymore that’s almost maintenance for me (I’m 5”3 135). So I have to eat way less than the average person with my measurements. Because our fat cells don’t go away once we lose they just shrink, so vs someone who is was always skinny it’s harder to maintain. I wouldn’t be too worried unless you highly restrict or fast for a while. Why do you think when people fast for a while they gain at least half right back if they don’t gradually eat.   Sorry this was so astronomically long!! If you have any other questions or need me to clarify anything let me know!! Sorry I tried to explain it the best I could, and with most of the knowledge I can remember lmao",False,False

Because your body was in starvation mode now it’s seeing food so it’s like ooo I’m gonna need this let’s store as much as I can.
