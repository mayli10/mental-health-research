That purging taxes your heart and electrolytes more than shorter term restriction. But then I realized seizures don‚Äôt really have to do with your heart, as the cause of seizures is dysfunction in the brain. Anyway, I ended up googling as you suggested and there was a study done, and apparently risk of seizures were increased particularly in patients with bulimia. But there‚Äôs a greater risk of bone loss/osteoporosis with SSRIs for AN. So unsurprisingly, any ED make various medications more dangerous.   Thanks for your thought provoking answer :)",False,False

This is going to be higher for long term restriction and purging/bulimia since those both weaken your heart a lot.... Especially as purging really messes up your electrolytes which alone can cause seizures. Lowered risk for high allowance/short term restriction but still risk.  Again I'm not a doctor/expert! You can always Google these things and get info yourself too :)  Stay safe everyone üíú,False,False

For all of them, when I started taking them I had pretty bad nausea for the first couple of weeks and lost a lot of weight, but then after a while my appetite started coming back really strongly and I'd gain it all back again. Then whenever I went up a dose the same thing would happen.  I think the main thing is to take them really consistently, because then the appetite changes will be more gradual and you can learn to deal with them. It's easy to panic when your appetite comes back or is stronger than you expected, and I know in the past it's made me want to go up a dose just to lose my appetite again (which not a good idea!) or stop taking them because of the increased appetite even though I really need them for my health. In my experience, if you go up doses gradually and take them at the same time every day you can manage the side effects over time.  I also ended up eating a lot of low calorie vegan yoghurt type things when I was on them because it helped with stomach pain, both when I had nausea and after that.",False,False

While there are some medications and conditions out there that can cause *a very small* amount of weight gain without any diet changes whatsoever, the weight gain talked about with psychiatric meds is due to an increase in calories consumed. Interestingly enough, it‚Äôs not solely because of appetite increases, although that can obviously play a part. More often than not, it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre legitimately feeling better and are therefore doing things like eating out with friends or just plain not worrying so much about what you‚Äôre consuming.   As for what medications to try that won‚Äôt cause as much weight gain, it‚Äôs often more of a dosing issue. Lower doses have lower side effect profiles, meaning you‚Äôre less likely to have problems associated with weight gain, like increased hunger. That said, Wellbutrin is known for a particularly low side effect profile as well as weight loss. Low-dose Zoloft might be another option, at least as far as anxiety is concerned. Modafinil/Provigil isn‚Äôt typical prescribed as just an antidepressant, but it‚Äôs being investigated as such. Of course, your doctor knows you and should be able to make recommendations specific to your situation.",False,False
