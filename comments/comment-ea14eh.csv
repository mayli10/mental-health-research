It is shitty you are completely valid for feeling that way.  Maybe you could talk to your parents and tell them what is helpful/ not helpful?   also if you feel comfortable with it I would suggest  telling your nutrition teacher about your ed and asking to not be tested on triggering material.  I was exempted from a few things in high school bio to do with nutrition after telling my teacher about things,False,False
