And he says shit like ""oh i haven't eaten in 13 hours guess i'm doing intermittent fasting now"" or talks about how he's eaten \*so much\* when it's really just a normal portion for a tall, relatively active, young man. And it's triggering af. Doesn't help he works in medical care and talks about ""that anorexic has lost weight again and is now at X bmi"" like holy shit could you just not",False,False

It can be so hard to see someone you care about seemingly acting flippant about something like that. To empathize with your friend for a moment, though, I really believe that in order to even think that heavy restriction and fasting is a good idea, she must at least have some disordered thoughts surrounding food and body image. It doesnâ€™t seem possible to give yourself an eating disorder, itâ€™s more like her potentially disordered thoughts surrounding eating are now turning into disordered behaviors. She could probably use your help right now, as someone who might know a bit about what sheâ€™s going though. Her behaviors may be different from your own, but she could be struggling, and may need a sympathetic ear.   That being said, I get how listening to someone talk about losing weight and restricting can be pretty triggering, and you are so well within your rights to take a break from hearing her talk about that kind of thing. For me, Iâ€™ve had to ask several people in my life to not talk about calories, dieting, etc. in front of me because it stresses me out. I can understand that they have their own issues surrounding food, but I donâ€™t want their issues to worsen mine. EDs can manifest in really competitive ways, and I struggle with wanting to be â€˜the best,â€™ the â€˜most beautiful,â€™ the â€˜perfect one.â€™ I find it hard, but I try to remind myself that I donâ€™t actually want to compete with my friends, but rather I want to build them up to be their best selves. Youâ€™re doing your best, and I hope you have a good day today ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—",False,False
