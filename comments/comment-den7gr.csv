And could be goal.  But I also remember that once quite a while ago when I first saw her I felt something off, and felt instinctively she was a bit too thin. In the time since then I myself have lost weight, so now comparing to me I find her less far away on a thinness scale if you get what I am saying.  And so that instinctive feeling is not there anymore. And I might find it now achievable for myself.  I guess a part of it is also that we are never really satisfied. And we look not necessarily from a global fixed scale but on a relative scale to us. You will feel that the ""normal"" is lower compared to others as you will assume normal is something close to you. So the lower you go, the lower you will feel the ideal ugw is. It's never really enough unless you decide before hand what's the lowest you are willing to go and not go below that.   Also I think the lower you go there is less actual visible change on the outside. Since the flesh is close to the bone anyway there's only so much it can change shape. Just thinning of the layers. In the middle healthy ranges there's enough fat/muscle tissue to actually form structures and move around and with slight changes in that range you'd see more visible difference.  &lt;/TW&gt;",False,False

In my opinion, a healthy womans body DOES have noticeable fat on it, even with lots of exercise, and just because people like Gigi Hadid and Ariana Grande don't look outright sickly does NOT mean they're not unhealthy. I think you have to be underweight or at least a low healthy weight with a lot of muscle to look like that, because yes, it is healthy to have some fat!  I like to look at k-pop idols when I get dysmorphic, because they have their actual weights listed by their agencies (I'm pretty sure), so I KNOW the reason they look that good is BECAUSE they have a 16 bmi or whatever. Like, it's easy to keep moving the threshold for what 'underweight' looks like when it still looks passably healthy and you don't know their actual weights so you can't be objective about it.",False,False

Well this is a lot to unpack, lol... instead of just downvoting you, I’d like to offer some advice.      If I were you, I’d maybe try to look inward and find out why it matters to me so much what people on here consider thinspo or UW.      Who cares?? Some people’s thinspo is just straight up collarbone, and nothing else shown. Some is just thigh gap, or hell, thin wrists. Everyone is different, and you being concerned about the BMI that OTHER people consider thinspo is, well, a bit saddening to me. And not in a “you’re a sad person” type of way, but it makes me worry about you. I hope you’re doing okay and can try to reflect inward and work on your own happiness ❤️.

I really don't think Ariana looks underweight, she's short like we are and BMI kinda favors us.

She does ping my radar for ED behavior but doesn't look underweight to me. Maybe 18.5-19.   Yeah I don't trust online weights much (I was just using Ambrosio as an example) and instead rely more on visuals. LOL at the idea of Miley having a 16 BMI, that's ridiculous, she got thin for awhile in the past but I'd put her solidly around 22 BMI right now.   It's less that I think any of these girls are underweight (I don't really) and more that it seems like people here on the sub think they are or that they are soooo skinny.

Wider faces are also something a lot of teens have and they then thin out with age, which is what I meant by youthful. Just that it's a trait more commonly found in the young.",False,False

But yeah, I don’t think any of those people you listed are significantly underweight, except Natalia Dyer. I don’t think it’s your body dysmorphia.   You can’t trust the weights/BMIs listed for those people online because modeling companies are known for lying about the weights of their models. And, for celebrities who aren’t models, those weights listed are just estimates from people, so unless the celebrity has come out and said what their height and weight is, you can’t actually know what their BMI is.
