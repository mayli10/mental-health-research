My parents were similar. Both of them have disordered eating, and for a long time my mother was ~300 and my father ~350. I was always tall and juuuust overweight, but I was really active so it manifested as just a little fluff. I remember my mother skipping meals and hiding big bags of candy in her room.   My dad cooked, mostly, and it was all authentic Mexican. We would get takeout once a week, and we always had lots of treats around. There was no concept of an appropriate portion size or of waiting until dinner, but I also got in trouble specifically for eating too much of any one thing. I learned to sneak food and to take a little bit of everything, which was way more than I would’ve had anyway. I gained a TON of weight my freshman year of HS and then learned how to get rid of it, and here we are :’)  I don’t talk to my dad very often, but my mother has done a great job of turning the ship around. She and I have danced around the topic of our respective EDs, and I think someday I’ll feel okay to talk to her about it. She has been encouraging when I’ve lost weight, and hasn’t mentioned when I’ve gained.  Being 15 or 16 sucks a lot of the time, and I’m really sorry you’re feeling angry and frustrated. Remember that you can forge your own path now, and you’ll model healthier behavior for your own children if you want them. I second talking with your mom about it. She might be feeling some of the same things you are, and I bet things will get better in the next few years!",False,False

It might help to ask her about her feelings on the matter (in a calm and rational way).,False,False
