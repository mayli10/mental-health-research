Skip to 3:10.  https://youtu.be/S7OOwjBAFBI  Basically if your obsessed with food or weight or have food rules it's probably a eating disorder or at the very least disordered eating.  I do feel fake sometimes but I reminded myself why would I willing do this to myself. Sure I could just eat but then I'd constantly be yelling at myself for doing so. Normal right?  You don't need to be sick enough to mater or to be real. This shouldn't be a competition but most of us make it one. It's just part of it.,False,False
elmf2gr,t3_bgn168,t3_bgn168,SecretFinn,1,2019-04-23 20:36:00,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/bgn168/i_feel_fake/elmf2gr/,"Mental illness, true to the name, is more about the mental than the physical. Your weight doesn't matter. Your thoughts, emotions, and behavior patterns around food do. Also, anorexia and bulimia aren't the only types. If you want to, read a little about EDNOS/OSFED and the symptoms that can be involved there.  Self Dx is obviously a touchy subject for many, and professional diagnosis is the best case scenario/leads to the highest likelihood of successful treatment, but there are situations where it is necessary. There are race/class/gender barriers to professional diagnosis (people without health ins., people with jobs where professional Dx would come back to bite them, girls with autism, boys with ED, etc.) and sometimes self Dx is the only option. Doesn't make it invalid.   But if you want/need a professional Dx, why not ask one of your psych/therapists about it? The fact that you think about calories so much, the fact that you worry so much about 200-500 cals and call that a binge, the fact that you're here and it's affecting your life, says to me that you have some kind of disordered eating. Disordered eating =/= eating disorder though. Your doc who knows the whole situation might have a better guess whether the food-related struggles you're experiencing are a symptom of something else or a disorder of their own. But either way, you have a home here in this community if you need to talk about it. I, for one, have had a weird string of misdiagnoses and unrecognized issues, and I know it's not always as simple as saying ""yep I have anorexia""  Best of luck!",False,False
elm4495,t3_bgn168,t3_bgn168,stopandbelieve,1,2019-04-23 18:25:25,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/bgn168/i_feel_fake/elm4495/,"I think it’s natural to feel fake/like a fraud/like you’re not really sick. It’s part of the disorder. It sounds like it means a lot to you to have a diagnosis - would that serve as validation for you? I can empathize with that but also want to point out that even after being diagnosed, you can still feel like a fraud and not sick enough. So a diagnosis is really not a fix for everything  Is there any other way you can know that your struggle is valid and your pain is real? Eating disorders are messy and behaviors overlap between diagnoses, they exist on a spectrum.   Just because you eat doesn’t mean you’re not sick. Everyone eats food, including people with anorexia. Otherwise everyone would be literally dead.",False,False
