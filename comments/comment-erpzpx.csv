I have a round face with prominent cheekbones (think Chrissy Teigan or Vanessa Hudgens) so when I was borderline overweight I had a double chin with a moon face and no definition whatsoever. My face is still round but I now have somewhat of a jawline now and my cheekbones are more defined. Really made me feel better about my face shape ngl,",False,False
