Fortunately I was able to find a nice tight skirt because the only top I found that looked good was too big for me in the smallest size. I planned to tuck whatever I bought into my skirt anyway. It would have looked better if it were properly sized though.,False,False

It was nice being able to fit into my clothes properly ðŸ™ƒ I mean, not all of them. A lot of stores don't carry less than size medium and I definitely don't fit into a medium... Sometimes you need new clothes on short notice and medium is the best you can find though.",False,False
