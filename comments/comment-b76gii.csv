One of the hardest days of my life is when I tried to tell my mother that I have an ED and I wanted to see a therapist and she didn‚Äôt believe me because I was ‚Äútoo fat to have an eating disorder.‚Äù   I proceeded into a dark hole of a binge/purge cycle. This sub emulates that feeling sometimes. ,False,False

I‚Äôve struggled with ED for almost 20 years and have never been underweight, yet it has caused me an insane amount of mental and emotional suffering, has damaged many of my relationships... it is so much more than a physical thing to have an ED. It changes the whole way you perceive the world.",False,False

If people knew how much suffering goes on even when you're not bone thin they would understand how serious eating disorders get, and that the danger doesn't just primarily come from being underweight. I wish it was easier to explain to people that haven't been there. I hope you're staying safe and taking care of yourself!",False,False
