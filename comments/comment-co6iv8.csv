Something simple like ‚Äúhey, I know that in general you and [other roommates] share groceries but I have some particular dietary restrictions and money is a little bit tight at the moment (if you‚Äôre okay with telling him that) so I‚Äôd like to keep my food separate from the shared groceries. Thanks!‚Äù Nothing aggressive, just laying down a ground rule that you‚Äôd like your food to be left alone.",False,False

I thought about writing my name on my food but I'm worried I'd offend him or anyone else. They're all foreign so sharing food is normal for most people within their culture.  That's probably why we never set rules. Every housemate I had prior normally wouldn't touch anyone else's things so I never thought they'd be different. üò£ Big oops lol.  I'll see if I can somehow rally everyone together to talk about it but I'm unsure if it's worth it since my boyfriend and I are moving out in 3 months. Everyone also has drastically different schedules so it'd be tough to get everyone together.,False,True

I'm gonna talk this over with my therapist since I have problems with confrontation. She's been working with me on being more assertive so she can probably guide me on how to phrase things. This living situation is only for around 3 more months so the light at the end of the tunnel is near.,False,True

This issue arose most likely because ya‚Äôll never established rules when everyone moved in. Idk if you ever lived in a dorm with an RA but the very first thing that happens when everyone moves in together is that the RA holds a meeting with everyone to go over basic house hold ‚Äúrules‚Äù regarding trash duty, food, dishes, etc etc. you can kinda recreate that. Might seem ehhh but it actually helps in the long run.",False,False
