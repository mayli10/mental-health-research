Sometimes all you need is someone to say “it is allright, you do not have to fight all the time.” It is just so tiring to wear a mask all the time in order to ‘function.’  I’ll also keep mine crossed for you, hope your therapy gives you the right direction and at least enables you to live life with less drain and drama. It’s all we need in order to stay somewhat sane and hold on. :)",False,True

Sometimes when I'm miserable I have to really stop and ask if it's me and my fucked up head or if it's them. Tbh I brought that topic up in therapy last week - ""am I just a baby?"" Haha. But some places are really toxic, and even if they're not ""toxic"", we all deserve a work environment we're comfortable in. You spend too much time at work to be uncomfortable there.   I'm not even super outgoing, I'm just half-deaf and kinda loud D: I get what you're saying with interactions with your co-workers being... Draining? Like you're trying to prop up a work persona and it's kinda exhausting and it doesn't really feel like it's working?   Hopefully the rest works out and gives you some ideas for new career paths! I'll keep my fingers crossed for you :)",False,False

Already looking forward to the test you mentioned! Yesterday I came to the conclusion (after lots of talks with my friends and bf) that I will give up fighting and pretending to fit into something I am not and look elsewhere. For the second time this year soooo it is a but tricky cause yeah, EDs just like to focus misery on everything but the ED in order to survive.   And such a coincidence haha, I am the exact opposite of you, my colleagues expect me to be loud, out there and enthusiastic about everything. And I hate it and it is a big struggle. But yeah I know the feeling of the looks and side-eyes and not fully accepting how I am as a person. You just feel it sipping through every interaction, don’t know if you experienced the same? Probably just because they are different and cannot fully grasp it...   Let’s try the test see if it helps &lt;3",False,True

Most recently I was mentioned in a staff meeting for being ""too excited and loud"" during a work-related phone call. This is my normal speaking voice :c I don't belong here :c   I've already decided I'm going to try a different career, I was just terrified of making another bad choice.   Sooooo went to therapy and she introduced me to this John Holland Self Directed Search. It's based around the idea that jobs tend to draw certain personalities. So it has a bunch of personality questions and at the end it spits out a personality type and some careers for you.   Maybe you can try one of these tests to find something more in-line with your comfort levels? :c",False,False
