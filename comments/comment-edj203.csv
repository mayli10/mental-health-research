I hadn’t made that connection.   and don’t worry, as soon as I am enrolled in my new health insurance plan, I will be looking for a new therapist! I love living alone but I also have friends nearby so that’s okay too :)",False,True

I feel like new phases of life often make me feel a lot of pressure to restrict and lose weight, and somehow that leads to binge phases where I gain a lot.",False,False

To be fair, I had relapses ""in the plane sight"" before, definitely, but I'd say that my worst ones were definitely when some new chapter in my life was about to start (or was just getting in gear). New job, new degree, new place of living... you name it. I think it's largely to do with stress: the beginnings are always stressful, and for someone with a ED, we tend to deal with stress the only way how - through food (or the lack thereof). I think it's also a lot to do with control: new beginnings can strip down your sense of control, because they bring in so many particles of the unknown/uncertain. And that is scary too. It's a whole bouquet of triggers, imo.  What you talked about, e.g. the lack of treatment team by your side, social isolation - this all made me feel very nervous, because your situation, as you've recognized, will be a perfect setting for an ED relapse. I can only strongly advise you to find another treatment team as soon as you've moved (emphasis on the therapist!), because they might be able to help you navigate this rather difficult and stressful time. Best of luck!",False,False
