When I started to gain weight back, everything went to my belly and my boobs didn’t want to join the show.

At the same time, I’ll joke about them on occasion to avoid joking about feeling fat. What a paradox, right?  They pretty much came back at a similar ratio to the rest of my body returned, tbh. It took me a couple years to return to my normal size and with that, my boobs came back at the same rate.",False,False

Depending on what your body weight/distribution is right now, your body may first distribute the weight throughout your body, then to butt, then to boobs. But then again, every one is different. Not sure what your recovery regimen looks like, but if you are working out (or whenever it is safe recovery wise for you to do so), there are exercises you can do to build the muscles around your hips to make your butt look bigger and there are exercises for your chest that builds the muscles behind your boobs to make them appear bigger (boobs are like 100% fat, so there's nothing you can do to directly increase their size except put on weight and/or increase your body fat percentage if it's really low).
