I have a better watch than a fitbit, and I find that cold weather in particular throws it off (I train outside a lot). And then sometimes there's a huge lag from when I start doing some kind of activity and when it displays an elevated HR.   Basically, a wrist based monitor is good for giving you a ballpark training zone when you look at the memory over the course of several workouts. If you want it to be perfect, you need a chest strap.

Accuracy is how close the data is to the true value. Precision is how close the data is to itself. Optical heartrate sensors perform most poorly during exercise simply due to sweat interfering with the reading. When you are resting, the accuracy can be a lot better, like 5%. When you are looking at a change between sitting and standing of like 40 bpm like this, it's really unlikely that the inaccuracies at 50 bpm and 90 bpm are going to result in **more** relative error, because you are making the comparison at the same time, under the same conditions. In other words, say your actual heartrate is off by 10% at both readings. What are the chances the inaccuracies are significantly different under the same conditions, ie, you are actually 45 bpm at the low reading, and 99 bpm at the high reading? It's more likely the precision is fine, ie, it's 45 bpm vs 81 bpm, so the inaccuracy of the difference (40 bpm vs 36 bpm) is the same as that of the individual absolute values.  &amp;#x200B;  As for the actual reading jump itself, I'm not sure what would cause that. I have orthostatic hypotension that is exacerbated by calorie restriction, and the problem here is that my heartrate actually doesn't jump up the way it should when I stand up. Usually when my HR finally kicks up after 10 seconds or so, it's only on the order of the 10-20 bpm you originally mentioned. I'm not sure what to recommend here other than to see a doctor. Definitely wishing you the best with your recovery.",False,False
