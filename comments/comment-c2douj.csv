In my personal experience, nothing will ever be as bad as bulimia... those days are an endless blur of hating myself so, so much, feeling disgusting and emotionally unstable from the constant highs and lows of binging/purging. My whole system was so out of whack from throwing up all the time, and honestly the worst of it was the crushingly poor self-esteem that it caused. I was constantly overwhelmed by a lack of organization and feelings of hopeless despair.  Maybe not a popular thing to say, but things are comparatively much “better” with anorexia because it’s a highly egosyntonic disorder, i.e., it *feels* like I’m being “successful” and achieving goals every day, whether that’s a caloric intake, step count, weight, or anything else that gives the illusion of control/achievement. The flipside is that anorexia has kind of destroyed my personhood. I hated myself when I had bulimia, sure, but I still did lots of interesting things. With anorexia, my life has turned into a monotonous chore — I do the same things every day, eat the same things at literally the exact same minutes every day, walk the same routes, and have really lost the ability to deal with *anything* stressful that doesn’t fit my exacting routine. I think I feel better and my mind feels clearer, but I know that from an outsider perspective my livelihood is much worse than it used to be, and I’m pretty much a shell of a human being. This said, I still think there’s still nothing worse than the occasional periods where I b/p and experience all those feelings of self-disdain again.  I know this is a way longer answer than you wanted but this is something I think about a lot. It really depresses me that I’m so caught up in this delusion that everything is fine as long as I stick to the routine. I guess that’s the one thing that was better about having bulimia — I sort of wanted anorexia, but also wanted to be better. Now getting better is the furthest thing from my mind because I’m convinced I am content like this.",False,False

Both disorders are super horrible, mentally and physically. Anorexics suffer just as much as bulimics.Neither one is better  Bulimics tend to have anorexic tendencies/behaviors aswell. I can go weeks eating between 500-800cal. I can also go weeks B/P multiple times a day.   All I want is to be able to enjoy a nice home cooked with my family.",False,False
