My cuts were also noticed by a teacher which I kind of wanted to happen, but when she had me meet with a counselor, I was absolutely furious and I didn't speak a word to her for the rest of the year.  &gt; Now I'm the opposite   Me too. This is not the way I want to get attention. There's nothing charming about being a fucked up 20-something.",False,False

I have a complicated relationship with the people who hurt me in my past, but even though I would say they contributed to my disordered eating they are in no way responsible for it, and they wouldn't deserve to be made to feel guilty for it.  You can get through this!",False,False

When I was in highschool I was depressed AF and I used to self harm. Sometimes I did it somewhere obvious just so someone would notice. I would do enough cuts to know it wasn't a 'cat scratch' but I wouldn't fill up my whole arm because I didn't want to look 'crazy'. (That was for my legs that no one would see lol)  I remember once I had a teacher that for some reason I lowkey saw her as a motherly figure and my sleeve rolled up and she saw them and she just looked and didn't say anything. This happened 3 more x during the school year. She never said anything about it ever. I just wanted her to ask me if I was okay. I wanted someone to care about my wellbeing.  Now I'm the opposite. I'm so used to talking about restricting and the perils with having disordered eating online but in real life people ar elike what the fuck! i was face timing my friend and i started c/s in front of her because i'm just so used to it. she was horrified and i had to pull it off that it tasted bad but she said why did you take multiple bites then. :/  you're not alone in your feelings though. sometimes i wish someone would just say 'hey, i care about you and your feelings but i'm not going to act like you're crazy for doing what you do'",False,False

They didn't care about me before and they wouldn't care if they found out about my disordered behaviour. They would never accept any responsibility for it, and I'm not even sure if they should.   Sorry, just replied to another one of your comments too... But this really stood out to me.  I still have a hard time wanting to ""get back"" at some of my middle and high school ""frenemies"" and I'm 24. But even if they were hurt by my struggles and underweight body, they shouldn't be. It's my and only my responsibility to heal from my youth traumas and move past it.   I am not a victim.",False,False

When I started restricting heavily I did it because I wanted it to be my dirty little secret. I WANTED to be able to ""get back"" at everyone who concern-trolled me when I was bigger, to be able to say that I only lost weight because I was hurting myself. I would daydream about everyone tragically finding out and regretting their actions. I wanted them to worry about me, too.  But now, I don't want anyone to know. When people give me genuine compliments or ask questions about how I lost the weight I feel awkward and embarrassed. It's not my little revenge-secret any more, it's genuinely embarrassing. I feel bad that they would worry about me if they knew what I was doing, because that's not why I'm doing it any more. I just want to be thin. I don't want to make people upset or worried or sad because of what I'm doing to myself. I hope nobody finds out.  I think part of it was when I realised that the tiny percentage of people who I wanted to ""hurt"" with my secret would never actually be hurt by it. They didn't care about me before and they wouldn't care if they found out about my disordered behaviour. They would never accept any responsibility for it, and I'm not seven sure if they should. The people who would be hurt most about it, my friends, my family, my loved ones, are the ones who don't deserve to be. So now I'm stuck.  I think it's natural to want people to worry about you, though. I don't think it makes you a shitty person at all. Personally I think EDs are almost always manifestations of deeper emotional health issues, and it's totally NORMAL to need help, reassurance, and comfort when you're hurting. But people can't see internal hurt, so we sometimes manifest it into other, more alarming, more obvious behaviours, like disordered eating. We need help with something we can't really tangibly explain, so we come up with something we actually need help for.   You deserve support and love. I know people do care about you and you DO matter, even if it doesn't feel that way, and you don't need to be hurting like this to be important. This comm is always here for you when you need someone to care.",False,False
