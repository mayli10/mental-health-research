I know we are all just venting on here. But this seems very anti-recovery and posts like this are really triggering. I want to restrict more than anything and I’m trying not to do that. Now I just feel terrible. I know you probably didn’t mean to upset anyone but talking about fasting and restricting in a positive light and getting “skinnier than ever” is very very triggering and was very distressing to read. Now my ed is telling me how terrible I am when I was already trying to process the emotional turmoil that comes with feeling full when you have an ed. Please put TW’s,False,False
