There just needs to be something to protect the stomach lining. So if drinking a glass of milk post purge and pre antibiotics is something that would be manageable, that would be a way you can still take the meds you need.   GPs know very little about mental health typically speaking(normally just enough to be able to recognize a concern and refer you to a specialist), I'm sorry they were so dismissive. ",False,False

This may/may not be helpful but I have a strong inclination to tell you that tampering with the consumption of antibiotics can lead to organism resistance, and if that antibiotic needs to be prescribed for something else later, it may not be effective if you accidentally purge it too many times. I really hope you can find a way to keep your sanity and get those antibiotics in you! ",False,False

They’re given a very basic version of the two, but it’s kind of up to them to do more personal research on the subjects to be helpful in these areas. Essentially, he probably knows what bulimia is, knows the impulses, but only to a small degree. “Just don’t” is probably sound advice in his opinion. I don’t have bulimia, and I don’t know what it looks like for you, but if there’s a time of day when you usually eat something you won’t purge, I would time the antibiotics out for then. Example, If you tend to b/p at night, do it first thing in the morning with something that you can hold onto, by night they’ll be absorbed into your system, they won’t come back out.
