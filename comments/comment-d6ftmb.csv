Please please eat before you go to get it, because you might pass out otherwise. All the best getting one! The copper one (the one I was gonna get) doesn’t have any hormones, so even though it makes your periods heavier and more unpleasant, weight gain is NOT listed as a side effect!",False,False

Last time I had mirena I gained 50 lbs but I was eating nothing but margs and tacos. So idk I don't think it's the birth control so much as what you eat.,False,False
