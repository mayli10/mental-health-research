I know full well when I’m triggering myself, but I do it because I *want* my ED to get worse so I can lose more weight.   And yeah, my therapist wouldn’t understand. I mentioned it once and that was it. I don’t feel like doing outpatient programs haha.",False,False

Yes it's very comforting, but my twisted ideas could litterally destroy someone's life...",False,False

And then if they turn out to not be a match you have to start the process all over again. And yeah if they don't specialize in ED it's seriously just a huge waste of time because they'll ask super obvious/leading questions.,False,False

I have reached out a few times but get put on waiting lists. PLUS they're hella expensive if you want one that actually has education/experience with ED or other specific issues/disorders. I am also nervous because I know that If i see a therapist for my ED, I'd also have to revisit all of the other shit in my life. Which I understand is benefitial, but it is super intimidating. I had a few different counselors when I was younger and honestly they just made me feel extremely invalidated.",False,True

I know I'm basically fessing up to myself that my ED is active again when I'm in these communities and yeah I probably should see a therapist instead but they literally never understand.,False,False
