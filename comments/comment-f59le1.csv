If today’s the last day you’re with them you can just say you don’t have much of an appetite? If you’re firm about it they’re more likely to leave you alone ya feel? But yeah, you most likely won’t end up over 103, you’d have to eat about 4250 today. That said, don’t let any potential water weight scare you, it might happen just because you’re eating differently than normal. Hope that helps.",False,False
