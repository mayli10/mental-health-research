According to all the “usual” measurements (wrist, elbow, etc.), I have a “small” frame. However, the smallest I’ve ever been was 131 pounds, and my 23andMe results say that I am predisposed to weigh MORE than average for my height. So...what does that even mean? Who even made up this stuff in the first place? Is it just internet garbage?",False,False

I also have pretty big boobs but I doubt that has anything to do with it (though I did weigh them one time to 1.8lbs each lmao)",False,True

When I was a child I was like normal weight and very skinny looking and I went through a lot of tests because of it (I think they thought something was wrong with me.  Turned out I just had basically no body fat but a normal amount of muscle, which is why I appeared underweight even though my percentile was low normal. So yeah maybe you just lost a lot of fat but maintained a lot of muscle mass",False,False

This is why there are technically multiple measurements for indicating frame size because one alone could be inaccurate, like your wrists!",False,False

My wrists are pretty small, but yeah, my bones start showing at an -objectively- high weight for my height. It’s also, I guess, the stigma of being considered “petite” and the feeling of not being legitimate unless I reach those super low weights :l",False,True
