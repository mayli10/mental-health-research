It was because you're bigger than they are due to you being an adult, and they were probably looking to get a rise out of you. fuck em",False,False

I forgot I was literally half her height. Not saying what they said was OK, but kids suck at perception. Like my younger self would call fucking Ariana Grande ""fat""",False,False

I’ve learned that I can’t let it get to me because they don’t comprehend the weight of words just yet, and it’s likely that they’re just using words they saw on TV or heard out in the world. They can be really fucking mean though, and I’m sorry you had that experience. It’s never a nice feeling.",False,False

See, kids are cruel sometimes. They'll say things just to get a reaction, good or bad. You're very obviously not fat, and it makes sense for them to say that to either pick on you, or get a reaction because they knew it'd bother you.  Kids can be very sarcastic. Hell, maybe they were envious of you for being thin. Who knows at that age? But regardless of exactly why, the point is, they weren't genuinely thinking you were fat.   They just said it to bother you or pick on you, either because **A:** You are obviously very thin so it's funny  to them to call you fat as a joke, or **B:** They know you're conscious about your weight and very thin, so they called you fat either out of spite, or just trying to mess with you.  This honestly sounds like something that happened to my friend. When she was about to turn 20, she was feeling very insecure about it because she didn't want to get old and felt like she wasted her teen years. Well, her asshole little brother knew about this obsessive fear, and started always calling her old to mess with her. To her, that confirmed all her fears. But to us, it's very obviously just a snotty kid being a dick and we know she's not even close to being old.  It's the same with you. You believe it, but to us outsiders, it's very obviously nothing but kids being kids trying to mess with you or make a sarcastic joke. Don't let it get you down. Just because some kids say something untrue to mess with you doesn't make it a fact.  Oh, and as a side note, I bet if you actually were fat they wouldn't be rude enough to say anything. I bet they felt comfortable saying it because to them, how could someone so thin feel fat? Their undeveloped minds can't understand how that would bother you, so I'm sure they were just picking on you and assuming you were actually fat, wouldn't point it out like that.",False,False

This could have been picked up on TV or other media sooooooooo easily. You're likely posting this here because you have an ED and remember, with an ED comes an inability to properly tell if you are legitimately thin or not, so you have your mind f'ing with you too. Your mind is trying to say ""Hey, what these children said is EVIDENCE that I am INDEED fat like I've suspected all along!"" .... it's shitty evidence because they are 8 and 10, so you must disregard it or it can become a mammoth trigger.",False,False

Honestly, sometimes they say wonky stuff just because that’s a word they happen to find amusing this week. Or they got an interesting reaction saying it the other day so they’re trying it again. In a lot of ways all children are scientists - experimenting and gathering data.   (And it sounds their use of the word “fat” had  absolutely no basis in grown-up reality.)",False,False
