WELL I did the deed. I was not told to just eat more and sent on my way, and nor was I written a referral and kicked out the door. That said, my doctor's office actually has a behavioral health wing, which I knew, but they make no mention online of handling eating disorders so I was not sure whether that avenue would be pursued on site.   Turns out it was, and IMMEDIATELY, so the whole appointment ended up being more of a Thing than I anticipated, which was stressful enough but probably for the best since it didn't give me any *more* time to stew over it and second-guess imposter syndrome, etc.   But there was a lengthy interrogation (a very kind one) with my primary care Dr first, and he was not shy about digging right in. I have follow-ups with both him and the behavioral health folks in a few weeks, and he gave me a slight uptick in my daily calorie goal to work on in the meantime. And he did diagnose.   He also did mention the possibility of more specialized options but we seem to be working at this level for the time being, which I'm all for if it works.  As for bringing it up in the first place, I basically just told the nurse I was having food and eating issues. She clarified if I meant issues *physically* eating, and I said it was a mental thing. She gave me an anxiety/depression questionnaire to fill out and mostly left it at that until the doctor came in.",False,True

My suggestions would be to be as honest as possible. if you are skating the surface a GP won‚Äôt be able to give you the help you need. say something like you think you have anorexia but don‚Äôt want to self diagnose. maybe also ask for referrals? depending on what type of help you want, you could ask for an eating disorder therapist referral, an ED nutritionist referral, or nearby treatment center referrals. best of lucküíì",False,False

Ask for that. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where to find treatment/a therapist.‚Äù ‚ÄúI would like to try medication.‚Äù ‚ÄúDo you have a nutritionist you work with that I can speak to?‚Äù They may not have the resources up front but a decent doctor will do some leg work for you and follow up. They‚Äôll likely want to do some tests (EKG, blood work, etc.) so mentally prepare for that. And yes, they will suggest trying to eat more. Food is the cure and the medicine for eating disorders, the recommendation has to be floated to you. It‚Äôs also okay to say ‚ÄúI know I need to eat more but I need more support and help with it.‚Äù   A few things that helped me stay honest and chill about it: 1. They can‚Äôt help if they don‚Äôt know and they want to help you.  2. It‚Äôs highly likely that you aren‚Äôt the first person with an eating disorder they‚Äôve treated  3. You‚Äôre still in charge of yourself and still have agency (if you‚Äôre over 18). If you don‚Äôt like how they act, you can fire them.  4. This is about YOU and your health, not what your doctor thinks of you or how they feel about it. A competent doctor knows this.  5. Just as you are today, you are worth treatment and brace as shit for asking for it. A part of you knows this with conviction which is why you are seeking help. That voice of worth and self acceptance may be so, so quiet. The farther you get it will get louder. It only takes 20 seconds of insane bravery driven by that voice to ask for help. Let that voice lead the way. It might be completely terrifying and so vulnerable but it‚Äôs also worth it. So worth it.",False,False

In my experience trying to get treatment for a chronic illness, I got much better results re: them actually listening to me when I had a list of things I was unable to do or missing out on. If they can see how it's impacting you, they're more likely to give constructive help, in my experience at least.",False,False
