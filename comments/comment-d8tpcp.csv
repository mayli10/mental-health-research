I was sitting with my back turned but heard one of the guys called Julian say, ‚Äúyou know what‚Äôs really putrid. Jackie in a swimsuit.‚Äù Then he did an over dramatic shudder. I felt crushed because they didnt know I was there and he was supposed to be my friend. My eating disorder started when I was 11. I went through so much shit but I became conventionally attractive in my teens when I recovered from the anorexia. I am 22 now and have a healthy body and a healthy weight. I am no longer underweight but I am not overweight and I carry my weight nicely. I look different than I did when I was a kid but I went through so many years of self hatred and self doubt and just hating myself( this is changing and I am learning to love and take care of myself) . One day I was in the grocery store and my mom starts chatting with this lady. They‚Äôre going at it talking about things and she said , ‚ÄúJackie so good to see you. Julien is just around.‚Äù And she starts yelling for the fucker. My heart is beating 70000 miles an hour. I see the mother fucker and he goes. ‚ÄúWow puberty hit you like a truck, you look great.‚Äù He then had the gall to ask me out like 10 minutes into the conversation. I swear to god I wanted to clock him there and then. I declined politely when I really wanted to call him out and bitch slap the every living shit out of him. When I starved myself, I thought of his words. When I puked my foods, I thought of him. When I binged and restricted, I thought of him. His mom then asked me how I lost sooooooooooo much weight and that I looked ahhhhhmaazing. I was so mad at that point and straight up said ,‚Äù anorexia. It‚Äôs so easy. All you have to do is fast for three days. Eat an apple when you feel like passing out. Or you can follow the devil wears Prada diet where you eat nothing and when you feel faint eat a block of cheese.‚Äù I left at that point. In other words, what you say can stay with someone for year.
