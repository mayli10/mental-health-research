She’s definitely like my diet guru in a sense. She’s kind of like my work mom, too, which is nice. Always concerned and crap (not as nice, but still sweet). Anyway, she definitely believes that certain foods and certain ingredients affect not only what you listed, but so much more.   Even though I’m sure I’ve been to so many doctors, therapists, psychiatrists, etc, etc, I could probably give you a general idea (also with the countless hours of research and personal professional diagnoses I’ve been given), but I’m most definitely not a health professional (quite the opposite, haha), so I couldn’t give you a diagnosis even if I wanted to, unfortunately :/   I strongly encourage you to reach out and see a health professional if there’s one available in your area. For me, when I was finally diagnosed with OCD, it was like “holy crap, this explains so much. This explains my whole life. This explains everything.” It was truly eye opening and I won’t lie— I cried. Not out of sadness, but relief. I never understood why I did the things I’d done my whole life, but then when I was given my diagnosis, I went home and did some research. It was like “...whoa...”   After seeing everyone else’s struggles, and seeing that they went through/are going through what I am/have always gone through... and I really want to emphasize this: *i didn’t feel alone.*  If you’re unable to find a health professional in your area, you might check into the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders). That’s what health professionals use to help diagnose patients, along with testing. It could be a start. Steer clear of the online quizzes, those are like Satan clickbait and extremely inaccurate.   I think you’d be surprised to find you’re not alone with whatever disorder you may have. I truly wish I could give you an accurate diagnosis, or any diagnosis for that matter. You have a beautiful soul and I wish I could give you all the answers your heart desires.   Like I said— see if you can find a professional to diagnose you, or go to the library and check out a copy of the DSM-5 (probably available online as well).   Keep me posted, and message me any time! Sending my love your way!! &lt;3",False,True

People *actually* care on here, and the feeling is mutual to you or anyone else who ever wants to talk! &lt;3 my dms are always open!   Okay, update since yesterday:   I went to my PCP, she’s referring me to a nutritionist to get my eating back on track. I’m extremely anxious about it. I’ve been hiding my relapse into my eating disorder for a long time; avoiding my family, friends, basically cutting myself off from the world except for going to work and therapy.   A while back my therapist had recommended seeing a nutritionist, but I was like “uh, no.” Recently, she has been encouraging me to do an outpatient program, which I have been basically shooting down every single time she brings it up. It’s like yes, I know I need to recover, but... damn. This has been going on for so long it’s like wired in my brain to *not* eat and *not* “recover”.  My mom says “just eat something small until you can build up your stomach capacity,” but it’s so much more than that. It physically hurts not only my stomach, but my mind. Even if it’s celery, my brain is like “*what the fuck are you doing? Put that shit down. No. Bad. Gum. Stick to gum, caffeinated crystal light, and water. That’s it. Nothing else. Stop.*”   I literally hate myself for anything I put in my body that’s not on my current “diet plan”. That being caffeine, nicotine, gum, and water.  Just the *thought* of seeing this nutritionist is terrifying and making my intrusive thoughts worse than normal (I have OCD; my therapist and psychiatrist both say this ties into the ED). I cannot gain wait. I cannot follow a meal plan that I didn’t design myself. I want to show them that I want to “get better”... but what if I don’t? Does that make me a shitty person?   I only recently told my mother about my relapse (not sure if I already mentioned this), maybe last week? Anyway, she’s always been in denial and definitely always against the whole therapy, medication, etc etc... even against being hospitalized after my suicide attempt a little over a year ago.   Since I was 15, I’ve always been very good at playing it off, pretending everything is fine and that I’m fine; but now I just don’t have the energy. It’s nice to be able to talk to her again. I missed her so much. Now that I moved out, it’s easy to avoid them, and that’s probably why my ED grew to be so bad in such a short amount of time.   I’m 22. I moved out about a year ago. That’s when things started to get bad again. It turned from binging constantly, to actually dieting and exercising (the right way), to binging/purging, to restricting, to heavily restricting, to (currently) basically not eating unless I’m forced or I feel like I’m about to pass out.  TW (weight/numbers):  I lost over 50 lbs in about 3 months after I started heavily restricting and eventually stopped eating unless it was absolutely necessary. It fluctuated at first, but my start weight was somewhere in between 150-155 lbs. I’m 5’6”. My weight dropped significantly down to 128.8 when I started purging and held constant. It was like nothing would make that stupid number go down. That number was driving me crazy. That’s when I started restricting. I couldn’t get that damned number out of my head. The number dropped more and more over time, then stayed in the 110-115 area. I ate less and saw more progress. Now I’m down to my lowest weight, 100.6 lbs (not counting my first encounter with Anorexia; my all time lowest weight was 85.3 lbs).   It’s just so fucking *difficult* when there’s that stupid voice telling you “you can’t eat that, you’ll get fat” or “that has too many carbs” or “don’t even think about that delicious looking, wonderful smelling grilled chicken, I don’t care if it’s ‘healthy’... NOTHING is good for you. EVERYTHING will make you gain” or “cupcakes? Ha, forget about it.”   So yes, I know I need to get better. I know the path this will take me down. Sometimes I care, but most of the time I don’t. It’s selfish, yes. And I hate myself for what I’m doing to my family and loved ones. I see the look in their eyes that they try so hard to hide every time they see me after it’s been a while and I’ve lost more weight. It breaks my heart that I’m breaking theirs.   I’m at a war with myself and that’s all there is to it. “Getting better” and “just eating something small” is *so* much easier said than done.",False,True
