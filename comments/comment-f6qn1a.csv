I'm always scared I can't change my habits.  I'm sadly not a great fan of bananas but I'll look into alternatives to chocolate! ‚ô•,False,True

I will consider OMAD.  I've never tried it before because going too long makes me so hungry it hurts.  Does that happen to you?  I will keep trying to replace my food habits with healthier foods!  It feels very hard.  But it's so reassuring to hear why I'm such a junk feind.  I've always been that way but it's worse lately.,False,True

The primal urge is strong and constantly fighting it gets tiring.  To maintain my weight and not be miserable I do alternate day OMAD. On the ""feast"" days I eat however much my body wants to (which is usually 3000-3500 calories with a TDEE of 2000) and on the ""fast"" days I just eat a single 600-1000 calorie meal. The calories would escalate to +4000 if I kept eating unrestricted and got used to it, but the OMAD days somewhat control my appetite.  You could try something similar to give yourself a mental break, but go into the ""feast"" day with the mindset of being able to freely eat healthy foods. You COULD eat only sugary stuff, count the calories and feel miserable, or eat as much healthy high-volume foods as you want for the day.  Your body also craves foods it's found to be reliable sources of energy in the past. Just like it avoids foods that made you sick in the past. When you simply get to the habit of eating healthy foods and getting plenty of calories from them, your body will not crave sugary stuff as much anymore.",False,False

When I feel like I‚Äôm about to binge straight junk and I know how badly it‚Äôs gunna fuck me up later, I kinda remind myself that if I can have no solid food intake and only consume 200-300 kcal in liquids for 5+ days, then I have the self control to make better food choices when I do decide to eat. You should make a list of fruits, veg, maybe some soups and stews, salads, etc you like, and then you can look over that list and see if any of the stuff sounds like you can make some kind of ‚Äúmeal plan‚Äù around it. I try to pre-portion my foods on days I am fasting (no temptation to pick at food while i am packing it up), and then stick a post it note on the lid with the calories amount, so it‚Äôs always staring me in the face. However this is disordered behaviour too, but taking steps to eat nutritious foods is better than nothing. I think it is totally possible for you to start **wanting** better food choices. chocolate is my absolute weakness, I like to chop up a banana and some strawberries and put sugar free chocolate sauce on top, for example. Also fruits are naturally sweet so it does help my sweet tooth. That being said, there are still many, many, MANY days where I eat an entire chocolate cake in one go.",False,False

My restrict days leave me feeling stressed but then I see my deficit and feel euphoric.  Then I binge and hate myself so much.  Volume eating better food might help.   Do you think I can train my mind into wanting healthier food? It just screams for junk all the time and it makes it even harder.  Raspberries? But the dairy milk is calling my name...,False,True

Huge salad with a decent amount of dressing can be like 200-300 kcal but might make you feel hella full. I try to do this in really bad days when i feel like i need to eat everything in sight, when I am utterly ravenous. I‚Äôll eat like a pound of raspberries, and then pound of blackberries, and just eating bell peppers and tomatoes straight like it‚Äôs an apple, lmfao. This obviously is not for everyone, and i hope you can find something that works for you. Keeping a high calorie deficit/heavy restriction is a helluva drug, and binge days can be low-key traumatic. sending support and love üñ§",False,False
