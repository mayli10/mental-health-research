He’s always been kinda scrawny but recently he’s decided he wants to bulk up and since I’m trying to lose we made it a contest and we weigh ourselves once a week (lmao ya right I do that shit every day) and our first weigh in he was 20 lbs lighter than me. I bought fucking died.  So now I have to watch him stuff his face and complain about how hard it is to eat so much more than he’s used to and I’m just like boo fucking hoooo I would KILL to be able to eat as much as him and not gain weight. It was already triggering as fuck being so much bigger than him but now it’s just unbearable and I’ve gone full relapse mode and I don’t even care. I WILL be smaller than him.   Sorry. Kind of a rant ,False,False
