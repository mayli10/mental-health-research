He came home the other day and was like “have you eaten” and i was like “......yes” and he was like “what did you have” and i hadn’t thought that far ahead so i was like “ramen” and then he opens the cabinet and says to me “no there were 3 ramen this morning and 3 ramen are in there now”   I felt so attacked lmao,False,False
