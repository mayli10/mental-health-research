I agree with you on getting my GP/therapist to advocate for me so as to avoid my ED interfering, that was a good way to put it. I actually think my GP may already be on that because she was pretty appalled by the treatment I received and she's really reasonable/kind. Honestly it's such a breath of fresh air to hear people talk about recovery in a positive light so again, thank you for this!!",False,True

She was way out of line and totally inappropriate, and I can't believe you had to travel 8 hours for such a mess.  On a different note, it sounds like the program was not a good fit for your recovery needs (or finances) anyways, especially with the whole having to stay in a hotel thing. I'm glad you don't have to deal with her anymore either, what a nightmare  What has helped me in getting the support I need was to get someone who knew my situation well (GP, dietitian, psychiatrist, or psychologist) to talk on my behalf in addition to what I have to say. This is usually in the form of an email or a phone convo (often you have to formally give them permission to do so). They are better at communicating what they think your needs are and can stress the importance as they don't have your ED interfering. (I will disclose I have not been formally admitted for my ED but I have used this in other similar cases, and I don't see how an email on your behalf would hurt your chances on being admitted)  Ive had my fair share of invalidation over the years, but I'm living proof recovery is possible, even completely outpatient. I'm still far from complete recovery, but I can live my life and attend university - I've honestly come a long way. It has been a slow process, but to sum up how it's been possible is I am as honest as possible with my team. I tell my dietitian what I can and can't do, and we work together to set a goal that's obtainable but still a challenge each week. Sure ED tries to lie, but I'll correct myself, text them about it later, or worst comes to worst talk about it the next week. There's always setbacks and me wanting to give up, but if I want to live my life there's no other choice but to get back up and fight   (As one final unrelated note, I'd recommend r/fuckeatingdisorders if you're worried about triggering content. There isn't as much activity on there though so I can see why you'd post here.)  Best of luck ♥️ This isn't the end, just another hurdle in your recovery. Feel free to DM me if you want. We are here for you",False,False

It’s also for symptom interruption and to help restore weight when that fails in outpatient. I don’t know why they just had you meet with a social worker because they are not the ones that determine what level of treatment you need, it is a physician along with input from a therapist. I’m sorry that happened to you, that SW was an ass.",False,False

I think there are some programs that can help w/ financial support, but I don't know what they are - and I think you should also follow your nose about the need to be in IP and not OP-and-hotel.  I don't know what else to say but I want to send you well wishes... the support group someone else mentioned is a good idea. Perhaps there are also online support groups?",False,False

I actually went to see disabilities services on campus last year when I chose to come back to school and again, I was met with the ""well you don't look 'that' sick"" because at that time I was maintaining at a slightly higher weight. Do you mind if I message you? I'm actually also located in Canada so I'm wondering if we're potentially dealing with the same outpatient, and if so any feedback would be welcome.",False,True

I know how hard it is to seek help and I'm appalled by how poorly you were treated.   I'm currently in an outpatient program and it has been so hard (because when is treatment easy) but also extremely helpful. I'm lucky that it's just hosted by my local hospital so I don't have to travel far and since I'm in Canada I don't have to pay for the program.   I'm not sure how things work where you are but maybe ask your GP if there's anything closer, or even a local support group you can attend. If you're in school then an onsite social worker is also a good source that should be free. I know it's not treatment but something is always better than nothing. I think talking about it is a huge part of recovery.   You can always message me if you need some support or a place to vent. I wish you all the best and I hope you can find something that works for you.",False,False
