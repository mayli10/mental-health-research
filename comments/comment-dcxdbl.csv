I also made contact with my student health center and plan to get support through them. Thank you for showing me that there are people like us in all sorts of positions in life. I am so grateful for your comment.,False,True

And you can do this! âœ¨âœ¨  I somehow graduated my Ivy League school despite this being my life for just about the entire time.  This definitely wasnâ€™t the ideal way to do things, or a long-term plan, but as an emergency fix in the worst moments, it helped me to do my workouts *first* in the day, and sometimes to plan out food before the day began... I felt like then I could jussst salvage enough space in my mind for my assignments!   I also kind of made peace with being late for everything - full-scale battles of the ages taking place in our minds take time, let alone with homework - itâ€™s okay :)  Also! When these kind of thoughts tipped from being in the background to getting overwhelming, it was because I was truly at the point of being *very* physically depleted - that was contributing more than I knew at the time  College is such a uniquely, strangely stressful time in every way and I bet things will get so much easier from here - feel free to message me about anything at all ðŸ¥°",False,False
