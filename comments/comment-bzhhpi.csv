I don't get very thirsty ever so I'm not motivated to drink. Plus it makes me cold. PLUS my dumb ADHD brain finds it too boring to drink something for like 60 seconds (or even worse, having to periodically sip), and feels similarly agonized by the annoyance and boredom of taking a piss.   I'm desperately trying to drink more on the theory that low-level dehydration is causing my endless water retention nightmare, and it sucks. whyamilikethis.jpeg",False,False

Dehydration is easier than you think not to notice and it can put you in the hospital or kill you. Decaffeinated tea is great for that. You can also use electrolyte drinks like sports drinks (cheaper option) or pedialyte (faster acting, lower calorie)",False,False
