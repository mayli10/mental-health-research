I‚Äôm sure (I hope) your friend would have sympathy if you actually opened up about your ED.  It‚Äôs just hard for some people who‚Äôve never been affected or exposed to mental illness to understand.   All the best!",False,False

Unfortunately, most mental illnesses are misunderstood. But to be unable to sympathize with someone who is sick just because you can‚Äôt understand that people aren‚Äôt completely rational? That‚Äôs unfathomable to me. Sympathy is free, people! Why wouldn‚Äôt you have sympathy for anyone who is struggling with anything? Your friend is being extremely irrational with his lack of sympathy towards EDs.  I definitely understand why you‚Äôd feel unable to open up after an experience like that. But this is definitely an issue with your friend not understanding mental illness, not an issue with you.   If it comes up again, you might have better luck trying to compare mental illness (and EDs) to any irrational thoughts or phobias your friend might have that are more ‚Äúsocially acceptable‚Äù. Like being afraid of heights on a safe rooftop or something. then you can point out that EDs cremate strong, irrational thoughts between food and body image. Or probing to find where they draw the line between mental illnesses, do they have sympathy for schizophrenics even though your friend probably never experienced symptoms like hallucinations or delusions?because thinking you‚Äôre fat when you‚Äôre underweight is, frankly delusional so why can he understand one but not the other?  Of course, it isn‚Äôt your responsibility to help your friend see how wrong he is, but it might help to be prepared if it comes up again, or if you ever decide to open up about your illness. I hope your friend matures a bit and this doesn‚Äôt affect your friendship. Your ED struggles are valid, even if people don‚Äôt understand them.",False,False
