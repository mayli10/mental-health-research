Definitely a new fear food!,False,False

I’m going to a party tonight and bringing two of these super bland 100cal cans of vodka soda. My goal is to come home tonight and just go to bed without eating everything in the fridge.",False,False

It doesn’t fit in macros. It causes fat gain and muscle loss. I have to occasionally engage for work and it’s the worst. If I can, I ask for a Diet Coke, no ice, in an old fashioned glass and act like I’m drinking a Whiskey Neat.",False,False

Light beer is safe ish. Wine is sort of safe, mostly because I physically can’t drink it in large (or even normal, really) quantities.  Everything else, not so much, *especially* if I’m not drinking at home. Part of it is because of the calories (in the liquor itself as well as in mixers— I don’t trust bars to not include surprise sources of calories), and part of it is because I react very oddly to alcohol. Vodka I can drink without any problems 99% of the time. Beer/wine are iffy but they usually fill me up before getting me too drunk. Everything else— especially tequila for some reason— is super risky. Sometimes I’ll be ok, but more often than not I will have crazy reactions. Like, I’ll get completely wasted off not even a shot worth of tequila (whereas vodka doesn’t really hit me til the third drink, and even then it’s not so bad). Then I’ll either pass out and feel like complete shit for days (so safe from an ED standpoint, not so much for my mental health in general though) or else I’ll try to offset the effects of the alcohol by eating anything and everything in sight. Which doesn’t work, so I end up hungover and feeling fat as fuck.  tldr: alcohol in and of itself isn’t necessarily unsafe, but the way I react to it can be very unsafe.",False,False

Something that helps me is that I can easily calculate the cals in a drink. Bartenders are very precise when it comes to pouring standard drinks (5oz wine, 12oz beer, 1.5oz liquor is typically the standard unless otherwise stated) so I know a rum and diet coke will be 100 cal, or a glass of pinot grigio 120 cal, shot of fireball is 110 cal, or a bottle of miller light 100 cal (just some examples). Very rarely will they overpour, especially with liquor! Also I don't like beer as much so if I want to drink slowly I will get one of those.   Honestly if you don't feel comfortable with drinking there is nothing wrong with that, and you don't owe anyone an explanation! But if you want to try something, you can look up your options before hand. Also, lots of liquor stores sell small single serving bottles so you could always buy a few of those and your fave 0 cal mixer or diet soda try to come up with something you like!",False,False
