It's a weird feeling, being self conscious when I'm completely alone. And what's worse is my bf keeps saying he wants us to get in the shower together sometime. He's amazing and I have no doubts he would ever say anything bad about me but I feel soooo disgusting that I think those feelings would outweigh the good feelings and I'd just feel mostly embarrassed about myself. Ugh I hate this.",False,False
