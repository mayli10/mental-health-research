Unfortunately, I‚Äôve been binging like once a week for like the last month or so, so now I either maintain or lose like .1ish a week.

It‚Äôs kinda weird because I eat however much I want when I‚Äôm hungry (for main meals, I don‚Äôt allow myself to have snacks) because more food usually means a trivial number of calories. I eat in front of people and with my partner all the time and no one suspects anything.
