Esp with bouldering I've made bigger strides working on flagging and footwork than strength.  My main issue with climbing while restricted is holy fucking endurance. I can never top out the route even if it's easy, I'm just out of gas.",False,False

She did an insta post about how she has a nutrition coach that she calls when she’s “in a panic that she’s going to eat a whole bag of cookies” and it just got me thinking... she is hella tiny after all ,False,False

I guess though that unless you’re at a really high level, you’re gonna get more climbing gains through strength than you are through dropping weight, especially if you boulder. ",False,False
ehfoj06,t3_avdfyr,t1_ehfo682,SubBiscuit,1,2019-02-27 17:23:12,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/avdfyr/making_myself_eat_at_maintenance_for_nothing/ehfoj06/,I watched a video with Alex Honnold where he literally tries to dance around the issue.  You need to be as small as possible to be a better climber. I started losing healthily after starting climbing but it only lead to relapse. I have to eat to climb though so technically the sport is keeping me healthier than a full relapse????,False,False
ehfo682,t3_avdfyr,t1_ehetnkn,Arceliaz,1,2019-02-27 17:18:44,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/avdfyr/making_myself_eat_at_maintenance_for_nothing/ehfo682/,Haha fellow ED climber checking in. I actually never had an ED until I started climbing so there’s a fun fact! Seems like a bit of an issue in the sport... ,False,False
ehetnkn,t3_avdfyr,t1_ehetcjb,SubBiscuit,1,2019-02-27 11:57:53,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/avdfyr/making_myself_eat_at_maintenance_for_nothing/ehetnkn/,I'm going to try and just shift a ton of calories to 1-3 hours before bouldering and try to not eat as much after even though I'm ravenous. By a ton I mean like 400 but still.  You've got this competition! ED climbers unite? Haha,False,False

Yeah I kind of hate how well I’ve been climbing recently because I feel DISGUSTING and can’t wait to go back to restricting, but I want to keep climbing hard hah. ",False,True

I boulder and since I relapsed I've climbed like absolute shit! Ive tried having like peanut butter and a banana (200 cal) an hour before I climb and it hasn't helped.,False,False
