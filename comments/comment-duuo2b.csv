I’ve gotten to that point of thin that isn’t pretty to look at anymore, and I know it’s not. I know I look malnourished, not “skinny” if that makes sense. I know my ED has ruined me and it lied about all its promises of making me more desirable. And yet I can’t stop because supposedly gaining even a little bit of weight would make my body even more repulsive.   Rationally I know I’d be so much prettier if I restored weight. More importantly though, I’d be happier. And tbh it hurts knowing that and not being able to do it.",False,True

There’s no sense of accomplishment or joy but just “why am I still alive, I thought eds were supposed to kill yet here I am still breathing.” Morbid I know but that’s how much I dgaf tbh.",False,False
