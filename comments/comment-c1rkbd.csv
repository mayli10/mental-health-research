As for the fittofat sub, IF that’s what’s happening there as well, I think people are just assholes who want karma.

I can’t help feeling like people are just posting reverse progress pics though? Like something is telling me that those people actually lost weight and the person who posted it to the sub just flipped the image.   (Totally off topic, but there’s been a trend lately on the weight loss subs of people posting THEIR OWN progress pictures in reverse, with the “after” photo on the left and the “before” photo on the right. My OCD brain can’t handle it. It drives me n u t s.)",False,False
