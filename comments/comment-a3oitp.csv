Had it out in 2015 at 22. I had severe pain for all of 2013/2014 were I would pass out with gall stones pain and throw up bile every single morning but I delayed surgery because I didn't want to take time off work. I did lose a lot of weight across this time but I ended up in hospital with jaundice and had to get it removed urgently. Then I got pancreatitis after getting it removed and nearly ended up in ICU. Moral of the story, best to get it out earlier rather than later hahaha. Nothing much has changed but I can't eat any burgers with heaps of fat because my body can't break it down so I just throw up. But yes, I can definitely point all this to my disordered eating ways unfortunately ",False,False

Too much fat is hard for my body to digest, and eating small meals through the day is easier for my body to digest also instead of doing OMAD type eating.",False,False

(I was doing intermittent fasting and an almost keto like diet) I would vomit bile almost every morning for months. (And I was not pregnant!)   I still don't do the best job and once in a while the spot where my gallbladder use to be will get twitchy (I don't know how else to describe the sensation) and it will be tender when I touch my abdomen.

After they ruled out stuff like ulcers- I had a HIDA scan. That scan showed that my gallbladder was not excreeting bile at an appropriate rate. Then they took the fucker out.   Back then my insurance was bomb so I have no idea how much things cost now. Because now (I'm assuming US) you probably have something like a 6500 deductible you have to pay before insurance actually does anything. I'm still paying off thousands of dollars from other medical issue I've had since then (mental health and other stoach issues determined to probably be gastritis flairs after a gastric emptying scan)  Silver lining? I try to eat a lower fat diet because fats can hurt my insides. ,False,False
