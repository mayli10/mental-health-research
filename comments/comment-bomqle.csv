It's harder when you're feeding a kid and famy and you need to have food around for them and not subject them to your insanity. :( I actually often find myself in the chip aisle and I'm a sucker for fun flavored chips and when they're on sale I buy a lot of them. Then I get home and look at what I've done and throw it all away. :(   I have a very tiny list of ""safe"" foods now and try to make a beeline and get it over with...

I feel bad because when I goto the market I go nuts because there are so many great deals and then a lot of it goes bad before I can even get around to eating it.

But I'm also kind of a minimalist and every few months I get irritated with my accumulation of items and end up donating or throwing things out. When I go shopping I put items I want into my cart and just walk around with them for awhile. When I'm done I look at all my stuff again and ask if I really need it and the answer is usually no so I put it back (same for food actually, I only eat one meal a day and I'll ruminate over it for awhile and pick at it and ask myself if I really need it, the answer is often no so I throw it away or give it to a co-worker who always forgets her lunch. I feel bad about food waste but it's wasted either way isn't it? My thighs aren't a trash can, a trash can is a trash can)",False,False
