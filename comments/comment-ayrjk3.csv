I've struggled with constipation all of my adult life and started abusing them occasionally after ""binges"" or days of now bowel movement.  I have woken up in the middle of the night in severe intestinal pain due to taking too much laxative. But then when I actually go it feels so good.  Also it's just about one of the top most embarrassing things to be addicted to/abusing. To have my fiance confront me about buying laxatives - that's attractive--and then years later about abusing laxatives is such a great conversation every woman wants to have. ",False,False

Omg I love smooth move. It’s on the gentler side (idk why I didn’t get some of that?!?)   I suppose lesson leArned though?

I don't abuse them but if I'm eating and don't shit I'm counting the days, worried. So I took some smooth move last night that I left at my aunt's years ago. It was expired so I was like whatever. I had two cups because it was so tasty! Big mistake. All night. Almost shit myself. Can't even. Now today my stomach is cramping and I'm drinking salt water to try and replenish my fluids. Jesus why did I do this!?",False,False

I miss the days when I only had that kind of nightmare bowel function when I went hard on the lax because now that happens with most food I eat.   That being said, I used to use milk of mag every so often and omg sometimes it would hit like 8 hours later and sometimes it would decide to start having fun right away.   Laxatives are the devil. Sometimes necessary but the devil nonetheless. ",False,False
