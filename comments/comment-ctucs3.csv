As for the age thing, I’m glad I’m not the only one who enjoys being called a high schooler, sometimes I feel so weird for wanting to look so young.",False,True

So in that sense, yes you are, along with everyone else who suffers from an ED.   If it makes you feel any better, I'm the same way. I love being mistaken for a high schooler even though I turn 25 in October - even though that tends to happen whether or not I'm ""thin,"" I do notice that it happens more often when I've got a BMI under 18. Plus, I feel more confident in my appearance overall, and I like having people worry about whether I've eaten enough. When I'm not giving into my ED, I eat like a pig because I have a super high BMR - even though at my very very highest weight my BMI was still under 20. Since I eat insane amounts of food when I'm not restricting, I routinely hear my parents say things like ""You're eating ***again?!?!""*** or ""Didn't you just eat?"" or if I say I'm feeling hungry they'll be like ""No you're not, you just ate."" Shit like that, and it just pushes me into a restrictive cycle all over again.",False,False
