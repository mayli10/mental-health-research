I saw this wannabe fitness Instagram account of this chick I went to HS with, and she was complaining about her body, but I was like, ""Aww, I think she should have nothing to be upset about; I would be content with something like that."" I put her stats she listed from that day into a BMI calculator because I figured that if I thought that girl looked good at her current weight, I would just have to reach her BMI, and  if I was still unhappy, anything under that BMI would just be the BDD talking. Anyway, I put the stats in, and.. *drumroll* ..SHE HAD A FUCKING HIGHER BMI THAN I DID. I was in shock.",False,False
