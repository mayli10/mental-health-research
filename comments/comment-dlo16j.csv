They're nothing to be proud of, of course, but it doesn't make you a bad person. It makes you a person who is afflicted with an eating disorder. It fucks with your brain and how you fundamentally see weight.  also, I relate to a lot of this. my weight fluctuations have been smaller (I switch though binging and restrictive phases more rapidly I think), but it was very frustrating when I was trying to maintain my social life. I'd show up to one event all flat-stomached, looking cute in a crop top, then I'd show up to the next looking like I'd barely been able to stuff myself into my jeans because I was so bloated. And then I'd be back to normal, and then rinse and repeat. It was like written all over my body that I had wildly fluctuating eating habits, especially to people who'd see me every week.",False,False

Tbh it was kinda my fault it was noticed because I went and bought some clothes that actually fit my smaller body, and when going out to coffee with a group of my friends,I took off my puffy jacket. I also know that there are people who are looking at my body who‚Äôve known me for awhile that notice (but don‚Äôt say anything), which is preferable.........but the whole ordeal is super uncomfortable.   I hate when people notice me :( I jut want to exist at my gw and that be the only representation of me that exists and has ever existed lol",False,False

At least for me they did. I don‚Äôt want my weight loss noticed because that means eventually people will question it and my ED will possibly be exposed.   ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è sure would be nice if people just left us alone and not even address our bodies,False,False
