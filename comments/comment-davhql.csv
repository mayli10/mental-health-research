I'm really bad at taking pills so my doctor recommended this to me instead. I haven't noticed any bad side effects, I mean my depression got really bad recently but I was slipping up before I got the shot (so I think they're unrelated, might not be though). She said bone density loss and weight gain are common side effects, so she told me to start eating more calcium and also watch what I eat so I don't eat too much. I laughed about this internally, because she doesn't know she's telling an anorexic to ""watch what you eat."" Anyways, my point is, the weight gain she told me that a lot of people have this happen because the hormones in birth control can mess with your hunger cues. For someone with an eating disorder like we have, we already know how to ignore hunger cues so this isn't an issue. I actually lost weight since I got the shot.",False,False
