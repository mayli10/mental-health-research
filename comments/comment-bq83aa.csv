If youâ€™re struggling with b/p throughout the day why not take your meds at bedtime, then you can be sure theyâ€™ll be absorbed assuming you sleep for 8 hours afterwards?   Try not to multiple dose as you may end up with too much in your system, which can cause unpleasant side effects; and on the flip side (IMPORTANT !) please use back up contraception like condoms in case you still donâ€™t have enough of it left in your system ðŸ˜¬ good luck.",False,False

Taking them not as prescribed makes them ineffective as birth control, and can mess up your hormones. I suggest switching birth control. There's other options available: Depo-Provera (a shot every three months) or an  IUD (inserted into your uterus).  The 2 hour stomach emptying window is normal human digestion--- us bulimics, purging out stomach acid which breaks down food, slows this process over time. Be safe, kiddo. Switch your birth control.",False,False
