I feel like I've numbed myself through everything I've gone through in the last \~6 months (a parent diagnosed with stage iv cancer, dropping out from college, a break up, etc) through a pattern of oversleeping and overeating. I've gained 15-20lbs since I started my job in October, because all I do is eat. I don't even feel guilty eating anymore because eating my feelings is just second nature now. I wouldn't even say I'm in a binge phase, but I'm definitely using food as a crutch and am hating myself more and more every time I look in the mirror. I lost a lot of my old ""binge weight"" through yoga and healthy eating and was maintaining a weight I was comfortable at for a couple years. Sometimes slipping into disordered (restrictive) eating (maybe more than I'm admitting, but never very severe), but it was mostly natural. Now I'm just gaining. Constantly. And it's mostly worked as a coping mechanism, but not all the time.     I feel like I feel everything I do feel in extremes. When I'm not sleeping or eating, I'm going through the motions or I'm hyper sensitive to both the good and the bad. When things are great, they're really great. I have a lot of fun and feel motivated and free, like I'm on the top of the world. I feel happy in my relationship now but am doing things I normally wouldn't do to feel something. I'm pushing aside little seeds of doubt and dwelling on them later because I'd rather feel happy in the moment than jeopardize things. I'm drinking more than I ever have in the past, and it's not a lot but it's more than I ever would have in the past.      And when I'm not having these emotional highs, I'm lower than I ever have been and crying for trivial reasons that don't make sense. I feel like I'm pretending. That when I'm happy, I'm acting, and that's why the emotions come across as such a caricature of who I really am. Why I'm doing things for cheap thrills, why I laugh so hard. It's a performance. And it doesn't take much for it to all shatter.      I've been thinking a lot about losing weight again. I don't know why. It's just always in the back of my head. I don't actually do anything, I haven't restricted in ages. But I can just. Feel it there. In the back of my mind. That it wouldn't take much to trigger a full blown relapse, and apart of me wants it to happen because at least it would be a distraction from everything else. I guess I just know that I've had breaking points before, and this feels like one. :(",False,False

I put on some size initially recovering from mild AN and then struggled with restricting again for a time. I ended up losing size, muscle, and strength. Then I looked back through my photos and kind of realized, even though I had more body fat, I also had substantially more muscle and overall looked a bit better near when I first came out of the ED near my peak weight (in the past couple years).  Muscle is very metabolically expensive to build and maintain. If you don't feed your body, it's not going to be inclined to build or maintain muscle. When I was recovering from my ED and listening to the extreme hunger and eating tons of calories, I unknowingly created the perfect conditions for building muscle. The ironic thing is my training at the time was far from optimal and I still put on crazy amounts of muscle in almost no time.",False,False

I kind of assumed it was a restrictive type, in which case, staying super lean is simply not conducive to gaining muscle.

Perhaps building muscle might help you feel better. At least with muscle you can control where it grows and it can change your figure. If you put on muscle and maintained your weight you would lose body fat of course, but at a healthy weight and with a healthy diet you should be able to get into the athletic range a little bit without getting sick. It's kind of risky though. Like, it's hard to guess how losing more body fat would effect you. What's acceptable seems to change on a person-to-person basis.

You're absolutely not fat at your weight and it's important for your health that you remind yourself of that when you start to feel bad. It's recommended that women maintain around 20% body fat. If you have a very healthy lifestyle you might be able to go lower into the athletic body fat range, but that's very difficult to maintain. Athletes work really hard to maintain their health and figure. They also have plenty of muscle to make up their weight which the body will burn for energy if it doesn't have enough fat. And if you go even lower than the athletic range into the essential fat range you will absolutely start to feel the effects of weight loss. It's difficult, but if you focus on eating at maintenance eventually it just becomes normal and you'll feel a lot better than you will if you allow yourself to continue losing more weight. It's hard to practice self-love when you have an eating disorder or anything similar, but I find it's the best way to get better. If you're nice to yourself eventually you'll start to like who you are and the body dysmorphia will fade away :)",False,False

The rare times I do eat a Cinnabon it's always a small one, but 4 packs have the full-sized ones in them.
