Binging is one of my most serve behaviors in the past.   I eat about 850-1200 on a regular day. I’ve had 3 days in 2019 when I had about 2000 calories but those were very special occasions.   I’ve found it easier to control my urge to binge when I’m not low restricting. Especially since I do OMAD so I sit down and have those 1000ish calories all at once so it kind of soothes the binge monster.   I have a very physical job [Starbucks- on my feet 8 hours a day, don’t give myself breaks bc I’m the supervisor, constantly lifting/squatting] then I do about an hour of strength training at night with kettlebells and resistance bands.

I’ve lost 42 pounds so far in 2019. Never eating below 500 calories in a day but also never more than 2200 which is my tdee.   I haven’t binged once which is huge for me. ,False,False
