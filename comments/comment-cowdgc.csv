They always complained about their imaginary fat and how they needed to lose weight and ate nothing but Tab and lettuce. I donâ€™t remember ever feeling thin enough even though I was always underweight.,False,False

I can full heartedly relate with my parents getting on me in regards to my weight and affecting my relationship with food and self-image. I am incredibly sorry that you had to go through that, and as much as I would like to say something poetic that would chip away at the heartache you experienced growing up because of the actions of your parents from personal experience I know how much this doesn't work when coming from someone else.   I understand that sometimes parents are misguided in their approaches to their children, especially on the topic of weight. As they see the weight or food issues as a direct insult to their image or their parenting. Thinking that they think that they have our best interest at heart, when what they are honestly doing is causing us more harm then good.   Once more thank you for sharing your story with us.",False,True

I remember growing up my mom and dad were constantly arguing about my weight. My mother kept insisting I was too chubby and would restrict candy from me and give me incredibly boring and pathetic snacks (like a piece of bread with a cheesestick). My father let me eat anything I wanted. He didn't care. This caused my weight to fluctuate from chubby to underweight throughout my elementary years. I remember always comparing my body to other kids, never felt ""skinny."" I always felt fat. I had such a hard relationship with ""unhealthy"" foods since my mom restricted them so much, I craved them like no other.  Something clicked in high school. I stopped caring, packed on the pounds, and ate whatever I wanted. Yeah I was on the heavy range of normal, but I literally couldn't care less. I was more focused on school and my hobbies. Weight was never in my mind. Didn't know what the hell a calorie was and I didn't care. Food was just food.   Then senior year rolls around, I got into kpop &amp; realized I hate my body. Then thrust myself full force into a chaotic concoction of anorexia/orthorexia.",False,False

One of my earlier memories (I was 3 or 4) is of freaking out because my mom gave me a snack, and worrying how much fat was in it.",False,False
