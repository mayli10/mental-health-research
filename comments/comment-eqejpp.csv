A lot of that is water weight, and it will go down eventually. Don’t freak out or start restricting heavily again.   As long as you stay active and eat at maintenance, your weight will normalize (i.e. the water weight or any possible bloating goes away). It takes time for your body and metabolism to adjust to increases/decreases in food intake, but I promise the increase in weight will not be pounds of fat.   Also, as you increase food intake while continuing to exercise, there’s a good possibility you’ll gain weight from lean muscle — which is good. I’ve heard many cases of people seeing their measurements get smaller, even though their weight stays the same or even slightly increases. So don’t worry too much about the scale.",False,False
