I am just really panicking that Iâ€™m expected to stop losing weight and to eat more. Iâ€™m so worried Iâ€™ll lose control and gain all the weight Iâ€™ve lost back. All that hard work and restricting for nothing. But Iâ€™ll try and be optimistic and share my concerns with them.  Thank-you.",False,True

Professionals understand that anorexic doesnâ€™t automatically mean skinny. They want you to stop losing by restricting before you wreck your metabolism and make future weight loss efforts unproductive. Iâ€™ve been there and it sucks, but they really do know whatâ€™s best here.",False,False
