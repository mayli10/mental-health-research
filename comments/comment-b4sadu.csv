It's when the holiday season rolls in when I get worried. I've still trying to recover from binge eating since Thanksgiving x.x I think I've flip flopped into restricting recently, though. The word, ""moderation"" remains a foreign concept to me.",False,False

I can just make sure to exercise a lot that day, and restrict for a couple days after if I feel it is necessary. But all the candy around? Shit.   I know damn well that if I want to not binge on Easter treats, I need to go and get some ASAP, and work them into my days for the next few weeks. It worked with Christmas treats. But I came so close to binging last week that I'm scared to have that stuff in my place :p ",False,False

But I’m in restriction mode so  every time I go to the grocery store I ogle the Easter candy and select one thing.... which I hide in my closet upon getting home.  Usually I restrict better by not keeping junk food at home. But when it comes to seasonal items I enjoy like Easter candy... it weirdly helps me restrict to know that I won’t miss out because I have my stash for later.  I just have to donate it all before reaching GW or I’m screwed.  So... yeah, I’m nervous lol",False,False

Family get-togethers are pretty frequent with my large family and it always stresses me out but Easter and Christmas especially do me in. Don't get me wrong, when I'm binging I go back and forth between savoury and sweet but my sugar addiction is by far the bigger demon. And my grandma and aunt always hit up the bulk store and easter chocolate.... oh my. I can avoid the gummies/jellybeans but REESE chocolates, malt eggs, creme eggs.... *sigh*",False,False

Mum will take my brother and I out for lunch and give us a large Easter egg each, but that's the extent of it. Honestly, I dread my birthday much, much more.",False,False
