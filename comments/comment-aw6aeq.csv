From personal experience, however, yes it will definitely make a difference.  I bought a two piece dress/ crop top with skirt that barely fit me at the top because it was too tight at my bust and the skirt fit my waist. I only loss 6 pounds (though I did start exercising more, so it might of changed my fat composition, idk) and the top fit perfectly, but the bottom was almost hanging off my waist and I had to pin it. Personally I lose most of my weight around my waist and stomach so it all depends on each individual.",False,False

Measure your hips, waist and bust and compare to the measurements of the dress.",False,False
