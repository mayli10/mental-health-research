It sounds like it's just a waiting game at this point. You just have to trust in yourself and know that the actions you are taking will have an effect. It sounds like your partner is fed up so feel free to message me or anyone else on this sub. We are all open ears. Also, depending on the school, it should have free counseling services. My school did and I took part in that. It helped. I also got free medication for my anxiety.",False,False

I’d have a major panic attack if I was to drink proper liquid calories and  I exercise everyday for at least an hour and a half. My partner just gets pissed at me for the most part if I try and talk about this stuff so I swallow it most of the time to avoid the argument. I leave the house when absolutely necessary, to go running so I can earn food, to go get groceries, to go to my place of study and for work placement but that’s about it. I’m a super broke student so trying to find a good therapist who fits in my budget is proving to be very difficult.  I need to consistently remind myself I have the control.  Thanks for the advice I appreciate it",False,True

It does suck but there’s always a tomorrow, you can always go for a run tomorrow or start a new diet. Doesn’t matter if you had that piece of cake, own it girl! it’s ok not to be perfect and trust me, coming from someone who’s feeling like shit today bc I ate so much.  It’ll be okay!",False,False
