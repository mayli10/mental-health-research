I wish I could tell you where on YouTube that I’ve seen this. I’ve heard that we move fat and reassign it to the butt and hips. Whether this is bs or not I don’t know, because it was from a YouTube video. I will attempt to find it.",False,False

The majority of my body fat during recovery came on in my midsection and then over the course of about a month about 50-75% of it redistributed. The remaining took longer, more on the order of months. The other crazy thing is that all of it eventually came back off. It's crazy. Like I'm recovered right now and I eat a million calories a day and don't feel half as hungry as I did when I was struggling with AN, yet I'm measurably leaner, particularly in my abdominal area. It's amazing to me how the body adapts to being in a starvation state to preferentially deplete fat in your extremities and actually increase the fat in your abdominal area.",False,False

It seemed like I was only losing in certain areas on my body. I even had a thigh gap even though my BMI is only 22. I’ve also plateaued for a month and I lost the thigh gap but also like half an inch off my waist. My collarbones and hips also look a lot less bony. I lost 1/5 of my body weight in 3 months so I think my body just needed time to adjust. ,False,False

However, and I have no actual scientific proof to back this up (lol), the same thing happened to me a few years ago. Restricted from obese to overweight really fast and then started b/p’ing again, putting me basically at maintenance. I had no ass and no waist for the first two months, but with seemingly no exercise, the booty came back and my waist was more defined than it had been when I was bigger. I wonder if my body was saying, “Okay, you’re done losing - let’s look how we used to look, just smaller.”",False,False
