I just act in ways that I assume will be safer for everyone, but I feel like this just reflects the fact that I have a gross misunderstanding of how relationship dynamics operate.   Thank you again for the comment, all the best to you.",False,True

Might get worse. Might get better. I’ve done the same: spent so many years trying to be tough that I ended up mean. Be careless with people, relationships, letting them slip away so that they’re out there hurt by me and I don’t think about it or care or remember the details. Not sure if I’m better now, but I hear you, and I see you. Remember that if you never go to class and isolate and fuck up school then you will be found out again. That’s what happened to me, I committed fraud and lied and hid and stole and racked up debt and put myself into awful situations to be alone with my disorder and depression, only to be dragged back into the light because it all fell apart underneath me. I’m better now at managing it: only come apart at the seams a few times a year. But I still snap at people and dig at them and keep a barrier around myself. I have one or two very close friends, and a boyfriend, that I trust now after years of disposing of people who loved me because it was just safer, better for everyone. But I only show each one a little of what’s going on with me, just enough that they’ll forgive me my prickly edges and trust that I’m showing the truth without ruining the relationships. I am a turbulent ocean and a dam. I didn’t mean to talk about myself, but I feel you.",False,False

I know I need to think a bit more in the future. Everything just feels so limited to “now” and unpredictable and...  I don’t know. I don’t know what I’m doing and that scares me.   I’m glad you’re still around. And if things suck, I hope they start looking up.",False,True

I just wanted to say that I read your post and I know how you feel. I know how hard this is. I'm right there with you.   Something that is important for me to remember when I am low like you are right now is knowing that I will not feel this way forever. I know it's cliche and when people say it it's so fucking frustrating. *But I feel horrible now,* you're thinking. But emotions don't last forever - good or bad. I remember having moments of thinking to myself, ""I am so fucking glad that I did not kill myself when I was 19, because I would have missed this."" I have to hold on to that knowledge. And I say this as a 26 year old who is only recently recovering from my latest depressive episode where I was absolutely fixated on suicide.   Being a human is hard. Life is hard. Having an eating disorder is hard. Recovering from an eating disorder is hell. Sometimes things are hard. Then they get easier. Learning how to surf the waves, so to speak, is part of living. That's how I see it anyway.  I hope you feel better soon. Don't get on the scale again for awhile. If your bingeing was carb heavy, you're likely holding on to A LOT of water weight. Drinks lots of water and try your best not to restrict.   Feel free to PM me if you want to talk. I'm a goddamn veteran of this bullshit at this point in my life.",False,False
