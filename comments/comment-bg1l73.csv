She didn't even address the disordered eating part, she was focused on making me a meal plan that had a calorie deficit that was 'easy for me to stick to'. As if I binged because dieting was 'too hard', or something... I was salty that I paid a $25 copay for that bs.  The Vyvanse helped a bit at first for my ADHD, but it never felt like it did much for BED, and I was eventually moved off of it onto something else for my ADHD.",False,False

I dont think you can identify the cause of BED as not having enough sandwiches.  Damn",False,True

Nutritionist told me to eat sandwiches every day since I didn't have a kitchen. I didn't go back to the nutritionist and I didn't bring it up to the psychiatrist again.,False,False

So I guess I'm dealing with it old-school :/   Thank u for your response, it helped!",False,True

He did prescribe Vyvanse as it's the only medicine FDA approved for BED.  If your binging is causing you distress, I'd definitely bring it up. I was embarrassed to but glad I finally did.",False,False
