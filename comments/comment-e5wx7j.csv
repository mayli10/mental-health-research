So safe for me to have it portioned out like that and not have to also stress about possible waste if I donâ€™t drink the carton fast enough. I can finally coffee again!,False,False

It's a hefty 33 calories *but* it tastes so good and makes me so full. Especially nice on cold days or days where I'm going to be super active,False,False
