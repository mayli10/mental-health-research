So yeah somebody actually might have the infamous ”naturally fast metabolism”.  But I’d say that in most cases that’s not the biggest factor. Unless they have a pretty severe medical condition, next to nobody is gonna stay thin if they’re eating super high-calorie meals all day.   I’ve known people too who always seemed to eat loads and yet magically stay skinny, but if you actually get a change to observe their eating habits for an extended period, there’s usually a visible explanation.   Like, my boyfriend is always telling me how he just can’t gain weight no matter how much he eats. But he seems oblivious to the fact that even though he can consume a whole pizza very fast and often, his eating is not consistent enough to put him in a steady caloric surplus. Dude eats like a little cereal for breakfast, some small portion of junk food at work and then the bigger dinner, and other than that he seems to completely forget about food (unlike me who has 4 snacks while waiting for my 5 minute microwave meal to cook). He’s a tall guy, and though he doesn’t exercise-exercise, he’s still on his feet all day at work. I’ve sometimes calculated his calories secretly and on most days he eats like half the amount he should to gain weight.  And most of my ”naturally” skinny friends are that way too: either they forget to eat some meals (how?), or eat at all meals but almost never snack (how???). Some eat both but in tiny portions, and only eat a truly high calorie meal on special occasions. I think (non-disordered) people tend to eat their biggest and unhealthiest meals while in social situations, so it’s not a very reliable indicator of their general diet.   But yeah, even knowing this stuff, it gets super frustrating and triggering sometimes :/",False,False

I think my ED started as a way to take control of something in my life when I felt that everything else was out of my control.   Money was kind of an issue and at the time my ED started I was living in college residence, so food was expensive (*and they had a mandatory meal plan there, so had to eat on campus*) and I figured if I just ate less I could save some cash.  Another problem was that I actually was athletic in high school, but in my first week of college I broke my foot, so I couldn't exercise and I never got back into the habit of it. Partly because I used to just get exercise in gym classes and at after school practice, so going out of my way to get exercise wasn't as easy, partly because my work load was crazy and by the time I was healed up I just had way too much on my plate to even think about spending time exercising. I probably only gained about 5 lbs in my first two years of college between not exercising and eating the unhealthy options in the residence cafeteria every day, but my weight was muscle before and if you don't use it you lose it, so I ended up putting on some fat. I was still thin, just not as much as before because muscle is more dense than fat. My thighs started touching a bit and my waist was up to 27"" (*which seems to be below average, but again was more than it used to be*). I figured eating less would help me look the way I used to. I wasm't wrong, but I ended up losing 30 lbs which was just way too much. Most of that was actually after I moved out of residence though because I had to buy groceries then and finally had options to eat way less than I did in res.  One last problem was that I had been transitioning for close to a year at that point and recently started presenting femininely. At that point I really started to feel pressured to conform to female beauty standards. Once the anorexia mindset settled in I started to feel really self-conscious about my weight even though I never had before. Body dysmorphia made me feel like I had become fat when I hadn't. Things like my belly not being flat the way it was when I had abs were suddenly become a major problem for me.",False,False
eo6b2k1,t3_bqls6c,t3_bqls6c,ceruleanohara,1,2019-05-19 20:30:36,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/bqls6c/naturally_thin_people_how/eo6b2k1/,There is literally no “naturally thin.”  It does not exist.   It is easy to just eat. And not move. We live in a society that promotes sedentary lifestyles and fast food. Soooo easy.   Being thin takes concentration. Absolutely no one is sitting on their asses eating 5000 calories a day and maintaining “thin.”  Science.   You can be sedentary and restrict and be thin.   You can be moderately active and eat (maintenance) and be thin.   You can run miles every day and eat garbage food/excess calories and be thin.   People say shit to me like “well if I looked like you I could eat that too.”  Uhhh- no. I don’t look like you because I obsess about not eating that. And then I go home and do 40 push-ups because I’m afraid my arms look too fat. Maybe I’ll have a slim Jim today to build muscle. Yes! I’m naturally thin! It’s so fucking easy for me!!

So like, as a baby I had to have my tonsils and adenoids removed which meant that until that happened I could barely eat because I was always choking. I just sorta grew up never eating as much as other people. As an adult it probably seemed to other people that I was eating as much as they were, but in reality I was only eating once or twice a day, so even if I ate a lot in one sitting it was still usually not that much. For the past year I've been really sick and I did try to gain weight a few months ago, but eating enough for that just made me more sick and I couldn't process that much food properly. After like a month of trying I just couldn't gain weight and went back to my usual eating habits so I wouldn't be as sick all the time.",False,False
