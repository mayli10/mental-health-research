I did restrict yesterday, but I haven't had any BMs and there's just no fucking way 4 lbs of fat, food mass, anything has moved off my body. The scale must be off. It's digital and I generally distrust digital scales.   I'm having a 1200 calorie day today because I have homework to do when I get home. And I just feel like tomorrow I'm going to wake up with those 4 lbs back on my ass. ",False,False

Doesn't help that there is only one small patch of floor in my house that isn't carpeted. ,False,False

How the fuck? I know that it‚Äôs probably just water weight, but I was still fucking heart broken. Why does the number on the scale own my life? I‚Äôve lost so much weight but I still look and feel disgusting all the time and it‚Äôs fucking exhausted. ",False,False

Just weighed myself, and I've gained a pound since last week despite my calorie counting efforts.

You‚Äôre never really without your body, so when weight drops, it‚Äôs really easy for it to go under your nose, especially when your clothing is still fitting similarly. I have clothing that still fits me pretty much the same as it did 20lbs ago which makes absolutely no sense to me. Probably a bone structure thing, but I can‚Äôt figure it out for the life of me.  I have a lot of pics of myself on my phone which has sort of been my workaround for this. It‚Äôs more solid evidence that I‚Äôm not hallucinating or something, but I look at the weights that correspond to the pics and it‚Äôs confusing too. Like ‚Äú10lbs should be a more visible loss than this‚Äù. Drives me insane. I‚Äôve always been more focused on the numbers, but lack of reflection makes me question them. I‚Äôll get the same reading 3 times and still have my doubts.  The human body is just an extremely weird thing and reconciling that is impossible",False,False
