Might need to have imaging to check for obstruction. The pharmacy also has something called Go Lytely that might work maybe check that out. Not sure if it requires a script.,False,False

A friend of mine had a similar problem and that was recommended by a lady her mom knew. It helped when nothing else did. I'm not sure if it'll work for you but it's worth a try.  Make sure you're getting enough water. Go to urgent care if it goes !much longer. That's a really long time.,False,False

Do you feel like there's a massive, palpable amount of fecal matter inside you that just won't budge, or is the situation more ambiguous?   Have you tried drinking magnesium citrate yet? That's what they use to clear out bowels before surgery. Prunes do also act as a powerful laxative for many people, but you may have to be aggressive with them. I need to eat half a bag to get an effect. Alternately, do you have any diarrhea-causing food intolerances? (That's my personal weapon of last resort.)  But yeah, 2 wks is the threshold for when constipation starts becoming a real concern. That said, if you're not experiencing additional symptoms such as fever, bleeding, malaise, or vomiting fecal matter, you're *probably* okay. Don't take that as medical advice, but I get how complicated things are when you don't have insurance. The one thing you want to avoid at all costs is a bowel perforation, which can be life threatening, so please don't ignore severe pain or the symptoms listed above.",False,False
