In fact, you will need several weeks of eating above maintenance to help your body heal. I ate 3500 calories a day when going through weight restoration. You’re probably still not eating enough",False,False

I have no idea about biology or anything, but here is my uneducated guess: your body needs more than 2 days to get going and start all the processes it shut down to conserve energy. Also, the simple stress of not eating a lot for a long time and the emotional stress of an ED can wear you down. Give your body the chance to heal itself.   &amp;#x200B;  Also, great job eating at maintenance! Despite how you feel right now, that's a huge win and a step to long term improvement.",False,False
