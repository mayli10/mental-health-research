(I'm sensing some OCD behavior here but I can't diagnose). Because if so. Rice is white, cabbage is white, garlic is white, tofu is white, some beans are white. Pears are white. Onions are white there's white corn. Mushrooms come in white. Coconut oil is white. Chicken is white. Chick peas are white. All of these except rice are safe foods for me because I'm personally a low carb type.   In the end though this is still restrictive and I highly recommend seeing someone for what's going on with you. ",False,False
