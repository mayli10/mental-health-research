Other than that got the best giggles of my life and had a fantastic time. I brushed my teeth after eating them which always motivates me not to eat cos it'll taste bad and ur mouth has some flavour in it.,False,False

I down right trained my brain out of munchies being a stoner for about 3 years but the first time I had edibles I had the most insatiable munchies ever. Dunno why but they always cause them really badly for me, so I smoke instead.",False,False

But since I don't ""count"" per say, my stupid brain told me to omad (usually &lt;400) all the way until saturday. That way i'd somehow have earned the cookie. But your comment does help.",False,True

It hasn't been the strongest deal. I have definitely ""counted"" edibles calories a couple times since then. But it has also helped me in other circumstances. I don't panic when I'm offered an edible anymore. I don't think I've logged the calories in an edible for at least a few years. (3?)  Personally I also want to say Huge Relate to the control factor, I think it's a really great idea to help out with the cooking a little so your ED can ""feel"" control and calm down a little bit.  If you're in the headspace where you're able, try to make that deal with your ED where you either don't count the edibles or decide on a sane number and stick to it, don't let your ED bully you into freaking out or logging mystery calories that aren't there.  Sorry I'm not sure if that's really helpful advice. But that's kinda what I do.  I hope you have a lot of fun at the party :)",False,False
