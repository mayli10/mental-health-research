It has to prepare for it",False,False

Lots of water and/or things like green tea can help it go away as your body heals from the exercise.  Sometimes being at a calorie deficit makes me retain water too, if I eat certain foods. So that can be a factor too.",False,False

Alternately when starting a cardio routine, your body actually increases the volume of blood in your body to help make sure oxygen gets everywhere during exercise.   Both of these can result in non-fat increases on the scale. The muscle inflammation/water weight will typically go down in a few days, and the blood volume increase from cardio levels off after a few pounds - you don't just gain indefinite blood volume.  So don't worry, your body will balance out, and there is no need to panic.  (But also I just don't weigh myself for a week after starting any new exercise routine because...yeah. Nobody needs that kind of panic.)",False,False
