I think it has more useful information that the average person can actually take away and apply. That said, I think there's a lot of pseudo-science in it (I remember one episode totally buying into the ""starvation mode"" myth), some technical inaccuries (a lot of the calorie counts they give for foods seem extremely over- or under-estimated), and a lot of elements that haven't aged well, and overall it still doesn't do much to address the root causes of why people over-eat, e.g. trauma, depression, food scarcity, etc. IMO disordered eating on either end of the spectrum can't be meaningfully changed if the root cause isn't fixed first.  I think also it doesn't focus enough on how a lot of people have these misconceptions about food, calories, and nutrition specifically because 1) education on the topic is so lacking, and 2) marketing and packaging is intentionally misleading. I find that it tends to shift the blame onto the people trying to lose weight themselves, as if it's their fault that they've had this misinformation reinforced to them all their lives. It's hard to know to even question things like ""eat salad to lose weight!"" if everyone around you is repeating it. Sure, sometimes people are given all the tools and still refuse to use them (my roommate lol), and that's on them, but it's hard to know where to begin researching when you have absolutely no support network like most of the participants on that show.  Edit: I guess my distinction is like... I feel badly for people who have no idea about calories, or CICO, or energy use or anything else, because if you have no idea where to start looking there are a LOT of sharks out there who will capitalise on that. Like, imagine if you had no idea about calories or whatever and you weren't very tech-savvy so you just asked your friends or random people for advice? You'd get all kinds of crazy diets and MLMs and whatever. It's when someone HAS all the tools available to know how to lose weight properly, but they're still like, ""ehh, that's too much effort/I don't need to be THAT *strict* about it, I'll just Eat Healthy"" and then complain that they don't see any difference where I'm like... uhhh yeah sorry to break it 2 u that weight loss requires effort lol  I absolutely agree with you that you can't take control of your diet unless you're 100% honest about what you eat, though. I think that's the first major hurdle for anyone trying to change their weight. Even if you lie about what you ate on your app or your pen-and-paper food log or to your dietician, your body knows the truth, lol.",False,False

Def trying to change this. When I see thin people eating “junk” food I always think “Thank God you are normal and aren’t suffering with an ED” obviously there are some nuanced stereotypes going on here but this is where my head goes immediately.,False,False

It is available to watch on YouTube. It compares the diets of obese people vs the diets of people with an underweight BMI and makes them switch their diets for 5 days so they can see their destructive eating habits.,False,False

To change how you eat, you need to really be honest to yourself how many calories you're taking in, and these people are often living in their own calorie fantasy world pretending a big Mac is a snack Brenda",False,False

""OMG only 200 CAL for this BIG BOWL of ice cream!!!! \[photo of 1 normal-sized ice cream scoop in a small bowl\] I CAN'T BELIEVE I can still have JUNK foods on a DIET!!!"" and it's like  congrats that you figured out a normal single serve of ice cream is a fairly reasonable thing to eat and that one scoop isn't going to be 5800 calories...? Like I want to be ""how do you think these foods were even invented if one single serve was enough calories to fuck up your whole day"" but then I remember how many single menu items at most fast food chains will put a person 1.5x over their average daily intake and I get sad for everybody. No wonder so many people have fucked up relationships with food lol.  At least the person in your OP is counting calories tho. The ones that always grind my teeth are the people whoa re like ""I'm not like, EXTREME about dieting so I'm not going to do crazy stuff like counting calories or researching macros or even looking at the sticker on the packet that tells me what percentage of my daily energy it is, I'm just going to Eat Healthy!"" \[Eats a 900 calorie salad for lunch that they don't even like so they eat a 1200 calorie sandwich afterwards to compensate\] \[Drinks full sugar juice instead of a diet soda\] \[Eats handfuls of nuts at a time and whole avocados and olive oil and wholemeal bread and brown rice bc they're Good for you\] ""I just don't know why I don't lose weight! I'm so Healthy!!!""  dhgdggh my last roommate didn't try to do anything but portion control. Like yeah, okay, you might still see some results with portion control without having to calorie count, but not if you 1) only cook meals loaded with carbs and fats so that they're still just as dense as larger meals and 2) KEEP COMING BACK FOR SECONDS AND THIRDS LMAO",False,False
