You're more likely to develop something like OCD if you have an eating disorder, so it's normal in that regard. Unfortunately, It's very hard to manage OCD on your own.  When you get to the point where compulsions are affecting your daily life like this then you need outside help. I'm sorry you're going through this!!",False,False
