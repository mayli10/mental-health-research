Because surprise, surprise; the foods that have an actual decent amount of zinc are typically fatty foods and non-vegan foods that I’m scared to eat.   I now supplement with zinc (along with vitamin E, omega-3 and biotin as a “skin and hair” cocktail) every day it has really improved my skin. Take this with a grain of salt because I’m just a hangry idiot with a Reddit account and not a real doctor, but maybe try a low-dose supplement and see if it makes any difference. It took about 2 weeks for me.",False,False
