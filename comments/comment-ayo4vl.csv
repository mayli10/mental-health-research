Food, especially junk food, IS addictive! Replace it with something similar, some rice cakes or popcorn and maybe some low-cal granola bars? Cutting things out completely will generally cause you to binge on it when you return to it, so finding low-cal substitutes is your best friend. ",False,False

Sugar by itself is crazy addictive and your brain loves it and chips are engineered to have the perfect amount of sugar/salt/fat so you crave them and don’t want to stop eating them. I have the same issue so I don’t know how to stop eating sugar altogether but just know it’s not your fault for being “weak”. ❤️,False,False

My biggest regret is not seeking help until it spiraled into full blown bulimia.  2) Maybe instead of giving up your favourite foods entirely, try reducing your portion size? When I cut out certain food entirely, they became strictly binge food and I can't enjoy them normally anymore.   Best of luck. ",False,False
