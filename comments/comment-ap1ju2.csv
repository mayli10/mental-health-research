First, shout out to the big knitted sweater dress I bought on sale at the beginning of December for being the single most-worn item of clothing I‚Äôve donned all winter.   I have 3 pairs of safe jeans, all size 26 inch waist that are definitely NOT the same 26 as all my other pants. One from Urban Outfitters in dark blue, one pair of Levi‚Äôs with roses embroidered on the thigh pockets, and one black pair with flowers embroidered all the way down the leg.   Black leggings from Aritzia, bless them all. Especially the super high-waisted ones.   Sports bras and bralettes, for when my boobs can‚Äôt decide what fucking size they are that week (jk I haven‚Äôt worn a real bra in months).  Oversized men‚Äôs button-downs, god BLESS these for work.   I have two basically identical black long-sleeved dresses that I love, one of which is from Frank and Oak, that are both fitted at the waist, forgiving, and professional. I have a black-and-white striped dress from Old Navy that is the same shape.   I have this low-cut black sweater that I wear around my bf all the time, along with a black low-cut button down thermal long-sleeve.   Thank god I was nervous af of gaining the weight back so most of my winter clothes are forgiving. My summer clothes are decidedly NOT though, so I have to restrict like hell now if I want to wear my shorts and crop topsüò¨  ",False,False

Now that I think of it, perhaps wearing particular clothes to hide parts of the body was a very early and innocent ""maladaption"" for me, too. This is so normalised in society that I didn't think twice of it - everywhere you see tips on what you're supposed to wear if you have a certain body type etc, it's crazy.  But now that I'm way deep in bad stuff, wearing something safe seems quite beneficial in reducing obsessive self-hate thoughts and the anxiety of going out, meeting people etc. Kind of like not weighing/measuring yourself. I'm not sure if avoiding the mirror is actually for the better or worse in the long run, but at least it allows me to participate in the world more regardless of food intake.",False,True

So far I no longer wear my hat indoors but I still need to wear tights. I have SH scars but only on my arms and thighs, but I still haven't gone bare-legged since I was 16 - she diagnosed me with BDD even absent of disordered eating which I find quite interesting now with this new context. I digress - I have specific combos of layers, lots of different ""arm warmers"" to wear under short-sleeved shirts, leggings I wear with particular socks, I'm really into colour blocking. I have OCD and the rigid, ritualistic, obsessive way I approach my clothing rings true with my other OCD rituals.
