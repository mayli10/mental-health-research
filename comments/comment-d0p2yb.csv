Pretty much all of last month I was avoiding carbs like the plague, and then waking up the day after my workouts and just feeling like crap.   I’ve managed to get myself to be okay with bananas, carrots, carrot juice, and organic whole wheat bread. I feel so much better.",False,False

I hate when I get home from work and havent eaten a thing, I feel all withered and slim and sexy and I have a craving and I binge fail at McDonalds.  I'm terrible and usually throw it up afterwards, but the next day is always a new day to try again.   Also, I always found the mindset is important. Make it more nonchalant,  ie. ""I could eat right now, but I'm good for 10 minutes"" then distract yourself with something and you're golden. Keep putting it off. You're the one with the control that way, you're not 'slavin to the cravin'",False,False

I am so jealous.,False,True
