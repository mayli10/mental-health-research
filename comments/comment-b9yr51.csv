Even the most accurate device was off by an average of 27 percent. And the least accurate was off by 93 percent.  However, it tends for me to be be less accurate the more active I am. If I’m active I take 30% off, not active 20%. But if I’m really trying to be accurate I just use the step metric and a formula for calories burned per step plus my BMR. It will undershoot but that’s better than the alternative.",False,False
