Of course then restriction never ends but that's another story.  In order to recover, you have to learn that you CAN have the food that you want even if you haven't restricted to make up for it.   It's likely that you wanting six donuts is actually due to restriction itself. I've never really been a sweets type of person before my ED - I loved sweets but a single slice of cake, a couple squares of chocolate or an ice cream would have been enough to satisfy me both physically and emotionally. Now, though, it is hard for me to comprehend how ANYONE could be satisfied with that. I see people eating a single slice of cake while I'm sitting there wanting to wolf down the whole fucking thing plus more.   It's because we need to eat more. We know that, you know that, but we're not going to do much about it, are we?",False,False

I wait till 9-10pm every night to make my perfectly planned out safe meal after a long day of craving all the stuff I love. I LOVE food. And not like stereotypical American I love McDonaldâ€™s blah blah. I genuinely love food and recipes and the way everything is made. When you say a donut I want the biggest best donut and I would drive to the next town over to get a dozen of the best ones and eat every single one. A single donut from Duncan wonâ€™t curve the craving itâ€™s like all of nothing so 9/10 I choose nothing.   It feels so much safer to be alone in my room eating my carefully measured out meal even if itâ€™s 600-700 cals since itâ€™s the only thing Iâ€™ve eaten all day. A big safe food for me is ramen so Iâ€™ll get the package (300-400cals) and add sautÃ©ed veggies for volume or even add a miso packet broth so it can be as large a meal as possible. The warmth and amount of time it takes to eat is just so satisfying.,False,False

Iâ€™m terrified of losing control over food and I canâ€™t do moderation so I just donâ€™t eat. And I donâ€™t get triggered to binge by my safe foods so I can enjoy them in relative peace lol,False,False
