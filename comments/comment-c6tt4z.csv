I’ve spent hours and hours of my life trying to throw up because I struggle to puke. My gag reflex is ridiculously insensitive. Now when I think about it I think about how bad my stomach hurt when I had actually successfully done it and how much I don’t want to experience something like your story. So thanks again,False,True

I’m going to push myself to not continue.   It’s so weird, I’ve been trying for literally years off and on and now that I’ve finally started I’m like “okay now what?”",False,True

Bodies and eating disorders are so fucking weird. We're your people &lt;3  Obligatory gross cautionary tale coming. If you can stop purging now while it's new, please do. The other day I was getting dressed, bent over to pick up a pair of shorts AND SPONTANEOUSLY THREW UP IN MY MOUTH. But I hadn't eaten yet so it was just coffee and bile. It was like my stomach just dumped itself when I bent over, like overturning a cup or something. And the last time I'd purged had been a couple days prior. I've heard of this happening to people before bc it's def a thing but never experienced it myself until then.   Don't you just love this rollercoaster we're on?? /s",False,False
