I canâ€™t decide if I like or dislike it. I think starving myself as a teenager prevented some of my development, and starving it now just means thereâ€™s no chance itâ€™s going to change.",False,False

I'm 19 but I sometimes get babied by people my own age.  I have like an older-looking face though because of constantly smoking and not sleeping lol, so that helps.  My friend is 20 years old and I've never seen him at a healthy weight, he fluctuates between ""skinny"" and ""please eat I'm afraid you're gonna die"", and he's been like that his whole adolescence so he never like, fully went through puberty or whatever.  So this one time he lost his ID and whenever he asked someone ""hey I'm 20 but I don't have ID, can you buy me a pack of smokes?"" they'd be like ""go home kid, you're like 15"".  Like noooo I swear I'm a grOwN uPPP.  &amp;#x200B;  So yeah, you're not the only one man.  I totally understand knowing you'd look better if you gained weight but being terrified to gain weight anyways.  But hey props to you for making an effort at recovery; that takes balls.  I love you man.",False,False

Looked like I was in my mid 20s at my HW and now I'm actually 20 with a normal BMI and I look like a 15 year old on a good day,False,False

Now I look so young and it's actually embarrassing as people treat you like you're 15.,False,False

I want to have a nice body that people would compliment but that requires weight and weight is terrifying. I realize that being very thin (paired with naturally small chest) makes me look like a prepubescent boy but I canâ€™t seem to stop myself.   Good on you for recovering though, people really shouldnâ€™t comment on other peopleâ€™s bodies I never understand why people donâ€™t see how rude that is? Donâ€™t let their bullshit follow you, Iâ€™ve come to realize that no one on earth looks a way where no one criticizes them for it, someone always has some bullshit to say and itâ€™s both unnecessary and untrue. Youâ€™re doing so well on the hard track to recovery, their pointless comment shouldnâ€™t factor.",False,False

I currently weigh what I did at... fifteen, I think? And I look about the same. Most people assume I'm sixteen.  &amp;#x200B;  When I was around 18 I did have the 'ideal' thicc body but I decided I'd rather be a spooky skelly.",False,False
