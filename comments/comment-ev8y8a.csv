I expected him to pack and run, I was mortified. But: relationships get better when you feel comfortable enough with someone to let them know your secrets, and I’m really glad he knows now. Even if sometimes it’s really hard now that we live together, because I am more likely to eat if I cook and then if he eats with me. This worked well with my overweight ex-husband who was a professional chef, and who would always eat when I was finally ready to- but my boyfriend is very anxious, and is often not hungry. But anyways, his reaction at the time of The Bagel Incident™️ was very nice and sympathetic, and I truly hope for you that your boyfriend will react with love should you decide to tell him!",False,False
