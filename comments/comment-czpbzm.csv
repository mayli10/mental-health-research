You are so fat.” And kept pestering me.   Whoopsie here we are. I take everything to heart and personally so obviously it became a focus. At 19 my first boyfriend of a good yet doomed relationship broke up with me. Deep depression of first love lost, so I knew I was already weight obsessed and I could control this. Google brought me to... I dunno maybe Ana butterfly? The site is long gone now but it’s when I became obsessed with calorie numbers and least calorie meals.  I was eating a slice of buttered bread and an apple for lunch every day at work and nothing else. Maybe gobstoppers cause at the time I had it figured out calorie wise and I could have 3.    Moved out at 21, suddenly ended up being alone in the apartment I was sharing. I was broke and anorexic, so I focused on cheap and low cal. Broth and cabbage soup with soy sauce and onions was some bastardized recipe I found online so I would make a big pot of that and only eat that for like a week. I had the best body. I remember going to a pool party and stepping down into the water and I am still riding the high 10 years later of watching 2 guys catching their breath.    Mostly my Ana stuff has been guy motivated. I don’t feel like they pressure me into it, it’s that I pressure myself cause I love that attention of being able to turn heads. I’m a piece of shit and I know it. I just want them to lose blood flow to their brain periodically at my command.",False,False

The summer before sophomore year (so I was 15-ish) I weighed myself for the first time in a while and found out I gained about 20 lbs. Coincidentally, I stumbled upon a pro-ana blog on Tumblr, with a bunch of the stereotypical low cal diets, thinspo, 'skip dinner wake up thinner' type quotes and decided I better whip my ass into shape for school. I entered my sophomore year of high school about 10 lbs lighter but I couldn't stop thinking about how I should eat less, weigh less, be prettier, smarter, etc.   I've always thought of myself as 'chubby' even before that (like middle school) and I've never had a healthy relationship with food or my body, and starting to restrict royally fucked my perception of myself and what a normal diet looks like. Even now I can barely imagine eating a 'recommended' diet. I use my ED as self harm and as a reason to keep going every day, and I'm not sure who I would be if I never went onto that Tumblr blog",False,False

Attention for being the skinny frail anorexic girl and attention for losing weight so fast. Disordered eating began at age 11 for me when I developed habits like being unable to eat in front of friends. I'd say it became full blown anorexia however when I was 14, then after I developed a mixture of BED/bulimia and completely lost control and went from very underweight to the higher end of a normal BMI in a very short space of time, I maintained that weight for a few years, however was only physically recovered never mentally in the slightest and hated my body. The anorexia returned again out of nowhere aged 18 last year again for attention reasons but I also began to appreciate the emotional numbness that restriction gave me.
