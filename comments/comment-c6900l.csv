I was even made fun of briefly by someone recovering from BED (before I had a seizure welp) at how I literally went for the dessert first before anything else during my meals. And even outside of treatments my friends with AN and other EDs all judge me? And tell me if it weren't for being underweight I'd never be diagnosed with AN? All of my safe foods of chocolate and dessert are all fear foods for them? And they're always reminding me of this?  I think what I'm trying to say is: thank you so much, I really needed to read your comment, and I appreciate you sharing your experiences during treatment too.",False,True

It made me laugh so much. Also same about the nuts (though I occasionally like to eat pistachios) and I'm literally about to grab a hot fudge sundae from McDonald's (no peanuts though since I actually non-ED related abhor peanuts)!

Also same, I just love sugar too much. I'm so used to being shamed for that by other folks with AN instead of eating healthy so this is just, gosh.

You definitely are NOT alone. While in treatment, people would talk about being afraid of certain foods, and for me, it was about moderating the calories and how much I consumed more than anything. I would count less than 1500cal total for a week, and then eat a bag of twizzlers or eat a few pieces of laffy taffy. It [junk food] was the most important thing to me, and I would cry if someone ate something I bought since I would have been saving it until the end of the week after totaling my calories.
