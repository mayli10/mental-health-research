It can also be in your head, I used to get stared at A LOT before my ED and I thought it was because I was ugly- I think that's partly why I developed an ED because, now, if people were to stare and I'm in my satisfaction weight (which is usually underweight), than  at least I can assume it's because I look sick.  &amp;#x200B;  Either way, try not to focus on people staring at you. Try to be comfortable with your body by doing everything you can to have it were you want it to be, that way you'll stop noticing if people stare or not. I legit can't go outside a day after a binge.",False,False

I guess if they're trying to figure out which ethnicity we are, that could be it in some cases lol. When I was on dating apps, I alwayssss got ""what's yur ethnicity"" questions.

I'm actually a ""normal"" weight, but people are always staring at me and I don't know why. I wore jeans (actually jeggings) today instead of skirts/dresses and I'm so uncomfortable in jeans and everyone is staring. The guy at Peet's said I look nice today, and I'm thinking all DON'T NOTICE ME, I'M DRESSED NORMALLY. I literally have on blue jeggings and a black sweater and black boots and my makeup is normal af. Don't notice me don't notice me don't notice me.  I have this issue when I go back to my mom's city for some reason, despite dressing normally. Everyone stares at me. WHY.  I don't know. Am I just so beautiful or am I fat or what. Do I look weird. Or is it because I'm biracial. WHY. It's so uncomfortable. Is it paranoia. Am I freaking out for no reason.  AGHHH.  Sorry for the rant. I know how you feel :'(",False,False
