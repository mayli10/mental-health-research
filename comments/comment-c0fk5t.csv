If you care about someone I just donâ€™t feel like those thoughts would cross your mind, even if itâ€™s really how you feel. Just comes off a little phony.

Iâ€™ll cry over gaining half a kilo myself but I like my men thicc. My partner used to be a little chubby which I loved, he was so comfortable and cuddly and I always had the best sleep ever with him cause of his cuddliness. Then he started going to the gym and heâ€™s quite skinny and fit now and itâ€™s uncomfortable to cuddle into and Iâ€™m not attracted to it (and I have complained about it to my friends a lot in general conversation) But I still love him just the same, heâ€™s still perfect to me and heâ€™s irreplaceable whether or not his body is my personal â€˜idealâ€™.",False,False

I like thinness in myself and others. When I met my boyfriend he was a thin thin boy. I knew my type and picked someone who fit it. Recently he got into bodybuilding and has gotten buffer and lost all the sharp angles I found attractive. But guess what, I don't love his hip bones I love him. His mind and our experiences make me love him. I told my best friend how I preferred, purely physically, his smaller frame but I found attraction in him and his health. What makes him healthy and happy makes me happy. Talk to him, COMMUNICATE, taken out of context things I said would have made it seem like I didn't find him JUST as attractive as before, which I do but in different ways. He's still a 10/10 to me but for different reasons then when we first met. This could be true for you and that's just people growing and changing. He's the sexiest man alive when I met him and he still is.",False,False

Itâ€™s one thing to be hard on yourself, but another thing if someone that supposedly cares about you does that. Not cool and not worth it!!! Screaming booo to him from the cheap seats. You deserve better.",False,False
