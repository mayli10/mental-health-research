I just prefer to exercise with a bunch of other fit people at the gym/boxing. Workout people motivate me lol. Really depends on you. Financially, the gym I used to go is expensive but I have been doing [boxing](http://brisbaneboxinggym.com.au/) which is a lot cheaper and affordable for me. I don't know where you live but I live in Brisbane and I just go to my local boxing class. Maybe try boxing? ;P  ",False,False

But truly no one cares about other people working out since everyone’s focused on themselves. If someone looks at you it’s only going to be because they are resting between workouts and their eyes are just mindlessly wandering around the room or it’s because you’re doing an exercise that is new to them and they are curious to see your form to learn it themselves or whatever.  For lifting itself start by learning basics w body weight or water bottles at home first so deadlift, press, curls, squat so you can perfect form then go try weights. Another tip I have is if you do join a gym maybe try a local recreational centre gym/city gym/whatever they are called since they tend to be smaller and skew more with old people gym goers so the super macho gym guys aren’t at those places as much. But even when those kinda guys are there it’s no issue they are just so intensely focused on their exercises.   I was so anxious about working out publicly at first that I would go so early hoping to beat everyone and exercise alone. But now I workout whenever and I do all these suggestive looking exercises (bridges, hip thrust, cable pull through etc) without giving a fuck about other people  + no one cares back ",False,False
