Not to armchair diagnose anyone but she herself sounds pretty disordered. This contradictory attitude towards food (""I have to tell you to nourish yourself because it's my job but I also can't stop myself from making judgemental comments about your bodies when you do"") is pretty standard for someone who doesn't recognise they have disordered eating behaviours, which is likely if she's sharing an 8 day fast like it's no big deal. This damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't projection of eating onto other people is telling. She might even subconsciously be doing it to make herself feel better - if she makes sure you all have eaten breakfast, then her fast is somehow even more meaningful.  I hope you're getting an overall positive experience out of this class otherwise, because this behaviour is concerning. The trouble is whether anyone above your teacher would listen or care, if they aren't already tacitly allowing it to happen.",False,False
