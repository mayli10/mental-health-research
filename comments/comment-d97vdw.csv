When I'm magnesium deficient I get so foggy and tired, my limbs tingle/fall asleep a lot, and I get lots of little muscle twitches.

Watch out for fainting, try and recognize if you're about to faint so you can sit down. You don't want to hit your head and seriously injure yourself. Your body doesn't have enough calories to be awake and doing stuff. So it wants to conserve energy by sleeping. Not really anything you can do besides eating more. I basically started to develop narcolepsy type symptoms at my worst. I would fall asleep standing up. No amount of caffeine or electrolytes helped",False,False
