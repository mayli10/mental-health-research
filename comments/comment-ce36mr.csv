A million times worse than normal purging or vomiting from flu/hangover/food poisoning. I’ve read that it can cause severe heart damage, even if you don’t use it regularly. It’s just bad news all around. If you haven’t taken it yet, please don’t. It’s a terrible idea even by ED standards.",False,False

It can causes worse electrolyte imbalances than regular vomiting and over time can cause damage to the heart. And there is still the risk of esophageal or gastric rupture.,False,False
