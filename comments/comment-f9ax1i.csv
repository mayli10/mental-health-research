And even if we go shopping together she’ll always suggest bigger clothes than are actually my size, even though she is looking at me and can clearly SEE that these pants are falling off me. I don’t know if it’s a holdover from when I was a growing kid and she needed to buy me clothes that I could grow into, or if she just expects me to get fatter.",False,False

When we were kids my sister was skinnier than me  however she's now put on weight and I've lost a lot (because of a crippling eating disorder) so despite being the same height and still reasonably slim she's now about 30-40lbs heavier than me (we're tall).  My mum still consistently buys me a bigger size than my sister which horrifies me but I feel like I can't say anything without upsetting my sister about her weight or coming across as ungrateful. I just loudly point out to my mum mine are very ""spacious"" to which she'll just be like ""yeah you want pyjamas big for being comfy""........   I don't think it's malicious (with my mum anyways), I think sometimes parents just get a fixed idea of their kids in their head and it doesn't update so I wouldn't worry that anyone else views you the same way.",False,False

Every year on christmas she always gets me clothes that are *at least* a couple sizes too large and it makes me so upset. It makes me feel like while I might be an xs my body still looks like an xl.,False,False
