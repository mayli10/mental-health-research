Because there's so much more to life, places to go and people to meet and things to experience. Your eating disorder will rob you of so many things.   Because your brain will eventually start working normally again, and you'll have more energy and strenght and resiliance. And it will stop obsessing over food.",False,False

Recovery = less time obsessing over food. Also less bingeing = less money spent on food... which can be spent on clothes, or whatever it is you like",False,False

Then there are tons of physical effects, which will reduce to quality of life and cost you money if you end up needing to be treated for them. You’re at risk for vitamin deficiencies and malnutrition which will cause you all sorts of problems like making your mood worse, early osteoporosis, and atrophy of your muscles. You can cause lots of problems with your esophagus and stomach from vomiting frequently. You can erode the tissue of your esophagus which is painful and can get infected. The stomach acid in your mouth will ruin your teeth over time, giving you more cavities an d your enamel will wear out and cause your teeth to get smaller and chip more easily. You’re also at risk for electrolyte imbalances and dehydration that can kill you by causing your heart to stop beating if you vomit frequently. Your breath will smell bad and people will be able to smell the vomit on you and in your house if you do it often enough. You’ll have puffy cheeks and red eyes and possibly red marks on your hands which will make it obvious to anyone familiar with bulimia that you are bulimic. Plus the more often you eat a lot and then vomit, the harder it is to stop yourself from eating to the point that you feel you have to purge again. And it becomes harder to control over time. You will never get rid of all the calories you ate from purging and you will end up eating more and more and that can lead to weight gain over time. So the whole thing will make your life worse in general.   If after all that you think vomiting is harmless, well then you may just have to find out the hard way what can happen to you.",False,False

It will only ever bring you pain and take away any life you may have had. You can't see what damage it is doing to you on the inside, and if that damage is sustained for too long, full recovery gets further and further away. There will be a point where your body cannot fight for survival, even if you want to mentally.  So while it may be easier to eat and yeet, having a healthier relationship with food and feeding yourself nutritious foods will be far better for you and your body in the long run. You can eat whatever you want though. Thinking you can't is the ED inside of you clinging on for some control.  Find something you enjoy doing in your downtime, or seek out a new hobby to fill your time. If you're busy being distracted, time will pass by and you won't be fighting this internal battle, over whether or not to binge, as intensely. Recovery is always, always worth it, even when your ED is in full control. Especially then.",False,False
