My answer to you will be kind of in between the other responses you've gotten.   It's instinctual to a lot of people with low self esteem to purposely look for reasons that you're not good enough, like you mentioned at the end. It's instinctual, but it's really important to try to manage those feelings as best as you can. So I think it's ok to kindly ask him to try not to stare at other girls' bodies, especially when he's with you, because you're dealing with a lot of feelings right now, many of which are irrational. But I don't think he's wrong to feel like he was put into an unfair situation either. You can't realistically expect him to not even accidentally glance at someone. If things like this keep piling up it's probably going to put a lot of stress on your relationship.  If you're able to and are not already seeing one, I would recommend talking to a therapist about how you can cope with these feelings and manage them better. I think it'll help relieve stress from your relationship if you can take some of the insecurity/ED talk and redirect it to a professional instead.  Wishing you good luck, relationships are on another level of difficulty when either or both party is dealing with mental health struggles.",False,False

I don‚Äôt think a look means anything - it‚Äôs fair enough to get annoyed at it but it needn‚Äôt be so dramatic as to end a relationship over. We didn‚Äôt get to see how bad it really was, we weren‚Äôt there and you didn‚Äôt give too much info. What if it was just a glance? We here don‚Äôt have great self esteem so I‚Äôm willing to bet your mind could be blowing it out of proportion and these people are enabling you. I also don‚Äôt think the fact it‚Äôs a new relationship necessarily means he owes you more, as stated by the other comment.   Men really do look at women, men are extremely visual based creatures. But he‚Äôs in a relationship with *you*. He wouldn‚Äôt be if he didn‚Äôt want to be. I fear that by the others justifying your behaviour, you‚Äôll drive him away with constant insecurity. He can try to never glance at women because he knows you have an eating disorder, but, Imagine if every-time you simply looked at another man, with no intentions, he flipped out on you? Let alone spent time with other Male friends. Would you want to stay with him?   If a man walked past topless with a perfect six-pack could you really say you would completely cover your eyes and divert your attention? If you did look, would that mean you didn‚Äôt want to be with your boyfriend anymore?   Again, men rely on the visual an incredible amount more than women, so the example isn‚Äôt even as extreme as it actually would be.   You‚Äôll get comments from other women saying it‚Äôs all okay, and you‚Äôre doing everything fine, but this is my opinion as a man - that‚Äôs not me looking down on anyone here as less intelligent or inferior, absolutely not, we are just biologically different. I say this in itself absolutely does not mean he doesn‚Äôt want to be with you. ",False,False

Men really are visual based, hence why they love upclose highspeed porn etc. Women can be visual based too but often nowhere near to the same extent.

Ugh that line pisses me off.   Anyway, I‚Äôve been with my bf for over three years now and this would definitely upset me too, so don‚Äôt feel bad about that at all.
