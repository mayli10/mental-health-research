I feel like a cartoon character because my body gets all bent in the wind yet my feet stay static!  &amp;#x200B;  To be honest, my ED brain likes it, but when it was really bad at the start of the year I was getting into some dangerous situations with the wind and having to stop and hang on to something was annoying.  That was more to do with the severe weather than my weight.  I'm over winter already and it only just began!  Be careful though.  Especially near roads!  &amp;#x200B;  (I get the feeling you might be in the UK?  We're getting the dregs of storm Whatsername.
