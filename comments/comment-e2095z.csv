I’m so glad you had something to eat and were able to make it through your appointment! You should be very proud of yourself! &lt;3,False,False

I haven’t poached an egg in a while because I feel obligated to not eat yolk. But my medium eggs are 60 cal. I think I can work that in and it would be nice to have a hot meal. I’m totally fine with volume eating despite not liking full feelings. I ended up with a big bowl of veggies and a little corn. And I made it through my appointment ok!!,False,True

My go to: poached eggs. Only about 70 cal each and don’t make you feel too full. If I’m feeling brave I have some avocado with it as well. High cal but very nutrient dense.   Feeling full is a big trigger for me so I’m not much of a volume eater :(,False,False
