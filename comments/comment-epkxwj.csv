You deserve to give your body a rest (regardless of what your brain is telling you rn), can you take a few minutes to step away from things, maybe go take a shower for 15 minutes and just try to focus on breathing and grounding yourself? Drink a glass of water or some powerade zero or a drink with electrolytes. Take a nap if you can. You deserve so much more than this, I hope you can take a minute to be kind to yourself, you're worth it!",False,False
