Comments about weight have never helped. They didn’t help me at 210, 150, 185, 140, 125, 138, 110, or right now as I frantically bounce between 135 and 145.  Having been at such a variety of weights and having had my weight bounce around a lot due to ED behavior, I can honestly say that I’ve never been happy at any weight. I’ve never felt that society was happy with me at any weight. I’ve never felt that any comments about my weight have truly been helpful.",False,False
