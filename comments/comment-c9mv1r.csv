And my worst calorie counted day of binging was around 20 thousand cals. :/ You just have to keep trying though.  Recently I downloaded some apps one is called iPrevail and the other is called 7 cups and they’re digital/online therapy apps. You can either pay to get set up with a licensed therapist to talk to or talk to volunteer trained “listeners” I don’t know if it will help you out but it might be worth a shot to try out next time you get a binge urge. That’s what I did last week when I felt like I was about to start binging and I didn’t end up binging",False,False
