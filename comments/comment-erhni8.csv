I just tell them I don't want to be weighed. :-) you may have to say no a couple times - the first time I saw a new doc, the nurse said ""some meds are based on weight"" and I said ""That might be true, but I'm not on any of those meds. I'm happy to talk with the doctor about it."" Anyway just be aware you may have to stand up for yourself a bit.",False,False

I don’t like getting weighed either but I do it anyways but I just have her not tell me the number. Sometimes if I’m feeling bigger than usual then I’ll just tell her not this time and she respects that. I’m sure your doctor will respect you and your boundaries so just let them know.,False,False

If they absolutely need your weight, then ask to face Backwards on the scale so you do not see it.",False,False
