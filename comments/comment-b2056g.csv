Choose the food you feel most comfortable eating. Take some home if its allowed. If your a broke college student then it would probably be a good idea to eat the food so that you can save money. It might suck and you might be mad at yourself, but at least you wouldn’t be mad about buying food and having it go to waste when you could’ve spent that money on something better. Or feeling o ligated to eat all the food you bought so that it doesn’t go to waste and ending up making yourself sick.",False,False
