I have literally gained almost 50 lbs over the last three years since I went in for treatment for my ED. I like to think it's worth it (and I know it's better than being really unhealthy and underweight) but I still miss it (and my skinny body). I miss a lot of unhealthy things like feeling empty and seeing my bones. But I know that's fucked up. I'm still hanging onto my recovery (sometimes by a thread) because I also remember how miserable I was when I had my ED.,False,False
