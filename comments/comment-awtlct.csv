I think its a mouth thing but I used 6mg of nicotine and it def curbs my appetitie but can sometimes make me feel dizzy.   Ita also nkce bc if youre around a lot of people and they all are eating and I dont wanna I just drink and vape. Keeps me busy and still like om included in the social situation,False,False

It’s an essential oil vape basically so it gives me something to do with my mouth and calms me down at the same time. All natural and no nicotine!! It is a bit pricey though but hey so is binge eating :c,False,False

If I were to get anything with nicotine it would be the lower mg, i don’t have an addictive personality per se (at least to drugs/alcohol. Food obviously is another thing) and can’t see myself latching to cigarettes as I never liked the smell/burning feeling much.   I definitely think having the moment to distract myself (potentially with a vape/juul etc) before I mindlessly grab food can make me stop and think about what I’m about to do before I do it, which is basically why I wanted to know if that’s helped anyone else before. Curbing an appetite would honestly be a plus as I’m a volume eater anyway. ",False,True
