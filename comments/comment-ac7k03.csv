Most likely reason is that pro ed sites have been getting a lot of shit and a lot of coverage since like the 90s. I think there is an idea that fetishists are just people who have a weird kink, but know what they are doing. People with ED's have mental disorders.    Now, I think both subs should be left alone because no one is hurting anyone but themselves. But that is probably the reasoning for banning one and not the other. ",False,False
