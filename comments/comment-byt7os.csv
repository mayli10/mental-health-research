Well I mean higher calorie than I’d like But if I just eat dinner then it’s maybe 400-600 calories for that. I have to have lunch too or I pass out,False,False

Before that I ate my 2 or 3 meals a day. Hope this helps.      I don't like to cook a lot. I am alone and it always takes so much time. I don't know about your food prices but 20 a day sounds way to high. In my country there is a website dedicated to money education which has a budget for food and I think it is 4 or 5 € a day, maybe less. All you really need to make a dinner meal is for example rice, vegetables and maybe a piece of meat, or meat replacement. And against overeating you could prepare everything for just one plate, but buy in bulk. Like large sacks of rice, large bags of pasta.    I can buy a 1 or 2kg or even 5kg bag of rice or pasta and cook multiple dinners with that, rather than buy the small package.    Personally I really like to eat bread. And I'm Dutch so it is really common to just eat bread for breakfast and lunch. So I would buy bread. Or crackers maybe. Something for breakfast. Maybe yoghurt for breakfast. That is filling? I also like Greek yoghurt, with fruit for breakfast if I'm not eating bread. A tub of that could last me a week for 2€. Frozen fruit is 99ct for half a kilo at aldi.    Health eating does not have to be expensive. I do know al these prices at the top of my head. Cause it can be a journey. I have been really poor, like too poor to buy food a couple years back. If you want to find healthy foods but not spend your entire bank it's good to write down or remember good prices and go to multiple stores. Halo top and bang ain't exactly the best examples of good prices, haha.    I like the eatcheapandhealthy sub, but I often see people make a their meals in bulk and I know that if I make my meals in bulk I will eat them in bulk. Lol. But is I buy the ingredients in bulk and cook just what I want to eat ill be way to lazy to cook a second time.    I already said I don't really like cooking so much, so often I make things that are done really fast. Or even things that I can microwave. I used to eat a lot of oven prepared dishes. And also sometimes microwave meals, those are pretty high calorie but I can cook even more calorie dense and if I eat a microwave dish I won't eat anything else extra cause I already feel so much like my grandma.",False,False
