It was definitely the right decision to go!      As I wrote in a previous comment, I would recommend two things:    1) Do you have a family doctor/GP that you feel comfortable with? If so, you could go in for a general checkup to let the doctor make sure your heart, your blood pressure and your blood levels are ok overall. In an ER setting, the nurses and doctors are typically stressed out and short on time, but a GP in his/her regular practice might be able to address your concerns in much more reassuring setting and offer helpful, long-term care. I am also very scared of going to hospitals, but I regularly go to my GP for checkups like that (I have to because I take prescription meds that require regular blood tests) and it always a relief when the tests come back ok.      2) Please think about getting help from a therapist who specializes in EDs. If your bulimia is already causing you such severe problems with your physical health, you should really start getting professional help now. It can make such an enormous difference. I have been seeing a psychiatrist and a psychotherapist regularly and I am still not recovered, but so much better off than I was a few years ago. I am convinced I would be dead by now (from organ failure or an electrolyte imbalance caused by my former extreme laxative abuse) if it hadn't been for the interventions by my psychiatrist and psychotherapist.      Stay safe and take good care of yourself! &lt;3",False,False

I hope you are feeling better-- your last comment was 3 hours ago so I may be a bit late to actually help, but in case something similar happens again, try an herbal tea with no caffeine, and if you're not allergic, lavendar.  I hope you feel better soon if you dont already, I'm so sorry you went through that.",False,False

Does your mom know about your bulimia?   If you go to the ER with her, a doctor might be able to explain that Bulimia can cause potentially life-threatening electrolyte imbalances that might impair the healthy functioning of your heart and that your chest pains should be taken very seriously. As you said, she loves you, and wants what is best for you, and understanding your condition better from a medical point of view will make it easier for her to help you and offer you the support you need.    Have you considered getting long-term professional help from a ED-specialist?    I hope that all will go well at the ER and that you'll feel better soon.",False,False

I am afraid only a doctor can give you a definitive answer to that, but if you feel a little better already (I am writing this 1 hour after you posted), I would suggest that you try to get some rest, lie down, drink some water so you won't dehydrate, and see your Family Doctor tomorrow or in the next couple of days for a general check up to make sure your heart, blood pressure etc. are ok.
