I eat large volumes of food but they‚Äôre mostly fruits and veggies, so not super calorie dense and people make comments alllll the time about how much I eat, asking if I‚Äôm going to eat all that, etc. honestly, I find it kind of rude but then I think they really just don‚Äôt think about calories like that and they base it purely off of amount. When I bring a big salad to work, my boss always seems astounded that I eat ‚Äúso much‚Äù but then when I bring a large smoothie (calorically dense with bananas, peanut butter, flax seeds and stuff) she‚Äôll be like ‚Äúhm, is it a light day for you?‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat, are you on a diet?‚Äù",False,False
