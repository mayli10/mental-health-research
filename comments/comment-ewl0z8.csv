If you ingest too much water too quickly and soon after purging you can deplete your electrolytes even further. Harm reduction is of course key so do take the tablet but perhaps give yourself 30-60 minutes after the tablet before you drink too much.   Electrolyte imbalance is VERY serious and can very quickly land you in the nearest ER.,False,False

After purging your stomach isn't really up to digesting.,False,False
