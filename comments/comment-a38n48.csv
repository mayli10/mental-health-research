She loves to talk to her subscribers, she live streams, and is really open about her mental health issues (bipolar/depression). Wouldn’t recommend if you’re triggered by thin girls eating lots of food though because she is pretty thin. ",False,False

Livia can be kind of triggering tho, especially with her recent What I Eat in a Day video where she only has a little over 1200 cals and exercises heavily every day so she can have a weekly binge.. kinda of quasi-recovery.  Not really the same thing, but british shows like supersize vs. superskinny, secret eaters, and fat families fuel me through fasting too.",False,False

It's like reverse thinspo+junk food conditioning. Foodie beauty, hungryfatchick, trisha paytas, joeys world tour. I also like ephemeral rift's asmr eating but that's the exception bc he's a healthy guy. Feels like I'm having dinner with someone. :) ",False,False
