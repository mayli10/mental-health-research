I’ve been dealing with this fucking bs for 8 years. In those times I was “better” I was only eating a couple times a day but I convinced myself I was “fine.” I’m going to therapy and everything but I keep ignoring my therapist and doing dumb shit like making lists of why I shouldn’t eat and how to resist cravings. I want to come out on the other side but I don’t think it’s really possible.,False,True
