With working like crazy, I don’t have time to prepare my meals, and if I do have a free hour or two, I feel like I should be doing something I actually enjoy. Convenience is truly taken to the next level in this country.  I speak enough Japanese to survive and have friends, but not enough to talk to a proper therapist. :/   Personally, with the cultural differences, I’d rather speak to a Westerner for this issues I think.

Literally moved to Japan last year and picked up binge eating habits. Everything is just too convenient, and my willpower is too low some days :(   Went from about 103 to 112 lbs in 6 months with my binge/starve cycles.

Then I offer up a new opportunity: “tomorrow is a new day, we can try again.” Finally, the following day, I remind myself that I am not pursuing thinness, I’m pursuing health: “don’t over-restrict, we’re trying to hit the middle of moderation, not the bottom of restriction”.   I still binge and I only barely made it through yesterday, but this is the train of thought I use. ",False,False

I struggle with binging a lot, especially since easy, cheap, delicious  food is so plentiful here.  Idk if this will work for you,  but intermittent fasting has been keeping me on track most days of the week.  I have a fasting app downloaded on my phone,  and as soon as I see that timer going,  I feel more determined not to ""mess up"" and binge.  Also, being able to eat a lot during my eating window satisfies the mental desire to eat a shit ton of food all at once. Doing it for a month or so has definitely shrunk my stomach as well so I don't even binge as much as I used to.   ",False,False
