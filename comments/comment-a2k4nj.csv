I remember taking the day off of work, walking to the gas station, and hiding from the world for the next two days. I couldn't leave my apartment for the amount of laxatives I took afterwords.  It gets better, I promise. Just take it one day at a time. I know that's hard, and the days seem to last forever, but you'll make it.  You are strong and appreciated, and you're going to have a great year. PM me if you need someone to talk to. ",False,False
