I was a huge dork and got bullied really bad. I lost 20lbs and showed up to freshman year in all new trendy clothes. Suddenly the popular kids from other schools were all really nice to me. I got a date to homecoming. Then when the popular kids who used to be mean to me started treating me differently I lost it. It all felt so fake. It didnt feel like how I expected. It was empty.,False,False
