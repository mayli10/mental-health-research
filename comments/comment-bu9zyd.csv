When I gain weight, it's all on my legs/butt, a little bit on my belly, but mostly my thighs.   When I lose weight, it melts around my ribcage/face/collarbone-area...    The more I lose and gain and lose and gain back... the fatter my thighs are getting and the thinner my upper body.   But since you've actually had a thigh gap beforehand (which I've never had), I don't think you have lipoedema.   So I guess, I'm no help :(",False,False

That would ""shape"" your thighs differently. I think water weight can also affect leg shape.",False,False
