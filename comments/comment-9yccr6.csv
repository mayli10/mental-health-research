My emotions completely dictate my ED. Got dumped today, and my immediate reaction was to be upset that I had eaten already today, because all I want to do now is restrict. It's like a reflex to sudden sadness. You are not worthless, and I am sorry you're struggling. I think its really good that you're aware of the pattern, and that you know you didn't eat too much!",False,False
