Now it has been 6 years + 48 lbs and I still can't get back into that mindset.  The only thing that has helped recently is going to the gym and walking my dogs every morning. If I have already worked out it makes it a lot easier for me not to over do it because I don't want to ruin such a good start to my day. If I put off working out until later in the day, I usually end up binging between lunch and dinner and don't work out at all. Ugh",False,False

What helped “curing” my daily binges is doing OMAD. I can still eat loads of food in one sitting (eating lots of veggies) without having to feel bad. I do OMAD dinners so that leaves little room for late night snacking. Hope this helps!",False,False
