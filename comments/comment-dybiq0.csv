That would be a BMI of 16 for me. Even for a girl of average height that would be underweight. So this post is a pretty big mood,False,False

That doctor had a philosophy that all SH is *exclusively* an act of attention seeking (umm, whaaaaat?) so I can only figure they thought clumsily-executed reverse psychology would eliminate the “reward” for me. Total hot garbage. On the upside, I knew my current therapist was finally someone that would be a good fit for me when I told them about this experience and they basically did a facepalm. Lol. (Good providers are out there!)",False,False

I wish I was better at words to tell you how truly grateful I am for it, and how sorry I am that anyone - especially professionals - have said such horrendously misinformed and cruel things to you in the past ❤️",False,True

I’m sorry they treated you that way &lt;3   It’s seemed to me that medical doctors are often pretty bad at helping people who are dealing with issues that are more than purely physical. Weirdly, they seem ultra-bad with EDs...maybe because there *are* so many physical side effects to focus on. They lose sight of the fact that this is a physical manifestation of a mental and emotional struggle. Insurance companies seem even stupider at times.   That said, “she looks healthy so we’re not worried” is almost comically inept. Cuz yeah, everyone that’s ill always *looks* externally ill. (“Well sir, you *look* fine so we don’t think there’s any cancer.”)   *For some lols, here’s the stupidest things docs have told me during my mental-health journey so far...*  - “You don’t look depressed.”      - “You are a very pretty girl, what do you have to be depressed about?”      - (*after disclosing alcoholic drinking habits*) “Have you considered reducing your drinking?”      - (*in a residential facility for severe depression and SH*) “I want you to hurt yourself. I need you to hurt yourself.”      - (*same doctor the following week*) “Ok, you need to stop now.” (Me: Gosh! If only I had thought of stopping!)      - (*during an emergency appointment for severe suicidal thoughts*) “Ok. Here’s a new prescription. Give us a call if it gets bad.” (4 hours later I was on a vent in the ICU)    Bottom line. Some doctors are clueless. They’re in a position of authority, so it feels like their judgements of us must be true. They must know when we deserve help. But they don’t always know that. There’s no blood test for mental illness. Anguish doesn’t show up on scans. They have to *listen*, and ask questions, and then listen some more. And some of them really suck at that.",False,False
