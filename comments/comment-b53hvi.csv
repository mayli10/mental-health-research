It‚Äôs kind of a big range and I‚Äôve never been there yet. I was gonna go by that ‚Äúnew bmi‚Äù calculator cause I‚Äôm pretty short but when I was 110 people always commented on how skinny I looked so anything less than 100 would probably be too much.   Natalie Portman / Mila Kunis in black swan is my main example (both around my height and between 90-100) ,False,False

Maybe less. Perhaps not though, depending on what I look like there. But I want pretty much zero fat on me.
