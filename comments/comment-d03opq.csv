I would have barely eaten early this week if you hadn't posted that stewed apple pic...I just keep eating apples haha  I can relate to your feelings though, I feel like it's difficult for people our age to make new friends if we aren't in school. I'm trying the app called Meetup, maybe you could try that as well?   I'm really sorry you're feeling ignored by your current friend, I know that sense of rejection, and it is really difficult to deal with.  Perhaps you can try one more time with her, and invite her out to do something that isn't food based so you'll have more control over the situation. Like a movie or mini-golf. Something where calories aren't a built in component.",False,False
