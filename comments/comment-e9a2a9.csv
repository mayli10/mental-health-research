Going to try the protein drink tonight - therapist said to prepare it in advance so it will be what I consume when I stumble over at 1:30 and 4:30 respectively. Will report back if there's any positive result here :P",False,False

So I eventually could not handle having it around because I would seek it at night. After a few weeks, I'd miss it so much, convince myself I could try to let it back in, and eventually snap and start night-eating it again. It's been gone now for a while. I wish I could control myself so that I could have it around for the day time when I'm better at managing. Now that it is gone, the problem has shifted to doing the same thing with ""safe"" foods - all my desiccated shitty sad sucked out fat free eating disordery bullshit safe foods that I actually allow around. There's gonna be nothing left that I can keep around if I don't get ahead of this. My damn kitchen doesn't have a door or I'd lock that thing up. Argh apartment!",False,False

And, oh, I laughed so hard at the gremlin bit. That's been me when I had a friend sleeping on my couch. Tried so hard not to wake them, but I'm not even well-coordinated when I am gremlin'ing out. Truth though - it really fucking blows - waking up feeling like shit when you wake up after engaging in night-eating. Setting oneself up for the day like that. That's the part that hurts the most. Not properly hungry when you wake, cuz you ate at night, so caloric-deficit during the day, setting up for another binge waiting for the tea. And round and round we f'ing go.",False,False

My therapist told me that when I low restrict for fast for long periods of time, my ‚Äúloss of hunger‚Äù is actually just my body turning off hormone production that isn‚Äôt essential. After a certain point, she said it can literally only perform its essential functions with the amount of food I‚Äôm giving it.   I don‚Äôt know if that makes sense the way I explained it, but I thought it was super interesting. Our bodies could literally be starving and suffering damage but we don‚Äôt  feel it because it stopped producing ‚Äúhunger hormones‚Äù in order to keep our hearts beating.   :(   I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre feeling this way and I hope you can feel better soon!",False,False

Most often it would happen because I wanted a cup of tea, but while it brewed I would start binging, so I stopped drinking tea at night and started more or less confining myself to my room after dinner (yikes).   The things that help me: chewing gum, brushing my teeth, trying to stay busy, and eating dinner later at night (between 8 and 10pm) so I'm not hungry before bed.   It sucks though. It's so secretive and embarrassing, there's been a few times where a roommate has come home while I was eating honey and peanut butter from the jar like a gremlin",False,False

I figured if i ate 3 meals a day my body wouldn‚Äôt feel like it needed to eat at night.  -leaving my sliding door slightly open. this let the cold wind come in at night. so when i woke up i was more focused on closing that door and turning on my heater. it gave me something else to do when i woke up  and thats pretty much it. it really sucks bcuz its hard to control but youll get there :),False,False

Totally fine during the day, uncontrollable bingeing at night.   My solution was to literally knock myself tf out lol.
