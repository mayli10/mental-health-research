Maybe what I do helps you, write down all things your body allows you to do. even the smallest things.  My body allows me to walk, my body allows me to hug my bf, to see a movie, allows me to talk, to love. Just to remember that our bodies have so much functions than just look good, and so many functions that many people do not have, and we must be grateful for that. It is a small thing, but it helps a bit, at least to go through the moment. ",False,False

You feel like a prisoner in your own 'disgusting' body. I've also dealt with really persistent negative thoughts about myself. I'm not sure if this will help you but these are a few things I've learnt for HOW to be kinder to yourself.  1. If you wouldn't say it to/about your best friend then why is it okay to say it about yourself? When I think something negative about myself I think about how I would feel if someone said it about my best friend and I get mad and upset because my best friend doesn't deserve that. You don't deserve anything worse than your best friend and trying to learn to treat yourself like you would a bff can be a helpful technique. 2. I just straight up challenge the negative thought when it happens. I started doing this in combination with snapping an elastic bracelet on my wrist, not too hard but enough to associate the mental action with a physical response. E.G. my inner thought would be 'you are so stupid and fat' and my reaction to that would be to snap the elastic and internally say to myself 'that's not true, you are not fat and you are smart. you are valuable as a person'. It might sound weird or dumb but wow committing to that technique made a world of difference for me. The negative self talk is still there sometimes but it went from being loud and overpowering to a quiet background noise that I just ignore most of the time. 3. Imagine yourself as you were as a little kid. For myself, I pick me at age 4. Picture times when you were that age and just really in a moment of being a carefree kid, totally unaware of anything other than the enjoyment you were getting from just being. Then consider what it would be like to say the negative self thoughts out loud to that child version of yourself. Children, even us as children, are so small and fragile and innocent. Easily made happy and just easily made unhappy sometimes by simple things. Next time you find yourself engaging in negative self talk imagine your child-self and try to protect them because these negative thoughts are not you, they're your disorder.  These are not quick fixes because there is no quick fix to this type of negative self talk. But they are little things that are definitely worth trying because they can add up to making a really big difference to how you feel about yourself. Your experience in your body is valid and I understand how shitty it feels to be inside a body that you hate and one that you can't see has any value but you have to challenge that voice that tells you you're not good enough, because that voice is wrong.",False,False
