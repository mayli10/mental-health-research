Iâ€™m sure the look on your face made it very clear that his behavior was making you feel the opposite of good. Yet he repeated it. I donâ€™t think youâ€™re wrong in feeling he went about it in totally the wrong way. I donâ€™t think youâ€™re being overly defensive. Your boundary meter was going off. Your body isnâ€™t a topic of conversation like the weather or an episode of Modern Family. And something else to think about: you said you were overweight, yet heâ€™s asking why the weight loss. What friend wants their friend to stay overweight? If Iâ€™m reaching I apologize. But all this just rubs the wrong way. Iâ€™m sorry you got put on the spot like that. Not cool at all. ðŸ’š",False,False

I HATE when people comment on my body. It just feels intrusive and uncomfortable.  Itâ€™s absolutely not okay to be so loud about your business in public either. Iâ€™m sorry your friend upset you, it totally sucks when people donâ€™t think before they speak. ðŸ˜–",False,False
