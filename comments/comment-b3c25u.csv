I am such a loud chewer, especially compared to everyone else :( Crunchy stuff OMG and even soft stuff I feel like I'm extra slurpy gross. Ugh. My MIL is anorexic and I think she's conscious about it too because whenever she eats crunchy things like crackers she bites SO carefully and chews so slow... it's mesmerizing to me.

I’ve actually never heard someone else bring it up before.   Not even just theaters but in general. It’s like everyone is focused on how much you’re eating based off your chewing but in reality they’re all really focused on whatever else is going on. I guess in hindsight everyone was probably too focused on the movie to notice your Pringle party ☺️ ,False,False
