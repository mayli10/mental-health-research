An old friend was one of her patients before Youtube took off. I guess fame and clout corrupts anyone.,False,False

I JUST found out about the Shane video after seeing a youtube comment on a pewdiepie video from a few months ago. I know it's going to trigger the shit out of me, but I'm about to watch.",False,False

I would have preferred her come back on her own terms of you know what I'm saying.  She should have posted her own video first then let the duo video come out a day later,False,False

Maybe since Kati isn't Eugenia's therapist and Eugenia agreed to do it, she just gave him advice. She can't do anything about what Eugenia does.",False,False

And I do think she should have waited a little longer but maybe she felt that this was best for her maybe as a way to ease her way back in or let fans know that she is doing okay at least.",False,False

It didnt seem like she was really ready, but also, she owes it to absolutely nobody to say even a PEEP about what was going in. If I recall correctly, the milestones for ED recovery are 1, 3, 5, and 10 years. She is only 5 months in. It's her choice, but if what people are saying about her mom is true, she doesnt know how to say no to people, and she is under pressure to play the perfect recovery patient",False,False

I completely agree we don't know how it made her feel and I hope it tried to take the conversation more light hearted and wish the best for her.",False,False

Like, it's a serious situation, but I've been in a psych ward (not ed related) and theres SUCH stigma around it. So anytime a friend laughs about a psych ward joke I make, I feel better. Like, hey, sometimes we need to take time away, and sometimes it needs to be supervised.  Obviously we dont know how it made eugenia feel. But i hope it made her more comfortable instead of less, in the long run",False,False

I think that her consenting played a big role and if she didn't feel comfortable then she could easily have said something. I think she gave the vague answers to show that maybe she wasn't 100% ready to let everyone know everything and this was a way for her to let her barrier down. I think that Shane had her best interests at heart and with the ip jokes I think he was trying to not make it all about her, I do agree they were a little uncalled for but it could also help to make it feel like less pressure on her seeing as Shane has suffered with an ed.",False,False

Shane was probably the best option for that. I don’t know if she felt pressured but I feel like she was still very closed off about everything. It’s obvious she still doesn’t want to talk about much and that’s why I think the interview felt kind of hollow (at least when she was talking about her ED).,False,False

And often at some point in when you are feeling a taste of normality you are so excited and energetic about it that you want to share it.  That said it can turn around very fast at times and you just want to ditch recovery.  Maybe she asked him to make the video, she was out of social media and was hard to contact her.  Did one of them mentioned who's idea was?   Also he asked what things he could ask or talk and she said nothing is out of her boundaries, and shifted topic when she was feeling a bit uncomfortable. It is a sensible topic, but if she wanted to tell her story that is her call too.",False,False

But i can tell she is always fidgety in videos. Also she has been going through it for YEARS and i feel like it was just to rushed, maybe shane should have wait a year or something cuz now other youtubers are coming out with drama.",False,False
