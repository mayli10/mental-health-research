Your stat bar lists ""N"" which I think stands for ""normal weight"" you list it with your name, so I'm sorry if that was a touchy topic for you.  Also the fact that your intrusive thoughts never took you there does not make you better. Just means you don't have the same experience. So don't shame people who have a different experience.   You easily could have commented this sentiment on the original post, but instead you had to make a whole new post. You could have connected with OP directly. You could have been uplifting, given examples to help challenge OPs perceptions.    I'm not saying these types of thoughts aren't wrong. Hating anyone for the way they look is wrong. Having a space to voice these thoughts where other people can *kindly* guide each other away from the negativity is super important.",False,False

These intrusive thoughts and feelings about obese individuals do not define the OP  2. The thoughts are wrong! But they are there, and getting that toxic stuff out of your head is important.  The comments that try and perpetuate the stereotypes without pointing out the cognitive dissonance should be repeated.   ""Oh yeah, I totally agree with your point about fat people""  Would be an example. That's insensitive.

I get it though. My own Body dismoprhia doesnt help my own comparisons. But because i find comfort in numbers and measurements knowing i am on the heavier side, i have found some of these posts to be painful.  But I get why posters NEED to say what they do. And I dont find the posts hateful, because it is completely human to judge and while the word disgust seems loaded, disgust is a primal emotion that is seen is every single human being accross all cultures and walks of life.  Let me add this too. When it comes to triggers, it is my own responsibility to not seek them out if I am fragile and it is my own responsibility to work through them as needed.   All I am asking for is some kind of content warning. Because I love each and everyone of you and we all deserve a safe space. During my last relapse I spent HOURS on r/fatpeoplehate and I feel a lot of shame around that. So me? Guilty of the thoughts too.   When we have ""unpopular"" opinions or we recognize those unhelpful and judgemental thoughts, some feel shame. And shame leads to isolation. And that is the very last thing any one of us needs.  Tl;dr idk a content warning might be helpful. Everyone no matter what size they are, how their ed presents, or where they are in their journey needs and deserves a place for their thoughts other than just in their heads/private journal/etc",False,False
