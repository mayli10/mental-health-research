Peak bone growth happens in your youth and having your period is essential. My ed only started when I was 18. I’m 25 now and recovered but I still have osteopenia (which is the phase before osteoporosis).  It’s a very dangerous disease which can leave you immobile. I would do some research into it.,False,False

I grew about 1.5 inches from then until I was 16 and then I stopped growing. I am in college now and I have since grown to the height of 5’8 (I’m 19). In the early years of my eating disorder I did not pay any attention to vitamins/minerals and I was terrified of fat and protein. When I first started ‘real’ recovery (around the age of 17) I started to focus on those nutrients more. When I started restricting again I made sure I made the vitamins/minerals a focus and I included a great deal more protein and fat . Your height plight is not hopeless, just focus on obtaining adequate nutrition! (I use cronometer to make sure I get enough of each nutrient).",False,False

That said, it would majorly help to make sure you're getting proper nutrition.  I can't promise you'll grow, but it's the only way it can possibly happen. At 14 you still have plenty of time left to grow- I know women who grew a few inches in college!   I know it's probably scary, but maybe you can use this as motivation to recover. A dieticians and doctor could help identify nutrients you could improve upon in your diet.   Even if you dont end up growing taller, your brain is developing and will also need some vital nutrients.",False,False

I take about 5 steps total in one day so to eat what I spend I’d probably need 1400-1500 calories. I think once you reach an age, you stop growing. For me, I think I stopped growing when I was 13 because I’ve been 5’0 for a long time. Everyone stops at different times but assuming you can still grow then I would think you have to eat a nutritious “normal” amount of food. No guarantees though, I used to eat a lot and I’m still 5’0.",False,False
