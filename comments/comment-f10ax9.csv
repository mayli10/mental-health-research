Basicslly I take the lowest I burn during sleep every 15mins.  Times it by 4, then 24.  That gives me my sedentary bmr as far as I'm concerned because past experience has shown me I barely clock 100 over it when I spend all day on the couch.",False,False

So, I definitely don't take the TDEE estimates I get as gospel but I do use them to get a sense of the ballpark.  I'm not sure what lab testing is out there that's available to ordinary people. There probably is something that could get a more accurate BMR number...but total energy is so variable day to day based on activity that I don't know how they'd handle that. I do really want a dexa scan at some point so I can finally know what my body fat % actually is....but ofc my brain says I have to get my body fat % lowerrrrr before I can go.",False,False
