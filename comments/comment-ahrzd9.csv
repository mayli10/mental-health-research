The 75mg dose is to get my body used to it apparently.   Today was much better despite waking up two hours late and freaking out over being late taking it. Walks in the cold air seem to help. I just hope I feel more normal soon.,False,False

A few more days to make sure my weight sticks around that range, and then back to bulking :)  A couple days ago, I was getting into the danger zone for a binge, so I looked myself in the mirror and said, ""you can eat maintenance and stall for a few days, or you can set yourself back a month. Your call"".  I did the former. Even though I really probably shouldn't have cut the ""extra"" weight, I still feel like I'm getting into a healthier mindset about things overall.  Plus, it was so much easier to cut again after a month and a half of maintenance/bulking. I feel more confident about being able to cut again come spring.",False,False

The endorphins basically pump me up for the whole day and I feel like I started off on a productive foot. Some people find the gym tiring (in a good way), though, so if that‚Äôs you you could always go later at night.   I avoid going during peak hours (5-7 pm-ish) like the plague. ",False,False
