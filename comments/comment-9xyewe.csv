I am sorry you had to even hear any of that. It is just cruel and so hurtful and I hope you are okay. I know it will take time to cope with such harsh words.  &amp;#x200B;  Just know it is very common for people to gain on psychiatric meds. and you are not alone in that.   &amp;#x200B;  If you want to lose some weight that is okay, but don't do it for your mom and please don't feel you need to be anyone but what you want to be.  Eating disorders are monsters (as you know) and it sounds like you were able to feel happy for a period of time and that is wonderful. I truly wish you the best in your choices and please stay safe.   &amp;#x200B;  Disordered patterns are easy to fall back on and it seemed you were really strong!!! I would hate to see you go back because of her.  Once again I am so sorry for you being treated so awful. Many hugs &lt;3",False,False

No but really, try to remember your health and safety is so much more important than anything insensitive someone could say. You deserve to be healthy and your worth is not defined by your weight.  Stay safe.",False,False
