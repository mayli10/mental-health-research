They aren't the best tasting protein bars out there... but they take a long time to eat and are extremely satiating. That's the appeal.   Speaking as a protein bar connoisseur, One Bars are similar but less rubbery. Combat Crunch and Cliff Builders (a high cal energy bar hybrid) have a similar satiation value to Quest and One bars, but taste/feel more like candy bars. Combat Crunch is my personal favorite, because while they taste really decadent, they're chewy enough that you're forced to eat them slowly. Chewy like a chewy candy bar, though. Not like a quest bar. ",False,False
