Didn't have time to really get into it then, so pretty sure that's gonna happen this time round, and I'm terrified too. I can message you after my appointment about my experience if you want.   If you're resistant to complying with treatment and are high risk, which with such a low BMI I would say you are, then you could be forced to receive emergency treatment to at least stabilise you. Your doctor likely won't force you to eat 3 meals, he may try to encourage you to eat more, but should you be willing to try and get better, he should refer you to a dietician whilst maintaining primary care over you.  Any health professional worth their credentials will treat you with respect and work with you, rather than against. If for whatever reason you don't like how you're treated or the outcome of the appointment (like being dismissed), you have every right to seek out a second opinion.  I know it's scary, but that's because the actions you're taking go against the very nature of EDs. It thrives on secrecy and now it feels threatened, it's that which makes us question if we should reach out for help. The answer is always yes, regardless of the duration and intensity of the illness.  You're so brave to be open with your mother and to take action against this disease. Try to distract yourself in a healthy way and when you feel yourself getting worked up, take a few moments to breathe. It'll all be alright in the end.",False,False
