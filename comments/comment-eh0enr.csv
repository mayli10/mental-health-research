Sometimes it helps me to remind myself that whatever I pick, I can try something else that I wanted the next day! If I want eggs and toast, for example, but feel anxious about having both, I can have eggs today and toast tomorrow. Sometimes I feel like it's a much bigger decision than it needs to be, but I know I'll eat again at some point so it's not the last chance I'll have for that food.  This is just what works for me, though, and I'm so sorry you're stressing about it. I hope you can find a solution that works for you!",False,False
