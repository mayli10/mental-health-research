The idea is that when I am in an emotional crisis where I'm spiralling I have to learn to just sit with the pain. It helps when I'm having negative intrusive thoughts that are completely taking over.   https://www.getselfhelp.co.uk/distresstolerance.htm  That website gives a basic overview and I'm sure there a lot of better resources on the Internet.,False,False
