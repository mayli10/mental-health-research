It's even more unattainable than ever, and a quick look over at a certain subreddit shows that those influencers don't even look like the body they're promoting to others.",False,False

I don't eat much these days but nobody really bats an eye because I'm ""naturally tiny"".  little do they know, I purge and starve and its becoming such an issue that when I eat a couple of bites of anything, I get too full. Which sucks bc every now and then i do wanna eat care free. My acid reflux is so bad, which makes it worse. I'm always weak. This ain't it. I know plenty of skinny girls that starve all day too. But we never say the obvious... But, people notice my ""bigger"" coworker and when she misses a meal . its honestly so bizarre to me.",False,False

It seems like you are never enough and your body is a life-long work in progress. On the other end of the spectrum I see more pressure to gain weight if you are considered too skinny. I see nothing wrong with most who desperately wanna gain. It makes me sad that female beauty is so intertwined with sexual validation these days.",False,False

I would have lost my ED mind.   In reality they should attend group or post up on reddit but money insulates them from the reality of balancing home, work and relationships with an ED.   Plus the fact they avoid the self-doubt and are validated I guess to a certain point by follows, comments &amp; views.  Look at all the celebrities and models who clearly had ED's and abuse issues (no judgement) and had long performing careers before they attended treatment or unfortunately prematurely left us.  ED takes its toll, to what extent depends on your position on the social spectrum. Not in all cases I understand but in a large number though.",False,False
