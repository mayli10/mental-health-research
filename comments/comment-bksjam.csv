Stay strong. 💜💜💜  Often you can gauge how false a comment is by the meanness of it. The meaner the delivery the more you can bet it’s about the other person needing to tell you absolutely ANYTHING to make themselves feel better at the moment because something is floating around in their head making THEM feel like shit. People say all the time “it’s because the other person is insecure” IT’S TRUE. Block her comments out if you can. Don’t absorb lies if you can protect yourself. Wrap yourself in a warm blanket of truth. I’m sorry that was said to you at all. ♥️♥️♥️♥️,False,False
