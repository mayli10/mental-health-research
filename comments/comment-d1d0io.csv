I got an x-ray and it showed that that part of my spine is a bit straighter than it's supposed to be, so I had to get physical therapy for it. Some things that help are strengthening the muscles there and it's also good to regularly stretch it with the cat and camel stretch.  I'm currently suffering this and it sucks",False,False

A bone spur is one of the most common issues with pain right at the base of the tailbone. A fracture or a dislocation could also be a possibility. You could have two of these.   Slight angulation is also a possibility. The muscles that hold you coccyx in place could be pulling your coccyx to one side.   Some people have issues with their coccyx but feel no pain. But others do feel pain. It's possible you had an issue prior and due to your WL, your inflammation went up, you padding went down and an existing injury is now triggered.   Good luck!   Get an x ray first and then a MRI. Join a coccyx group. I am part of a support group. Read Dr. Pateick Foyes book Tailbone Relif now.   Unless your tests come back with an obvious problem, you wont be taken seriously. Ask for second opinions. Just because they say there is not a problem doesn't always mean there isn't a problem.   Good luck!",False,False

Mine is also biased towards one side (the right), which I'm pretty sure is due to some unconscious posture thing that I can't hope to fix. If I were you, I'd assume this comes down to a combination of low body fat and posture issues (the latter of which are a problem for almost all adults in developed countries, so don't feel bad or anything).   But yeah, I flat-out can't do yoga that involves sitting poses, nor can I bear meditating in traditional positions. Being the driver on road trips is challenging due to my inability to shift around, and I only book aisle seats on flights so that I can walk around.   It's of course possible you have a curved coccyx/pinched nerve/etc...but if we're going by Occam's razor, I guarantee your body fat is just too low to make sitting comfortable.",False,False

Also: calluses that would form along my back where my spine rubbed against the backs of chairs. Now Iâ€™m in my 30s and at a higher weight and although the butt pain is gone, Iâ€™m dealing with lots of other fallout from trashing my joints and posture from over a decade of restriction-induced muscle loss.

I remember avoiding going to class because sitting for an hour was painful af. I think it may have been caused by the loss of fat around the tailbone without putting on any muscle around that area, because it went away as soon as I gained ~10 lbs. Either way, it's good that you're getting it looked at - back issues are not something to be messed with",False,False
