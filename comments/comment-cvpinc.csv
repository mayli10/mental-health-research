My diagnosis was a big wake-up call for me. Even without a formal diagnosis, you are hurting and that is definitely real. You deserve to not be in pain. So many people feel their ED isn't ""real"" if it's not stereotypical anorexia. But it is absolutely real. I have seen so many people who weren't the skinny white girl stereotypical who were sick, sicker than me, and they needed help just as much. Please take care of yourself as best you can and see someone who can at least help with harm reduction. Eating disorders of any type are absolutely deadly if left unchecked.",False,False

Not every ED is anorexia nervosa.  It sounds like you're really struggling, and I just want to urge you to please be as careful as you can. Purging is much more dangerous than the media shows and it's a good idea to look at some harm reduction techniques if you can't stop doing it. Your disorder is valid and you deserve to be healthy and safe. I hope you can be ❤️",False,False
