I make $10.75/hr since I work with a lot of specialized equipment (and most other jobs on campus pay $7.50-8.50, so by that standard... i'm living large)   I pay pretty much nothing in gas since I walk a mile up to school, I split a shoebox apartment with 2 people, and I obsessively budget grocery bills and meal prep so I only eat out once every two weeks or so (and usually it's just $2/3 worth of taco bell). And I make recipes that make ""3 servings"" last a week and a half (thank u ED). Since moving out I've actually SAVED money. I grew up single parent dirt poor so my financial aid cover all my school expenses, and so my academic scholarship just geta directly deposited into my bank acct twice a year.   The issue? 0 cal drinks. I grab a black coffee going into work when I open. Grab a diet tea after I go the gym to have with me in class. Start falling asleep doing homework at night so I drive to the convenience store and buy a huge coke zero. My roommate wants to get food at 2:00am that night but I just say I'm not hungry and get a pepsi max. That's like $8 a day. And I can do that for like three weeks straight eithout realizing.
