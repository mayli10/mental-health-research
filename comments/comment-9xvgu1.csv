Not everyone relapses, but relapsing doesn't mean you failed. That's a lesson to take. At least you know it was a bad decision.   The only advice I can give here is that if you feel A LOT of pain, as you described, it's always better to have an ambulance come. You could have blood slipping out of your digestive system or even a perforation. Better safe than sorry and the medical staff can help even just over the phone. Passing out from pain/exhaustion is definitely a warning sign, and shouldn't be ignored.  ",False,False

From someone who was there briefly. *i do not encourage this if youâ€™ve never abuse lax only if youâ€™re trying to get yourself off and away from them* The downside of laxative they just ream your insides for like 24+ hours insane cramps and pain. Possibility of pooping yourself awful none sense and dependency on them for regularity also the calories of the food has already been absorbed. Pros in the mind of those abusing and why they become addictive weight loss from removed waste water weight gone and finally able to poo plus that empty feeling we all crave.  Buy an enema bag and when you feel like taking laxatives do an enema instead. Youâ€™ll remove waste and allow your system to feel clean and itâ€™s all within an hour after that no threat of poops itâ€™s not chemically addictive and you still lose the waste weight. Itâ€™s gross and can disrupt the good bacteria so eat yogurt after but letâ€™s face it weâ€™ve done grosser stuff and in my research this is safer and a good way to get yourself better slowly. Cold turkey is uncomfortable and a lot of the time leads to relapse. I hope this helps and please please be kind to yourself. Drink lots of water today. Stay safe. ,False,False

You went a significant amount of time without laxatives!!! Thatâ€™s amazing!!! Is that something you could have done before!?! Did you even know how much strength you had!!!??
