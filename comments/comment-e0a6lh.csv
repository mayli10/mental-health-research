You ate half of what it takes to keep a baby alive in a day. The poster who said your brain uses 500 calories a day is a little misinformed; your brain uses 20% of your energy intake so for a person eating a normal diet, that would be between 300-500 calories a day. Today you only gave your brain 100 calories. The lack of energy your brain is getting is a huge reason you are stuck in this mindset. Your brain is starved and you cannot think properly. Please get some help. This post is very troubling.",False,False

I was just reading that 500 is the minimum your brain needs to fully function so you're definitely doing yourself a great service today by giving your brain some much needed fuel!! I know it seems excessive but trust me overall your still going to be negative at the end of the day bc each one of those cals is going to be used for body function, not turned into weight :)",False,False
