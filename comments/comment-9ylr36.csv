I had a headache (a brutal, relentless, constant headache) for about six days, and then it was gone, completely done. I like having a hot cup of something though, the ritual of it was almost the most important thing for me, so I replaced coffee with hot lemon water. The headaches suck, but they won't kill ya. Good luck.",False,False

I don’t recommend doing this more than 1-2 days because you don’t want to form a habit but taking an excedrin migraine or other pain reliever with caffeine is a lot more effective for me than one without caffeine for a withdrawal headache if you do get one. (For obvious reasons)  I’m also trying to cut it out I hope someone has advice lol. ",False,False
