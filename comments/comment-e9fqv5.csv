It’s a real challenge to redirect the brain onto more helpful and compassionate lines of thought. (For me it gets harder when hungry and/or tired, so a double whammy)   Sometimes it helps me to remind myself that sleep will actually improve my overall efficiency. I’ll have more energy, think more clearly, and actually do *more* because my brain and body have done the critical repair work that happens during sleep. Getting decent sleep is never a waste of time - it’s genuinely essential!",False,False

Please let yourself sleep. Doesn’t matter if you’re sleeping or not, not eating is fasting. Don’t add sleep deprivation to your plate.",False,False
