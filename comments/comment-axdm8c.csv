I have been diagnosed with AN first, then with Bulimia, and also with Major Depression, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Social Anxiety, OCD etc., so you could say that I am a total fucking mess in any case, but let me tell you that I was never a bigger fucking mess than when I was addicted to laxatives.    That was really the absolute lowest point of my life.    I was anorexic and my body was shutting down with organ damage, loss of my period and all that jazz, and I eventually reached a point where I thought I had to go into recovery if I didn't want to die. The problem was that after restricting for so long, I couldn't just slowly increase my calorie intake. The first bite of bread, pasta, rice etc. after months and months of starving triggered the worst carb cravings I ever had in my life and I started bingeing uncontrollably for several weeks and just literally couldn't stop shoveling food into my mouth.   I turned to laxatives to make up for the damage, believing they would prevent me from putting on weight. They didn't. The weight kept piling on steadily. The problem is that laxatives will you make feel better temporarily. You feel cleansed and empty and might even appear skinnier because of the massive loss of water. However, laxatives will simply not effectively prevent your body from absorbing calories.   I quickly became addicted to Dulcolax, both psychologically and physically and I basically spent my days alternating between bingeing, running to the toilet with terrible diarrhea and lying on the couch with excruciating belly pain. I was so disgusted with myself and ashamed. I showered obsessively because I thought my whole apartment, my clothes and my body must all smell like shit. It was so humiliating. And as I said, it wasn't even worth it, because laxatives don't stop weight gain.  It took a serious intervention from my psychiatrist and a step by step withdrawal plan to wean me off from laxatives. I swore to myself that I would NEVER touch that stuff again. ",False,False

I have gone over a week without a BM when trying to stop using laxatives. You could try instead using a psyllium husk supplement (at proper dose) for fiber, and if you're still having issues after that, something like Miralax may be gentle enough to help. But keep in mind that this is all dependent on what you're eating.",False,False

They can be pretty harsh. In the US we have miralax. It’s gentler on your system and doesn’t have as many side effects. It’s also safer to use more frequently.   A quick google search says that it is sold in the Uk under the name movicol. See if that helps give you some relief. ,False,False
