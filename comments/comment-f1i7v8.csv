You have no right saying anything against anyone who is on this forum you could end someone's life doing that  the souls here are fragile enough with out help from outside their own selves and if your on here you should know that so how dare you !! I hope others on here are kinder to you than you are to other so much so that it changes your heart from cold and empty to warm and full so you never make that mistake and have the weight of someone elses life on your shoulders  And to you OP   Live life the way that makes you *happy*   Dont compare yourself to others   Because you are an individual you are yourself and no one else can be you but you and no one can live your life but you so make it one that you love to live instead of one that makes you dread getting out of bed,False,False

I got called a wannarexic and a voyeur earlier by someone who’s bigger in this community than me and now I’m struggling even harder. I had another breakdown over whether I have an ED at all after seeing their message and it’s still affecting my now. I know I must be ill as I restrict but maybe that person is right and I’m just as awful of a person as my imposter syndrome tells me I am... for some reason though whenever I start thinking they're right I start crying and I feel like I’m lying to myself but if they think I don’t have an ED (while they properly do) then surely I don’t, right?  By “that chick”, do you mean the person who made the post I linked? Because that was me... sorry if that makes you worry as it made several other people feel that way...",False,True
