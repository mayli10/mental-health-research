Because we have very similar looking shorts, sometimes when I‚Äôm sorting laundry I‚Äôll accidentally confuse my 4 year old son‚Äôs shorts with mine (tbf he‚Äôs a big 4 year old lol) and then I‚Äôll wonder how the hell my shorts look so tiny (I‚Äôm a size 00-0). It‚Äôs strange how it‚Äôll look so small in the moment but look significantly larger once I hold it up to my body or try it on.   This also happened recently when my son was playing with my belt and had it secured on the smallest belt loop‚Äî it was just sitting on the floor buckled up and I noticed how tiny of a circle it was and couldn‚Äôt believe thats how small my waist is. So I tried the belt on again and, surprise surprise, it no longer seemed so tiny anymore.",False,False
