They take longer to eat and feel more substantial than fiber one and some of the other ‚Äúthin‚Äù protein bars. I think they‚Äôre an acquired taste tho  My fav is the quest hero blueberry cobbler,False,False

They‚Äôre so chewy, and they give my mouth a workout if I put them in the freezer. The mouthfeel, rather than taste, make them worth it to me.",False,False

I don‚Äôt think they have as much protein and probably have a little bit more sugar, but they‚Äôre pretty good!",False,False

Stopped eating them. Then got on the ONE train. Those are so much better and pretty similar nutrition wise. Higher cal I think? But I use it as a meal replacement.  The power crunch bars are delish too. They have a wafer cookie-ish texture.  I also like the pure protein bars too. They come in huge boxes of 12 too.   Life is too short for bad protein bars.,False,False

Apparently they're good for fibre and keeping you fill cause they expand in your stomach. I've heard as well it helps with bowel movement,False,False

Plus, they achieve the low net carbs by sweetening with sugar alcohols, and those sometimes upset my stomach in an ‚Äúoh god is this appendicitis‚Äù kinda way.",False,False

I used to choke those down for the protein but I won‚Äôt eat them anymore because they are too gross and don‚Äôt taste like food. The cereal bars were ok but they stopped making them of course.. üò§,False,False
