Thanks for being so specific, that's super helpful!",False,True

In a proper physical I’ve had all vitals done (blood pressure and heart rate lying down and standing, oxygen saturation, respiration rate and temperature), plus patellar reflexes and a squat/sit up test, blood tests and an ECG. You might be able to disguise your weight with water loading but you won’t be able to disguise any other signs of deterioration. It’s best to be honest.   Unless you’re at huge risk you’re vvvvv unlikely to be sent to hospital or made to miss school without being given chances to improve on your own.  Best of luck!",False,False
