I haven't showered in like a week because of depression and ya know, catatonia, and I'm just about to go into a welfare assessment meeting with dirty hair, probably smelling bad, in homeless bum clothes, looking like a pale, fat bloated fuck who hasn't slept in 5 days. The outcome of the meeting determines if I'm likely to be homeless by the end of the month, so I have to say the right things to get help, but unfortunately my selective mutism is kicking my ass recently so this is going to be really fucking bad.      It's humiliating having people see me at rock bottom. At least I'm not drunk, I guess.",False,False
