As for the ballerina tea‚Äî it‚Äôs in a green box called 3 Ballerina Tea, and it‚Äôs basically just a tea bag of a combination of senna and Chinese mallow, so it has a laxative effect but doesn‚Äôt do the same harm as otc laxatives, which is why I use it for constipation. There‚Äôs a grocery store near my house that sells it, but I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs hard to find for most people. You can get it online for $4-7 a box though!",False,False
