It’s just difficult to tell them anything even though they tell me time and time again that I can, because I don’t want to seem weak I guess? idk",False,True

But props to you for posting this, getting it off your chest. I hope you felt better after ranting. When you feel like talking, you can always message me.   The first thing I noticed while reading this post: Seems like you have some social life going on which is a great part of your life. I really hope you can enjoy some of those events without overthinking everything, without panicking and just be you around the people who care about you.     But keep in mind: you can message me whenever you want or need to.",False,False
