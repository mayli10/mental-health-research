Easier said than done but I wasn’t happy in my last job and questioned myself constantly that I was just complaining but switching jobs has made me soooo much happier. It changes everything around u. Theres many toxic work environments. Just like ud dump a toxic bf. Firstly u need to get away from that triggering ass shitty co worker, at the least. And a place where the bathroom is PRIVATE. Also a perk of my new job. My last job had the worst bathrooms.",False,False

I work in the office of a school, so I get parents, teachers and even the children constantly asking me why I never eat.   I'm the youngest person who works here by far, I'm 19 and the next youngest girl is one of the classroom support girls who's like 25.   one of the other women in the office (probably my best friend here) is 26 and bulimic, she knows I have an eating disorder too, we share a private office and everyday after lunch consist of 20 minutes of her purging at her desk which I don't mind but she binge eats like nothing else and when she's having a bad day she will try and coerce me to eat with her, those days are hard.   we have a chef on site who makes the children lunches, and EVERY FUCKING DAY she tries to bring me a plate of food and every fucking day we have the same argument about her feeling offended that I don't eat her food.   they all know I don't eat during the day, I tell them I do intermittent fasting, some of my colleagues are respectful or will poke light fun which I'll laugh with them at, but others are straight up nasty. obvious who's jealous of me being a size 0.",False,False

This is not gonna work in the long run. Maybe you hate it so much that you sabotage it by browsing reddit instead of working on the overload of work?
