Not even if they do it first.   I've had patients make comments about their weight and say things like ""I'm just so fat"" or ""sorry you have to try and lift my fat ass to the chair"" and I always just respond with ""its my pleasure to take care of you"" or ""you are beautiful"".   Sometimes they comment on my weight and tell me I'm just a tiny little thing and so skinny. They don't know the hell I went through with cancer and I usually just completely tune those comments out and change the subject.   As a patient (who's ED was secondary to chemotherapy), I hate listening to the low level staff at the doctors office comment on my weight. One MA told me I lost too much weight after I literally had 30 lbs of dangerous fluid retention diuresed off of me through a hospitalization. Then that same MA told me congrats on gaining weight when I was 1 lb heavier at my appointment, and yet 40 lbs lighter than when she made my weight loss comment.  I. Cannot. Stand. Her.

Just cause someone works in a hospital doesn't mean they're not whack lol - I am always grateful for every genuinely caring nurse I encounter at this point.",False,False

Did she even go to school?? She of all people should know about the link between EDs and gastroparesis, not to mention the fact that gastroparesis itself can contribute to weight loss due to the discomfort associated with eating. I'm sorry one of your care team was so unprofessional and offensive. If I were you, I would ask the Dr.'s office to put a note in my chart that I don't want to be cared for by that particular nurse again in the future.",False,False
