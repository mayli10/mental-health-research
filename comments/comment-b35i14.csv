I’m a college student who pays my own bills so that is a nice effect of that ahaha xD! Anyways, I’m glad you could share this with me as I will have to go ahead and ask my parents to put me on health insurance so I can get actually treated for asthma (and also obviously at least start vaping Mary J as opposed to smoking) and stopping nicotine use. God breathing is so good.",False,False

You might be able to tell by having a blood test at your doctor and seeing how your liver enzymes are? One of mine was about 100 above normal in range.
