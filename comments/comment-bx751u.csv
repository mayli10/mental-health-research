I had been fasting and felt dead inside but had a date that night.  Decided to actually eat a decent amount (1500 calories) and I was excited and happy again!  And had the energy and mental sharpness I needed for the date and we hit it off.  Food is okay sometimes I guess :),False,False

Eating more and eating at regular intervals really does have pretty dramatic results.    &amp;#x200B;  If you're wanting to gain weight but you're afraid it'll happen too quickly, that won't happen with an extra 500.  I know what it's like to go over what I let myself have (correction, what the disorder lets me have) and I step on the scale expecting to have gained 14lbs in a few days.  No.  That doesn't happen.  &amp;#x200B;  I loved to read this.  Even though a few months ago I was adamant I was only going to maintain, the fact I'm feeling better mentally eating more has made me say I'm trying to recover.  I get you about the hair.  Mine's gone from being oily all my life to a brittle mess.  It knocks your confidence and deep conditioning can't help when it's nutrition that's poor.  &amp;#x200B;  Well done, you.  Keep at it.  Remember how good you felt today on bad days.  It's worth it and so are you X",False,False

I think it would be a good idea to increase your intake for this purpose. Also, an increased intake won't necessarily mean that you will definitely start binging more.  Good luck &lt;3",False,False
