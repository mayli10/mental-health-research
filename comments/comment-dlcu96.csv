Nothing is worse than disappointing food with this illness. I mean after weight gain that is. I really do feel your pain. I didn't eat all day because I gained weight but finally caved this evening for sushi and it was the most mediocre shit I've had all week including the basic ass food I make for myself every day. Can't believe I paid over 20 bucks for that shit.,False,False
