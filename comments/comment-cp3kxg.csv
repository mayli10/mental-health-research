I assume that between her getting closer with Ruth and her new bf and having her baby close with her (the purging was triggered by jealousy of the new stepmom) mixed in with a little time = recovery.,False,False

I guess the reason why I didn’t like it was cause it was too realistic LOL which I realise is ridiculous and ironic",False,True

And Ruth, who has been her friend for years, noticed when she skipped meals. Obviously Debbie is someone who has struggled with an eating disorder in the past, and this was a relapse.   Relapses happen. My grandmother got caught purging just weeks before she died.   I, for one, am glad for the realistic representation of a adult ED. Maybe you noticed she also tried to exercise purge, but was caught by an older woman who talked her through it. Solidarity is key to sustained recovery.",False,False
