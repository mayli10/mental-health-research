Just complete disgust.... and of course that followed with a disgust at the idea of being overweight. There are many many factors that played into developing an ed but that weird disgust with myself for eating too much is probably the oldest. I’m not sure where it came from either. But I feel it now, and the opposite, that eating little enough and losing enough weight will turn me into a fucking martyred medieval saint or something. I don’t know. I feel like it will make me a good person and god sometimes I feel like a really really bad person.",False,False

I haven't been diagnosed or talked about my relationship with food to anyone, but I'm a psych major as well. I plan on doing grad school and I have to research professor interests to find the correct school to go to. The ones focused on EDs are always so inane. They focus on stuff like ""what causes people to be overweight,"" ""do people really know the risks of being under/overweight,"" ""what causes eating disorders,"" and similarly basic questions.   Whenever I read that these are their focuses, I'm absolutely baffled. They really have no idea what eating disorders are like and they're trying to apply their own thoughts about food to people with EDs rather than asking people with EDs what they think. It's so aggravating. None of them have a clue.   The more I'm on this subreddit, the more I learn just how shit the DSM is for defining EDs and how shit the treatment methods are. As someone who is also in this field, I cannot tell you how much it frustrates me. ",False,False

I have always felt my body was wrong since I was very young. I definitely had disordered behavior as a kid but it got really bad around 14. It took me many years to admit I had an ED because I've always fulfilled my school/work/social obligations no matter how bad my mental health was at the time because I'm really good at white knuckling through things. I also definitely have symptoms of OCD (though mild) and have always wondered if that was connected to my ED.,False,False

I know people say ""I'm.more than my disorder"", and they're right, but I literally am disordered. I don't have it, like something I can let go of. it's just a part of my brain isn't right and it won't ever be fixed, all I can do is chose to ignore it for awhile if I want. ive only tried two therapists but neither have been helpful or understood that, they just wanna go with their script as per usual.",False,False

So, in part it's that,  but another part is that being a hypocrite is not acceptable to me. I do everything i can to avoid being one, and i know I'm judgemental of other people's weight (because i am judgemental of my own). This sets me up for a massive fear of becoming obviously underweight, or overweight. If I'm either of those, I'll have allowed myself to become a hypocrite. I try really hard to not be judgmental about weight anymore but it's something my parents and brothers really push (even though none of them should talk).  I don't fit under any clinical diagnosis and no therapist or doctor has ever heard me out about it because they just dump it under generalized anxiety disorder.   I don't purge, i deny. If i feel like i eat too much, i exercise until it hurts and/or deny myself even more. No one cares though because i look healthy, so do i even really have an eating problem? Maybe not. Maybe it's just a response/symptom of my body dysmorphic disorder, which i don't fit into really either. ",False,False

The ladies I met in inpatient tended to fall into a couple of categories: people who felt they deserved to be in pain, people who wanted to disappear, people who wanted attention, and people who wanted control.     I also feel the need for obsessive organization in order to calm thoughts that I am a failure. I think that this manifested in an ED because of the synergy between that need for control and ritual with my poor body image and gender identity issues. I think if I had been born AMAB I may not have had an ED, I may have had another form of compulsion, but obviously hypotheticals are just that.    I call myself an orthorexic because it's almost optimistic for me; I have never been fully recovered in the sense that I adopted intuitive eating or came to accept my body or any of the stuff therapists have promised me comes with recovery. I was weight restored and eating multiple times a day, but I replaced obsessive calorie tracking with obsessive grocery shopping list writing, meal planning, tracking vitamins, researching nutrition, and making sure my dinners always went meat, vegetarian, fish, vegetarian, repeat. I just adopted a new soothing behavior.",False,False

But basically the only medical interactions I’ve had about my eating disorder is mentioning to my therapist at 15 that I hadn’t been eating but she brushed it off (probably because I was really depressed and maybe just though it was loss of appetite). And two years ago I had mentioned to my pcp that I purge and we didn’t go into it that much (idk why).  With that prefixed, I just wanted to say that I don’t think any official diagnosis “get” the people assigned to them properly.  I could be wrong but to me the text book definitions have always seemed more like a “these are the things that people with this condition MAY experience but they may not experience all of these things and it can be experienced differently”. To me the DSM is more of a guide than a dictionary.  Everybody’s human experience is different but we group people who experience certain distressing traits that may benefit from similar treatment or care into groups to help us help them.  I was around a few adults in my teen years that worked in the field of psychology and I took an interest and talked to them about it a lot that’s where I learned to think about it in this way.  Basically I don’t think the DSM definitions of things perfectly fit very many people but are rather a guide.  Not all professionals think about it this way but some do and I find they are really good at their job when they do. If your working in psychology I think it’s extremely important to treat the patient rather than the disorder.",False,False

If I could just snap my fingers and be a normal BMI again, I honestly would. I looked so good at a BMI of 18-19, now at a BMI of 16 I just look sick.  It's almost like reverse fat acceptance, I logically know that losing more weight from here does not make me more accepted or better looking like it used to, but I just can't stop the chain of behaviors that lead to me losing weight. So I fool myself into thinking that it's somehow a good thing. ",False,False
