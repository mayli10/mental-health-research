I was looking at my logs and all i see is the numbers going down each month. -2lbs one month, -3 lbs the next month, -4 lbs the next month until i was like 94lbs.   i kept that weight for a month but then slowly started to gain. ALL BECAUSE I WAKE UP SEVERAL TIMES A NIGHT TO EAT. So like since August ive been waking up at night to eat.  im currently 105, i was 103 yesterday but i ate a bunch of tortilla chips last night at 3am. I have no idea have to stop this. Ive been trying to eat around 100g of protein ever day and eating 1000 cals a day.   i mostly binge on carbs at night. The most horrifying thing is i just donâ€™t really care at night. Maybe because in half asleep.  if you do find a solution to this problem PLEASE lmk because i just want to be back at my low weight.",False,False

I experienced this all through the weekend until yesterday basically and thought I was going crazy. It comes in cycles and you can definitely feel it coming but when it hits, no amount of self-talk, appetite suppressant or triggering thinspo can do anything. It's horrible. I believe it has something to do with your body fat % dropping too suddenly.  It's ruined it BIG TIME for me in the past but somehow this time around, my body only needed a few days eating at maintenance.",False,False
