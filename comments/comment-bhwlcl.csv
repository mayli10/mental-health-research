I travel the tuna in a separate container, usually something resealable like a little jar in case I don't want to eat it all right away.  Usually I just do plain tuna. Sometimes add any combo of Greek yogurt, salt/pepper/spices, lemon juice... Sometimes I go crazy and get the flavoured ones. Some of them have reasonable ingredients/macros/cals but read the labels carefully!  Sometimes the veg is just sliced cucumber/zucchini/celery/radish that can serve as ""crackers"" to dip in the tuna. Sometimes leafy greens (I LOVE arugula) and the tuna becomes like a salad topping.  Re: dip/dressing... I like 2% Greek yogurt (many prefer 0%, you might like that better too) with spices or lemon, or a tsp or two of olive oil with some nice vinegar or lemon juice.  Sometimes I sub plain grilled chicken or shrimp for the tuna. Those be my safe proteins :) all of which are still pleasant to eat cold.  Hope that helps!",False,False

I like 2% Greek yogurt to get me them fat soluble vitamins (also it's yummy), but YMMV that's very much a personal thing.   I don't do bread products. Sliced cucumber is better as crackers. Radish is good too because it won't go all floppy in your lunch box.",False,False

If you're really adamant about avoiding carbs you can look up how to fold a couple layers of lettuce into a sort of wrap. I used to do that a lot and it was delicious, albeit a little messy. Pro tip: you can use non-fat, sugar-free plain Greek yogurt instead of mayo for a pretty good tuna salad sandwich.",False,False

All day every day:)  Add dressing or dip of some sort if you want a little more fat for satiety. Maybe an egg if you're feeling adventurous.,False,False
