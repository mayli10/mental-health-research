Is he disrespectful in other ways as well?",False,False

Tbfh I would freak out if something similar happened to me because I’d be afraid that I wasn’t “good enough”. However, I think in your case it’s the opposite... he loves you so much that he wants to share his life with you and I guess the gym (whatevs I’m personally not a big fan) is a big part of that.",False,False

He goes to the gym like daily basically and I guess that’s what he wanted. I’m definitely going to suggest some activities I enjoy that are body beneficial like that.,False,True

I’m the same, I’m “recovered” but still struggling. On the flip side, I try to make my boyfriend go bicycling or climbing with me (he’s really lazy lol) not because I want him to lose weight (he’s perfect to me) but because I like to do those things with him. Maybe your boyfriend is the same?",False,False

I felt like the comment he made was relatively innocent until you wrote that he said  &gt;I’ve always wanted to be with a little gym rat  That’s so unnecessary. I feel like the comparison is what’s hurtful. You shouldn’t date your partner with the intention of changing them.",False,False

My SO had a close relative commit suicide by firearm, and I still just canNOT remember to stop saying “just shoot me in the face” every. fucking. time. I am annoyed by something.   He has it in his mind you’re “recovered.” He isn’t thinking about your history. Maybe suggest a compromise of jogging outdoors at a park? Riding bikes together? Rock climbing? Any one of a hundred different physical hobbies that could replace The Gym with a more organic way to move your body? I also fucking hate the gym, so I do other physical shit I’m the actual outdoors and it’s wonderful. You have options. Also, I see you and I love you ❤️",False,False

I'm sure he didn't mean it like that, but I can completely see how you'd take it as him wanting to change you. He ought to be more mindful of the topic, really.",False,False
