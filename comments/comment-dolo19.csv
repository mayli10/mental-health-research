Unless he is talking about function and not aesthetics (my husband makes reference to my body’s sensitivities like bruising easily, weird periods, food allergies) but not how I look.   I don’t think it’s ok, and your feelings are valid",False,False

My bf knows about my eds in the past, and while I consider myself mostly recovered, there are some things he’ll off handedly say that still trigger a huge breakdown and relapse in thinking. It’s taken some time but being able to in the moment of the comment say “hey that’s upsetting/triggering/a dick thing to say” really has helped us realize what is and isn’t okay with being said.",False,False

Like, if they said the wrong thing, or miscommunicated, then ultimately that's *their* mistake, not yours. My bf has also said things in the past about my eating habits and even when he clarifies or I just know him well enough to know that's not what he meant they still cut really, really deep.  Also, that's objectively a weird comment for him to have made. I don't think you're being unreasonable. It'll sting for a while and he just has to understand that's the consequence of him messing up.",False,False

Tell him that if he ever wants to see your body again, he needs to curb those shitty comments. Whether he is meaning to be unkind or not, even children know better than to say crap like that.",False,False

I think if you ask anyone on this thread they'll probably agree. When I lost a bunch of weight my bf makes fun of my flat ass and no tits, so I almost always leave a skirt and shirt on during sex now, unless if he has already taken out his contacts and the lights are out, then I feel more comfortable being naked.   It's the worst to feel uncomfortable around someone who you're supposed to be the most comfortable with, and with this illness deciphering rationality when it comes to emotions is difficult, and personally I make that clear to my boyfriend, without it letting it get to the point where he cab invalidate my feelings.  Just talk to him about it but be strong and mature so he will truly listen to you and not dismiss you for ""being emotional"".",False,False

And that you have every right to be upset. I'm sure your body isn't weird, and I hope you can see that yourself soon.",False,False
