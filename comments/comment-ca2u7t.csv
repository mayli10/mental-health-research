Sometimes multiple times a day to multiple grocery stores just to stare at food, read macros, and fantasize about everything I want to eat.  I only buy stuff like twice a week though",False,False

I take the basket and walk around the store for hours collecting ingredients for meals I want to cook in next few days and when I'm done, usually one intense powerlifting session later, I look down at all the food, realize there's no way I'd eat that and walk around the store again to return all the things back to where they belong and end up leaving with a pack of tomatoes and two low fat greek yogurts. I have been doing this for a few years at the same store and I wonder if anyone has already noticed",False,False

I‚Äôve been in kind of a weird situation though for...Jesus, about a year now. A combination of increasingly bad anxiety plus a lot of travelling means I haven‚Äôt spent much time grocery shopping at all. I haven‚Äôt been home for probably six months out of the last year, and when I have been home I‚Äôve been too anxious to go to the store so I just get everything delivered. I haven‚Äôt actually been to my local store since last summer.  There are two grocery stores near where I‚Äôve started working though, and I pop in about 2-3 times a week. I‚Äôve discovered a whole lot of new foods lately and it‚Äôs nice to finally be able to actually see what‚Äôs available again!",False,False

I was restricting quite severely, but somehow being surrounded by food was therapeutic to me. I would observe and analyse people's shopping, try and guess what they were making or details about them based on their purchases. It was also fun trying to pick out patterns, for example only older ladies would buy swedes, and older men would buy all bran. and I also LOVED when a fat person would come to my checkout and buy tonnes of junk food and non-diet (shock horror!) fizzy drinks. It satisfied me to see that their body matched their eating habits, because I believed that I was eating very healthily so hopefully I looked thin and healthy too.",False,False

My idea of a ‚Äútreat‚Äù for myself is going to the fancy whole-foods-esque supermarket 30 minutes away (and it‚Äôs 24/7, so I can go when it‚Äôs practically empty and just take my sweet time with only the employees to judge me!). I typically only buy my safe foods anyway, but I absolutely love walking up and down the aisles and looking at everything and fantasizing about what it would be like to buy, prepare and eat that food.  Someone once asked what my hobby was and I literally almost said ‚Äúgoing to [x grocery store] at 3am‚Äù because that‚Äôs how much I love it lmao",False,False
