He's not overweight and has a lot of natural muscle - an absolute dream to me - but he used to be chubby in middle school and weight is a genetic issue looking at both sides of his family which are predominantly overweight to obese. The point is: he is aware of body issues. He deals with his. Yet he still doesn't understand my ED. I don't think anyone - thin or not or in between - could truly relate to the disorder inherent in an ED that is not versed themselves with some form of one.  Ironically, I still get extremely triggered by him. When he wants to have a cheat snack with me, it could turn into an entire binge cycle for me if I'm not careful. And sometimes when it does go down a path like that he'll, without warning, be back on healthy mode and go to the gym and refuse to finish my binge leftovers. That makes it sooo hard for me to do anything at that point. I feel uncomfortable continuing to binge so my anxiety is up (along with my weight lol) and yet I also feel angry at him - for no rational reason at all - and going back to restricting is harder when it feels like a game of catch up.  Even though he's not a stick, I get the same worries about being on top. I actually very frequently don't have my top off during any kind of sex for this exact reason.  I guess what I'm saying is - hopefully without coming across to you that I'm invalidating your specific struggle because I in no way intend to do that - having an ED &amp; being with someone kinda sucks regardless. If you were longing for him to be bigger (not that you were), trust me...the struggles are still there just shaped (no pun intended) a bit differently.  As someone who has to reach a GW to do anything important (get a license, see a family member, go to the gym, wear shorts, etc....), I completely understand not wanting to see him until you lose a bit of weight. But I hope you do anyways because it's clear he loves you no matter what and maybe, if you explain your anxieties more specifically, his unconditional love, support, and acceptance might be just what you need right now.",False,False

We’re also doing long distance so it’s easy for me to hide my body from him, but I’m meeting him this october and I’m so fking scared. He also doesn’t understand why I’m so worried about food because.. well he’s never had any issues with it. Sometimes I’m really jealous of his body physique bc he has vvv little body fat. fuck.",False,False
