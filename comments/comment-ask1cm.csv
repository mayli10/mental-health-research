Maybe she wanted to confirm that you're skinny and it's not just her imagination. That doesn't make it ok but there's a possibility it wasn't malicious.  Your friend commenting on your weight is probably the same thing. She's probably concerned but doesn't know how to approach the subject.,False,False

It’s a matter of perspective and the fact that we’re all literally sick here babe. I think they’re just concerned about you, but don’t let that get you down. At the end of the day this is YOUR life and you can’t let other people dictate how you live it. Be safe love x",False,False

I mean if she was genuinely concerned she would be talking to you about the issue. Instead she’s seeking validation by putting you down. I’ve had girls do the same to be except I was obese back then. ,False,False

That's a reflection of her and her own nastiness and insecurities not you. That's not okay to take pictures without your consent and talk about you behind your back.
