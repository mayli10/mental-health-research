There is potential for you to still grow some however. I was in recovery from 20-22 and I grew two inches during that time. I think if you focus on nutrition there is potential for you to grow still.",False,False

And apparently a lot of back-and-forth on it.   From what I’m finding, most lean towards being underweight through teenaged years handicaps puberty through most if not all stages. They find having a certain body fat percentage is possibly necessary to kick puberty into gear in both males and females.   [one article that’s actually about males](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.researchgate.net/publication/265189620_The_underweight_adolescent/amp)  [not very detailed, but briefly covers things](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/25781529/)  [older and mostly about females, but mentions males a few times](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/4053451/)  So possibly, yes. Being underweight might have stunted your development a bit.   The human body sucks.  Edit: it might be possible to contact a doctor about some form of hormonal therapy to give you a boost, even later in life.",False,False
