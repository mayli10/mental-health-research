Do you  enjoy your job? maybe you can use it as a motivation whenever you feel like shit, knowing that you're good at something that not anyone could manage. I think that's one of the things I lack of (or at least that's what I've convinced myself) Thing is, i don't really have a dream job, i have basic knowledge on a lot of basic things but  always think that anybody could do it better than me. I started like three different carreers and only finished one of them but don't see it like a forever job. the other ones i don't know.. i feel like if i had just finished the first one instead of dropping off on year one my life would be so different and successful and better in every way (useless thought now, duh). My family has always been by my side on choosing what I want to do and that makes me feel awful cause 1. i know not everyone has that opportunity and feel like crap for  waisting it and 2. I'm such an ungrateful asshole and a disappointment for them... and the third career i just know I'll never be good enough as to live off of it... i don't know if that selfuselessness (if that's even a word) is what caused my ED on the first place or if this is all a consequence of it but I'm sure it's related somehow...  BUT good news is I'm getting help and have been purge free for a few months now and very proud of myself.. there are a few things i still have to work on and professional path is one of them and the one I'm more motivated towards.  this is the first time i talk about this with anyone other than my therapist and i guess I'm proud of that too! it's actually making me feel a bit better telling you about it, maybe it'll help you too to talk about your story?? I sure will be happy to read it :)",False,False
