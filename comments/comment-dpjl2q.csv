I'm sorry to be cynical, but asking questions with no good answer is kinda mean. I mean, he could either be honest with you and say he thinks you're out of his league, or put himself down and call himself uglier than you to make you feel better. You really put him in a cage with that one.",False,False

He’s an adult, not a middle schooler, and he knew it would make you feel insecure. I had an ex like this who would put me down and make me feel like I should be grateful just to be with him because he was “outta my league.” It turned out to be super abusive.",False,False

If I don't mean to break his face, but it breaks when I punch him, he's still injured even though I didn't ""mean"" to.   He's both an idiot and an asshole. If he thinks he is ""out of your league"" then let that little dude go and be with someone stupid enough to deal with him. YOU are out of HIS league, and he is not worth your time, emotional labour, or energy.",False,False

As soon as he realized what he had said, he apologized immediately. It’s just that his attempt at correcting his statement made it worse. He really is extremely ignorant about everything",False,True

I don't care if he's six years old - a boy should know not to say that.  He also sounds insecure as fuck because who says that except foe a guy who is scared that his gf is hotter than him?? And/or emotionally abusive and it's just gonna get worse from here.  Also what the fuck is a ""league"", especially to an 18 year old?",False,False
