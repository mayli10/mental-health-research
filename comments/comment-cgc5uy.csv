Some people literally don't know how to parent. My mother is emotionless for the most part. She also encouraged my eating disorders with both ridicule and praise. Praise for losing weight and ridicule when I couldn't. I actually think I might have some sort of issue with cortisol that contributed to my inability to lose weight after a certain point. Some parents are literally ignorant on the matters of wellbeing and they treat their kids like an object to live through. You are not alone on this. I'm 23 and she has not changed so I'm starting to distance myself from her. It's hard but if it comes to it and you get tired of the abuse, you can't be afraid to do it. I have been. I wanted a good relationship with my family but they clearly don't give enough of a shit. You have to do it for you. At the end of the day, *you* are there for yourself and there are plenty of good people in the world to be your friend and your family.",False,False
