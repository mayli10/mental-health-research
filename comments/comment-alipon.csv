My high school notebooks are covered in calorie and weight loss math. My class notes would have it in the margins. How much have I eaten today? How much more can I eat? What would the number be if I had this for dinner? If I had that for dinner? What will I weigh next week if I eat this much? Or that much? What BMI would I be that this weight? At that weight?  When I got bored with that, I'd make long lists of safe foods and unsafe foods. Then I'd cross out some safe foods, move them to the unsafe list, and rewrite the list.   But this was all before I had a smartphone. I could have waited until I got home to do it all online, but... eating disorder. So I memorized calorie counts and equations and did it all by hand, all day long. ",False,False

If I can’t work on losing weight because I’m in between ‘meals’ and I can’t exercise that’s the only way I can feel productive. Since I’m obsessed and super compulsive I feel like I’m still working on weight loss by visualizing my goals over and over again. ,False,False
