This is very helpful. Obviously it’s the day after my binge but this is good to know if it happens again (hopefully not lmao). I’ll just not weigh myself today to make myself feel better.",False,True

You will gain weight.  That is water, because pretzels and chips are hella salty. I sincerely doubt that even if you went in and 100% downed entire bags of each you will actually gain any body fat.  This is going to be counterintuitive: drink lots of water.  Yes, you will briefly bloat but it will help flush the excess sodium out of you and you can go back to your non-bloated self.  If you don’t flush that sodium out you’re going to bloat anyway and it will stick around until you finally get enough water in you to help dispose of all the excess.",False,False

Given I don't know how much of them you ate, they still probably won't put the weight on like white bread or anything super sugary would.",False,False

Just chug chug chug water especially because chips n pretzels have sm sodium you’ll be okay the uncomfiness and water weight and bloating will go away,False,False
