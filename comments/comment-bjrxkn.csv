If I could stop restricting I probably wouldn’t want to binge but I can’t. I know you’re trying to be helpful but most of us can’t just eat normally or take the healthiest approach to food. That’s why we come here. Again , I’m not trying to be confrontational! My suggestion is probably not helpful to a lot of people either. But telling someone to eat normally has literally never cured anyone of an eating disorder. I’m surrounded by advice like this in real life and it’s so frustrating when it pops up in the one place I can go to and not feel like a freak.",False,True

If you have a craving, try actually eating a serving of the food you're craving. My intuitive eating research is shining through right now, but I genuinely believe this is the healthiest approach to food.",False,False
