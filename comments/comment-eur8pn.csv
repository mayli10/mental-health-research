Your mom clearly cares about you, and even if you can't tell her whats going on she just wants to make sure she's doing the best she can. You're almost an adult and while it may seem like she's being controlling or pushy about food, she's just trying to show she cares.    Regardless of whether or not you ""need"" to gain weight, your body is still developing (and will be for several more years). With that your shape and proportions will change as your body develops (regardless of if your weight changes). I'm not trying to scare you or anything, I just wish someone had told me I'd go through a bunch of physical changes in my late teens and early 20s, maybe I wouldn't have as many issues as I do now lol. If you can, use her support and any other resources you have (school counselor, maybe friends if you've told them) to try to get better. This isn't something you want to keep dealing with, but I know you're aware of that and its so hard to try to work towards getting better. For what its worth, I wish I had taken advantage of resources I had when I was younger, or in college. I'm super proud of you for doing your best though, and you're always welcome to DM me if you need to chat or vent :)",False,False

I'm being forced to eat by my mother (she's trying to get to gain weight after noticing I'm borderline uw) and it's really freaking me out, especially because I need to pretend that I didn't have an ED to start off with and don't feel I really needed to gain weight. It's hard, and I just really need some hope to get me to pull through this. I'm trying to make the best out of a terrible situation and use it to get better but I'm *this* close to a panic attack...",False,True

And it takes a while, lots of work and lots of slip-ups, but I'm ok with eating a normal-ish amount of food. I know I need to fuel my body properly and even though I have a ton of disordered thoughts and food hangups, I'm slowly getting back to where I won't always panic if I have a day/week where I ""overeat,"" I don't feel the need to purge if I feel too full, and its ok to have unplanned things sometimes. Its hard, and Ive had so many slip-ups and still have a fuck ton of progress to make, but it can and does get better. You have to work for it, but I promise its work worth putting in.",False,False
