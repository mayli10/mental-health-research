They don’t live together. She claims to be hesitant because before they started dating (literally same week) she was going to go out with a guy she found very attractive, but she realized she wasn’t into him, and she didn’t want to date her bf right away because she didn’t find him attractive. And now she says she’s not sure about if this is the future she really wants. ",False,True

The hesitant about being with him part doesn't sound good. Do they live together?  I'd say if she needs an escape from him/everything, then you can provide that. Hope things get better for her!

He’s always there for her, he’s a friendly and accepting guys, and he genuinely cares for her. I don’t get any bad vibes from him, and I would like to believe that she would tell me if something bad happened as she has in the past. But when she’s around him you can tell she’s super anxious, she becomes more people pleasing and quiet. Which is so not like her. I’m not sure. Her anxiety was triggered because she was hesitant about being with him. Thanks for the suggestion, I’ll try to ask her to go out more. ",False,True

Don't give up on her. I know that being friends with someone in this state can be frustrating because it feels sometimes that you can't do anything to make them feel better or they don't listen to your advices. But I can assure you: if your friend knows that you'll support her, it will definitely give her courage to face the other demons she faces in her life.      I second the tip about meal replacement shakes, and I'd recommend a multivitamin too. Try to take her out of her house every time you can. She won't agree every time, but just keep on insisting. Doesn't have to be anything elaborate, a walk in the park will be enough to keep her spirits up.   &amp;#x200B;  You are a good friend, and I hope your friend can get better soon.",False,False

However, I havent found things to help when I'm that bad. So I cant really help with that, but she is doing everything she can and if she is working hard, things will start to get better. As for the weight loss, suggest that she gets some meal replacement drinks. It can help get calories and nutrients without upsetting the stomach.  I hope that helps. Keep being there for her, you're a good friend",False,False

Is her bf being abusive, controlling or something, or is something else going on in her personal life? Obviously she might not open up about it, but it's important to find out the cause of the anxiety/depression, and then trying to mitigate the situation I'd say.   E.g. If something at home is bad, try to get her out of the house, try to distract her from what's going on, maybe try and do some self-care together. Is there professional help she can get while she waits for a therapist (e.g. School counsellor?)   Make sure she knows she's not alone, you're there for her, that she can talk to you/speak to you any time, night or day. Even if it's not to talk, but just for her not to be alone.  ",False,False
