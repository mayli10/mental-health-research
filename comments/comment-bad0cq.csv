While you're out and can do whatever you want, wether that's binge starve or live your life to the fullest you have your life in your hands.  It's horrible putting it down like this but you get my point.",False,False

My friend's not inpatient currently but she's been before and she's clearly relapsing... I feel so ashamed when I stand next to her cause she's like half my size. I and my my other friends are worried for her health but I also kind of feel jealous?? I mean, I'm on a supervised meal plan and skipping meals is hard so I've put on a lot of extra weight which makes me hella insecure. Even tho my friends think she looks awful I'd still give anything to look the same...  I guess we should try to separate ourselves from their situation since in the end, they're sick and we should be hoping for their recovery and support them even if it's hurtful to us. All the best to you, take care of yourself and try not to compare too much ðŸ’›",False,False
