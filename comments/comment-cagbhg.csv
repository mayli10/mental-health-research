I lost touch with him but see him on insta sometimes and he looks very lively and healthy. You deserve as much support as anyone.  I feel you on the stigma, too. Mine is never taken seriously because I'm almost 27 and overweight and ""should be done with that bullshit"" as I've heard. Every woman around me is having kids, raising up in their jobs, joking about love handles and eating ""bad"" snacks. I take speed and binge and restrict and worry about my one meal a day constantly. But I will never have a healthy relationship with eating and food. And I have met men who don't even know they're disordered and I can't imagine how hard recovery is with the bias. I'm here for you.",False,False

You’re valid and worthy of support. ❤️",False,False

I’m glad you feel able to open up somewhere, and I think it’s brave of you to do so in a community where you know you’re a minority there. I hope you feel you can continue to do so and I think I speak for everyone when I say I hope you feel welcome.",False,False

It is so disheartening and frustrating that so many people (especially clinicians) are blind to the true scope of eating disorders. I really hope you're able to find the support and validation you deserve.,False,False

This is unfortunately because people don't even usually associate them with men, but that just adds to the suffering in silence. Take care. You're heard.",False,False
