I think it's a way for them to cope with the fear of someone they love suffering. Doesn't make it less shitty, doesn't mean you're ok or overreacting by any means. Idk that's the only way I've been able to explain it to myself without resenting them for ""not caring"".   Hell yeah for getting some serious support from your followers, though. You matter and are cared about!! Focus on you and don't let others diminishing the problem keep you from addressing it and utilizing the support you do have. Sending love ❤️",False,False
