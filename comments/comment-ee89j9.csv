I seriously got this from like 2-3 of my ex-boyfriends. I would attempt to 'cook' something for myself or for both, and they would ALWAYS come into the kitchen to point out everything they thought I was doing wrong. Hated this!!! One time I attempted to make a good Italian dish I had a recipe for from a coworker. It was either his birthday or Valentine's day &amp; the asshole came into the kitchen when I told him I wanted to surprise him &amp; told me I was taking too long &amp; was making it wrong. I'm SO glad he's an ex! With a roommate I'd probably say to mind their own business or that I like it this way.",False,False
