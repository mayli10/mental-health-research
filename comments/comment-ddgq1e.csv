She is actually an amazing mum in almost every way except dealing with mental issues. She used to say really hurtful things towards me, like that I need to wear dresses that hide my legs etc. when I was recovering, And it absolutely killed me. She knew about my eating disorder. I never talked to her about how much it hurt me either. At the end of the day I had to learn to take my health into my own hands and just ignore her comments, and I encourage my sisters who have gone through/are going through similar comments to just ignore them and know that I am in the right direction whatever my mum says. Now 8 years later I'm essentially fully recovered, I'm ""naturally skinny"" with a BMI of 18 without restriction despite originally having gained some weight during the recovery due to how hard it is to go from eating nothing to eating normally.",False,False

My mom use to CONSTANTLY talk about how thin she was when she was my age and how I‚Äôd NEVER fit into her wedding dress! üôÑ My dad use to comment on everything I ate and that it would make me fat.  My dad is dead now and my mom now lives in another state from me (and I‚Äôm an adult). The last time I saw my mom she said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm surprised you‚Äôve gained weight.‚Äù Within like 20 minutes of seeing me. So. I have no advice, but I‚Äôm sorry you have to deal with this.",False,False
