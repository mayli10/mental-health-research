I can’t stop thinking about the number and then I never forget it and the food is often ruined for me afterwards.   Thing is, you’re probably not going to forget that number, but the further you get away from it timewise, the less relevant it will be. You won’t be that exact weight tomorrow, or the day after that, and so on. In a week who knows what the hell your weight will be. Could be .4 of a pound different, could be 4 pounds. Today’s number won’t matter either way.",False,False

He took one look at the expression on my face and immediately started backtracking: “Or not! We don’t have to! It’s okay. Maybe next time. Or not.” Haha.   Sorry that happened to you, I hope you’ll be okay.",False,False
