And the fact that you have to pay for premium for a bunch of the features that MFP provides for free?

I used to just not count calories because I'd always binge if I went even a little over my limit. Also it just feels more restrictive when you have a clear cut limit I think.

I think there‚Äôs the whole aspect of seeing a climbing number and it becoming intimidating. Also if I go over even one calorie I just give in and binge. Counting/logging everything keeps food on your mind for longer and makes it easier to push off eating until you finally overeat. ,False,False
