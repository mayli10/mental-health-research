My bf hasn’t brought it up since, he knows it’s a sensitive topic. He was kind and empathetic and hasn’t pushed me about food at all.  Most everyone I’ve told usually just “ignores” the information I’ve shared and we are able to continue a normal relationship. I know you’re freaking out about telling him but if anything, it’s really good that you did. It shows you trust him enough to share vulnerable and sensitive personal info. I’m sure it might feel awkward at first but y’all will be back to normal in no time. Deep breaths fam, you’ll be just fine",False,False

As long as you don't freak out I'm sure he won't pass it off as an eating disorder, though maybe actually discussing it with him would help. Either way hope it all works out for you",False,False
