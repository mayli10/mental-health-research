He's going to learn that ""fat"" is seen as bad by most without any of our input. It's a message out there everywhere. Is it okay for him to go around telling people they're fat? Like I said in another comment, the first time I was bullied for being fat was when I was six.   When I asked him where he heard that, it was in the same way as when I asked him who taught him ""buttcheek.""   ""*Uncle Joe*.""   ""Uncle Joe is silly,"" followed by a month of using and giggling at the word by both of us.  But again, this is why I came to this sub. It's hard when I'm trying to learn and do my best when everyone is downvoting me. *All* I care about is his wellbeing and I'm already insecure about my ""parenting"" abilities.   I don't assume that role, by the way. I support his dad in any way I can, but I'm more of a fun live-in friend type. But of course, that involves telling his dad about anything I find important, as I would the teacher of the kid I tutor.",False,True

I've been in a lot of treatment for drug use and other issues and a lot of what they focus on is childhood trauma and it's amazing how much of who we are and how we behave and think is from our childhood experiences and how things that may seem so small can actually have huge effects on our subconscious even if we don't remember them. I'm not a professional but I've had 6 months of intensive treatment at VERY expensive (thank god for insurance) places so I know what I'm talking about wayyyyy more than I used to and way more than I could ever have hoped to learn on my own. I'm assuming the other people commenting are just talking about their own opinions, and that's fine, but opinions aren't facts. Anyway, i promise you you're being 100% rational and your feelings are justified. I think other people are seeing it as you're using your projecting because of your own ED but from my experience I think you're just able to see it more than others because of your own experiences. Using drug addiction as an example, I can look back and see what went wrong and see all the warning signs that led up to my addiction and now I can see it in other people too from my own experiences. In the same way, you can see where a develipmental things happened to you and you're able to recognize it as a possible warning sign for someone else. Anyway, I believe in you and I know you can get your streak back and get it even higher. Good luck :) btw feel free to message me whenever",False,False

There was an incident when he was around 3/4 when someone told him he would be fat if he ate cookies, so he refused to eat them for a while. I think that you shouldn't involve children in talk about fat/skinny bodies until they are older. He has been impacted by it and I hope not to the extent of an eating disorder.
