Because you'll know how many cals are in the food already, so you can just store it away (preventing a binge, bc you'll have a meal prepped already) in the fridge or the freezer (if you're not hungry, you can keep it there for up to 6 months) ",False,False

I started planning small easy one-serve meals like rice-paper rolls and stuff that I can just make a couple of and eat without any excess left over, but now I have the problem that my bf doesn't really have anything to eat and has to make his own dinner. Which he doesn't mind, but he's such a bad cook I feel bad seeing the packet food he eats or w/e while I could have just made him something nice. I feel like I can either make something 1 serve or make something 8 serves, never anything in between idk why!",False,False
