Many ED patients I've met while being ip are just going through the cycle of starving themselves until they get to a dangerously low weight, being hospitalized, gaining, getting released, and then repeating all over. Sometimes it just turns into another disordered behaviour.  I've been on and off diagnosed with BPD depending on which psychiatrist I was visiting at the time, so no one knows what my actual diagnosis is, but I definitely experience splitting (or very similar behaviour), plus the extreme need for validation and irrational self hate. To me, it's either skinny or worthless. Which is bull, but my environment while growing up certainly contributed to the praise-craving little me being brainwashed by those beliefs about myself. The issues run insanely deep and it's going to be difficult to find a solution, but hopefully I'll be able to find the will to work on it I had back then.",False,True

I'm really happy for you that you found a way to get better. Recovery is not black or white, so unfortunately some setbacks are bound to happen, but as you said, the progress you've made remains! Best of luck with your journey and have a virtual hug back. There's always a chance for everyone, hopefully with me included, so I hope I'll be able to go on until I gather enough resolve to look for help again.",False,True

I live in a country where even being at the higher end of the BMI spectrum means you get insane amounts of shit from other people for it, add a dose of certain abusive family members (who, for example, called me a whale for growing boobs at 12, or encouraged me to starve, because ""bones are beautiful""), and you get a deeply ingrained mindset of ""it's your fault"", ""you're not even human"", insane body dysmorphia and paranoia.  It's not my fault, and any sane person shouldn't blame ill people for being ill. And of course weight does not play any role whatsoever in your worth as a human being.  I know that.  Even though, I hold those beliefs towards myself. They're just buried too deep, I think. Hopefully I will be able to get rid of them one day. You will get rid of yours as well. Wish you all the best on your road to recovery!",False,True

Unfortunately with restrictive eating disorders, the focus is way too much on ending the behaviors that lead to starving, without addressing the mental aspect of it. So you‚Äôll get ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù physically but your brain is still very sick. Not surprising at all that you found a different way to cope. But you managed to stop your restrictive behaviors, that means you can totally deal with the binging. You will find a way and you‚Äôll deal with the mental shit too so you won‚Äôt have to turn to food to cope with life. Please have some compassion for yourself. I‚Äôm very proud of you for making the choice to get better, even if you feel like you‚Äôre worse off now. Just keep working on yourself. You‚Äôll be okay!!",False,False

I feel like recovery wants you to be able to just eat whenever without thought, but it doesn't work that way for us. There's no middle ground for us, only a voice screaming EAT MORE or EAT LESS.  Something that has helped me is setting a calorie and macro goal each day. I know that recovery doesn't want you to do that but if you set it at your TDEE you will be a healthy weight instead of eating too little or too much and verifies you're getting enough nutrients.   Obsessing about your health is supposedly a no-no, but imo if you're obsessing about your health in order to be ACTUALLY healthy, then why not? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",False,False

I went through the same thing as a teenager (anorexia and then BED/massive weight gain and obesity) and it was hell. Those were the worst years of my life. After years of weight cycling I developed bulimia and my ED got much worse but i still wasn‚Äôt as depressed as I was after that initial BED/weight gain.   You can get through this. Don‚Äôt give up hope - if your current medical professionals can‚Äôt help you,  there are ones out there that can. I am now nearing 30 and relapsed last year, but had many good years in recovery from treatment I had around age 20. Even now my ability to manage my symptoms is much better. Eating disorders are SO persistent but I do believe recovery is possible.",False,False

I know it's just the illness speaking, but it's hard not to feel that way nonetheless. It's a combination of not wanting to endure this any longer and having failed too many times, I think. I went through many types of therapy, including CBT, DBT, psychotherapy. Many of the therapists told me or my parents that they don't know what to do. Plus it's hard to find new ones, as they are either fully booked or too far away for me to commute. I was hospitalized a few times, but I found out that they just keep you in until you're no longer in immediate danger and then send you home. According to my psychiatrist, she tried all types of medication that wouldn't probably have bad side effects in my case, so for now I'm on sertraline, quetiapine, plus Xanax when it gets bad. They can keep me somewhat functional at least.  So for now, it does feel like there's nothing I can do but wait. I try to remind myself that it probably won't last forever, but I also can't imagine having to endure living like this for another 5 years or so. It feels like I'm just wasting my young years away, but I don't have the strength to do anything anymore.    I'm sorry for rambling too much! I'm feeling very edgy right now, haha. Thank you again for the kind words!",False,True

People can lose weight again, people can get better from BED or at least learn to control it a little more. Have you tried CBT? Any medications?  Weight is not the ultimate measure of your self worth. You are not a failure, you are struggling. You haven't *failed*, it just sounds like you've given up. If you have the strength to motivate yourself to get better a second time then I'm positive you can. It's not too late.  I know I'm just a stranger on the internet but I genuinely wish you all the best. It sounds like you're really struggling right now.
