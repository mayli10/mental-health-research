The only thing making me double think purging is my oral health.   I'm 22 and lost 4 teeth and a 5th one on the way due to purging. No amount of brushing or flossing will help.  Acids will eat your teeth out (think about what they due to throat/mouth  tissue if they can eat out calcium teeth),False,False

Every time I read a post like this my heart drops. It‚Äôs not worth it.
