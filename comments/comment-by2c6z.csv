You learned coping skills in that time that you didn't have before, so now you have two choices:  1. You can see this as total failure and your eating disorder will take over 2. You can take what you learned from what triggers you, and start back into recovery from here  Recovery isn't linear, it isn't like, ""Oh, you start recovery and then you'll never use an eating disorder behavior again."" That's not how it works, if it was that easy, we'd all be cured instantly. The hard part is using the behavior and then identifying what happened, why it happened, and how maybe you can cope without using the ED behaviors next time so that your recovery is a little more stable.  You didn't fail, what happened is totally normal. I don't know anyone with an eating disorder who hasn't at least had a lapse, recovered or not. Keep going, you are so worth recovering from your eating disorder.",False,False

This is just a setback. Setbacks are normal. Everybody experiences them. Your progress hasn't been undone because of one mistake.,False,False
