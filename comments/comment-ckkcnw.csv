Potential TW for talking about binge eating, fasting and calorie counting.  I know sometimes when people disappear from this sub it's because they went and got their life together. Not me LOL. I disappeared because I've been binge eating nonstop for what feels like (and probably is) months. I'm scared to weigh myself. I know I've gained weight. Actually I know I've gained weight because I weighed myself about halfway through and I'd gained weight then, so the idea that I've probably gained even more than that is terrifying.  I don't necessarily regret binging. The past two months have been probably the most stressful period of my life, for a variety of reasons, both planned and unforeseen. My eating is always the first thing to give way under pressure and I think if I'd tried to stop myself from binging I would've snapped. (Like, more than I did, lmao.) But it has completely solidified for me that if I'm not restricting, I'm binging. Healthy, intuitive eating is completely beyond my grasp, lol. Hell, even simply overeating because I want to is impossible without going into compulsive binge territory. And I don't want to be fat any more so I have to go back to restricting.  I'm kind of excited about it actually. It's hard to pull the reins on a binge, especially when I've been spiralling out of control for so long. But I can pull back up. Yes, I've gotten fatter, but I'm still not as fat as I was when I started and I don't want to be one of those people who gained back all the weight they lost. I'm not starting from scratch. I can do this. Today is the start of a new month and I succeeded in my first 24hr fast in months. I'm going to go back to logging all my calories, even if I do binge (going off-record is always the worst thing for me to do WRT binges). I got foods I know I like to eat that are low-calorie and I'm going to throw out all the gross old food from my fridge that went rotten because I was too busy or crazy to cook.  The truth is that eating ""whatever I want"" sucks. I almost never actually want the food I end up eating, I'm just revelling in the childlike glee of not having to answer to anyone. Well, I have to answer to myself, lol. And my flab speaks for itself. The reality is that no matter how alluring junk food or 4000\~ calorie meals seem, I feel better and happier when I am paying attention to what I eat. Food tastes better and has more meaning when it's actually special and not just the 35704783457th thing I've shoved in my mouth that day.  So - I'm back. My life has finally died down and gotten less hectic. I still have to figure out what I'm going to do for money longterm, but I'm okay for the short term.

Idk if this is my incentive to try and recover.    My ED brain is screaming ""NO YOU HAVEN'T LOST ENOUGH YET, YOU HAVENT BEEN DOING THIS LONG ENOUGH AND IF YOU STOP DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING EVERYONE WILL THINK YOU'RE FAKE AND HATE YOU"". Most of that doesn't even make sense but it terrifies me enough to not recover. Sigh.",False,False

It's hard because he has become my best friend and it's hard to adjust to the fact that I am not as important to him anymore as he is to me. What is even harder is that he told me that she is both thinner and taller than me. Who even says that. I love him and I want him to be happy with her. It's just hard to know that he has found someone prettier, smarter and more funny than me while I'm just one big mess trying to recover and work on myself. You can't control emotions and who you fall for. I just wish he had fallen for me.",False,False
