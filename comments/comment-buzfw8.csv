I'm 22 and have had an eating disorder since I was 10-11. I had never told anyone until two months ago when I told my best friend, and then a few weeks later, my boyfriend. I've known my best friend since we were 8, and she never knew.   They both encouraged me to get therapy, which has been a challenge because (1) I'm broke, (2) I live with my dad and don't want him to know, and (3) I have very shitty health insurance.   I searched everywhere online for ED specialists that offer sliding scale (Psychology Today's website is a good search tool for that). Unfortunately, basically all of the sliding scale ED specialists weren't taking on new clients, but it might be an option for you. Sliding scale means they adjust their usual fee to fit your financial circumstances. Also, if they say they're not taking on new clients, inquire about a waiting list -- some places will put you on one.  I finally went to my college's counseling center (where they offer free therapy to students) as a last resort 'cause, on their website, they mentioned they didn't treat eating disorders. It turns out it was a great decision because they recently hired an ED specialist and I met with him the other day and got diagnosed for the first time.   So, in summary, search for sliding scale ED specialists, inquire about being put on a waiting list if they say they're not accepting new clients, and check out your college's counseling center if you're in college and if your college has a counseling center (make an appointment with them, and they might know of low cost referrals, even if they don't treat the issue themselves).  I hope we can both recover! I believe we can",False,False

I needed to hear that it's possible.  How would you recommend I get started? I can't do hospitalizations or anything because, well, I'm not underweight. I'm on the border of normal-overweight. I also can't really afford any professional help. I know that you're no expert, but is there anything you learned in your recovery that was kind of a stepping stone to make you change?",False,True
