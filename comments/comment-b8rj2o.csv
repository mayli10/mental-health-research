It's very physically demanding but I think of it as getting paid to burn calories and bond with piggies. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è tbh it kills me, but I also just really like feeding animals. The documentation is probably harder than the physical labor when I haven't eaten. I've probably gotten myself into more trouble than if I just had a proper meal at lunch and remembered to document things I'm supposed to tho lol.",False,False

I'm a tech, still ""figuring things out"", zero clue what I want to do. Don't want to be a nurse as it seems incredibly stressful. I have a few options in my head that would offer job security and a decent pay, but the only thing I really want to do is live somewhere else entirely, like a completely different country. I sound like a complete idiot because I am one!",False,False

Technical shit, mostly lighting and video.   Long hours make it hard to control eating. Being around the 24/7 catering isn't really an issue, though I see some people I work with get bingey af in public, which must be super embarrassing for them.  Being around the talent is actually super validating because I'm prettier and skinnier than most of the women. And the ones I'm not it's cool because it's their job to look better than me. It's become more and more ok for female actors to be healthy weight (which is a good thing) or even overweight (which is not a good thing). The men are more motivating because a lot of them are super disciplined and in really good shape.  Working with stunt performers of either gender is actually my favourite, because they're all about fun and fitness instead of just looking pretty. ",False,False

Actually I just hate working full time in general. I do pt jobs like Instacart or waitressing for fun money but my bf supports me. I constantly feel like I should be doing more and that I need to prove myself. In my school there‚Äôs a lot of thin and pretty women so I get triggered almost every day.

I enjoy it, it‚Äôs rewarding. My ED and mental health totally fucked up my education - never graduated from high school due to medical absences and took FOREVER to get my AA degree. I‚Äôm a perfectionist but also easily overwhelmed, I just can‚Äôt take on a lot at a time. I come from a really privileged background (I‚Äôm the first person in my family for three generations who DIDN‚ÄôT go to university), was expected to do something prestigious, so I would have liked to be a proper lawyer, but oh well, try not to dwell an all my failures. The firm I‚Äôm at right now I‚Äôve been with for two years, which is the longest I‚Äôve kept a job ever. I used to do temp work because that way I never built relationships or had much responsibility - two things that would get in the way of my ED.   My dream job, however, was to be a trapeze artist in a traveling circus. And I did that for a time but had to stop because of my health. Was asked to leave to focus on my health, actually, which was humiliating. So yeah anorexia definitely impacted my career.  ",False,False
