I could be better about that, I just get quiet and try to disappear or leave :/  It really sucks, there are some insecurities that just cling to us I think. Plus mentally it‚Äôs really hard to grow up. My MIL says the women at the center all consider themselves girls still, and I‚Äôm starting to understand what she means. Idk tho, knowledge is power and the more we understand WHY we are compelled to do things, perhaps the gentler we can be to ourselves and others.",False,False

The worst is when someone I care about does it.  My boyfriend's mom has been constantly talking about her diet/weigh lately.  It's so awful because she is a grown ass woman, like probably going to be a grandmother in the next 5 years, and it just makes me so sad.  Like, she is very independently successful and lives a full life, but seeing this crack in her is so demotivating.  Like oh, you can raise amazing children, work your ass off to build up a successful company, have loved and lived more than most people, and yet you can still be an insecure little girl who feels too fat underneath it all.  Makes me sad as fuck.  Also, she is very beautiful and petite - I feel like a giant ogre next to her, so how does she think it makes me feel when she laments a little bit of excess fat when I am technically a blimp in comparison?  I take a weird pride in never talking to anyone about my weight or body image or eating habits.  I try to shut down any diet talk IRL,  especially around other women.",False,False

Probably because people just don't realize it or just move on to the next diet...or those posts get deleted/ignored/downvoted.  I'm convinced that anyone who isn't born with perfect corresponding genetics and didn't grow up in a household that made food a perfectly normal thing has disordered eating, at least in any given first world country.  Like truly, anyone on any of the weight loss/diet subreddits has a problem with food, that's just a fact.  The severity varies and you can always get better, but it's so easy to get obsessive. Instead of treating the heart of the problem, they start keto!  Try to tell me an ultra-restrictive diet that your whole life revolves around isn't extremely disordered eating.   Also, I don't want to fucking hear about your stupid fucking diet unless I actually ask.  That is for private internet time only with anonymous people, not casual lunch talk or work talk.  Especially because I don't want to cringe when you eventually give it up in a few weeks and feel guilty about it.  I have my own issues to deal with, thanks.  I honestly think I only know like three people who sincerely don't have food issues.",False,False
