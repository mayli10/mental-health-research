For example, my boyfriend's family likes to go to dinner on Sundays. But I definitely see where you're coming from. Obsessive scheduling of food is definitely disordered.",False,False

The comment was about control. Maybe it's just that I already recognize disordered thinking in myself but in my opinion as soon as a diet becomes about total control of where and when you're ""allowed"" to eat the lines get weird. If it had just been ""yes I love bagels so every so often I go and get one as a treat"" it would be fine.",False,True

It sounds like moderation to me; they enjoy that food but they know it's calorically dense so they only have it once in awhile. If it doesn't stress them out to do that, I don't see the problem.",False,False
