I feel so guilty eating around my boyfriend who has perfectly normal and healthy eating habits and he does little things that trigger me. For example, we could open a packet of cookies and he‚Äôd take one, and I‚Äôd take one, and then he‚Äôd close it and put it away when I still wanted several more and I‚Äôd feel terrible that I wanted them when he was obviously done, because if he only had one then if I had more it would mean I was a disgusting fatass.   And yeah, he‚Äôs deliberately taken food off me that I‚Äôd started binging on before. The guilt that comes from essentially being told, ‚Äúno, what you want is disgusting and wrong‚Äù is indescribable.",False,False

My boyfriend has figured out that binging and overindulgence leads to an increase in compensatory behaviors and mood swings. So if we were in this position, he would probably talk me into eating a reasonable amount and then hide the rest for another time lol. Or if we go to a pastry shop nearby, he‚Äôll encourage me to only get one thing, and tell me we can always come back again later if I just haaaave to have the other item I want.  Maybe talking to him about what helps you, and encourages you to make healthier decisions or turn to more productive coping mechanisms could be beneficial?",False,False

He may have been coming from a place of love but that is unacceptable. Also 3 cookies is not a binge nor does it mean anything is wrong with you, wtf.",False,False

I opened up to my wife a bit about my issues and that I need to stop emotionally eating and binging so I can lose weight so when we recently went grocery shopping, the only naughty food I was allowed was one dark chocolate bar. Part of me was upset, and part was super stoked she was helping me restrict üôÉ",False,False

Maybe for home making you set a limit is a way to avoid the self loathing that comes after the binge, and maybe it works but some distraction could help too.  I don't think he is am asshole because he is not doing it with the motive of making you skinny but trying to make you happy and help you with the limits we loose in the binge.",False,False

I genuinely think he means well and just wants me to be ok but he doesnt seem to realise that I'll hate myself and feel like shit REGARDLESS of what I do and taking my binge food away won't stop anything, it just makes us both upset and miserable.",False,True
