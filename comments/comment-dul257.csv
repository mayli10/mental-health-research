I was so upset at the people who treated me badly/dismissed me for being overweight that I wanted to get thin, then thinner, then ""scary"" thin, so I could turn around and say ""THIS is how I did it, THIS is what you made me do, are you guilty now!?""  Then I actually started losing weight and... That's not how I feel any more. I get anxious whenever people comment on my weight loss because I feel guilty for how I'm doing it, especially when they're trying to lose weight too. The people I wanted to get back at would never care, anyway, and so the only people I'm hurting are the people who already cared about me.  It sucks. I tell myself when I get to a healthy weight I'll stop... But I know that what I'm doing is already unhealthy.",False,False

She's big enough that 50 lbs isnt even noticeable loss.  Well in high school I went on a diet to fit in with my attractive fit peers cuz I was doughy. No big deal right?  Bitch got jealous and started weighing me naked and sneaking butter and shit into my food. I caught her one day.   Well I saw a pic of her from Christmas after losing 50 pounds again. She looked bigger than the last time I saw her in person. She's done this enough to lose her body weight twice over. Nearly half a ton yoyo'd.   That's why I do it. To prove she couldn't bring me down with her despite her efforts to keep me porky.",False,False

There were a couple times where doctors basically said “you don’t seem that bad” or “tell me if it gets really bad” ... and I’d go off the deep end. For me it’s a really intense 100% emotion-based coping response.   Someone summarized it for me as “that’s like drinking poison and hoping the other person dies”. That stuck with me somehow. At least it gets me chuckling at myself a teeny bit.,False,False
