Having 3 normal meals a day, steak , chicken, snacks , but In healthy portions to your liking. People like myself can’t physically even consume a lot of food , I haven’t been able to since I was a child. And that’s not intentional but developed my eating disordered thinking for the past 20 years now",False,True

I still get chest pains, I’m still constantly I’ll because my immune system is shit, I’m still really miserable and have a fucked up view of food.   There’s no healthy way to have an eating disorder. Higher restriction might minimise the damage, but after a certain point that just means it’s killing you slower.",False,False
