Life is a lot, and I’m sure what you said isn’t even the extent of how draining it is. You seem like you have so many good intentions but it’s causing you more stress than good. This is going to sound really hippie but I suggest some daily meditation (good apps to use are Headspace and Calm) and learn to use it to ground messy thoughts a stressed mind. It took me a long time to warm to it but it’s been helping me with college stress (freshman 15? more like freshman 25) and I’ve found that I can handle much more responsibilities without resorting to eating, and food is becoming less of a burden to me. Something that made me become a huge believer in meditation is [this](https://www.recoverywarriors.com/bulimia-meditation/) article. I highly suggest using it for an extended amount of time, as hard as it may seem at first. It’s definitely not a magical answer to life’s problems, but it teaches you how to handle/perceive problems and change will follow.  Another thing: congrats on not purging!! You’ve made the conscious choice to beat a mental disease and thats a huge step!! If you’d like to talk more feel free to pm me, I’d be more than happy to listen.",False,False

I havent really been dieting. I gained 10lbs, lost 8 (mostly because I was sick and had no appetite for a few weeks) and now I'm gaining again. I'm also probably smoking weed too often. I sometimes get the munchies.   I am just so tired of my life being like it is. I'm less depressed and now have enough energy to work and maintain a social life. But adulting is kicking my ass. I so desperately need to deep clean my apartment but every time I start I get so overwhelmed I cant do it. I cant check my mail. I'd love to have everything in order. Like keeping my apartment clean (it's so bad I wouldnt bring a one night stand over), start wearing makeup more often, maybe even make an online dating profile (but as long as I'm overweight it's really scary). I work 5 days a week but since work is so slow I'm not working anywhere near 40 hours, more like 30. Even when I start work late or get off early I never know in advance and I'm still just as tired as working full days.   My weekends are scheduled like nuts with therapy, the chiropractor, psychiatrist visits, and some gyno visits I've been putting off (abnormal pap, lactating slightly from one boob), and overeaters anonymous meetings and meetings with my sponsor once a week. I feel like I have no free time. In the midst of doing all this I need to also meal prep and count calories (the only way I've ever been successful at weight loss). I feel like I'm drowning.

But I had to recover, I didn’t want to use purging as  a crutch for more future binging later. So I waited it out. It SUCKED, the feeling of being so full I couldn’t straighten up my back, the immense guilt, etc. But I kept telling myself that it’ll be over soon, and I would have taken another step towards being normal. I loosened up my diet plan and stopped counting/mentally estimating for a while. It’s helps a lot. As hard as it may seem, give yourself some space, work towards just letting go a little bit. I promise that it can make you feel better, and changes will follow.",False,False
