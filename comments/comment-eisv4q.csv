I have a “large frame” so I never look like the tiny/dainty/feminine/pixie ideal in my mind of what being thin should look like. Plus I have super broad shoulders, and I have no curves. My waist isn’t defined, even when I was at my lowest. I’m a classic “ruler” or “banana” shape.",False,False

Sorry this isn't helpful but just wanted to commiserate. I'm certain I actually am bigger than people see me because I'm constantly bloated from overeating and I feel disgusting and huge and I just don't know anymore man, I don't know what I look like or why I feel this way. Maybe being larger in the past makes us afraid to take up any space at all now? Maybe we need non-ed-related therapy honestly",False,False
