Can I get you to eat ANYTHING like??” And I said “N O (✿◠‿◠)” like I just stopped caring, the result is the same, I’m not fucking eating until I feel like eating, and extra little things I don’t plan for throw off my budget and it’s frustrating to have it pushed on you all the time, so I just stopped being nice about it lol  And exactly, I feel like if you’re genuinely concerned for someone, talking about it isn’t a horrible thing. Like if they’re gone and you ask someone else “hey, I’ve noticed ___ doesn’t eat at work. Have you noticed? Do you think she’s okay lately?” or whatever, I don’t see that as a problem. It’s just concern, it’s nothing bad. But just straight up gossip and giggles and “she had ONE baby carrot ONCE lmao 🤪” is really, really angering lmfao",False,True

Go off?? Why does he think it's appropriate to bring you food and try to force feed you like that? Or it's so callous to make comments to your face. That is awful.   At least you're not letting it bother you though. 😂 And you have so much gall to just tell them no like that!   I agree it's just gossip. At least in my situation, it was clear she wasn't worried for my boss or anything... It was just gossip. That doesn't help anyone. ",False,False

Support is always nice but ultimately it’s her situation to handle, and I’m positive she wouldn’t want it gossiped about behind her back lmao. At my job no one EVER sees me eat, because I don’t, same as you, and they’ve said some things about it behind my back that’ve gotten back to me, or some little things to my face even, and I just stopped caring what they think. Like this one coworker in particular will always bring me food, like a brownie or a breakfast sandwich or a chocolate or something, and he’ll try and get me to eat it in front of him, and I just blatantly say no. Like literally “No. I’m sorry, thanks though” lol.  But for someone who IS sensitive to that being talked about or people having opinions or trying to involve themselves in what they eat or how frequently or whether they eat at work or whatever, it’s just disrespectful. Like if they’re fasting, leave them to it! If they let other people know, cool, but if not, it’s no one’s fucking business anyway lol why do people need to make comments about it? Or what if it’s genuine anorexia or what if they’re eating a single baby carrot now and are going to binge later? That’s not anybody else’s issue to involve themselves in, or to make comments about, especially when the person isn’t even there. If it’s not support, just gossip, mind your own business in my opinion lmao 🙄",False,True

And I’m registered in a very small town, so NO ONE is in either the courthouse or the county clerk office, so there’s maybe one person in front of me at either of those when I come in once per year to renew my tags or once per however many years to renew my license? Lol. I don’t even think there is a DMV here. Where I live for work, though, is a super populated city, and I’d shoot myself if I had to go to the DMV there for anything. Like traffic while driving is bad enough, I can’t imagine traffic like on foot, inside a building, in lines, and everyone is angry. No fucking thank you, that’s giving ME anxiety lol  But yeah, I don’t even remember how they got to that subject. They were literally talking to another person who came in and then all of the sudden “I’ve never seen _____ eat a single thing here ever” like? How is that appropriate conversation while she’s gone or at all, especially with a customer or two in there?",False,True

She never eats anything at work. When she finally married her new husband she started bringing in 1 apple sauce but that's all she eats all day.""   I'm large so I'm sure she has no clue I also don't eat all day. But I had no idea what to say to her beyond ""oh my.....""   Like that's none of my business even if my boss does have a disorder???

If you are in the US and your state has online registration-Please for the love of god and all that is holy DO YOUR TAG RENEWAL ONLINE OR BY MAIL.  I spent two hours waiting at my dmv to get a title transfer because for some reason the MN dmv was putting registration renewal before everything else- so if someone came in 30 minutes after me with their renewal, they got to go first.  Also fun fact, in MN tags are called tabs. This isn't really important though.   Sorry, I read your post first thing upon waking and it gave me a little anxiety. I have another title I need to transfer and I am dreading a return to the dmv.  As for you question, I would be livid if I found out people I work with were talking about the food I eat. Some people just don't eat when they work. If this other women is suffering from an ED , it is really sad that her coworkers just use her eating as gossip material.",False,False
