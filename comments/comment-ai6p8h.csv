I do my best to eat whenever I feel hungry, but that desire to look ""\*perfect\*"" even on my off days is always there, lingering and waiting for the right moment to come back in force. It's kind of tough when you're in a position where you finally enjoy how you look, but you can't actually let yourself enjoy it because it's unhealthy and you know you'll just make things worse. The worst of it all though is probably when I allow myself to have a really big meal for a special event like thanksgiving or whatever and then I just feel awful about myself for days because I'm not as thin as I was when I woke up that morning. I usually don't even eat enough to actually gain weight. It's either I'm bloated because it wasn't a healthy meal or that it just hasn't been long enough for me to digest all the food I put inside me and it's still there taking up space. It's definitely not helpful when you have proof that you could be thinner that you could look at any time you feel a little bigger than usual.",False,False

I've actually got some good perspective now though. I'm at a very healthy and normal (read: I want to lose weight) weight so my brain is functioning and I can see and recognize just HOW scary skinny I was.  I knew I was skinny, but I honestly had no idea how bad it was at 14.9.  NEVER AGAIN.",False,False

I'm so glad I didn't really care about my weight back then, because I'm sure my body looked even worse. It's motivation not to gain any weight. Then I look at pics from right before I went on vacation to Canada (so june/july 2018) and I cry because I looked so thin and cute and pretty. I highkey wanna look like that again so it's some motivation to restrict better.",False,False
