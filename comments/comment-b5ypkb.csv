Puberty and adolescence require about 1000 extra calories for them to grow properly and develop their sex hormones. It‚Äôs tough as an ED mom because you don‚Äôt want to pass on any bad habits or thought processes but at the same time they need encouragement and guidance to develop healthy eating habits.

So if they choose not to follow my advice I won‚Äôt nag them. I use finances as an excuse too, I‚Äôll say no more than 2-3x candy bars a day for example, because it‚Äôs too expensive if they go through more of it, then if they think I‚Äôm a bit nagging they won‚Äôt get the wrong idea that I‚Äôm criticizing or trying to control their weight whatever.

But growing up there was a lot of emphasis on being in a small body from my mom and when I got to late childhood all my favorite snacks were cut off because ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt need them‚Äù. These were things like little Debbie snacks, koolaid, chips, fruit snacks, etc. I would still get them occasionally, but it was rare. I was always a small kid to begin with and never had an issue with weight, but these messages resulted in a lot of secretive eating, shame surrounding wanting snacks, and guilt. It‚Äôs definitely one of the things I can pinpoint as something that contributed to my fucked up relationship with food and I feel strongly about giving kids messages about good foods and bad foods and value judgements based on what or how much is eaten. She‚Äôll get enough of that from peers and society in general   My goal when I get through this shit and have kids of my own one day is to teach them to listen to their bodies. Are they hungry? They should eat. Are they full? No pressure to finish their plate. I want to teach my kids to reflect on how foods make them feel so they can learn how to respond to their bodies and give it what it needs or wants. Intuitive eating isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôve mastered yet so I don‚Äôt have specific advice, but in my experience rules around food can be a really bad environment. I applaud you for not setting certain times for meals or anything like that. I‚Äôd say let her snack if she wants to snack. If it‚Äôs realistic, let her have a hand in choosing what kind of snacks or food in general to have at the house. I think giving more autonomy in food choices is better than taking some away ",False,False
