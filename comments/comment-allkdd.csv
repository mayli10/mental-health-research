It's mindless entertainment most of the time. Try replacing TV with conversation with your SO.  Move the TV remote away from where you sit (like, 20ft). Also, leaving your ohone further away from you while eating will be helpful too.   It's hard to change habits and progress in breaking them isn't linear. But if you're eating w/o tv for the majority of the time, then that's a win.   Defining your goals more specifically can help you stick to it, too. Instead of just saying ""no tv while eating"" say ""i will not watch tv during breakfast or dinner today. I can watch tv during lunch, though"" is a good way to start imo. Eventually, try to get it so you don't watch tv for any of your meals most days.   Coming up with scenarios of your SO saying ""hey, lets watch [tv show] while we eat [meal]"" and then imagining yourself saying ""no thank you, watching tv leads to me eating an unhealthy amount of food"" and then switching the conversation to something else can also be beneficial",False,False
