Physically removing myself from the situation is the only way.,False,False

Physical deprivation aside, the diet mentality involved in restriction can also make ~unsafe foods~ appear more attractive.   I personally realised recently that, for me at least, binges *will* happen if I restrict. My body just isn't happy when it isn't at it's set point. This motivates me to try eating consistently and eating enough, though things are deffo really hard.   I'd advise you to stop restricting but I also know how difficult that can be. Please try to take care of yourself and don't beat yourself too much; it's likely your body just reaching for what it needs and it doesn't make you a failure, no matter what your ED tells you. And at least some of the weight you've gained is due to water retention/bloating, especially if you've hinged on foods with lots of carbs/salt/sugar.   Stay strong &lt;3",False,False

You have to realize why you're binge eating, are there any current stressors in your life?  As long as you sleep enough, stress less and exercise with a clean diet you will gradually lose it all. Before you eat ask yourself: am i so hungry to want to eat a salad? No? Then just hydrate yourself. When you do eat, eat without distractions and chew and chew. Slow it down, what's the texture? What does it taste like?  You will get through this. Push through! :)",False,False
