If you broke it today, that's okay. Try to understand that you can break it just for these few days, there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. You're not a faliure. Tell yourself that, ""I'm not a faliure for eating 1 day a year. I can fast after Christmas, and then I have the rest of my life to fast. I can still get where I want to be, I'm worth a day of being able to enjoy good food"". All the best :)",False,True
