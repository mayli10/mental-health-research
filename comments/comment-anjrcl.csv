I drained the tinned grapefruit, patted it dry of all its horrid grapefruit juice with kitchen roll, sprinkled it with pumpkin spice, and placed it under the broiler. When it was done I sprinkled it with truvia. Adding artificial sweetner makes me anxious because although the packaging says it's zero calories, I do worry that it's not. Next time I'm going to grill it even longer so it's extra crisp (seems to bring out the sweetness) and add more cinnamon (to disguise the grapefruit flavour and hopefully allow me to cut back further on the truvia). The whole tin of grapefruit was 157 calories, but I'm rounding it up to 200 because of the spices and truvia. ",False,True
