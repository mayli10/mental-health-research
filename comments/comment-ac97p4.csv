It sounded pretty uncomfortable and grocery shopping is definitely a time when I *do not* want to be bothered. It‚Äôs really weird to me that she would attempt that convo at all...but forcing the convo when you attempted a graceful exit was just plain rude.  As for resolutioners as a class...if a number on a calendar helps them take a little action in their lives...more power to ‚Äòem. Seems like many times it just helps them *talk* about taking action but I‚Äôm ok with smiling and nodding. If their newfound zeal leads to criticizing *my* way of life then it‚Äôs time to set a boundary.,False,False
