Got 2 boxes and sprinkled all 50 tablets onto ice cream. Ate the entire pint of it.  &amp;#x200B;  This was about 5ish months ago. I've since stopped using laxatives. Mostly cause I'm jobless now and have no money to get them anymore. Stopped cold turkey too which was absolute hell.  After weeks of strange pain and no poops or rabbit poops my digestive track appears to be ok and running on its own. I now just eat soup (best thing ever) and my only binge food is chips (fml).,False,False
