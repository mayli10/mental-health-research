It really depends on how badly you want to recover. It takes so much dedication (and therapy lol). Its probably the hardest thing anyone could do, but also probably the most worthwhile.

About 3 of them are over the past month, from stress eating. And I can feel that there is actually fat accumulating on my stomach from ""flexing and pinching"" (lol). Hopefully it redistributes over the next year...  But thanks for the tips &lt;3",False,True

I've never been underweight, so I've never had to done minnie maud, but I've heard that the same thing happens, but to the extreme. Apparently, it can take up to a year for it to redistribute. They encourage you to wear loose clothes, don't look in mirrors, and don't do body checks.   I can't imagine yours is anything more than bloating and water at this point though. ",False,False
