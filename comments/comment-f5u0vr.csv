I know how incredibly difficult this must have been -- to make a decision you know is best for you. I know sometimes this can feel like a loss but this is SUCH a victory. Just that you were able to identify what your body wanted and needed, let alone step up and triumph over ED thoughts -- I am so proud of you. This was a triumph over your ED and a step in the direction of happiness and healthiness (physical and otherwise). Keep on keeping on and keep your friend close to you - you both seem to care about the others wellbeing :).",False,False
