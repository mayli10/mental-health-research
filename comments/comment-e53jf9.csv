That means so much to me :) I had the guts to tell them that I don’t see this going anywhere and blocked after. I’m not interested in hearing what excuse they’ll spout at me.,False,True

They just can't make it up to ya.   Maybe you should switch to looking into an upper age bracket.   I can't place exactly how, but reading your post I think you're going to figure it out. I have faith in you.",False,False

Why do you want to go on dates with me, invite me to parties as your date but don’t date me? Saying you want “companionship” instead. Fuck right off and unadd me right now. Trying to invite me on a date and then say “I don’t think I can ever make it up to you.”  NO. NO YOU CANT. The only consistent relationship I’ve had is with anorexia nervosa. 🙄 it won’t ever leave, at this rate. I’m not even sure if should text the guy back. I didn’t even open whatever message he sent me.   I’m sorry that you’re experiencing this too. Late teens-early 20s is a total clusterfuck. Dating in school is a mess. Thank you for understanding as well that living in rural areas, you will have to deal with commuting.",False,True

I’ve never been in a relationship (19F) because of the same things as you listed. I never got to have a “normal” high school experience because of my ed and now in uni guys just want fwb or they don’t have time for relationships. Being at my lw has proved that it doesn’t get better being thinner, I feel so stuck. I hope you don’t feel so alone, many of us are right here with you at the tragic realization. I hope it motivates you to maybe try and get better.",False,False
