Getting an ulcer meant feeling sick and having pain for most of the day. It can put you in the emergency room if it ruptures too.,False,False

It's like possibly in theory but not worth the risk irl.   You still lose muscle along with fat unless you weight lifted the entire time and stayed at a healthy body fat percentage.",False,False

When times are plenty, you put aside some for lean times. You don’t want to take money out of your savings unless you absolutely have to. Same with your body, it is trying to invest in your future, collect interest, give you a cushion for if you’re ever sick. Not only that but you need more than calories to live, you need protein and fats for proper hormone development and muscle repair. You’re not going to get enough macros on a low calorie diet so your body will cannibalize your own muscle tissue to keep you going. Supplements are cool but doctors agree that they can’t replace the nutrition found in food. Lots of vitamins and minerals need other compounds to properly absorb in our body. For example, you cannot absorb plant based iron properly without vitamin C.",False,False

But I try to eat every few hours so I dont binge and purge (because as much as I'd like to think I am, I'm not invincible and need to cut that shit out.) . It's just mostly veggies and tuna. I should probably find out how to prevent an ulcer though, since I have severe anxiety and my stomach hurts a lot of the time from it.",False,True

I ate enough but not for hours and hours. It gave me a stomach ulcer. That's not fun.    Also when you don't eat enough, your body doesn't just metabolise fat. It will eat muscle too, when that gets extreme it will start to metabolise your heart",False,False

They have, like, a pill for that right?   But then I realized that I was just being silly and this person probably didnt mean it like that.

I guess I should start eating protien but it's not free so my cheap ass wants to throw a fit about it.   I always thought I only needed protein if I wanted to build muscle. I'm dumb.,False,True
