It’s legally much murkier than someone who expresses suicidal intent. (And even for that more straightforward case, in the US my experience was a judge’s ruling was required to hold me for more than 72 hours.)   There are provisions for an adult to be assigned a conservator or guardian (basically a family member or the state now make decisions for you) but the only people I’ve met that this happened to had serious other mental health issues.",False,False

They’ll make strong suggestions, but can’t push past that. Unless, I believe, you explicitly state you’re going to commit suicide.",False,False
