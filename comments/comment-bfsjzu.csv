I don't have a dog, but once I was making a *sculpture* and someone said the person I was sculpting was chubby and it still bothered me. It seems that if we have an ED, we just don't want to be associated with ""chubby"" things.  However, your dog doesn't reflect on you at all! And your dog is in a normal weight range anyway. Besides, perhaps the comment was just in a non-serious way‚Äîsuch as the same way people comment on a baby's chubby cheeks without saying that the baby is too fat.",False,False
