I’m a pro ballet dancer and in my dance studio there was this girl who was very underweight (a beautiful trigger ngl) and she was telling this other girl that she got rejected by a ballet company due to her low weight (happened to me as well when I was auditioning to get into a dance school). And this other girls was like: “Omg just eat more! Look at me: I just smoke some weed and then eat a huge burger. You can enjoy food too!” I couldn’t believe my own effing ears. I was fuming. Didn’t react tho, bc it’s none of my business.",False,False

I regret leaving her because I don't know how I would handle it from an outside view. Some people just don't understand what we're going through.",False,False
