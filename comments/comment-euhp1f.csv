The only credentials i have are that I was in therapy as a minor for about four years, and still am as a young adult, and I am a psych major so I know a little bit about introductory counseling practice.

However, a good therapist will know when a minor is in more danger if people are brought in vs. they keep it to themselves. You may not want to test the waters immediately, give it a session or two and see if you feel comfortable/trust this person. If you talk about having an ED in a non-endangering way there is no reason for the therapist to bring your parents in, though if you get formally diagnosed, it will be in your paperwork, which your parents legally have access to until you're 18.",False,False
