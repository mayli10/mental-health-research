I think that we have normalized disordered behavior in order to avoid accepting that it is indeed disordered. Fasting, holiday diets, and such don‚Äôt mean you have an eating disorder true, but if these are your methods to stay underweight then you‚Äôre not naturally thin you employ methods to be that way. I just think the biggest problem is that we think you can be naturally underweight when you can‚Äôt unless you are unwell whether physically or mentally.   Biggest thing that pissed me off in a long time was people on a cErTaiN sUb insisting Natalia Dyer was naturally thin and that she probably eats whatever she wants all because there was a photo of her holding an ice cream cone. It was just so ignorant. You can‚Äôt know if she actually ate it, did she purge it later? Was that all she ate today? I do believe you can be thin naturally but not underweight and people constantly fight this.   I have to be about 4 pounds underweight to start looking like the ideal female body type and its total bull when people say those women are just fit. They were (or weren‚Äôt) fit and then they got their body fat low enough that‚Äôs it. When I am extremely fit I am still in the healthy BMI range. Only when I am using food manipulation techniques and exercise do I look close to our society‚Äôs idea of the normal fit insta girl.",False,False

I know a few people who claim to have ED but they just think it's a quirky and cute claim to make and it's really frustrating and alienating...

Merely suggest someone who looks underweight might have an ED and people lose their minds!  I think it's the ingrained belief, from media and weight loss industry, that ANYONE can become ideal skinny if they just tried hard enough, no repurcussions.  But the reality is underweight is pushed as the ideal and healthy weight and being underweight is HARD. You developed an ED on this neverending ideal body pursuit??  It's your fault, don't assume you're the majority.  Because that'll make me think my ideal body/ what I think is the ideal body for a partner is unattainable and now this is a personal attack!   It's not like they're trying to preserve decency or something, they've just stigmatized EDs in their mind to the point that they think it's offensive to talk about.  Like so many memes talking about being tired all the time, not enjoying hobbies, and wanting to sleep the day away hit the front page.  All the comments go, bro that's depression, me too lol.  Imagine if people went on the defensive about that like they do EDs?  Omg no bro, the person is probably just tired and needs more sleep than the average person, but otherwise lives a healthy lifestyle! Bro it's pretty offensive to suggest they have depression even though they openly share common symptoms of it, you're projecting, not everyone is depressd just because you are.  In short, I feel you lol.",False,False
