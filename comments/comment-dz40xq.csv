I practiced B/P behaviors for two years and told my family I “couldn’t keep food down” and they 100% accepted it. Asked me once if I relapsed and I said no and they were like “ok cool”. I mean my family was pretty fucked in general but denial is powerful, powerful, powerful stuff.   Question is - would you feel better if she was calling you out on it or would it actually make you feel worse? (I know for me I desperately want someone to notice until they actually DO and then I’m like ohcrapohcrapohcrap)  If you feel like you want her to know maybe you could come up with a time/way for you to talk to her about it?  Regardless, you are worthy and you are loved. EDs can suck a big one - all this shit is complicated and has no logic to it. ❤️",False,False

My mom used to do this too. I think she know damn well something is up but she’s got no clue how to bring it up.,False,False
