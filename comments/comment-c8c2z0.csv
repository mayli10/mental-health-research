You may be sure your brain is a sick fuck, but with piercing so personal and sensitive you just won't be simply able to let yourself slip into an infection. There is a sense of basic human survival in every single one of us and I think, that many people end like me - taking care about the piercing and themselves more",False,True

I had my cartilage in my ears pierced a few times, and one wrong move will cause it to get infected (even once you think its healed!) so I imagine the tongue is just as bad",False,False

I've heard it can cause nerve damage and much pain. Be careful, too. Just cause it happened once doesn't mean it can't happen again",False,True

I just had no idea that just playing with the piercing could chip a tooth â€” it didnâ€™t touch my teeth except for when I was playing  with it, and I specifically got that piercing to minimize tooth damage â€” and now Iâ€™m sad about my chipped tooth, so I just wanna make sure the same thing doesnâ€™t happen to you!",False,False

How could I stick my fingers down my throat without pulling the living hell out of my tongue? So i think purging is not happening for a looong time, until I decide to remove the bar from my tongue. Talking about throwing up, that piercing is pretty sensitive, so I am reaaally cautious of cleaning it properly even after every time I eat, so I can't imagine the pain and possible infection after purging",False,True

I have an iron bar going straight through my tongue and I feel it even if I don't think about it ðŸ˜‚ also, I play with it intuitively and it's kinda weird feeling. Well, I hope it won't wear off that quickly, cause I pretty much enjoy not having the urge to eat myself to death and then vomit all night every single day.
