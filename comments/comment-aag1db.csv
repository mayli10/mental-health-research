It started happening less frequently when I wrote my name on things, with big “DO NOT EAT” signs on it, and stopped completely when I started labeling exactly how many of each thing were left in the bag/container (ex 46 chips left in this bag, 38 kernels of corn, 27 beans, etc). From then on, you can start asking her to replace everything she’s eaten ESPECIALLY if it’s whole packages like that! As soon as I did all that at my moms house the “surprises” of my food being gone stopped entirely. Passive aggressive notes get you far. ",False,False
