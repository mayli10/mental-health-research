Same height difference. I gained almost 30lbs between him making me good food and me no longer running 5ks. He gained too, and now we weigh about the same, but mine is fat and his is muscle. I'm working on it but trying to do it kind of healthily.   It's normal to gain some weight when you enter a happy relationship, so at least it's a symptom of you being happy. I'm sure you'll be able to lose those few pounds, but even of you don't, I'm sure you will still look fine. 6lbs isn't honestly that much, unless you're a chihuahua or something. I'm only 5'3"" and my weight easily fluctuates 5lbs throughout the day. Just try to not beat yourself up too much if something happens and the number doesn't go down as much as you want.   I hope you have a nice birthday and vacation, and that the wedding is pleasant.",False,False
