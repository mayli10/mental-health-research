Sodium (which is in a lot of food even if it’s not “salty” !) and carbs cause crazy water retention, and you can see this in how people who do keto (or whatever bs fad diet is popular) lose a ton of “weight” the first week, it’s like that in reverse for bingeing, it’s not fat weight, your body just needs to hold on to water to process the food. For every one gram of carbs, 2-4g of water is stored and that adds up ! A random example is that if you were to eat like 20 slices of bread, you would “gain” like ~ 1.8 lbs which is all water weight. Same with sodium but I’m not sure of the exact numbers.  Then you have the physical food weight on your body, which adds up and if you have an ED then generally your digestive system can be a bit slow to get rid of it all.  And then the thermic effect of food, i.e. the energy required to digest it. This is amplified with bingeing as you are eating a lot, so the work done to digest the food is a lot. Around 5-10% of the calories in carbs for example are actually used to digest the food itself, and in protein it’s higher at like 20-35% ! While this won’t cancel it out, it does reduce the net calories a fair bit.  And the body isn’t that efficient as absorbing energy when you enter a binge as the sheer volume of food can be difficult to process.  So don’t panic, I don’t know your exact calorie numbers but you probably have at the absolute most gained maybe 3 lbs ? Or less ?  You haven’t ruined everything and try not to fall into a binge/restrict cycle because of this one slip up x",False,False

I know it's often said, but I did the math: you'd have to eat nearly 5000 calories in excess every day ON TOP of your tdee, which is probably around 1500ish as a conservative estimate.  In summary: definitely not, don't worry about it, it's most likely food weight and waste etc.",False,False
