As for my bf he knows I have dysmorphia and tries his best to help me but he really sucks at talking about feelings in general and sometimes it seems like he has no social cues and says hurtful stuff inadvertently or says stuff he doesn'tmean cause he panics. I sometimes ask him if parts of my body are really how I see them and I ask him to be honest so I  have a sense of how skewed my perception of myself is, he has always reassured me I was fine and not as gross as I think but I recently found out he sometimes has lied to make me feel better and now it's a bit weird to talk about this stuff with him, I know he really tries to get better at talking about this stuff but it's really hard for him and I get it but man it sucks sometimes.

Also, is this a normal thing? Why are you with someone who makes you feel bad if it is?",False,False

I wear a size 25-26 (5’9 / 121.4 pounds) and yet I get measurements over 30 inches when I tape measure my waist.   So I measured my pants and they were basically correct. One was .5 inches bigger and one was .75 inches bigger. They were both from Forever 21.,False,False
