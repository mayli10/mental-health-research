I'm like way sick though. Not sure what's wrong. I get bloated, get nauseous, experience general abdominal pain all over, and get occasional stabbing pains in various locations. Maybe minor vomiting at times? Hard to tell. Idk the difference between regurgitating small amounts of food and acid reflux. I don't think it's acid though. I rarely experience pain that feels like stomach acid burning me. I think I did after Thanksgiving dinner, but not since then. Idk if food coming up with acid reflux is normal. It does seem to me that this is most likely not losing fat though. Like, artificial weight loss. Water and stuff. Makes sense since I get so bloated at times. I noticed that I seem to be quite thinner lately and yet my weight only dropped 1 lb at the doctor's office, so idk what's up. I don't think you can be healthy and lose weight that quickly.",False,False
