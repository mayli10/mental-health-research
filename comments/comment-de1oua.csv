I am casually jealous of a lot of bodies and definitely jealous of those that restrict enough to have lean bodies. I'm not sure I could take the jealousy as far as needing to be tubed though... It sounds unpleasant.   I'm sorry you're feeling inadequate. This is also the story of my Life. We have value even if we have to work to remember.,False,False

It's understandable that you're thinking about your emotions since you weren't as close, you don't need to feel bad about it. You aren't in control of your emotions/thoughts, judging you for something you can't control wouldn't be right.   I hope she's found some rest now. I didn't know her, but she sounds like a nice person.",False,False
