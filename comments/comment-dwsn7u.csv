I hate that whole ""anorexic is for everyone"" bullshit, because it's just like, well, great, let's continue the stigma of how the only diagnosis that ""matters"" is anything that's not OSFED.   And people get so damn pissy when you point out that no, really, ""typical"" AN \*does\* have a weight requirement.",False,False

Someone replies that his source is just anecdotal.   The second comment says it's not recognized. This one has a reply from someone that works in ED research with sources why the comment is not correct despite orthorexia not being recognized in the latest iteration of the DSM.  The third comment says it's not recognized in the DSM and doubts that it's a real and common eating disorder. This one has a reply from someone that works in ED research with sources why the comment is not correct despite orthorexia not being recognized in the latest iteration of the DSM.  The last one is a longer comment chain and the person who works in ED research continues to argue in favour of orthorexia and provides facts and sources.  Three people are not representative of a whole subreddit, especially when the comments containing an opposing viewpoint are the ones that are upvoted.  The only person that uses non-factual language is no.3, but they're nowhere near as hateful as OP.  The text that was submitted is about eating habits, someone claims to have anorexia and asks ""where is the line?"".  There is a single comment that says the line (to anorexia nervosa, not the atypical version) is getting purposefully under a BMI of 18.5 and have it interfere with everyday life. They don't claim that atypical anorexia nervosa doesn't exist.!&lt;",False,False

It is about how people use the DSM as a substitute for thinking critically about mental disorders.,False,True

It ain't that deep.,False,False
