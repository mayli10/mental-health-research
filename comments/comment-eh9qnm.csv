My mom was/is in denial about mental health issues in general. I think a lot of people are under the impression that you can will yourself well when it comes to certain things. It's also easier to say someone else's kid needs help, but mine is fine. Like they think of it as an extension of themselves. But you should be so very proud of yourself. It's hard to seek treatment on your own, but you are doing it!",False,False

There’s nothing to be ashamed of and you’re absolutely doing the best thing for yourself by telling them! I believe in you 💕",False,False

I’m doing the best I can right now, which is not very well. But I’m going to tell my therapist how I’ve been feeling tomorrow (I normally hold back a lot). I’m dreading having to tell her I bought a scale because I couldn’t handle not having one and that I relapsed in self harm. I know she’s there to help but I hate admitting how mentally ill I am",False,True

And they are emotionally and religiously abusive. It’s rough. I’m out of my moms house now but I still rely on them in part financially. Can’t wait for the day I am 100% financially independent. Then I can finally set some real boundaries,False,True

Goodluck with treatment and I hope that going forward, your life gets better with or without the support of your parents 💕",False,False

My dad basically just told me to get over it when he found out i wasn’t eating. In middle school when he found out i was self harming he grounded me. They basically thought it was all for attention- and even if it was, why would you ignore such a loud cry for help?  I’m so sorry you’ve gone through this. It’s helpful to remember that they are humans just like everyone else and not everyone understands mental illness. I hope you are ok ❤️",False,False
