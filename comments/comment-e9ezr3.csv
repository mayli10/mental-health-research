I don't want her to call my mom about it or something and that's probably what she'll do. I don't want it blown out of proportion, but at the same time, I don't want my disordered eating to get out of proportion. I guess it's getting a lot worse lately cause I'm dealing with a lot of other difficulties in my life rn, including other disorders, bad grades, etc.",False,True
