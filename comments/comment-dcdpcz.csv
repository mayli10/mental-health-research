I just want people to care and talk to me and want to know how I am. And being underweight garners a lot of concern. People like to boil it down to attention-seeking, the same with cutting, but my answer to people who say that others starve or self-harm for attention was literally always ""if someone is so desperate that they'll hurt themselves just so a person will pay attention to them, they are obviously in a lot of pain."" I don't think of attention seeking behavior as negative necessarily, I think of it as a cry for help or as a reach for connection with those people we want in our lives.",False,False
