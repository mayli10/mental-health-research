I don't mean being supportive of her weight loss, but just of her in general. Like, be there for her if she ever has a really bad day or something. Eating disorders are very complicated mental illnesses. They're not like depression and anxiety disorders. They're like personality disorders, addiction and other more serious illnesses. Even mental health professionals often aren't properly equipped to treat somebody with an eating disorder. In fact, professional help for eating disorders almost always involves nothing more than forcing a patient to eat a health amount of food. They rarely bother to get to the core of the issue and try to solve it. Understanding where an eating disorder started from is crucial to treating it, but you can't read minds. It also takes a sincere willingness to get better on the part of the ED sufferer if there will be any lasting improvement.",False,False

It makes sure she knows she can talk to you, that you care, and that you’re listening. It’s really different from person to person, so specifics will have to come from her, but right now the best thing you can do is be there for her. (Also make sure you talk about other stuff. Ed’s take up a lot of time and mental space, don’t let it take over y’alls relationship too)",False,False
