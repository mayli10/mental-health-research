It should be a dark liquid and have tea bag tags sticking out one side. Plain chai tea has no syrup, so don't ask for any. Keep trying! And feel free to correct them if they get it wrong; in my experience,they're always happy to fix it if you're unsatisfied.",False,False

I got it and it is foamy at the top. I got sugar free syrup in it but it doesnâ€™t make sense that itâ€™s all foamy and creamy colored if itâ€™s plain right?? I feel like they put milk and stuff in it and now I canâ€™t drink it ðŸ˜­ sorry for the rant lol,False,True

I get it all the time. They might ask if you want them to leave room (for milk, cream, and/or sugar), so just say no. Zero cals, delicious leaf water.  I sometimes get a chai tea latte as a treat. To make it low cal, I ask for a half-sweet chai tea latte with almond milk and its about 140 cals for a grande. I think that's as low as the latte will go.",False,False

How would I order just the plain chai tea bag in a drink so that it would be zero cals? Sorry, I am literally so socially awkward I can't function. Lol. And I never really go to starbucks or any tea/coffee places really.",False,True

The latte mix is from concentrate, so drinking that is going to be nasty, lol.  Idk about mixing it with water tho. Might not be awful.  They also sell sugar free chai latte mix you can mix with almond milk at home, so you have a chai latte for 30 cals. Highly recommend. :)",False,False

Just ask for chai or a black tea and throw your own cinnamon or sweetener in it.   Asking for a chai tea latte without any milk is like asking for a cheeseburger with no cheese. ,False,False
