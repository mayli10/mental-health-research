I don't smoke anymore, I vape. But I can't quit vaping. It really sucks. And it just DOESN'T help. I've tried gum, patches, lozenges, etc. It does not curb my appetite. If it really worked super well there wouldn't be fat smokers.           Coffee and diet soda work so much better than stupid nicotine. Trust me. It isn't even close to worth it.",False,False
