I had a period of a couple of years where I was what I would consider totally recovered:  I ate 2-3 meals a day, plus snacks, didn't weigh myself, didn't count calories or restrict or purge, wasn't constantly distressed by my body.  Even so, *I didn't forget*.  Every day I was very aware of my body and of the food I was eating, and every time I overate I was very aware that, even though I wasn't tempted to purge, I *could* have purged and relieved the discomfort.  Of course, now I've relapsed, so maybe that influences how much you'll agree with me that I was totally recovered, but I just don't think you can forget.  I think it's always going to be there as an extreme level of awareness of food and body, even if you are able to control the compulsions.  Even if/when I return to my recovered state, I think I will still have my ED inside my head, it'll just be manageable.  I don't think it can be excised.",False,False

Those are very fair and valid thoughts. It means a lot that you are even thinking about this, and it is very overwhelming. I'm 26yo. I've been battling anorexia from a very young age. I've been through many 'good' and 'bad' periods. I believe that, unfortunately, its a journey that never really stops. I just have some days that can be really good, and days that are not.   Recovery is not like a light switch you flip on and ta-da! Done! No way. It's more of a mental mindset you have to adjust and grow every day. It really is a progress and every one is at a different stage to a different degree...as corny as that sounds.",False,False

I never really had a big problem with body dysmorphia but did have trouble coming to terms with gaining weight. The main thing that helped me come to terms with it that since i'm still so young, my body is still growing and gaining weight is inevitable during this stage of life. It's just a fact of life.",False,False
