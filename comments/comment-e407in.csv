If you needed IP, you should be able to take a medical leave. That would at least allow you to keep your insurance.",False,False

So if you were a normal weight but constantly engaged in ED behaviors and your mental health was deteriorating, you would probably meet criteria for admission. The insurance company doesn’t want to pay for expensive unnecessary treatment. They may determine that IP is the best option based on both physical and mental health.",False,False

Although I was very much underweight, my bloodwork came back for the most part normal. They said if my heart rate was any lower they would of had to admit me, I believe it was in the low 40s. I had to get weekly bloodwork and vital checks and agree to be wheeled around to class on the disability golf cart so that I wasn’t walking more than I needed to. It also helped my case that although my ED was at its worst, my grades were still as good as usual.   Of course it will vary between each patient and university, but I think if you prove you are committed to recovery and your vitals are not too bad you won’t have any issues. Hope it all goes well!",False,False
