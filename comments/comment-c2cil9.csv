(Sorry, I'm just interested.)  I'm sorry your ED is interfering in your life like this. I hope at least your gf tried to approach the subject in a productive way and not just an accusatory one. Have you considered seeking help, talking to a doctor, etc? That is in no way meant to be a pressuring question - I'm not in recovery, never have been - it just sounds like you're feeling lost right now. And if you haven't had an ED for long, this is the best time to deal with it.",False,False
