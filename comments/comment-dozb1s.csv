Eating can be really painful. And it took me a whole year to gain just 15 lbs. But then I ended up in the hospital for a night and lost 10 lbs very quickly after that. I felt a lot healthier when I was losing weight, but now I'm getting into an area where I'm getting more sick as I lose weight instead. Eating enough to stay out of that area makes me sick too though. Until I got rejected treatment by a doctor last month due to my weight I was pretty fine mentally. I have kind of relapsed though. Even on days where I feel I can eat enough I still try not to because if I go over 1000 calories every day I won't lose enough weight in time for my next appointment. That's really dumb though because my BMI is already the same as a girl of average height at 100 lbs which is the weight he said would be concerning. I just kind of can't help it right now. Even though I'm making myself worse trying to get there.",False,False

I cancelled a doctor's appointment that day and didn't leave my bed for hours. The idea of actually passing out was terrifying. And I was so worried about my health as I hadn't even reached my low weight and was already having symptoms I had before along with almost passing out which had never happened before. I really don't want to die, but I also don't see any way to become healthy again. I tried my best and failed. I'm always worried that any time I feel a little weak while I'm out in public that this will be the time I finally pass out and then I wonder what will happen to me if I do.",False,False

In the thread she posted a picture from a week before the heart attack and I‚Äôm already a lot smaller than she was then.
