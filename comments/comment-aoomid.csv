You’re not totally screwed(hehe)   There is not a way of knowing if your body was able to process that pill in time or if it came back up with your purge, unless you saw it, but those pills are tiny. Take your next one tomorrow at your usual time. Definitely use condoms for the rest of the month to be safe though.",False,False

If you missed (or lost) a dosage of anything just say okay and know that you’ll be okay until tomorrow. An overdose is more dangerous than a skilled dose ,False,False
