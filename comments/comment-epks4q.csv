Its totally ok to allow yourself that. Tbh the longer you resist this craving the stronger your binge urges may be. Its normal for your body to crave foods like cereal or nuts. Other options may be a DIY ""trail mix"" with things like popcorn, a few nuts (again one of those single serve packs), and maybe a small bit of chocolate or something else.  I've found that when I've been craving things for a long time, going and buying a small serving and letting myself have it really helps! Even if you buy yourself some cereal, pour a bowl then go trash the rest (like in the dumpster so you can't pull it out and eat it later, ya girl has done that to help too lol) thats an option! You're not being wasteful or bad, I promise!",False,False
