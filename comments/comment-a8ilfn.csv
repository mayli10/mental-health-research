He’s definitely underweight and has been all his life. He’s never had strong hunger signals and will literally forget to eat until he gets a headache and gets sick unless someone reminds him to eat. That’s so nice of him!!,False,True

We’ve been together for over 5 years so we do a lot of just hanging out at each other’s places and just doing whatever. I’m in grad school and he’s in undergrad at two different universities in the same town and there’s times were together basically all the time we’re not in work/class for days at a time. The hard part is he forgets to eat a lot and I take care of people a lot sooo I’ll end up cooking or convincing him to go out to eat in the evenings when he hasn’t eaten all day. He knows I’m still trying to lose and he’s trying to convince me I shouldn’t which makes dinner harder because he also knows I probably haven’t eaten all day either ",False,True

He has a very exerting job and has to eat a ton just to maintain. I got really used to eating a bunch whenever he did, which is how I gained so much weight again. So now I gotta watch him eat tasty food all the time.   He's been really good lately about only eating fast food and stuff when i'm sleeping or on his way to work, etc. He's so good ❤",False,False

I just eat how we eat and then I skip meals whenever someone isn’t around. So unless your boyfriend is there for literally every meal I would say try to make up your deficits in the other meals. ,False,False

And this is kind of a good thing because you're able to take your guard down with him. Unfortunately, a lot of people struggle with this, not just us with EDs.   Are your dates centered around going out to eat?   Maybe try going places where you can walk around like to parks or spots to hike. I know it's colder out now, but maybe go bowling, roller skating, or just walk around some shops. If you go to the movies, bring some grapes or berries in your purse. Or if you do go out to a restraunt maybe try a coffee shop or place like panera where you can fill up on soup. If you are comfortable, just ask for his help in eating less/ better because you're trying to lose a little weight.",False,False
