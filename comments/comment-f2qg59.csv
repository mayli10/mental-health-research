This helps to shed the build up, just make sure not to scratch the skin and rinse thoroughly.    Alternatively:  Paste method, baking soda: I keep a small plastic container of baking soda in my shower. When I first started the no poo method, I would put about 1/2 to 1 tablespoon in my palm and then massage that into my scalp. For the 1st 6 months, I did that about every 4 days. Then for the next 6 months, I did that about once a week. Now, I use about 1 teaspoon of baking soda about once a month (I do other washes in between my baking soda washes). Spray method, baking soda: This method is more popular. Mix about 1 tablespoon of baking soda in about 1 cup of water. Store in a spray or squirt bottle (non-plastic is best). This amount is 1-3 applications (depending on your hair).  And then give yourself a scrubby dub with a nice cloth and rinse again.   I hope this helps ease you a little. Iâ€™m sorry.",False,False
