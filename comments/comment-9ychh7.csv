At the same time people with EDs don't hate their body 24/7 it's more like 80/20 . You Gucci and you don't have to explain yourself to me. ,False,False

I became really impulsive last year and this year part of that was, ""I'm broke and some people like the fat thing so let's do porn.""  I actually made money doing it so I kept going.   Doesn't mean I'm not completely disgusted by myself most of the time. It does actually help me accept what I've become a little though. It's hard to explain. I never even did this when I was skinny. I just needed the money and it worked out. Shrug.   I started losing weight a couple years ago off and on, and the stuff that happened last year showed me that what I did was pointless so I'm just owning what I have now. I'm not going to go so far as to say body acceptance because I will never accept my body no matter the size, but I'm willing to show it off if it makes me the money I need. ",False,True

You gained hundreds of pounds to be undesirable sexually, but you market yourself sexually for the whole world to see?  Unless I'm missing something and you're completely over it now?

It also kind of helps me be somewhat be ok with this, but not really. I didn't even show any pictures of myself until about a year ago, and that was just on dating sites.

It‚Äòs a good thing you are in therapy and you feel comfortable with the therapist. Maybe dating isn‚Äòt such a good idea at the moment.

I was abused as a kid which spurred the anorexia to begin with, but I guess I decided that the other extreme would be better.

He knows everything. He's not eating disorder specified like my last therapist, but he's pretty good. He says I'm especially vulnerable right now and need to be very careful. I just tend to end up in bad situations for some reason. I had a guy come over recently and that ended up kinda rapey with me actually crying on cam a bit so that should give you an idea. I just attract bad people.   I was obviously a bigger mess last year after it all happened, but I drank a ton instead of restricting.

I had a time where I was so torn between becoming skeletal versus a whale, trying to think which would keep me safe more. Then I'd desperately binge at home to gain weight as fast as possible, like it was the only way to keep people from touching me. I've been trying to deal with what happened recently, which has helped push me into a binge/ restrict cycle. I think partly I binge to prove I own my body and can do what I want and destroy myself if I want? I don't know if it helps to know someone understands, but I think I do.
