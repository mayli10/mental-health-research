The treatment of EDs is a horribly misunderstood and often insufficient field, *but* they don't want you to be fat. They want to have enough fat to be healthy, and unfortunately that's pretty much (in my experience) all they can do for you. Whether you hold onto that fat and the accompanying health or lose it all again is a whooooole other story. ",False,False

I have to remind myself that I have distorted views of my own body and how much food I need and force myself to do it. I don’t believe it is bullshit but on a bad day I’ll bitch about it and complain that it’s bullshit, but I’m just venting my frustrations.",False,False

It's well known that starvation makes eating disorder symptoms worse and that patients respond better to therapy with weight gain, but I'm skeptical that most gain enough weight to make enough of a difference, although I'm also skeptical one could ever reach a point of complete symptom cessation. I've seen too many 'recovered' ED sufferers that, while they've gained weight and claim healthy BMIs (worded this way for factual accuracy, because I don't know what they weigh or previously weighed), they spend a lot of time publically focused on food, weight, or body image,  or they've built their career or image around it. At the least, even if it doesn't improve eating disorder symptoms, it does lower your risk of premature death to be in a normal weight range. ",False,False

But it is an easy way for a doctor or institution to point at something physical, say ""all better!"", take your money, and push you out the door. Note: it is sometimes necessary in the moat severe cases to focus on weight restoration first, because the patient is on death's doorstep. I am not talking about that.     When I went to therapy for recovery, I told then straight up that I didn't want to focus on weight gain because I was very wary of the idea that I was doing anything wrong. I wanted them to convince me that the way I was treating myself was wrong before I made any real, physical moves to change. So we did. And guess what? I was able to change my mindset, get into healthier eating and mindful eating, and ended up healthier than most people I know. The mental aspect is more important than the physical. ",False,False
