I generally don‚Äôt have issues getting fiber in but I like to think it helps my stomach figure out what it is doing. As for protein I just want like the bare minimum. I feel bad not getting enough fats in my day but also I just want to sometimes eat without having to game everything around and instead on some days just get the sustenance over with",False,False

I used to eat whatever as long as it was under my daily limit. (Food warning) KitKats with peanut butter on them, pasta with fettuccini alfredo, straight up cheese, lattes, spaghettios... etc.   Now I am really worried about not getting proper nutrition while restricting.   I try not to eat things I personally deem unhealthy now because I feel like it‚Äôs a wasted opportunity for nutrition. I still eat within the same caloric limit but I try to only eat predominately my safe foods (those I feel are low cal and healthy) because every calorie of ‚Äúbad‚Äù food is just bringing me closer to not eating for the day without hitting my nutritional requirements.   Granted, I probably am still undernourished. But I am totally an orthorexic now and it goes hand in hand with my workout routine.   By the way, I‚Äôm not trying to say that anyone who eats those things I mentioned above is unhealthy! It‚Äôs totally fine if you those things, I still do! I just am stressed about it now where as before I wasn‚Äôt!",False,False
