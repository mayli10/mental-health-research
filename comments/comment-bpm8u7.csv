Changing from carbs to fat is killer to me, I get sick as a dog for about a week, but once my body is used to burning fat for energy then fasting becomes a lot easier.   I think because a lot of low-cal foods are carb heavy, that’s the reason most people on this sub have trouble fasting, because most are eating calorie restricted and what little calories they intake are low-cal foods that happen to be high carb. (Fruits, sweet potatoes, lentils and rice cakes were my main things when restricting and they’re all very high carb)  If I’m not wrong, I believe eating carbs does make you crave more carbs. Something about insulin production, but it’s been a while since I’ve taken a biochem class and I don’t want to pretend to be an expert. If I have time later I’ll comb through the recent scientific literature and see what’s up with that now. For me personally, carbs are a huge trigger.

So I had a lot of fat stored up that keeps me going. I also closed my business to reevaluate my life so at the moment I don't have to work which makes it easier.

And why does my brain think fasting is some pinnacle of achievement anyhow? I really think that’s a distorted perception because for me, fasting amounts to pumping my ED full of steroids. It’s possible that for some folks it’s a fine activity, but for me it’s just not. And ultimately I gotta worry about me. After all, other people can do lots of things - solve differential equations, run 5 minute miles, tat lace. Basing my self-concept on how I fall short of other people’s accomplishments is a recipe for depression.  I mean, it’s cool that the body has mechanisms for fasting, but I’m not some food-insecure Paleolithic human who needs those mechanisms. If eating daily gives me days that are less crappy...that’s a good thing. Plus, with my ED brain, fasting is just a spiraling nightmare because nothing ever feels good enough. “If I did x days, I should do x+1 days, and only doing x days no longer counts.” Finally, my disorder is lying to me if it’s claiming that repeated multi-day fasts is any kind of good for me, cuz no way is my brain doing fasting for any purported health benefits.",False,False
