Thereâ€™s tons of articles though. We simply cannot absorb every single calorie we eat. Iâ€™ve been both obese and underweight and calorie obsessed (though luckily I donâ€™t count anymore!). In over a decade of attempting to calculate exactly how much weight Iâ€™ll gain or lose based on calories alone, I have been wrong most of the time.",False,False

Gaining a pound of body fat in one day is essentially impossible. Iâ€™ve binged over 10,000 calories in a day before, but didnâ€™t actually gain several pounds of fat because of it. Our bodies canâ€™t always process the amount of calories we eat. Give it a couple days and itâ€™ll probably be all gone.",False,False
