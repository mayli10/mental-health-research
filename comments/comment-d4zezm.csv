My significant other wanted me to ""get better."" I was told to choose. Him or ""killing myself.""   &amp;#x200B;  I was concerned that I'd lose him. Not from a break up, but I was worried he would kill himself. So I forced myself. He kept praising me, saying he was ""happy with my progress,"" and that I'm becoming more ""comfortable with food.""   &amp;#x200B;  Fuck that. I'm overweight and fat. I hate myself so much more than before. I'm basically triggering myself every single night to somehow encourage whatever little disordered part of my brain.. and very slowly I'm getting back into the routine of taking the ECA stack. The one that was ""killing me"" apparently. At one point I'll go back to not caring because if I die at least I'll be skinny.   &amp;#x200B;  I, for sure, miss high restriction. I miss having a clear eating disorder. I miss people telling me I need to eat more. Being told by my own psychiatrist that I should go to an outpatient program, despite how much it scared me... I miss weighing myself every morning feeling a little scared, but hopeful because I know I didn't eat so much the day before. I check and I lost another pound or half which does nothing else but encourage me ""to do better.""   &amp;#x200B;  I miss being at my worst. I miss being sick, mainly just the ed sick part.. I miss being skinny and being so happy for achieving my little goal weights...   &amp;#x200B;  And then I see myself in the mirror when I catch myself off guard. I wish that was enough to cause me to gag, but instead it makes my heart ache.",False,False

The reason it's applicable here is because OP said she missed having Anorexia. Which might offend some people.   But this is a mental health sub. People can get mad at OP for what she said, but at the end of the day it's just how she feels (and it's also how I and many others have felt before), it may offend some people but feeling this way is largely because of the eating disorder (though I will say for me it is/was also partially to do with the media too, but that's a whole other can of worms).

Sometimes eating disorders make us see things as more black and white, and devastating, than they actually are. You‚Äôve been thin before, you know how to get there, now you just have to do it in a more sustainable way. If anorexia worked, we wouldn‚Äôt be replacing one eating disorder for another anytime we recover from those habits.

It's been my reality anyways that I would so much rather be anorexic than have bulimia or bed.   I don't think going from one ED to another is recovery though.
