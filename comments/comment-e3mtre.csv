It is different omg you are so skinny you are going to brake (ok with me) than smth like omg you look disgustingly thin, you look like you belong in a concentration camp, eat a fucking burger.    of course it is most the positive than negative comments I personally get but some do hurt, mostly because they are meaning to hurt you, and the fact that someone is being mean on purpose is awful. That is why I do almost never post pics of myself I just don't want any comment.",False,False

I used to get asked if I was pregnant because I bloated.   Then I lost some weight and had ppl telling me, oh, you used to be so tubby, but you look better now!   Now I get told that my arms are sinewy or gross, or that I look sick and too skinny, or that it must be nice to be ‘naturally’ skinny.   I fucking hate all of it. Don’t comment on my fucking body.

I'm trying to recover and I'll be genuinely happy when I'll finally get back to a healthy weight. I'll look better, I'll feel better, and I'll be closer to my idea of ""perfect"". Really, my orthorexia is just a manifestation of my pathological perfectionism. My current issue is that it's really hard for me to eat a calorie surplus in order to actually get better, because in my head calorie surplus = overeating = unhealthy and wrong. Fuck this, I want to get back to being strong and lean instead of bony and frail. Is that too much to ask?",False,False

People giving me unsolicited advise or comments about my size, often under a guise of “concern for my health” felt hurtful, intrusive, and wholly out of place.

I don’t really feel ‘shamed-for-being-skinny’ per se, but body-shamed for my physical appearance which isn’t something I can control. That inherently feels unfair to me. I’ve had people literally walk up to me and GRAB my arm and loudly ask “How is it possible for you to carry that heavy binder with these SCRAWNY little arms?!” Ive had male coworkers come up behind me and start massaging my shoulders without asking and comment on how “bony” I am, then dig HARDER into my clavicles. I’ve heard people gossiping about how they’ve never seen me eat (I eat normal portions at work all the time, just not around that specific person) and how I “wouldn’t be that skinny without an eating disorder.” It is so, incredibly hurtful to be body shamed in any way. But none of these people thought their words/actions were harmful, and no one else ever tried to stop them- because I am *privileged* for being skinny. Because I *deserve* to be publicly humiliated for being underweight. Because being thin means I’m *asking for it* and any sexual harassment is “just a compliment.” Because clearly, being underweight is a CHOICE, not a mental illness that I suffer the physical and psychological consequences of everyday. But like the stereotypes and racial prejudice I’ve faced as a minority all my life, my “skinny privilege” is just another part of life that I have to accept and let happen because no one will *ever* sympathize with a dumb skinny bitch.",False,False

But I honestly don’t know what I look like to people who don’t know I have an ed or haven’t seen be prior to my weight loss. I obviously look very different because I was “normal” (closer to underweight) and now very underweight so much friends know I’m sick. My roommate said it’s like watching someone die. And I don’t blame her and I’m not upset. I think I do look sick but I like the way I look. I feel way more confident in tight fitting clothes.   Also skinny shaming is bs. Skinny people have way more privilege than overweight people. People don’t pass the same judgement at all.,False,False

I received a lot of flak for it and was scolded harshly for not eating well.   Wasn't great. But inside... Inside I was in glee. I felt validated. Like ""Yeah bitch, finally you're restricting enough. Good job""  Of course, I later figured out a reason to put the heat off my ass, saying I was just dehydrated. (and that may as well be the real reason)   But what I am saying is, I totally get how someone criticizing you can feel good.  &gt; Even if they say it’s ugly how skinny I am it feels good. Am I the only one?  You are not alone.    But I guess it's not the same for everyone. Not all people are willingly skinny etc. And it can be hurtful.",False,False
