Sm but I love bread and ice cream (I only don’t eat that now cause I cut dairy for skin stuff)  But also the idea of eating a protein bar w ~200cals? Disgostin and not worth it  But I’ll have 2 of those fiber one bars if I’m rlly hungry and want something sweet  Or a handful of granola that’s easy 100+ cals  So yeah it b like that sometimes  Also raw kale? Fuck no. Cooked kale? Now that’s some good shit right there like it’s literally the same thing w the same cals It’s just like. Somehow safer?? Idfk,False,False
