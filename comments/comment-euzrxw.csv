Like I've mentally checked out and I have no control. It's like something has taken over my legs and I physically cannot stop myself.",False,True

Youâ€™re a little snowball rolling down a mountain gathering snow. Youâ€™re in a very vulnerable place. Being undernourished makes every stress even more difficult, especially if you lack other ways to cope. The body is going to have to force the mind to spin down. If you are pacing: stop. Sit down. The perpetual motion lets the anxiety keep going.  Force yourself to sit down. If you can, take a hot shower. Your body temperature dropping as you get out can slow you down. I want to tell you to eat something. I know how that is, you donâ€™t want to, I know. But starvation makes anxiety worse. Stay in your room if you want, but take steps to make the environment more soothing.",False,False

I don't even wanna leave my room tomorrow. How the hell do I go about this? It's not like I can kick him out. It's my mom's call. She owns the house, not me. So I have to be around him and it's just gonna be weird and I'm already in a downward spiral with my ED and I've relapsed with self harm and I just can't take any more. I feel ill.",False,True

In through your nose, out through your mouth. slowly. Turn on some calm music if you can, or a meditation podcast. Force your body to descend from the panic state to get your heart rate down. Your mind will slowly follow.   Your mate is drunk, so he has low inhibitions and behaved inappropriately to you. You didnâ€™t deserve it, but he was out of control. Heâ€™ll probably be embarrassed tomorrow and he should apologize for upsetting you.",False,False
