So for the first 24 hours, you would go without eating. If you ate after exactly 24 hours, you would have eaten in the first hour of the next 24-hour-block. This would castcade onwards, continuing to eat once within each 24-hour block of time. The only difference I think between the two definitions is that if you define a day as a block of 24 unbroken hours then you have fasted completely for the first ""day"", but if you define a day as a calendar/week day then you (probably) would have eaten something on the first ""day"" to start the 24 hour countdown.  I think.",False,False

So say on Monday you start eating at 9am and don't finish until 10am. 24 hours later is 10am Tuesday morning. So, you eat again at 10am, then finish at 11am. 24 hours after that is 11am Wednesday morning. Repeat.  Practically speaking, eventually you'll reach a point where you would not be awake for your eating window, say 11pm. Either you break the cycle and eat something earlier - which means that you've eaten more than once within one 24 hour period - or you fast for longer than 24 hours and wait until the next morning to eat.  Example one: You finish eating at 11pm Thursday night. 24 hours later would be 11pm Friday night, which you feel is too late to eat, so you decide to eat at 10am Friday morning. The time since your last meal is only 11 hours so you have broken the string of 24-hour fasts.  Example two: You finish eating at 11pm Thursday night. 24 hours later would be 11pm Friday night, which you feel is too late to eat, so you simply go to bed and eat at 8am Saturday morning. You have fasted for 33 hours and did not eat anything for the entirety of Friday.  Example three: You continue the cycle of 24 hour fasts unbroken and simply stay awake/go to sleep around your eating window.  An alternative would be to keep one consistent hour-long eating window every day and fast for 23 hours instead of 24. This would be called a 23:1 fast.  Consistently eating every second day would mean that you were fasting more than 24 hours at a time.",False,False

BUT i also just realized that this depends on your definition of “a day,” for me it’s whenever i wake up until when i go to sleep again. so in the example above i’d be eating every day. if you look at any random collection of 24 consecutive hours as a day then teeeechnically yes you’re eating every other day. i think?!",False,False
