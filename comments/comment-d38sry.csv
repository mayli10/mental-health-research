Basically, during a panic attack, you can’t just think DONT PANIC. That makes it worse. So instead, think about and acknowledge all the feelings. “My heart is beating fast. My breathing is shallow. This is a panic attack.”  Then you start distancing yourself by saying thing like “I’m noticing this panic attack. I’m thinking about the fact that I’m noticing this panic attack.”  So instead of thinking DONT EAT ALL THE COOKIES, I think “Those cookies look yummy. my mouth is watering. I want to eat all the cookies.” And then progress to “I’m thinking about eating all the cookies. I’m thinking about binging. I’m noticing I’m thinking about binging.”",False,False
