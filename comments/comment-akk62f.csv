And you’re absolutely right, I love that girl to death and she is my very best friend. It killed me when I found out she was bulimic. My ED developed after hers and now I just understand her so much more. It’s definitely weird that it’s a thing that we bond over but life is weird. We grew up in a household of food-loving over-eaters so it does make sense that we have food issues. ",False,True

As we got older, it's funny, we both had secret eating behaviors, separately.  I have orthorexia/anorexia now and I'm so relieved she's normal, since I was afraid she might wind up overweight. Still, every time I talk on the phone with her, we end up waxing poetic about all sorts of foodstuffs... things I pretend I'd love to eat, but in actuality, I never will. She knows this. It's pretty messed up.  I don't know, the way you describe you and your sister, it sounds like of sweet. Like a fucked-up bond that the two of you share. There aren't many people I feel totally comfortable with, eating-wise, so cherish that connection.",False,False

Me and my brother will go through very long periods of either binging or serious restriction, I tend to restrict more while he binges more. My older sister restricts. My oldest sister has BED but she hasn’t been able to admit it to herself. It’s very strange given that we all lived in the same house and are relatively around the same age for us to be so different in our eating habits. ",False,False
