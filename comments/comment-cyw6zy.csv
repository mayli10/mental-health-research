In summary, it's a woman tweeting the nasty rant you mentioned above about people stealing plus-size clothes, along with a video screenshot of a youtuber showing how to alter large pants smaller; the pants look to be maybe a size 10, not even plus-size.  It is an absolutely ridiculous stand to take! There's no one besides capitalism that's gatekeeping fucking pants from anyone, and I agree with you about the size availability. Every time I go to a thrift store there's nothing my size (30 inch waist, men's pants), it's all muuuuch larger sizes. Women's clothing to my recollection (I'm trans) also had mostly clothes larger than my size.  The tweet has gotten a lot of backlash though, so I'll quote some of my favorite clapbacks to her tweet:  &gt;""As a fellow plus-size person... I don't care if someone smaller then me buys it before I get a chance. It's a thrift store. Let them have their oversized plus sweaters. Or pants to alter. I won't tell someone how to dress based off their body size.""   &gt;   &gt;""imagine thinking there are only 5 pairs of jeans left in the world""   &gt;   &gt;""She said and I quote: “It's BONKERS to me that someone would do this instead of just BUYING THE JEANS THEY WANT” pretty sure those are the jeans she wanted and you’re blowing this way outta proportion""   &gt;   &gt;""these videos are for people who have lost weight and possibly can’t afford or don’t want to buy new clothing every time they drop a few pounds but good try honey""",False,False
