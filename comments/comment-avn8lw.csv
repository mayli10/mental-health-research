I was 33 before i even realized I had an eating disorder. My husband knew long before I did. Somehow I thought it was relatively normal to obsessively search calorie content and home made emetics, and be homicidally jealous of people who can vomit at will. (I've known a few)  And I didnt know men also suffer from eating disorders until joining proed a year ago. I'm not sure if that's due to the knowledge just not being out there or eating disorders still not being well understood or if I'm just dumb. I'll leave that up to you all to decide. ",False,False

One of my nursing school textbooks did the same thing, and it was infuriating.
