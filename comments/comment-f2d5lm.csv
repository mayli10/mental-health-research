But now I just restrict in the days after. I know it will even out calorie wise and that the bloating will go down after a day. I tell myself that the food was already eaten so no use fixating on it now. Only thing I can do is change the present.,False,False

But I’m sick as fuck for two days and I can’t eat a thing.   I avoid binging by being absolutely terrified of food. The only time I do binge is if I’m drunk or high- which also causes me to quickly purge. Any other time I’m just purging a normal meal I was forced to eat.,False,False
