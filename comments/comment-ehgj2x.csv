Also she knew I like cooking and baking but I haven‚Äôt done much of that because...I‚Äôm fucking anorexic!!! So she would Be like why don‚Äôt you make a cheese cake since you love that and eat a small piece or two a week. Like bitch wtf also did you not hear me that I have ortho tendencies.  I stopped seeing her when she started to ask me more about my diet because she wanted to loose weight for a beach trip and said my diet of basically no carbs and all raw veg and canned light soup was super healthy...   I‚Äôm pretty sure she was accidentally listed under ED specialists and then realized she had no clue what to do but didn‚Äôt want to lose me as a patient.,False,False

I frequently run into therapists who either *really* believe things that aren‚Äôt true about weight and metabolism because they weren‚Äôt taught well in school and haven‚Äôt kept up with the state of that research OR therapists who know how nutrition works but think lying to their patients about it will convince them to recover, so they lie anyway. It‚Äôs especially frustrating because a lot of people with EDs are *very* knowledgeable about nutrition, especially now, so it just feels paternalistic.",False,False

There's this air around recovery that anorexic people especially don't see anything wrong and just believe that doctors are 'trying to make you fat'. I'm pretty sure that 'denial' is even a point in the DSM. But just from interactions I've had with people, I think that for a lot of us that isn't really the case.  In the same vein as that: dysmorphia doesn't necessarily mean being underweight and seeing an obese person in the mirror, there are so many other ways someone could be experiencing it. There was just a post about that on here a few weeks ago that does a great job of explaining it.   Although I guess that's more of a social misunderstanding. I'm not sure if it's something that psychiatrists screw up very often bc I'm shit at trying to deal with my problems lol",False,False
