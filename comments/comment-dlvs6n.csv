My trigger number is &gt;!120!&lt; lbs. If I get higher than that, I'm bound to get back into an OW bmi. I normally maintain between &gt;!115 and 117!&lt; now, so it's not the best and still pretty close to that trigger number, but it's enough to typically not go over that trigger number, even with water/food weight fluctuations. If I get close to that number, I tend to heavily restrict, fast, and c/s until I return to the normal weight.  But I also have a competitive factor, that I only realized/accepted recently. Basically, I always need to be ""perfect"" or better than/more successful than my sister at every aspect of life. It is absolutely horrible, especially because there's really no realistic competition as I am (as terrible as it sounds) more successful than her at everything and I don't even need to try hard :( There's more factors to my competitiveness with others besides my sister too, but I don't get as triggered from other people.  Also I told my bf that I have an ED last week, so I feel the need to prove it even more now lol.",False,False
