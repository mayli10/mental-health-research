Very skinny too and 6'1. I only realized later in life that being exposed to this from birth messed me up a little. About a year ago I caught her chewing and spitting at a restaurant in a togo cup. Then I realized religion was just the excuse. I have daughters and try to make myself as normal as possible. I always sit down for dinner with my girls and eat all my meals in front of them. My husband is very healthy and fit and mentioned getting a food scale. Hell. To. The. NO!!!! I don't want them seeing me weigh out food and thinking that's normal.,False,False

I only learned how to eat properly when I moved in with my mom and (step)dad.   But by then it was kinda too late. I only learned about eating healthy. The bad habits were already formed and stuck.   So I know what I should be doing but I can’t resist eating the junk. And I hate it. I want to be healthy but it’s so hard. And not like physically but like mentally. ",False,False

I never had a chance of learning ""normal"" eating lol",False,False

My father had multiple affairs and I remember being &lt;5 years old and bringing my mom diet coke and carrots to her room as she tried to survive that pain all with 4 kids. Her doing  tons of working out and then bingeing on a whole box of cheez-its at nighttime.  I've seen the opposite side also of eating yourself to 300+ because they have nothing left to give anyone. I've come to forgive my parents and realize they too were just young people trying to figure out their own demons the best they knew how. ,False,False
