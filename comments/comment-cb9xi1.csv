I think I do need to know. I'm home alone atm so if I cry and freak out at least I can do that in peace, but at the same time, I already feel really alone and idk maybe I'll really want someone there??  Idk I'm kind of venting a lot, I'm a little wine drunk and I can't organize my thoughts right now ughh",False,True

But I think you should definitely wait till you’re ready or make a set date, let’s say in 5 days or whatever you choose. I know it’s tough but no matter what the number says you’re going to be okay, it’s not permanent.  also hey it’s not a dumb crisis! we all have panics like this so don’t feel silly. you’re not alone in this and I’m here if you ever want to talk",False,False
