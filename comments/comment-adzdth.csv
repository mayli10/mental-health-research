Yeah, I still plan calories around it if I'm going out, but I make myself go. I honestly use alcohol the same way for food as for sex: I can more easily enjoy new food when I've had a drink or two :P",False,False

But he's actually pretty good about it due to a lot of food/ anxiety/ mental health issues of his own.  As long as I'm eating something and not starting to have health issues he doesn't tend to step in,  and sharing meals with him keeps me on the high restriction side of things as does my guilt. Because of all this though I do think I tend to be a bit less disordered in my eating. I'm able to do things like high restrict or go OMAD to do social outings. ",False,False

I had other reasons, but something that had been weighing on me (no pun intended) was the way I found it so hard to engage in my eating disorder around him. I gained a lot of weight and was too anxious to have sex.  I'm okay with trying the relationships thing again AFTER I get down to a weight I'm okay with and transition to maintenance",False,False

That way they don't give a damn if I'm fucking up my body.   The happiest relationships I've had are with people who understand though, yknow? People who hurt themselves to in some way too. It takes off all the pressure of secrecy and it's oddly intimate to share horrible thoughts that healthier minds wouldn't think. ",False,False

This is partially because being underweight leads to low estrogen and virtually no sex drive, partially because dates always revolve around food (too many calories) or drinking (also too many calories, and then I stop giving a fuck and eat too much as well). Partially because I always end up realizing I care more about wanting to b/p on the weekend than spend it with some guy and eventually ghost him. And lastly, because I'm so self conscious of my body that I hate being touched.  Every couple of months I begin to feel the need of  the companionship that comes from a relationship, so I'll download Bumble and go on a few dates with a guy until I realize the above and delete the app and stop seeing him.",False,False

Heâ€™d encourage me to eat and seek professional help but thatâ€™s it. He ended up fueling my ED big time.    The last fling I had I think suspected I had issues around food and my body because I hardly ate when around him and asked him if he thought my body was weird. He thought I was really in shape.... LOL   I want to go on dates again but I just wish they didnâ€™t have to revolve around food. ðŸ˜­ i also feel i could never really be in a relationship again because I am so committed to staying small it takes all my energy. I feel it would really turn people off. ,False,False
