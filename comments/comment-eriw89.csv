That would be about average for rent where I live in the U.S. but we pay monthly mostly in my area. I hope you and your family made it through the fires BTW. I'm sorry for you but kind of relieved to hear it isn't just the US that is so backward with healthcare.,False,False

The U.S. health insurance system is a train wreck that has been doused in gasoline instead of water.,False,False

If they ask what the issue is you can give a short description ex I am depressed or I have anxiety or I have issues with eating properly but I really feel uncomfortable discussing that with you I have a bond with my therapist and I am only comfortable discussing my issues in depth with them.,False,False

I know more then one person who's therapist helped them get Medicaid, or food stamps, or housing help set up.",False,False
