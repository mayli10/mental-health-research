I've noticed that it's really easy for me to stay a constant weight and worry less about food if I restrict then binge. Binges are really quick then restricting means I don't have to think about food at all.   I've just posted about something that's helping me. Copied below. x  ""So my therapist isn't accepting that I have an ED and is working with me on my PTSD and OCD instead but they have given me a really useful resource.   https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/Resources/For-Clinicians/Eating-Disorders  I'm almost done with the ""Workbook: overcoming disordered eating: Part 1"" and even though it's like reading a school textbook it is actually helpful. My aim is to complete it, along with the suggested food diary and charts then take it to a therapist that specialises in ED's. I'll have actual evidence in diary form that way and my own thoughts on each aspect of my ED.   Take a look. I answer the questions in a notebook instead of on the sheets because then I can read them on my phone or computer and answer on paper. I have them all printed out too but I find the sheets too big and awkward to write on and not enough space.   I hope this helps at least one of you.""",False,False

Restricting and binging is a symptom of a larger problem, and it should be addressed regardless of how you compare it to others’ disorders.   Honestly I’m glad you’re not restricting endlessly or purging. It really truly sends you down a rabbit hole and just makes life and recovery that much harder.   I do get it though, feeling like our EDs aren’t real because “other people have it worse” or “I haven’t lost any weight”, but I promise that if you feel the need to cope with the stresses of life and your relationship with yourself through binging and restricting, then it’s a good idea to talk to someone about your feelings and get their opinion on it.   We lie to ourselves all the time, and when it comes to things like this, a second opinion from someone who knows their stuff never hurts.   Good luck OP, I hope you find peace soon.",False,False
