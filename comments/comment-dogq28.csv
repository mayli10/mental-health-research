In other ways they're so comforting and dependable, I can nurse them for hours and I'm not thinking about food as long as I'm drinking one and they're so god-awful strong I won't chug them like I'd chug any other diet drink... But my heart is getting worse and I neeeeed to look into something else ://  Actually a big bottle of cold-brew tea helps me with that bc it also takes a long time to get through. Have you tried those?",False,False
