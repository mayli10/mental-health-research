Unfortunately in a lot of ways it's gotten more difficult with time. I will say though I think it's great you are so self-aware and can acknowledge and recognize that this is something you are struggling with. You are so young still - don't worry about ""being behind"". You have so much time. Also, it seems like you do have some understanding, kind people around you. As others have mentioned, you definitely don't have to self-disclose literally everything to everyone all at once, but maybe you could try to share little bits here and there until it gets more comfortable? I hope that helps. I wish you the best.",False,False

It sounds silly but after a while you will be able to just ask him how he's doing and ask about what's been bothering him and feel normal doing that. And eventually you'll feel normal venting to him.  But you're right, every conversation with him shouldn't turn into being about your woes. If you just go for it, you will find a healthy balance for it",False,False

So I don’t want to come off as self centred, and I think if I just vent at my friends It’ll feel like I’m using them. So like the logical solution would be to get them to open up to me first, but I don’t like asking other people about themselves, because I feel like if they wanted to tell me something, they would have already, and by asking I’m overstepping/being annoying. I know thats not the case though now and I should just ask them, but I don’t know how to start those conversations",False,True

It took me 2 years in therapy to be able to fully open up with my *therapist* due to years of abuse and being taken advantage of. I just didn't trust anybody. It still takes me a long time to open up to people.  If it helps, you don't have to tell everybody everything. I have had a friend for 16 years and she knows very little, just the basics of my depression. Not because I don't trust her, but because I get the feeling that 1) she wont really get it and 2) she very often makes things about herself, and that's the last thing someone with an ED needs when venting.  Anyways. It helps to work up to things. Ask you friend, ""I want to work on being emotionally available, I was to work up to being open with you and maybe a few other people. I'm gonna start small. Is that okay?"" And as long as he is cool with that, maybe start by at the end of the day, text-rant one or two things that went wrong in your day. Someone forgot to take the cheese off a salad out to eat? Tell him that you were pretty upset about that, even if you don't tell him *why*  I hope some of that helps you",False,False
