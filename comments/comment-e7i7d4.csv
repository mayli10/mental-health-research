A lot less mentally/emotionally/financially stable too though. I guess I just have an addictive personality though because I tapered of drugs after rehab to chain smoking, and from chain smoking I went to vaping. The nicotine was an appetite suppressant and since quiting entirely I've picked up another 10-15 lbs.   Now I'm bouncing up and down 20lbs whenever I get the determination to fast and subsequently spiral into unhealthy binge eating once i start feeling good about myself again. I live in a vicious cycle.",False,False

I've struggled with alcohol dependence, and quitting smoking is what triggered my anorexia.
