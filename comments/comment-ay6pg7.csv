Think about all the people you know who occasionally go out and overindulge, but maintain their weight. Just focus on getting through today, go have fun boxing, and try again tomorrow. And hey, I'm super proud of you for not purging! I know how hard and stressful it is not to when you feel like you've messed up, but you're doing great ðŸ’œ",False,False

I had demolished 6 donuts by 8.30am (950cal), but I've exercised a bunch today and burnt around 800cal, and I need to do some more gardening (green waste goes out tonight). My tdee is way higher than yours though (2200). You probably won't gain any real weight from eating that much for only one day. Also, dates can act like a laxative with the amount of fibre in them.",False,False
