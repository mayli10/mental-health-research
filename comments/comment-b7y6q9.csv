I feel awful asking that but I'm feeling dejected and don't want to end up turning down sex with him because his problems with it make me feel bad. He agreed, then yesterday did it again, and we had an argument where he lied to me and i just ended up crying myself to sleep. He apologized, but I don't really trust that he's going to stop now.   Idk yall. I might delete this later.
