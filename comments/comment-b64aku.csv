Your big Bollywood wedding sounds like it will be incredible and lots of fun! I'm sure you'll look amazing &lt;3    Weddings can be so stressful, and I know I was feeling really insecure about my weight when I got married, but once I was in the middle of everything I was so focused on the excitement of being married to a man that I loved, sharing our new life together, and the reception was a blast! I didn't think once about how I looked because I felt so in the moment-- I did my own makeup and you're so right about it effecting how you feel!      Best wishes for your marriage and I hope your day is everything you want it to be!",False,False

I‚Äôm so happy for you üíï I just got married last month, and my makeup was a DISASTER. I had to wash most of it off and redo it MYSELF in the car on the way to the venue.  Just make sure you get it done by someone good, and make sure to get an actual wedding makeup trial done beforehand to make sure your artist knows what you may want tweaked or changed.   I didn‚Äôt have time for trials since I had such a short engagement (less than three months) ",False,False

I'm getting married in May and I have been agonizing over the thought of the most important photos of my life being taken.
