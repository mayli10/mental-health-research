I dont want to say the specific disease it is a charity ride for, because charities for that disease are uncommon and I dont want to risk doxing myself.  But, even tho the 100 today got cancelled I have to opportunity for it tomorrow.  I had a small setback after dinner. Due to restricting and bulimia my hunger cues are fucked. I couldn't tell if I was actually hungry, not hungry, or full, and I ate to the point where food was coming up on it's own. I purged to relieve the pain, not because of calories or fears of weight gain, so it's kind of different, but its disappointing to have that happen after I did so well all day.  I'm worried I wont be able to convince myself to really eat tomorrow and that I'll end up getting injured because I pass out during the ride. Because right now I feel terrified of any food. I havent eaten in hours and I'm still so full it hurts. I can finally walk tho so that's my plan.   Thank you for the encouragement from when I was doing well earlier it means a lot &lt;3",False,True

The most I've done is a metric century, I'm trying to find a supported imperial century ride near me to test myself soon. I'm so excited for you!!!   If you don't mind me asking, was this a cancer charity ride? I had wanted to sign up for something that was 75 miles the first day and 100 the next day but I ended up missing the early bird discount period and couldn't afford it. Yours sounds super familiar!  Congrats again!!",False,False
