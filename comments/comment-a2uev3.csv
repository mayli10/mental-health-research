Sometimes twice a day if I'm feeling cold.   2. As soon as I get home, I put on cozy soft jammies. It doesn't matter if it's 11 am or 11 pm, if I'm home, I'm wearing jammies.  3. Donate, sell or throw away stuff I don't use anymore to keep my home as clutter-free as possible. I feel my best when I'm not surrounded by stuff. Every three months I try to sift through one room.  Not free:  1. I shop for groceries once a week and I always make myself get a treat for that day. Sometimes it's just a box of a tea I'd like to try, sometimes a good-looking protein bar or a pint of low-cal ice cream. If I don't want any food as a treat, I buy new socks, some nice soap or a new crochet needle. But I'm always getting myself something small.  2. Devote as much time, energy and money I can miss to my hobbies as possible. I crochet a lot and I'm always allowed to buy new yarn or take an evening off to work on a project.  3. Burn candles at home! It doesn't have to be cold or dark outside to enjoy candles.  4. Go to IKEA and browse. Sometimes I just buy one candle or a mug, but it feels great to just walk around in the fake rooms and houses they have and pretend to plan the interior for a new home.",False,False

Itâ€™s such an inexpensive way to make things feel really cozy and nice. (Bonus to this one is when you go shopping for candles, spend as much time as you want just going through them and figuring out which ones you like. Idk why but itâ€™s really satisfying to me).",False,False

I just use red manic panic, but I feel like I don't deserve to for some reason....so my hair looks a hot mess. I know I should but I am scared and I have no idea why.

Not free if you are paying the water bill lmao.  Wash yo damn sheets and put on some clean pajamas.
