The reasoning is half ridiculous, half not. It kinda comes down to this:   if you tell a school consoler, and they don’t report it and then you die or something bad happens etc, the school can be blamed for it, So that’s why. It is simply to cover their asses. Pretty fucked up way to handle things, IMO. But that’s the reasoning.",False,False

The one thing about her is that (and she's told me this) she isn't equipped to deal with eating disorders, and would refer me to someone else if she could (with my mother, she knows she can't).

I get the obvious reason why they’d set this rule, but If my parents found out they’d just drive me to further silence, how thick in the head are these administrators.",False,True

My school counselor sat down at our first meeting and stated that she would only report anything if I was in a serious danger of killing myself, or if someone was hurting me (abuse of some sort). Anything else, self-harm, ed, was completely confidential. It isn't even noted down somewhere my parents can find it.",False,False
