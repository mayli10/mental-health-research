The main point of that is that you had fun, you were *happy*. Think about it, who do you tend to gravitate towards when you are getting to know people? People who are skinny, or people who radiate good vibes and are happy with themselves?",False,False

I guess not many people look great after sweating a bunch! It‚Äôs so disappointing though, because working out makes me feel SO strong and empowered, it would be cool if that emotion came through in photos. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",False,True

That's how your eating disorder sees you, because all your eating disorder wants is to get worse.  That's the voice that you're hearing, latching onto a photo that you are unable to accurately assess to use your warped and vulnerable perspective on it to make you sicker.  None of that is you, and nobody sees you that way.  You did great.  You're doing great.  Keep going.",False,False

It is not who you are \*now\*, it is a snapshot of a moment, that is all. That photo is not a definition of who you are. It doesn't change the feeling you had on that day, it does not rewrite history.   you still feel strong  you are still happy with your time  You smiled the whole time.   that. photo. doesn't. change. any. of. that.   And frankly, who looks good during or after a fun run? Your sweaty, puffy, and you are not at your best... so don't judge yourself with perfectionist standards.   &amp;#x200B;  We are all on a journey.
