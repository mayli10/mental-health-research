I read the DSM criteria and anorexia and OSFED seem closer to my habits. I don't think I do that consciously tho and I don't want to lose more weight - I am comfortable between 50 and 55kg. I checked my BMI and it does say I am underweight but I also read that it's not that trustworthy and it really depends on your body type and all that. I just don't want to be heavier, I've always been small.",False,True

I don't avoid going out for eating but I am careful with how much I eat - I am careful as to not overeat like most of my friends. I checked my BMI and it says that I'm underweight but I honestly don't want to become fatter. I almost never skip meals, if I do it's because of waking up later than usual and not having time.",False,True

It might be helpful for you to look at the DSM criteria for the different eating disorders (anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, OSFED, ARFID, and binge eating disorder) and see if any of the criteria match up with your experiences.  What concerns me is that you are underweight and purposely restrict calories to make sure that you remain underweight. That is one of the hallmarks of an eating disorder.   I get the concerns about it becoming a real disorder, but a therapist only wants to help you. A good therapist, that is. If you do end up going to a therapist, make sure that they’re an eating disorder specialist. Non-specialists, in my experience, don’t know enough about eating disorders to properly diagnose you. And, even if you don’t have a full-blown eating disorder, some of your thinking is certainly disordered and you could still benefit from a therapist to help you navigate those feelings. You don’t have to be ashamed about your feelings or for seeking help. I don’t think it’s a bad idea to try seeing a therapist.",False,False

But I think the main difference between normal behavior and disordered behavior is whether it affects your day to day life. Do you often say no to going out to avoid food? Do you restrict to the point that its affecting your mental state/focus?   It doesnt really seem like you have an ED, but you might just make sure you're in the healthy weight range for your height. Make sure youre getting enough protein, not accidentally skipping meals, all of that stuff.",False,False
