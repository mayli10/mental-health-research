What my therapist has told me is that is you try to get rid of an unhealthy coping mechanism without first developing a healthy one to replace it, another unhealthy one will take its place. That could be what you're experiencing here. Perhaps you should work on finding a healthy set of stress relievers and practice using those in times of stress, and then work on tackling the ED behaviors. Obviously I'm not a doctor but from what I've been told, that will give you a better chance at truly recovering from your ED. Good luck and I'm proud of you for being b/p free for as long as you have- I'm about at the same amount of time, we got this!",False,False

If I drank soda, I’d be shitting myself all day. I can cope with diet soda again, but it took a few months to get back to being able to tolerate them.   I developed a massive sparkling water habit. I try to drink at least 1.5L of water most days.  Though keto constipated me badly - the ER doc said he’d never seen someone “so full of poo”,  it did help me steer clear of a lot of processed foods and now I don’t eat a lot of processed foods at all.   My groceries used to be instant noodles, packaged foods and chocolate, and now it’s more vegetables and salads. I’ve come to find that I just can’t control myself if there’s junk food in the house at all. So I don’t buy it. My psychiatrist insists that if I persist with eating better and exercising regularly that the self esteem should improve and then the binge urges will go away. I’m not sure about that, but we’ll see how it goes.  I know that I feel really quite proud of myself if I go shopping and manage to get out of the supermarket without buying chocolate, biscuits or potato chips. That feeling is kind of addictive. I also really like it when I can eat “healthy”, restrict and still get in three meals a day. I don’t know if I’ll ever get as extreme as ortho can be. But it’s hard to not get stuck on that as well. Unfortunately, my budget doesn’t allow me to buy all of the organic whatevers.",False,False
