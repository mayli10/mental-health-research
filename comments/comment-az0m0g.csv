A little bit of enamel is lost each time if minerals aren't properly deposited back into the enamel to fix the damage caused by acid. The damage can be especially serious if you have problems with dry mouth, since saliva is the body's natural way of fighting against mineral loss by providing the teeth with calcium and other essential minerals.  Other than general dental care tips that are always important, some purging-specific harm reduction tips would be chewing gum before purging, purging as quickly as possible and swishing around a tiny bit of toothpaste in your mouth after purging. Chewing sugarless gum for a couple of minutes before purging stimulates saliva production, which restores the enamel's pH level post-binge. The demineralization caused by eating food is nothing compared to stomach acid, but throwing up right after your teeth are already in a slightly weakened state from binging on a lot of sugar just makes the damage worse.  Then there's the obvious: the faster you get done purging, the less time acids will have to dissolve your enamel. Purposefully not purging the most acidic last 20% can save you from a lot of damage. And after you've gotten done purging, take a tiny bit of toothpaste (even 1/4 of what you use to brush your teeth is enough) and swish it around in your mouth for a couple of minutes ***without brushing***. This gives your enamel a ton of minerals to absorb to fix the damage done by acid. After swishing around for a couple of minutes, just spit the foam out and don't rinse your mouth.",False,False

Due to a combination of having bulimia and being on anti-depressants, my mouth is *very* dry. It's so acidic that it has a pH of 5.6.   I talked to her about how I have really bad dragon breath and it's really embarrassing. And the constant cavities. I usually have to get a filling once every 18 months and my front teeth are all broken from a combination of purging and being a lifelong nail biter. Here was her advice:   \- Rinse with water after having anything acidic, particularly coffee and tea  \- Rinse up to 5x a day with a mixture of bicarbonate soda and fluoridated water  \- Brush twice a day with a fluoridated toothpaste for sensitive teeth that also has bicarb in it  \- Avoid toothpastes that have sodium laurel sulphate (SLS)   \- Use the modified Stillman technique for brushing your teeth     I hope that helps!",False,False
