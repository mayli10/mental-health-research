I've been making myself take a break for the past couple of weeks and I feel really restless and awful without it, and I genuinely can't tell if it's because of the exercise compulsion or simply because I miss running.   I guess the only way to expedite the process is to recover faster? eat more and rest more, and try not to think about it for now I guess. because I really don't think it'd be a good idea to running again before you know that your mind and body can handle it -- it might just stall or reverse your recovery process.  Good luck!!",False,False
