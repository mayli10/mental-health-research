The only way to reprogram your mind and see reality, is reprograming your mind. With repetition. Each time you repeat to yourself ""I´m ugly"", you are reinforcing the ""bad/harmful"" program.  I´m not saying ""you are pretty"" out of pitty, you INDEED are very very pretty. One way to prove you, that I´m saying the truth, is for you to upload your picture to thos online programs that ""meassure your beauty"", those are based in face symmetry. You will receive a good score.",False,False

Don't let them put you down. You are truly beautiful, inside and out.",False,False

And yes, I read a page of your post history, that's how I saw this post.   Do yourself a favor, take a moment to look at the post history of the person who said your face is butter--that human is an abject moron.   Here are some of his less than enlightening quotes:   &gt;Women today are incapable of genuine love.   &gt;Careful now.......Team Vag will shriek at you for that lol /s  &gt;My memory is my black book. I remember every dick I’ve taken since I was 13  &gt;I don't know of anyone that finds the rabid feminazi appearance to be attractive.  The user who said you have a butter face is literally a gay guy who hates women, spends most of his time rating dick pics and when he's not doing that, he's posting on thedonald.   I didn't post anything other than asking for verification, so I didn't give my opinion in that thread.  I don't give direct opinions unless the person posting has followed Rule 1.  People catfish all the time, I still don't know if the person you posted is really you. What I do know is that the person wasn't fat, wasn't ugly, wasn't a butter face, had beautiful eyes, a nice smile, great skin tone and a lot of other great qualities. The person in those pictures is beautiful.  If it truly is you, be kind to yourself.",False,False
