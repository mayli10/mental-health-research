That's 793 cals per dollar or about 12 cents a granola bar at 90-100 cals (peanut butter chocolate chip, chocolate chunk, and s'mores are the three flavors). The 6-pack of Great Value sweet and salty almond, cashew, or peanut bars are $1.98 and about 500-510 cals per dollar (though those are higher calorie, 170-190 cals). I also love those Snack Pack puddings, 4 in a pack for $1, at either 100-110 cal per regular or \~70 cals for the sugar-free version. I'll have to check out my list later because I don't remember what else is on there that I've calculated lol",False,False

BUT that's if it was made exactly how the company expected you to, which was a very very VERY small cone (we even had a scale we were supposed to measure it on, and our cones would usually be double or triple in size). No one made cones as small as the company wanted us to, so I'm sure they were always 2-3x the calorie content. Just a heads up since I was always like ""how could this possibly be under 200 calories?!"" and then I realized, they usually weren't...",False,False
