I just made the decision to eat as mutch as I like every day from now on when I started recovery amd didnt set any limits regarding calorie intake or kinds of foods I ate anymore (I also cut put any kind of exercise completly). For about a month eating and sleeping where pretty mutch the only things I did. Then my hunger slowly started to become less and less and about one and a half months in I had the urge to move again. After talking to my therapist about it she allowed me limited exercise  again. I'd say it took me like 3 months of completely unresticted eating to gain my (personal) normal appitite back. But I stopped gaining weight before that. The most importent thing is to let your body do its thing and provide it with all it asks you for (be it food, rest or anythig else). If I had to guess i'd say I eat about 3k kcal now (I'm a ca.180cm male in his 20s) but I dont think of food in terms of numbers anymore - stoping to count calories is one of the hardest and most importend steps (at least in my opinion) if you try to recover",False,False
