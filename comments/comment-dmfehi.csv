I also used to have that problem. The way I ate literally every single day is insane to me now that I think back to it.

I've only had 7 binges in 4 years of being keto. I've just accepted that I personally need this way of eating in order to stay slim. Other people are surely able to stay slim without it -- that's indisputable! And I'm a little jealous of them to be able to eat any food group and not turn into a ravenous bottomless pit like I do.
