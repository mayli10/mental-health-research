Its great you left that abusive loser and found someone better. Maybe ednos at most but definitely disordered eating. When you force yourself to do the same things he made you do/self abuse you are letting him win. You don’t deserve that pain. Not then and not now. Have you seen a professional about this? Maybe some therapy could help you process this because you are at risk of developing an ed. And trust me it’s not glamorous it really sucks to be controlled by a mental illness.,False,False
