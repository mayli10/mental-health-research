I hope no one hurts your feelings with fact or anything, I know it's rough.   I'll be leaving now, I can tell that you're trying to function as adults, so keep up the good work and someday maybe you'll understand the concept of equal rights.   Just a hint, they aren't based on anyone's feelings. In the grown-up version, people tolerate speech they don't agree with so their own speech that others might not agree with will also be tolerated, and facts are acknowledged as fact, opinions as opinions, and beliefs as beliefs.  They are not all the same things in the grown up world.     I know it's difficult to digest all that, but keep working at it and it will probably kick in.   Usually people start to get it when it's themselves being muzzled, but not always, so good luck!!",False,False

If I send a report to mods of a sub and they think that what you're saying is appropriate, they don't do anything about it. If they think it's inappropriate, they do. It's not a decision that I make alone, but I will report something that I think is inappropriate so that the powers that be can make a decision. You need to get over yourself. I don't know how long you've been living life thinking that everyone else is in the wrong and you're right, but you have to get past that.",False,False
