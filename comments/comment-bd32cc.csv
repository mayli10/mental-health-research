It wreaks absolute havoc on my mental and emotional health, bank account, school, work, and personal life. But the pounds can pack on pretty easily, until I get back to my normal weight. At that point I'd have to be binging way more every single day for a while to go over. As of right now I don't have to force myself to eat, but I've been at that point before. That, plus the mental consequences of trying to gain make it incredibly difficult.",False,False

When I've spiralled, it gets to be a profound mental strain.   Gaining weight is mentally hard, but getting easier as I've done a couple short bulk cycles now and like my body better for it.",False,False

Outside of binges my appetite is quite low and in times of stress I forget to eat.   Maintaining is hardest of all I've found, even though gaining isn't particularly pleasant, if I have the mindset it's still easier than maintaining my weight. I have no idea how people do it.",False,False

I’m at the point now where I’m approaching my goal weight and I’m so terrified of what I’m going to do once I hit it and don’t have to restrict anymore that I’m trying to toe the line between my idea of a safe daily calorie budget and overeating (still under TDEE) because I want to draw it out for as long as possible ?? Because it’s like I get a high off of restricting?  But then that gives me anxiety because even eating a hundred calories more than I usually do feels like I’m binging, and all I want to do is give up and fast completely and never have to think about food again and waste away into nothingness   But also health and booty gains tho   Even my pancake-lookin bipolar ass’s eating disorder is bipolar",False,False

There’s part of me that’s resisting my efforts to gain weight, and some manifest as physical limitations. In short, gaining is harder ime.",False,False
