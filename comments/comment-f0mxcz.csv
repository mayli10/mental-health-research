Lying down or leaning back, be still for a few minutes and take slow, deep breaths until you feel completely calm, then measure it. At my low weight, BMI 16, it would dip down into the 30s. Not good. I'm NOT saying that if it's in an acceptable range everything is ok. But if it's super low, it means your body doesn't have the energy it needs for your organs to function properly.",False,False

Women who were under a BMI of 17.5 at 18 years old were 50% more likely to have early menopause.  I think I‚Äôm good because I stayed around 19-20BMI throughout my teens.

A lot of it is body composition and fat percentage. I know a lot of people who are naturally underweight and completely healthy, and people who aren‚Äôt. It‚Äôs just like being one BMI point overweight tbh",False,False

I‚Äôm not a doctor or anything but if you‚Äôre purging , heavily restricting, taking drugs, or really any ED behavior then it‚Äôs not healthy. I think the only way it could possibly be ok would be if you were somehow getting all the nutrients your body requires within a restricted calorie number, and exercising moderately.

Being underweight carries health risks of course, but the curve of how-underweight vs severity-of-health-consequences is a pretty individual thing. And partly it‚Äôs hard to know, because a big risk is the slow accumulation of invisible-until-suddenly-serious damage. So, you‚Äôre alive, just in a really struggling body.   And that‚Äôs just the physical side. Being underweight as the result of an ED usually means there are significant ongoing mental and emotional experiences (that can really be making life a hard, painful, lonely gig).",False,False
