There's a soy milk i really like which is 38kcal which i consider really hight tbh but i like it so much so i keep drinking it, plus it has the highest amount of protein out of all the non dairy milks I've found (3g per 100ml to be exact!)",False,False

Mix from either silk or blue diamond? (I know what it looks like not the brand!) It's 25cal/cup and soooo creamy! It's almost a milkshake itself and I can't believe it's so low cal! Amazing blended with frozen fruit!,False,False

If I could find one that’s lower than the almond one I currently use I would probably make the switch because I prefer cashew milk!!,False,False
