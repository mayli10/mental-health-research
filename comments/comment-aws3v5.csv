I'm not sure if it happened at all before that or not. I did try to get help with that from my doctor for three weeks, but she kept saying it's probably just a virus and there's nothing she could do to help. After that I went to a clinic instead and the doctor there actually checked me out, said it could be a virus but might also be a bacteria or a parasite and that further tests were required. He also noticed inflammation and gave me some medicine for that. The medicine helped a lot and within two weeks I was feeling better. I never got all the tests done though because I had issues with my health card being expired and having to wait for documents from the government to renew it since I was in the middle of updating information.",False,False
