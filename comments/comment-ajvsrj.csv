If i were you i'd maybe try dropping that you find that kinda talk a bit uncomfortable to her. It sounds super uncomfortable having to deal with talk like that.   societies standards are so fucked and insidious. thats how it be on this bitch of an earth :/ it shouldnt be but it is. our society is so obsessed with being thin until it comes out that the only way to maintain an unhealthy standard of thinness is.... u guessed it.... by unhealthy methods. how many celebrities are clearly disordered but are buoyed up by people who go to insane lengths to insist that no! it's *\~\~genetics\~\~* like they're a different fuckin species   i know my mum loved commenting on my and other people's food and comparing her own habits and body to mine until i told her that it makes me uncomfortable when people did so, and she's pretty much curbed the habit now, at least around me, you shouldn't have to put up with being casually triggered like this and i'm sorry that you've had to for so long  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;",False,False

She really just lacks tact but is otherwise very kind. I couldnâ€™t count the number of times sheâ€™s innocently said triggering things my whole life â€˜life is easier when youâ€™re thinâ€™ â€˜that girl could be so pretty but sheâ€™s so fatâ€™  â€˜make sure to hold your stomach inâ€™ etc.   She doesnâ€™t know about my ED but she heavily praises weight loss and being thin.
