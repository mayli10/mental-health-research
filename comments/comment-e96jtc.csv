Maybe it’s because I’ve realized that living like this is literally pointless, it’s not living at all.   I actually went to a few therapy sessions and am looking for a full-time therapist. I started a thoughts journal where I do several things: write my thoughts before I eat (especially if I’m feeling emotional/like I might binge), write my feelings if I’m feeling emotional. I also try to write positive thoughts every single day. Even if my day has been shit, I write the things I’m grateful for or that make life okay. If I’m having a good day, I’ll write down days I like about myself.   The biggest single change has been negating/removing negative self thoughts. When I want to say bad things about myself in my head, I literally stop the thought. I tell myself I don’t think things like that about myself, even if I do in the moment. I tell myself reaffirming and positive things and I know it sounds dumb, but it really works (for me). Life can be hard enough on me, I don’t need to perpetuate negativity, you literally can’t get away from your own mind.   I really hope all the best for you. I hope you can try some of these out for yourself and I hope that if you do, you find they make a difference. Remember that progress isn’t linear also, and don’t feel discouraged if things aren’t better immediately.",False,False

How did u start to feel more positively toward yourself? I feel like i try to not be negative but then when my body doesnt look how i want and it hasnt changed enough the frustration and low self esteem is reinforced. But ive seen this from an outside perspective and having a perfect body isnt what makes u love urself. Its so fcked up that i cant see that within myself.   I really have just been waiting for everything to start goint good and the weight to fall off cuz im out of that cycle. Both my parents are skinny and even without ed my body has that build, however all the trauma and shit has caused extra weight to cling to me. Despite a normal bmi i had high cholesterol a few years ago. Dunno what it is now",False,False

Just thinking about the upcoming holidays and going home just sends me spiraling into a panic attack",False,False

For me, treating myself like I was stupid and worthless because of my weight made losing the weight impossible. It was like reverse logic. Feeling fat made me depressed, which made me overeat. Dealing with my negative self-image and depression helped me actually lose weight because I was no longer punishing myself.   Healthy and rewarding behavior with unhealthy but satisfying outcome ¯\_(ツ)_//¯",False,False

Its inly like 10 lbs but it feels like 5000 and im not sure itll go away like it did before. I feel out of control and stupid that i cant make certain gat on my body disappear.,False,False
