Please consider getting help ASAP, I did not do this until my daughter was about 8 months old and by then it had spiraled and I was really really sick, it took a while to get better. When i was pregnant with my son I had therapy from the get go as soon as I had the first scan, it went much better and I managed to stay well for almost a decade. Don’t be afraid to ask for help. My therapist told me it’s the best thing a mom in need can do for her baby. Good luck ❤️",False,False

When she was breastfeeding me she didn’t want the same thing to happen so she said to herself over and over again   “I can always lose weight in the future. This is the only chance I have to breastfeed and bond with my daughter. My body is just for her now, not for me or the world.”   And she did that - ate healthily for me, lost weight naturally through breastfeeding, once that stopped she lost a little bit more and she’s been fit as fuck for as long as I remember.  Congratulations on your little one, there’s always support whenever you need it whether it be from friends, family, doctors, nurses, internet strangers, new mums groups, childcare services, phone hotlines, etc. It’ll all be okay &lt;3",False,False
