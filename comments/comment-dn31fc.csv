At some point, in my adulthood, my ED took a back seat and alcoholism took the driver seat (not literally, I drink at home and don’t drive while drinking). I’ve been trying to quit for a few years. It’s hard. I’ve also told my husband that I have a problem with alcohol...for years. He just told me a few weeks ago that he didn’t think it was a problem until about 6 months ago. Well fuck, it’s been a problem for at least 8 years. So, glad you’re observant. Anyway, I don’t have a point to this comment besides that I can relate to that aspect. Sorry you’re feeling this way.",False,False
