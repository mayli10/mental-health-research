You asked if there was a different restaurant and it wasn't a big deal. That is honestly such a great way to handle it. ♥️,False,False

On Thursday I eat double what I normally allow.   Afterwards I feel tired and usually have a few hours sleep, but this is what ""normal"" eaters do.  When I told my SO this happens every time he said to me, yeah that's like people who have a nap after a Sunday roast or Christmas dinner.  Therefore, IT'S NORMAL!    A persons body does what it has to.   When you eat more your body sends blood to the digestion system or something and it makes you feel sleepy.  Something to do with serotonin as well (I googled it ages ago and my memory's shit, lol).  Everything on the planet needs rest.  Lions sleep for decades after a meal (not 100% true but close).  Your ED is a spineless jerkoff that wants to wear you down but fuck that.  You NEED rest.  You do enough running around keeping everything in order (including ed demands).  I've ignored yells to get out of bed at stupid o clock and do some arm flailing and jumping around like a moron for an hour.  After a while, like all trolls, the ed gets bored and stops the hassle.  It takes a while but you can ignore the yells and just rest!  x",False,False

I can only imagine how much strength that took because the ED voice can be soooo fuuuucking louuuud. I always tells my friends i wish they could hear my brain when it comes time to eat. That shit sounds like white noise and nails scratching on a keyboard. Plus, it only goes away if I either avoid food altogether or convince myself it’s okay to eat.   I feel you about eating a lot and feeling tired the next day. It happened to me this past weekend and I spent my whole Sunday curled up underneath my blanket. Take a rest day!!! Society and our ED make us feel like we need to be active and productive all the time but sometimes the most productive thing we can do for ourselves is allow ourselves to rest. :)",False,False

I understand your mixed feelings and I am proud of you too for having a very normal day yesterday. What you said about giving yourself permission really resonated with me. I have been going through the same thing. But I think if we left it up to the eating disorder to give us permission, it would just have us keep going indefinitely until we physically couldn’t anymore. So I know it’s not my place but if it makes you feel any better, I give you permission to rest because you’re in such an extreme deficit that you physically need it. The ED will not ever give permission, but maybe we can give it to each other. ",False,False
