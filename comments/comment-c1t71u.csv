I think it can be really hard when we feel like we've messed up to zoom out and see the bigger picture, and it can help to let an outside party give you an assessment of the situation.",False,False

If you were trying to quit smoking, and you went four months without one and then weakened, your lungs are still four months cleaner, and you still get to count that four months of victory, and you hop back on the wagon.    If you were trying to quit drinking, and you were 4 months sober, and you had a rough day and drank some cocktails, that four months of sobriety is still yours to claim, still giving you the strength and confidence that you *can* make it without alcohol.  You're trying to quit something that serves much the same purpose as cigarettes and alcohol.  You racked up 120 consecutive days of good decisions, even though I am sure that some days you had to white-knuckle it.  But you did it.  And you can do it again.",False,False
