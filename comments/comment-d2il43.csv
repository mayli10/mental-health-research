Ive also recently gone off the pill and wondered this to! I have gone off of it in May and got my period shortly after but I haven't gotten it since and it's been like almost 6 months. I'm not too concerned as I was on the pill for almost 15 years. It will take awhile for my body to readjust. It's a good idea to keep your doctor informed and to take a multivitamin with iron! I also don't eat a ton of red meat so I'm lacking the iron and b-12 so that could result in the missed period too!,False,False

I'm not sure that's a super safe use of birth control (taking more than 1 a day). I'd ask a doctor... and use an alternate form of protection in the meantime.,False,False

It's all about energy availability.  Simply put, if you're not getting enough calories, your body will prioritise using the energy for movement, and other functions (e.g. hormones, thermoregulation, immune system, digestion) will fall by the wayside.",False,False

Is this the same scenario maybe?   I’ve had a period like maybe 1 month ago but just took a bunch of bc to stop it like usual. I felt the cramps two days ago but nothing else.  Idk when I should eventually be concerned or start my next pack since I’m sexually active.,False,False

It will take some time, I even saw online a month to half a year. Blessed with your homosexuality, I fear pregnancy.   I'm well aware of the poetic value of that last sentence :)  If you've been living with an ED for a long time and you suspect a lack of nutrition, then you could consider looking up iron vitamins and if it would perhaps help you. Or you could look into 'female' vitamins.",False,False
