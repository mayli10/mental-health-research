The thing is, I remember them commenting on my food choices the last few times due to my intolerances. I just HATE every comment about my food... But when I sit there and don't eat anything all day... I mean. I think they'd also comment on that. But maybe I can say that I just want to go for a walk... or that I have to go to another part of the building for my dissertation. BUT I think they're too nice and might say that I should enjoy my break and not work for my dissertation...",False,True

That's my problem now at home. I inhale everything because of  this crippling hunger. When I skip breakfast and  lunch, then  I can make it until dinner for my first meal  without these stomach cramps. And I was SOOOO happy to be able to live like that like during university courses again... but.. seems like there's no solution to his problem :(",False,True

I interned at a hospital over the summer and didn’t want to be around other people while they ate and I didn’t. I would go to my car and tell them I was taking a nap or calling my boyfriend. Lol I would then go on reddit instead. Or maybe you can say that you have to run errands? I know one of the girls at work would sometimes go grocery shopping so she wouldn’t have to do it after work.,False,False
