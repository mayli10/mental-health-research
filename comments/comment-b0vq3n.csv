It was 2am, I just turned in an essay due at midnight (it be like that sometimes) and I decided to reward myself with a few mini marshmallows. I had one, then two, then took out my phone and started checking instagram or whatever, and then suddenly I ate half the bag. I don't purge but I was on the verge of puking just from the physical damage of consuming so many marshmallows. Don't recommend it, but you can survive it.",False,False
