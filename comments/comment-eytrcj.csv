I just planned my *realistic* TDEE (of my GW) and I'm trying to stick to it and meet a weekly goal rather than a daily one. I'm going to try focusing on healthy food/behaviors and not weigh for at least a couple months. I was doing really well but got so exasperated at a couple-month plateau, getting angrier every day that the scale wasn't dropping,  that I binged 4 days last week. Back on track as of yesterday.    Hang in there!",False,False

I eat lots of veggies and a normal amount of protein, and I mainly watch my carb intake because it's what triggers binges. I have managed to stay in a deficit without feeling like restricting. By meal plan I don't mean eating the same every day or something specific, but having a guideline of portions for each meal.  On the evenings I feel more at risk of bingeing, so I just prevent them. I eat apples (or some other fruit) as snack, one or two on the evenings depending on how I feel. I never skip meals because otherwise I start bingeing. I avoid sugar, I don't drink my calories (except juice at breakfast) and if I crave something other than fruit I eat a healthy carbohydrate.  I wish there was some other answer but honestly changing my lifestyle is what has helped me. I've had some few binges but I have gotten better at preventing them.  You can PM me if you want more information on the portion serving of some things.",False,False

If you restrict then you’ll feel the need to binge; If you binge you’re gonna want to compensate by restricting. That’s how it becomes a cycle. If you want to break the cycle then obviously the answer is to stop binging and restricting, but of course it isn’t really that simple. Start out by cutting out the restriction; that should be the easiest part. Give yourself some reasonable leniency on your maintenance goal (I know one of the big triggers is “fuck it, I already ruined my day so let’s just eat everything”), but really try and resist the urge to binge. Keeping your hands busy helps, so does drinking tea, or chewing gum. It’s not foolproof but it’s saved me from binging a few times. Hopefully after eating at maintenance for a while you’ll hopefully be able to get it under control.",False,False

(everyone is different but) my binging started BECAUSE i was restricting. it continued because it became a bad habit. i would feel the urge to binge and i would comply. the life changing thing i heard was that the part of your brain that gives you the urge to binge literally cannot move your body. to comply to the urge means you are agreeing that you want to binge. it took many days of battling the impulsive thoughts before they went away. just know that you can’t try to argue with the urge because it IS YOU and it knows how to convince you. no matter what the binge urge says just simply say no. (which is way more difficult than it sounds, i promise i know)  the second piece of advice was that i had to stop restricting for many months. i did gain a little bit of weight, but it eventually maintained. so the binging stopped and i made myself eat at maintenance. i have only recently tried to start making steps towards losing weight again being more conscious of my thoughts and my body.  i hope something in here helps! i know advice involving binging is VERY controversial so i can understand if this doesn’t work for everyone. this is just what helped me&lt;3 i believe you can beat this!",False,False
