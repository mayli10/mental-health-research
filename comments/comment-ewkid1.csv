First time being sick (two years ago) I had a low heart rate, not super bad though because I was ‚Äúathletic‚Äù which means the range for acceptable heart rates is a little lower.   But now I have been two weeks into restricting again from 1200 cals tapering down to 600 now. I am also overweight now. Like very much objectively so. I have much extra fat and energy stores on my body.   But it has been literally two weeks and my heart/chest is hurting? I am getting random pulls and just like aches/heaviness in my left chest area? I also feel so, so, so, fucking hungry and disoriented and just unable to focus and I‚Äôm freezing all the time and so sleepy all the time too. I don‚Äôt understand if this is possible? I never experienced this before until I was underweight and didn‚Äôt get a period anymore and like things were much worse. Is it possible that literally two weeks of restriction has done this to me??? Or is it something else? To be fair though, I never restricted this low before. Two years ago I would eat 1000-1200 and exercise for hours, and now I am eating 600-800 and not exercising as much. Maybe this is what‚Äôs causing it?   Basically, my question is do I have to worry about my heart now? If I‚Äôm still like very overweight?",False,False
