I just don't think the body is a sophisticated enough machine for that. I understand that if I stimulate my digestion and then don't actually eat anything, like smelling food or chewing gum, I might feel hungry, but I don't think I've ever noticed artificial sweeteners making me more hungry. But if I had more of a ""salivatory"" response to sweet things then maybe it would.  I think it depends. And if the diet drink is caffeinated then I think it works out to be the same.",False,False
