Might as well save yourself $20 and buy the generic dulcolax.   Honestly, I don't think they really do anything. Most of the OTC ones are just white kidney bean extract, which... I always kind of put along the same lines as the Dr. Oz-y diet pills that are just exotic plants in capsule form and don't actually do anything worthwhile but sound fancy enough that people buy them.   I've used them before, but mostly thought they just caused gas/bloating and didn't actually prevent any absorption. If anything, it was likely a binge trigger for me anyway because I convinced myself at the time that ""well I'm absorbing less now so I might as well go whole hog!"" ",False,False
