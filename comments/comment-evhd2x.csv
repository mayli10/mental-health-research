I am not sure how old you are, but if you are young, I assure you someone will eventually find you attractive. That doesn't mean you will believe it and suddenly feel good about yourself from the validation. But it isn't as hopeless as it seems.  I didn't go on a date or even french kiss someone until I was sixteen. The first person I dated who I really considered my boyfriend wasn't until I was 19. I'm 29 now and married and have struggled with my ED pretty much since I was 15. I have had a few (mostly terrible) relationships and a lot of sexual partners since 16. My self esteem is better but still not good.",False,False

I just try to make peace with it, like I'm such a small speck of dust in the history of the universe, it doesn't really matter if another human finds me desirable. It definitely gets me sad sometimes, but I'm also comforted by the fact  that whether or not I'm desired, it doesn't mean anything. My cats are sweet to me and thats good enough lol",False,False

I‚Äôve felt this way my whole life. And when I finally found someone that I thought loved me and was worth the risk, I took it and it destroyed me. I‚Äôm still destroyed. I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll ever be okay. Am I glad I took the risk? I honestly don‚Äôt know yet. It was amazing though while it was happening, so it was probably worth it. He made me feel loved, and I‚Äôve never felt loved before. He made me felt safe, heard, understood, etc. Things I‚Äôve never known. Life is pain. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd trade the pain for not having felt the good parts. I just can‚Äôt say right now because it still hurts so fucking much but just don‚Äôt give up because if I can find it, anyone can. Even if it didn‚Äôt last for me doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt for you. I hate myself so much but I loved him so much it was more consuming than how much I hated myself while we were together.

My self image is so distorted that I attract less people being thinner than I did when I was a little overweight just because people can totally sense confidence and lemme tell ya right now I have zilch.
