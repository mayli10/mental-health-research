This totally wasn’t meant as a dig towards the OP, though I understand sizing can be tricky when covering problem areas.  To clarify- Clothing in sections like that are made specifically with more room in areas that some non pregnant people are equally as insecure about and are still cute and comfortable without being oversized in other areas! Ill buy XS/S in maternity for cozy sweaters that fit my arms but don’t touch my stomach and aren’t cropped. And SO many T-Shirt dresses. It’s the best shopping hack I’ve ever found.",False,False
