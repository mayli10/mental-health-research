I have to use tailbone pillows alot cause my dumbass injured it trying to slam dunk a basketball and fell straight on my tailbone. And the doctors said I bent it to the left. That was 6 years ago and its still in pain. Does your tailbone also stick out like a litterall friggin tail aswell? Its so weird.,False,False
