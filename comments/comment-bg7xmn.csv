My ex would do the same and he wouldn't understand why I would get so angry at him for telling ME that I NEEDED to eat. So hypocritical. It's honestly so incredibly triggering and unfair that I'm thinking about food 24/7 and he could basically live without it.  Its biologically unfair that boys won't have an appetite and will lose a shit ton of weight but if we fast for a few days we almost looks the same -\_-,False,False

As someone with AN, having an SO who literally had to be on hunger stimulants when he was younger because he doesn’t get hunger cues is hard af. On one hand making sure he eats usually makes sure I eat, but it also makes it easier to restrict when he’s not hungry and I’m supposed to be trying to recover so that really doesn’t help",False,False

WTF if there isn’t food in the house I like I run to the grocery store and even went a few times during snow storms this winter,False,True

If I don’t provide him with enough meals &amp; snacks for the day he just doesn’t he. He “doesn’t think about”, “eating is a chore”, etc  I can’t understand that at all. He eats like 3/4 Of what’s on his plate &amp; is just done. Like how?! I can’t just throw the rest of my meal away. I’m going to eat it all &amp; wish I had more. Count down to my next meal. I wasn’t likethis before I was obsessed with my weight and eating though. I want to get back to normal so bad",False,False

The fact that its possible to just...not think about food for hours and hours at a time blows my mind. I used to be like this in high school and I'd give anything to have it back &gt;:(,False,False
