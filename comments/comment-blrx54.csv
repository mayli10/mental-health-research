We can feel the upset in your writing. You don't deserve that.   We of course know that photos can be wrong ; in a good way, in a bad way, they really just represent and capture something that doesn't actually exist in the real world. It's not the whole of you. It's never what you actually look like, what the experience is of being in your presence.   Something that may help prove this is r/Instagramreality . Nothing on there is real. I'm sure the photo your friend took isn't real either.  You're allowed to let it go. And dismiss it as a fake.  I wish you strength and courage.",False,False
