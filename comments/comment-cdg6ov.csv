I feel like Iâ€™m the oppositeâ€” much better with houseplants than outdoor plants! I canâ€™t have an actual garden since I live in an apartment, but any container plants Iâ€™ve had outdoors havenâ€™t done nearly as well as my indoor plants.   But with houseplants, Iâ€™d say the number 1 reason people struggle with them is that they generally baby them *too* much actually. Most of my plants thrive on a decent amount of neglect lol; I mostly just let them do their thing and I never water on a schedule. Iâ€™ve gotten to the point where I can just touch the soil to see if itâ€™s dry enough to need watering, or I can look at the leaves of my plant and tell if it needs to be watered (if the foliage is slightly droopy/wilty/less plump itâ€™s communicating to me that it needs water.) Also always make sure your planters have drainage holes which will prevent root rot!  Start with an easy plant like a snake plant or pothos. Snake plants love to be ignored and I only water mine about once every 4-6 weeks and theyâ€™re thriving!! &amp; pothos will reward you by growing like crazy and they can live in almost any light situation. I water mine approximately once every 2 weeks, give or take.   Sorry for the novel lolâ€” plants take my mind off of things and get me excited!",False,False

You can't tell in the pic but he's a big ol' boy-- took him to the vet last week and when the vet tech was trying to get him out of the carrier she said ""Oh, he just keeps going!"" He's not fat, he's just really long and weighs like 10 pounds.   He's got one eye because he got in a fight at the humane society when he was a kitten and it got infected. We think the surgery to remove the eye must have also affected his sense of smell, because he refuses all food and treats except for what he already knows is edible.   Let's get weird, maybe it'll make you laugh. Like a lot of pet owners, my SO and I have a voice and a persona for him. His persona is a successful restauranteur who opened Mr. Whiskers' Chicken Tenders last year. The only entree is chicken tenders, but there's a buffet of sides (which change seasonally, ofc) and something like 25 sauces. They began offering grilled tenders after about four months, and are looking to expand into the breakfast game as well.",False,False
