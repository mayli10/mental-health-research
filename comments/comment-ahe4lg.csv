My husband was in the mood for chicken parmesan. Go figure. So Olive Garden we go. My only mistake was I ate 2 bread sticks. I was trying to cut back on the carbs ans eat one but I was hungry. I ordered the Minestrone and a diet coke. Suitable since I had a large lunch of sushi earlier. Still feel guilty on that. But my waitress kept asking me if I wanted more soup. I wanted to tell ""how many time so I have to say 'no'? I dont want more. You're still getting a tip."" I'm sure it was just her being nice but its like stop tempting me!",False,False

I feel comfortable eating an appetizer in place of an entree often. Or a lot of places now serve “small plates”. ,False,False

At this point, I think I’ve even gone to restaurants with friends and not ordered anything bc I just don’t care anymore ",False,False

I forgot to mention in the post that my concern was my mom, who was sitting at the table with me and may or may not have noticed that I'm leaving food on my plate at every meal, as opposed to childhood-me who ate everything in sight and helped herself to seconds.   Thanks anyway! You're very kind and your words were very soothing.",False,True
