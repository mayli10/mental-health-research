I can talk to her about EVERYTHING but weight. I always hire her hints about my binges and she‚Äôs just like, ‚ÄúYou know how to solve this problem, eat more veggies and protein and stop eating sweets‚Äù üôÉ",False,False

I'm really working in being grounded. What's worked for me is allowing myself to say that situation sucked le allowing myself to have a negative emotion before it turns into a full blown mountain like it use to. ",False,False

I also have trouble controlling myself around snacks and also I get annoyed when people bring them in the house. That doesn't mean i'm an idiot who can't understand that I put the food in my mouth. I don't need a therapist to tell me that. I need empathy and compassion and help to not feel so out of control. Seriously, he's a dumbass.",False,False

The fact he doesn't say anything when you restrict is not good. Like restriction can lead to worse binges (b/p cycles).  Him sighing is extremely rude.   If you think he's been helpful in the past and want to give him another shot, please bring up these concerns with him. Maybe in an email or write them out. If he doesn't acknowledge there's a problem with his style , find a new therapist!!! It's a huge waste of your time &amp; can cause damage to see a ill fitting therapist. ",False,False

You seem super grounded. I tend to whip myself up into emotional turmoils where I conflate my specific bad feeling with EVERYTHING IS THE WORST. But you seem like maybe you don‚Äôt do that and I admire that. ,False,False

I really like her though, so I just make a point to bring up whatever it was she said that upset me at our next appointment. She takes my criticism really well so far. Maybe you could mention to him how his reactions are upsetting you? At least give him the chance to change tactics, considering how long you‚Äôve been seeing him. Then if he still sucks you‚Äôll know for sure that it‚Äôs time to move on. ",False,False

His sighs, not commenting on something I say. Maybe it‚Äôs all in my head. But I mentioned that I try and not bring snacks into the house and get angry that family members do. His response? Well it‚Äôs your fault, you can‚Äôt blame someone else. You put the food in your mouth. BUT ITS NOT THAT SIMPLE (I say in my head). If I didn‚Äôt have to, I wouldn‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt *stop*, once I start. Just not feeling understood. He also acknowledges that binge eating is unhealthy. But when I mention my current coping mechanisms for restricting since I don‚Äôt purge (well he‚Äôs aware I‚Äôve tried but can‚Äôt), no judgement passes. So I feel encouraged? Does that make sense? Idk even. Thanks for talking to me though about this üò≠",False,True

Perhaps because it‚Äôs psychotherapy (so I lay on a couch) and he sits behind. And I‚Äôm just supposed to talk ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.   He has upset me before. I should say he‚Äôs not at all an ED specialist. I saw him because I was exposing myself to dangerous situations sexually. And now instead of sex I‚Äôm using food as a control. But he‚Äôs literally triggering me. Encouraging my restriction periods.   He judged me for not eating healthy. I tried explaining I can‚Äôt even eat a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù amount of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù foods like rice, pasta, bread. I just shovel it in. But all he could hear was me saying ‚ÄúI ate my weight in flapjacks over the weekend‚Äù and he was fucking judging me hardcore. Urgh ",False,True

How long have you been seeing him / has he ever upset you before &amp; ignored your response like today? Also what did he specifically say? (Trying to get a gauge on him),False,False
