After I binge I tend to go back to healthier foods and I can volume eat and still restrict then scale back the volume til I’m back where I’m comfortable existing. Maybe try volume veg?,False,False

The binge restrict cycle is REAL and really annoying, I feel your pain. As tempting as it is to try to “fix” your binge, I’d try to eat normally. I usually find that eating normally resets my appetite to its baseline, and I’m less likely to binge in the following days. Try not to be too hard on yourself, good luck! ❤️",False,False
