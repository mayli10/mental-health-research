I see a lot of people here lamenting their lack of sex drive in their lower weights and it's good to see a perspective from the other side. Congrats on your progress and your muscle done sounds amazing ü§©,False,False

It‚Äôs all so exciting again/actually enjoyable and I‚Äôm loving it. Pretty sure all I actually did yesterday was have sex and watch Netflix, a few months ago there is no way I‚Äôd feel okay and not guilty doing that.  My boyfriend really struggles with understanding my ed so he‚Äôd just be sitting there in defeat asking if there was something wrong with him after a while of me not really being into it and I honestly feel so terrible I made him feel that way. We should feel so proud of ourselves for fighting for our damn lives back, this shit is hard work but we‚Äôre doing it!",False,True

Even when I would be in the mood when I was at the worst of my ED,  I was too worried about my body to be in the moment. My partner and I had sex twice yesterday and I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs two more times than we did the entire month of April when I was at a low pointü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",False,False
