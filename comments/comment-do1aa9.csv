I didn't go into full fledged conversational detail with him about it because cowardice but I basically alluded to how it was making me feel in terms of control and told him flat out yesterday that I just can't eat in the way he thinks that I can. He seems to have gotten the hint but I'll have a real and more in-depth conversation with him about it if he keeps it up.",False,True

If it were me, I would explain to him that I appreciate his concern, but that my disordered eating is triggered primarily by feeling ""out of control"", and when he essentially forces me to eat food, he's just triggering that response more, which is going to cause me to restrict further/engage in other forms of self-harm and/or disordered eating when I'm not with him.  Because it's all about control, and ultimately, the best thing he can do for you right now to minimise further self-harm is to make sure you feel in control. Taking that control away from you might seem like the ""right"" thing to do in the short-term because you are technically eating more food, but it's the wrong thing to do in the longterm because it will trigger more damaging behaviours (like b/p as you said).  Good luck with this situation. Well-intentioned bystanders are the most difficult aspect to navigate.",False,False

Honestly it was one of the huge contributing factors to why we are no longer friends. I can't handle being around people who don't respect the boundaries that I've clearly set, and no, getting me high on weed so I'll eat an entire pan of brownies is NOT helping me.",False,False

I'm thankful that he's so willing to help but I've already mentioned to him that I'm not actively seeking recovery right now and that I'm afraid his bringing me food so often will result in a b/p, which is something I've managed to rarely do. But you're right, I'll try to talk to him more.  Thanks for the advice!",False,True

This is honestly a pretty hard situation imo because I’m 99.9% sure he thinks he’s doing what’s best for you, and that he’s just trying to help. Maybe try to explain to him that your recovery is something that you have to go through on your own? Or at least the majority has to be on your own?
