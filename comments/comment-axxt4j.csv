But feeling huge blows! so I restrict and the cycle continues.  I get this realization especially when I’m high. Not sure what that means, but it happens more high than sober when I look and see scary thin. It makes me sad to think that’s what my mom sees. ",False,False

I usually go between feeling fat or thinking I look skinny and OK. Occasionally, I see myself and see emaciated/sick/sad. I usually end up bingeing on those days and then end up back in the cycle.  I am sure you look fine. You are also more than your body.",False,False
