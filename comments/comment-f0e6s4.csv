Sounds like it's probably the quest bars tbh. I think you are right- if you have a sensitive stomach anyway they are probably too much. Shame because they are so nice!  If it continues, you could try some imodium (or U.S equivalent)?  P.s it's happened to me too in the past so you are not alone :P",False,False

Quest bars are a recent thing and Iâ€™m wondering if they may be at least partially responsible, as I know they cause problems for some people. I only have one a day but obviously will be avoiding them for now.  My stomach has been off quite often for a long time though (months? Maybe over a year?). Not every day but I go through bad periods, and itâ€™s been a nonstop shitshow (ha) for a few weeks now (even before the Quest bar obsession). I suspect the main reason is a relatively low volume of food with too high a proportion of fat and fiber with nothing much for it all to bind to?  Actually shitting myself is new though ðŸ™ƒ",False,True

They completely destroy my stomach when I eat too many. So does too many beans/lentils.  My cousin has ulcerative colitis (not suggesting you do btw) and he has been advised to eat little and often and to eat a low fibre diet. Perhaps you could try that for a few days?,False,False

Peppermint, ginger or chamomile teas are good with honey.  Eat small portions at a time to go easy on your digestive system. Meditation or breathing and relaxation exercises are very helpful as well.",False,False

Iâ€™m of course sticking to white rice right now, will probably try some gf toast, applesauce, and bananas later (brat diet). But Iâ€™m wondering about things like tea. Iâ€™m thinking chamomile or ginger tea with or without lime/honey. And I know enough to avoid strong spices/sauces, but do you think itâ€™s safe to add a very small amount of tomato paste to the rice? Salt? What sorts of things do you do or not do to manage your own symptoms?",False,True
