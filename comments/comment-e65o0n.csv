Itâ€™s so inappropriate for you to be pushed into doing things youâ€™re uncomfortable with, especially given the recovery program context.   It seems like everyone is aware of your personal connection with eating disorders, so you need to be honest and put a stop to it immediately. Go to your boss and say that you canâ€™t continue with these activities because itâ€™s impacting your own health and well-being. Itâ€™s not up for discussion - you are informing them that you canâ€™t continue. It sounds like it wasnâ€™t ever supposed to be part of your role, so this shouldnâ€™t be a problem.   If you can/want to, try to get in touch with local appropriately qualified people and get some quotes for how much theyâ€™d charge to cover the sessions. You can then present some alternative options to your boss. This has the advantage of the service users getting better support, which should be what everyone wants.   You can then either speak to the guardians of the young people yourself or ask your boss to do it, say you canâ€™t provide that support any more and recommend other services they can try.   I hope this doesnâ€™t come across harshly - I want you to look after yourself and be safe. If the thought of doing any of the above worries you or makes you fear for your job security, you should speak to HR.",False,False

Please be honest with people an tell them that youâ€˜re struggling yourself or that itâ€™s just to overwhelming for you to do all that on your own. ITâ€˜S OKAY TO SAY NO!!! Especially if the situation is triggering you. You have to help yourself first!! ðŸ’•,False,False
