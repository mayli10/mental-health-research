However, three workouts a day seems like itâ€™s getting well into territory where it can be masking ED thoughts/impulses/emotions. EDs can be really sneaky at sucking a person back into their vortex. And jumping from zero to multiple workouts a day is likely to put a lot of strain on your body, possibly resulting in injury (and then limited exercise as a result).   I think itâ€™s worth giving serious consideration to your treatment teamâ€™s suggestion, and hopefully having an open discussion with them. Going my own way often leads to overdoing things out of massive enthusiasm and then imploding...and then repeating. The easy-does-it approach can be frustrating but can ultimately give much more positive and sustainable results. Your body gets to keep healing. You get to work on slowly building a healthy relationship with exercise and discovering what is the most fun for you. You get to keep exercise in your arsenal as a tool instead risking it morphing into a weapon. &lt;3",False,False

I'm not familiar with having a team by your side but I'd be transparent and let them know. Honest is the best policy. ðŸ’“,False,False
