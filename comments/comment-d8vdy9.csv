I didn’t the same when I realized that their behavior was not normal. I feel that we should remind ourselves of positive things and not allow those places to taint our recovery. The fasting subreddit is particularly toxic. I remember someone asking if losing hair is normal and they literally go,” it’s just hair. Forget about it.” That’s crazy and no healthy person should be losing their hair over their diets. There so many things we can do to remind ourselves that there’s more to life than the ED controlling us. The support and love from others that understand is so important and I am so glad we have a sense of humor about it. Love you and wish you the best on your recovery and happiness. 💞💕💘",False,True

I didn't unfollow this one.  Cheers to a community of people from all walls of life in all different places with their journey, who can still take the time to come here and spread love. We're a great bunch!",False,False
