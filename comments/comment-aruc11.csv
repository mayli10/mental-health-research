First of all, as I’m sure you know and probably have experienced in trying to quit stimulant laxatives, our bodies get dependent on them and there is a really uncomfortable time (maybe a month or so) of readjustment.    Everyone gave me the same advice. Eat more fiber. Drink more water. Go on walks.    Those things are great, but did not help and I always ended up going back to the teas because I was uncomfortable AF and seriously looked pregnant because I couldn’t go.    Finally found a dr who had experience in treating my specific situation and got a solution.    Obviously all of previously mentioned things, but also Miralax. Specifically, in the evening I do 1 1/2 capfuls mixed into a 16oz hot tea.   Also, magnesium. I really like a products called Calm. I mix a Tbsp into a 1/2 cup of hot water and just slam it right before bed. If I don’t have Calm, I’ll just take a magnesium supplement ~200mg.    These two things changed my life.    It took a while for the bloating to subside. But I have become regular and don’t depend on the tea anymore.    I would also recommend fermented foods and things with live cultures- rebuild the bacteria in your gut and intestines after the destructive action of the laxatives.    I truly wish you the best. I know that is a total hell to be experiencing, but there is a light at the end of the tunnel!!",False,False
