Like zoodles instead of pasta. Skipping the starch and doubling up on the veg. Making myself some mashed cauliflower instead of potatoes.  A household fave though is ""pizza eggs"". Microwave eggs like you're going to make an egg sandwich, top with some homemade pizza sauce (or store bought ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) and some mozz, chuck in the oven (350 for 5ish). I always pair it with salad and fruit and end up under 200. Mine being egg whites, and theirs being whole eggs.  Chili omlettes are a big go to too. I make a big batch of chili that makes about 10C. Half cup portions are around 90ish. Chili baked potatoes, chili egg(white for me) omlettes, chili with rice, chili with veg, etc. Most come under 300.",False,False
