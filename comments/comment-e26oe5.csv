Dealing with depression and anxiety since my teen years I always wanted to exist as little as possible. I believed being bigger equaled being inconvenient. I thought of my appearance, words, abilities, and impact to be a waste of space. In my experience it had to do with never feeling like I fit in traditional roles. Believing that I was alone in having thoughts and feelings outside what is commonly discussed. Thinking my appearance was odd and different from those around me. In my twenties I have learned to celebrate those differences, yes I still struggle each day with ed thoughts, but I realize that it is okay I am not like everyone else. At the same time I share experiences with those around me who also struggle with self-acceptance. So in many ways we all share the same space. We are all humans just trying to survive and there is room for me, you, and our differences. Somewhere out there is a place for each of us, and we are all fragile and small in the scope of humanity.",False,False
