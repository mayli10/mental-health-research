I also live in a city center and all the people that live in this goddamn city are beautifully dressed, wonderfully skinny and just plain beautiful.  The grocery store is only a five minute walk but its a whole day activity for me to go. I need to: take a shower, put on my best going out clothes, make sure my hair is great and maybe I can go out. Take another five hours to make sure my make up is okay. Stand in front of the door for another hour to give myself courage. Then wait two more hours til my boyfriend gets home because he makes it so much easier to leave the house.",False,False
