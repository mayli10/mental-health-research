I personally don't because they'll jack with my moods. if they happen to not contain any animal-based food ingredients, whatever. they're still biscuits. literally nothing is actually vegan anyway due to crop deaths.

If someone only feels comfortable eating vegan foods at where they are, let them eat!!! let them fucking eat!!! sorry I'm not angry with you just passionate about this lol  If veganism is a step between restriction and recovery, so be it. Veganism CAN be a misstep for health for sure... But an ED is so much more extreme than that.",False,False

If you are clamping down on carbohydrates to prevent diabetes or diabetic complications, and you're only eating plants, your protein levels will be insufficient too. In all, a plant diet is completely deficient in, as you concede, cobalamin, and multiple other nutrients which many or all people must get in the diet. I also worry that supplementation, necessary on a plant diet but not on a diet high (6 svgs/wk or more) in animal products, could cause issues for some people that getting the nutrients from whole animal-based foods will not.!&lt; [TW: talk of antinutrients, which can cause atypical orthorexia]  You may think you're doing a good thing with what you are saying, but you are not. These people, if they try to recover from anorexia on a fully plant-based diet, will ultimately run into a brick wall. From their anorexia, they are malnourished. Place on top of that a vegan diet, and you're making a malnourished body process calories, &gt;!especially carbohydrate and vegetable oil calories (which require the most nutrients to process),!&lt; [TW macro talk] without sufficient nutrients to go alongside. &gt;!You're asking then for hyper- and hypoglycemia, and a condition that I hypothesise is a form of subclinical refeed syndrome (caused by other factors than the refeed syndrome that generally kills people), resulting in general bad feelings which will reinforce anorexia, since you just need less nutrients to maintain a TDEE of 400-800 kcals/d than to rapidly (over 3 weeks, to not cause refeed syndrome from an acute nutrient depletion) rise to a TDEE of 2000-4000 kcals/d.!&lt; [TW calorie number talk]",False,False
