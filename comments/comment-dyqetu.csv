I might have to try it as OMAD has been so difficult to keep to with all of the Christmas festivities happening lately. People really love being nosy and pushing food on you. 🙄,False,False

I don’t always perfectly adhere to it, but it provides me a good rule of thumb and I follow it for the most part! I’m not weighing myself until my clothes fit the way I like because I don’t want to get triggered. It’s so dumb but it will set me off. I would rather enjoy my life a bit and follow this diet as a general rule. I eat fruits and veggies and then have a 300-400 calorie meal and it’s actually pretty awesome for me. On weekends I go over (but not over my tdee) pretty often but during the week I’m so low that I’m still in a calorie deficit.",False,True

And everyone was always making comments about how “thin” I used to be and how I “used to look like a model”. Being constantly compared to other people or even to your past self just makes you feel so much worse. Like hi, I’ve had a shitty relationship with food for most of my life and your comments are reinforcing that, but obviously you won’t understand because I don’t *look* like I’m starving anymore, so I must be fine and just being a little fatass out of choice because I clearly don’t care. 🙄  I’m doing OMAD for a month but want to try the Skinny Girl Diet next. How easy are you finding it?  Also, I hope you’re out of that toxic relationship now and you’re in a better place. ♥️",False,False

I never even noticed anything about her until she was his ex. Then the thought of them being together for 8 years really hurt me. I know I am torturing myself, and he tells me I am the best thing thats happened to him, it’s something I’m struggling with. Of course personality is a huge factor, she didn’t treat him well. But even though there’s those compatibility things, I feel like, well I wanna be the best one. I wanna be the sexiest girl he’s been with. I don’t want to feel like he is settling for me! He says I’m his dream girl but I wanna feel like I am and actually look like a smokeshow in a bikini.",False,True

When I met my ex I was a stick and were both like duper skinny and trendy. I gained weight to be healthy and fit for a while (size 2, 5’8” 130 lbs) and that was my sweet spot, I felt okay. I’ve never thought I was super hot, but people definitely told me I was. Fast forward 6 years, I gain 40 lbs from sedentary lifestyle, my relationship had become toxic. I never went anywhere. I hid. Then post break up I lost most if it and I haven’t been able to get the paranoia out if my head. It doesn’t help that I have people that compare me to others. Or that I’m the only one who fits into a S for my friends bridesmaids dress, the other girls are XS. Its stupid cause I can’t follow my own advice, but if you do it slowly you can lose it again. I’m doing the skinny girl diet and I like it so far! If I lost 20 more lbs I’d be super skinny and I kinda want to be... the yoyoing is the nature of eating disorders with the ultimate goal of getting thin and staying that way...",False,True

I’ve been super insecure and asked him if he was attracted to me and why he was with me once, and I kept pushing it, and he got mad and was like “why would I be with you if I wasn’t attracted to you?”. We honestly have crazy chemistry and he told me he was glad to see that I have boobs and a butt because brown girls never have an ass. I was actually fine until accidentally seeing photos of both his exes. They were both so hot, big boobs, flat stomach, nice faces... I can’t stop looking at the photos of the one I knew though cause she and I are so similar and I know when I used to be skinny I was on the same level. Ahh I guess I just gotta focus on exercising and eating right, which is sooo hard to do sometimes",False,True

My bf told me that he actually really loves my body even though I have stretch marks and a stomach. I’m 5’1 and 140 lb. I weigh more than my bf who’s 5’7... honestly I used to not believe him but then he did his best to reassure me. Like why would he be with me and do the nasty if he didn’t like my body??? I still have insecurities but overall it gets better! He loves you! And your body!,False,False

My boyfriend’s ex is small and petite and stick fucking thin, I’m talking bones everywhere. He says he didn’t really like that and hated cuddling her or anything because of it, and that he loves me for me, but it really doesn’t help my mental state when he calls me “bigger than him” or “large” (I’ve put on a lot of weight over the last year because of medication and excessive drinking and family issues and other things). It also hurts so much that he said I “was a fucking broomstick when we met” because I was sooo thin and I know he was really attracted to me. I definitely feel like things would be better between us if I was thinner and he would desire me more (he’s told me that sometimes he doesn’t find me desirable but says it’s an issue with him and nothing to do with the way I look, but I just don’t believe that). I can’t stop comparing myself to his ex and feeling like a fucking failure. She’s so tiny, she makes me look like three blue whales superglued together. 😩  I’m doing intermittent fasting for a month - one 600kcal meal a day - and I just want to see if his attitude towards me changes. If it does, then that will just confirm that I look better when I’m thinner. And I’ll be happy because I’ll be thin again (yay!). It will also bring back ALL of the negative ED thoughts and behaviours that I’ve been trying to ignore/eradicate, but I guess you win some, you lose some, right? 🤷🏽‍♀️",False,False
