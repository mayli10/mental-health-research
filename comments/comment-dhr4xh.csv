There is a primal rage that overtakes me when someone tries to tell me anything about how I feel or how I should feel.   I’m wondering how many of us are really stubborn and get oppositional - I tell my wife that if she doesn’t want me to throw a fucking hissy fit and refuse ALL food that she can’t tell me what I should do. Ffs, I know she’s trying to help but like ???? Everyone??? Stop???  I feel this, is what I’m trying to say :/",False,False

That's not a friend thing to say.   ""You're so skinny already"" ""You're not fat"" ""You look unhealthy"" ""I love food how can you not??"" are all triggering at worst and inane empty statements at best.  I honestly don't even know what a helpful thing for a friend to say is. I just don't tell anyone at all so I don't have to deal with any comments because I couldn't handle them and nothing will be helpful. Like I actually want to know what a good thing to say to someone is other than ""I'll love you no matter what"".   I have never looked like I obviously have an ED (except when I was younger but kids are stupid and will call you anorexic for skipping lunch + I can't remember much from then) but I have lost large amounts of weight in short periods of time and I've always just said I got sick/depressed so I couldn't eat (not a lie!), so I haven't had to deal with this, thankfully.  My boyfriend will just say ""you gotta eat something and drink water so you feel good today"" but he doesn't even know when I'm restricting lol, but it's still a helpful thing to say and not too much pressure.",False,False

Idk y he thinks he has the right to say that, especially when he knows u like that. Sometimes we don't know y ppl we trust turn on us like that and I wish I had an answer.",False,False

Legit had a friend a couple days ago say ""seriously, how can anyone NOT love food?"" While staring me down like it was a challenge. I just had to sit there and ignore her cuz girl, I love food as much as she does but Idk...I have a freaking eating disorder???   To the edit: Yo Wtf. Who says that and actually thinks that they're helping??",False,False
