I swear Target is always the best’  I wish I had gone out to buy laxatives early enough to get them at Target! I went to Walmart for some magnesium citrate as a last resort—but alas, there was none on the shelf. Not one single bottle. Not one. *Not one.*   Begrudgingly, I undertook the (imagined) embarrassment of *asking an employee about it.* You know, after panicking and pacing around aimlessly for about 10 minutes. As one does.   AND I STILL! Didn’t get! The magnesium citrate! There was none! None! NONE!!!  ...I guess I could have gone to CVS afterwards, but the experience drained me to a sad degree... I wandered around til I forgot where I was. Then I purchased some truly *atrocious* “snake skin” leggings, went home, cried for no actual reason and immediately opened the trusty fasting app, lmao. ✨✨Glamor. ✨✨",False,False

I initially went to a grocery store today to get them but they didn’t have self checkout so I wandered around the bakery section and then I got really anxious and left,False,False
