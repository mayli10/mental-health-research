I was in ballet and my ballet teacher told me when I was 10 that nobody wanted to see a ballerina with thunder thighs and that I would have to start dieting and from then on until I got pregnant (17) I was always felt guilty about eating things that she and my parents wouldn’t approve of.   Like my parents, mainly my dad, would tell me to tell him how much I weighed that day and he’d get mad whenever I wouldn’t and it would always end up in a huge fight. Which was like daily or my ballet teacher would make brownies on my birthday for everyone but she would give me a really judgemental look whenever I reached for a brownie. She also fit everyone into a costume but picked the smallest one she could find and humiliated me in front of everyone in rehearsals about how I didn’t fit into the costume. I was the only person who didn’t have a costume thanks to her and she kept saying things like,”Not even close!” Or “Not even a prayer will fit you into this.” with the different tutus and I really, really hated myself for it. I still have problems now where I think I’m way too big compared to other girls or that I’m wide and it’s ugly.   Like I said, it’s never reached an eating disorder. Although I have considered laxatives and making myself throw up (I did that a couple of times) I have never really gone through with them. It’s such a shitty thing having people who are suppose to take care of you completely destroy you instead in that way and not even understand that’s what they’re doing. Like you’ll tell them but it just does not register at all with them due to their completely ignorance to our feelings and denial that anything could be different from their perception on what they’re doing. Sending much love to anyone dealing with this. It’s so sad.   I ate myself sick tonight and I’ve never felt more guilty in the last year. Take care of yourselves as much as possible. ❤️",False,False

I still have lots of memories of her body/food shaming me, lol. Some unintentional as a projection of her own insecurities, some intentional but kind of kneejerk, if that makes sense. I remember growing up feeling super anxious or embarrassed to ask for ""unhealthy"" food, but also confused because the food my mother regularly got for me wasn't always healthy either. It's like she was more than happy to ply me with junkfood providing I didn't ask for it.  If I were ever confident in my appearance as a chubby pre-teen/fat teenager, she would shoot me down, I think because she was anxious on my behalf that I would get treated badly for it (as if I wasn't already treaded badly for my size) and she wanted to preemptively protect me from that... only the things she said were super harsh. Sadly I think there was also maybe a little jealousy in there. The older I get the more I can see that my mother has truly struggled/suffered with her weight her whole life, too. I don't think I want kids but if I ever did I would try my hardest not to pass this on to them, too.  And don't even get me started on my dad, lmao. He's the one who overfed and neglected me until I was a stuffed little sausage, then when I wasn't somehow skinny (even though neither of my parents were skinny and I ate the same foods and portions as them so how did he expect it to go??) would shame me and sign me up for sports or exercises that I HATED because he didn't ask me what I would like to do (e.g. weight lifting, swimming or martial arts) and instead just forced me to do whatever he thought I should do (e.g. basketball or gym sessions with an impatient personal trainer).  It gave me massive anxiety about sports and gyms that make it harder to get fit now as an adult - it's hard to tell yourself that nobody is looking at you, that nobody thinks you're a nuisance at the gym, etc. when you have a whole childhoood of people staring at you jiggling down the basketball court and a PT who was visibly frustrated with you not being able to do a push up as a fat 11yo.
