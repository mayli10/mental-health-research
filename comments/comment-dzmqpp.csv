A lot of people in my class did, and they were smart graphic design students - even in *third* year many were having difficulties. some people just find the program easier than others. it's not because you're stupid or unintelligent.",False,False

Everyone needs a break sometimes.    This is one day. And honey, it gets better. I have been there and I'm telling you, don't give up. Hang in there.

I also contemplated suicide in high school and I‚Äôm so happy I didn‚Äôt because high school is a bubble that pops after four years. It‚Äôs certainly not easy to go through.
