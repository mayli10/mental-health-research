She refuses to eat the swapped meals, eats basically only Brazil nuts and garlic and there's a scene with some very obvious body checking in the dance mirror. Lemme just find out what episode it is  Edit : you might've already seen it it's season 1  episode 4 :)",False,False

I forgot his name and his season and episode, but he lost the weight! Rob something?   The 19 year old girl who was the fattest woman on the show passed away at 21. She was in the last season. I think her death scared me into changing even more, even though I’m older than her. I also think her bf was a feeder, so basically he killed her imo.",False,False
