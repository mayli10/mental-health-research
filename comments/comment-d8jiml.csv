Running is so weird.",False,False

It’s weird, I’m a terrible runner but I get what you mean, I just really like it too, but for me I normally hate the first five minutes until I start getting that rush so it’s not quite as addictive because it’s not that instant.",False,True

I just can’t stop after I’m supposed to, it’s awful. I wasn’t even a great or even good runner I just liked it - it must really suck for those who are really into it :/",False,False

It sucks, I love working out, but I hate literally feeling like I’m going to die. I haven’t tried working out while on adderall yet but that seems like a bad idea too :(  I’ll just restrict and get depressed and miss out on those sweet endorphins.",False,False

I used to workout 5 days a week and I managed to ONLY maintain. Bc if I workout, I become ravenous and try to eat the entire kitchen; but if I just restrict, I can actually lose weight.   I really miss exercising, but I don't miss the scale staying in the same place week after week. I keep hoping I can get to a comfortable place and incorporate exercising back in, but I doubt that will ever happen.",False,False
