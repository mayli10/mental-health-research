Any therapist with ethics would never charge you for a session in which they tell you they won't treat you. I'm sorry if that happened to you.,False,False

It's probably pretty true when you think about food/calories, etc. Once you're seeing the therapist, tell them that you focus your anxiety on your body shape/size and what you eat. That's a good place to start. (I know I'm making assumptions here, but I'm trying to be general.)",False,False

I know it is not good for me to be treated by someone who doesn‚Äôt know much about EDs, and I appreciate that the people I have talked to so far have been honest with me.

They don't have the experience treating someone with an ED and they don't want to fuck it up. EDs have some of the highest mortality rates of all psychiatric diagnoses. And many people with EDs refuse to work toward recovery, so therapists feel like failures if you refuse to try to get well.  You could try getting a therapist without mentioning the ED. Then later, tell them about it but explain that you withheld the detail because you were afraid they wouldn't take you. By then, the therapist may feel comfortable enough with you to keep working with you.  Source: I'm a mental health provider",False,False

I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this. Have you tried explaining that there is no specialist in your area to help treat you for this? I‚Äôm very sorry that this is happening to you especially when you seem to want to get help. Do your parents/guardians know about your disorder? If not then please explain and tell them about it. They may can help. I wish you the best and I hope you are able to find someone. Sorry I may not be of much help. Much luck to you my friend. Stay safe ‚ô•Ô∏è,False,False
