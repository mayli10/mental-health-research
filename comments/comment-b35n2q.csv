There *is* a starvation mode... talk to any doctor or look at scientific evidence. It does not make you stop losing weight but it makes your body slow down it’s processes. People just want to believe and spread the “iTs JuSt CiCo!” that they have told each other in echo chambers while ignoring factual evidence. ,False,False

But, what you described is a very simplistic way of looking at TDEE and BMR. BMR and TDEE are not the same TDEE = BMR + NEAT + EAT + TEF. Morever your BMR doesn't just depend on ""the weight you're hauling around"" but also on your muscle mass. And apart from that, your BMR does decrease slightly as you decrease your intake (which is why it's always recommended that you keep your caloric deficit as small as possible). Now all of these factors combined can't probably account for the huge caloric deficit OP is putting themselves in, which is why I specifically said that they would not gain.",False,False

At first this means weight loss. But your body's other functions will decrease (e.g. Hair growth, immune system, etc.)  Your body will try and conserve as much energy as possible with the calories provided, so digestion will slow down too (especially as there's less food for it to digest anyway). Hence many with EDs have to use laxatives.  When your weight decreases your basal metabolic rate also decreases, simply because you're physically smaller so you need less energy - this isn't a lie, I had my bmr measured recently (a few months ago at 54kg it was 1300 and now at 53kg it's 1279).  Also metabolism slowing is why when people's weight loss plateaus on a certain number of cals, they then increase them (boosts your metabolism because your body is like ""omg food! Quick digest it before we starve again!"" and then they get a whoosh in weight loss. ",False,False
