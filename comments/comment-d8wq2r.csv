It's really not worth the long term damages even if you have ed :( I have a GI in my family, and he told me how he sees a lot of permanently incontinence young girls in his practice because they abused laxatives so much.   Specifically, the class of laxatives that trigger your autonomic nervous sytem. I'm sure the stool softener class (which lubricates your poop by absorbing the water in your lower intestines) probably have long term risks too tho",False,False

They just make you draw water into your large intestines and that makes you poop much faster and much more. But the poop stored in your large intestines is not absorbed as calories. Your large intestines have no way of absorbing calories, they only absorb water, which has no calories. It's your small intestines that absorb calories, and the food goes through your small intestines, then your large intestines. By the time the remainder is in your large intestines waiting to be pooped out, all the calories have already been absorbed.  Now, all that water and poop weighs a lot, but you won't get rid of any fat because you aren't avoiding calories. The water and poop will just get replenished later. So although you will weigh less, and your stomach will be a bit smaller, it's only temporary. So if laxatives are causing you distress, you can give them up entirely without any effect on your long term weight loss.",False,False
