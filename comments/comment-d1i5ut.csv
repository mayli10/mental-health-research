So frustrating,False,True

A lot of ED are about control, and it sounds like someone took away some of that control today when they didn't have your desired pizza and left off your desired topping.  I once had a full on screaming/crying breakdown and tried to dump my boyfriend of 5 years because he ate my leftover lasagna that I had been looking forward to all day. He absolutely did not understand why it was such a big deal, but bless him for not dumping ME after that episode LOL.   Normal people without ED brains just dont understand the strong emotions we develop around food, but I get you. I hope tomorrow is a better day!",False,False
