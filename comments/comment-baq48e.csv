I actually did really well last weekend, only binging once fri-mon. I didn't feel too ashamed about it until she kept prodding like ""so y did u do it huh??? maybe because you don't really want to give up bingeing??? etc."" like jfc I was almost ready to move on and you're giving me the 3rd degree yet tell me I need more self compassion? what the actual fuck???",False,False

I know it probably won't happen but I keep seeing my peers getting their words blown out of proportion and misconstrued and I'm just mildly scared of that happening to me too. I've had my RBF completely misinterpreted in person before and been told that I was a liar when I denied it, and I felt so powerless.   This weekend I've just been going through the motions of socializing and could only pretend to enjoy about half of it. I keep wondering if people categorize me as a jerk when I'm not smiling or participating in a conversation that doesn't interest me.",False,False

I just got a pair of jeans in a size 26 petite and saw on the label that it's 26 or 2s. And I was like 2?? And got excited but then I was like HOL UP. 26 =/= 2 in pant sizes usually.
