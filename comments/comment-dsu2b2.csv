My partner walked to a nearby bakery and came back with some delicious treats which we split. It was going to be my OMAD and everything was reasonably portioned in the first place so I was looking at maybe 700-800 calories. Not the healthiest OMAD in the world but easy done.  I got maybe 1/3 of the way through my slice of cheesecake (which was already only half a slice) and it fell off my plate. Like, I don't even know how I did it, it was like a poltergeist pushed it off my plate or something, it TUMBLED - but it fell on my rug and got covered in hair and just... Being clumsy generally makes me feel completely worthless and stupid and takes me from 0-100 on the ""want to die"" meter so I just bitterly went and threw it in the compost. Then I came back and tried to enjoy the rest but I couldn't and I had to get ready for work anyway so I gave the last 1/3 of the bannoffee pie to my bf. The only thing I finished was half a custard donut which was nice but it was raw in the middle bc this particular bakery has a problem with their stuffed donuts even tho everything else is good and it's just like. Damn! None of this fucking worked out lmao!! I just felt like saying ""that's what I get for being a fatty"".  Then after work I met up with my bf and we went shopping, and we were kind of planning on getting something to eat there and I was like, cool, an excuse to eat more 👀 But we lost track of time and had to rush at the end. Not only did we not get to get food but we also didn't get to go to one of the other stores I wanted to go to because there was a miscommunication between us about what time the stores closed and so I was just stressed and had Zero food and Zero motivation to make anything at home bc I had already hit my calories for the day even tho I couldn't accurately figure out how many I had actually eaten, so eating out was going to be my reason to ""over"" eat.  I tried really hard not to lose it bc interrupted food changes upset my anxiety something WICKED but. Lmao. Why don't I ever deserve nice things, just once  O well. I found a really nice mushroom ""jerky"" and tried a new flavour of konjac jelly pouch (blueberry) that was really really good AND I found vegan kimchi with nutritional info (expensive but it tastes like how I like it) and two packets of my brand of 50cal konjac noodle soups that I hadn't seen in ages (I actually worried it got banned here or something??) so overall it was actually a pretty good day.
