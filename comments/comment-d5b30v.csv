He once got very drunk, bought gourmet cookies, ate them all in his McLaren on the way home and then ugly-cried over it. *Mood.*  Anyway I met my current boyfriend towards the end of that relationship. A very healthy normal fun person who briefly convinced me to remove head from ass. I mean, I'm relapsing now, but he's still a great guy.  It was simply never me, I was sick of it from day one.",False,False

It’s seriously an insane culture, did you finally just get sick of it?  What made you stop?  I dabbled in that community and even dated someone deep in it (like you) but he could only talk about his food and I was bored.  Also, his breath was nasty.",False,True

I knew an NPC bikini competitor in real life who was in such an insane deficit during competition prep, she posted alllll the time about being starving and getting by with cucumber slices and nooch, SF jello, etc. and how you NEED to weigh your oats because .5 cups is always over 32g, that sorta thing.  Didn't win her pro card, and proceeded to get even smaller/leaner next season. Like BMI 17 and 8% bodyfat.  Her and her boyfriend were both insane. As were myself and my ex, who were doing the same thing but too dysmorphic to ever compete, lmfao.",False,False
