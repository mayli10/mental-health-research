I'm from Canada and as I've started being more open with people about my ED recovery, I've gotten comments like ""Oh, but you don't have to gain anything!"" or ""Had you not said anything, I would have assumed you're just a little smaller than most."" My BMI used to be 17.3 but despite losing my hair, nails, skin getting dry and fragile, fainting, etc... I still looked *normal* to people.   So yeah, I get how invalidating that feels. I know it sucks because we're suffering and it never hurts to have someone show they care about our wellbeing. Right now, my biggest challenge is to be that caring with myself, to be the one showing concern about my own body.",False,False

My lowest weight was just on the lower end of the normal BMI, I'm pretty short so I need to lose a lot of weight to be underweight. I know how it feels to feel invalid, but I want you to know you and your eating disorder are valid and you are not alone",False,False

Are people from Europe frank and upfront, especially with matters regarding appearance? I am from Asia, and people here are so rudely honest (really blunt). They tell you straight up ""you gained weight"" or ""you lost weight"" or ""you should do this, for your face"" because here, everyone here wants to be skinny.  &amp;#x200B;  Hope you know your ED is valid. Please don't let what others think affect that.   Don't forget to take care and have a great day:)",False,False
