Trust me that it's possible - I've gotten even the stinkiest of shiritaki to smell like nothing after some serious rinsing.

Honestly I don't think they are at their best when just added to Italian pasta sauces, but you just gotta experiment.  Also note that certain brands are going to be much stinkier/fishier than others.  The American brands tend to be less stinky than japanese ones, but it might also come down to the packaging date.  I honestly really enjoy them, but mostly in a ramen type dish - they will never fill the whole wheat spaghetti void in my heart.",False,False
