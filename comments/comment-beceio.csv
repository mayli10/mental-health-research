When I went from a few pounds underweight to that unsustainable thinness I noticed a significant difference in the amount of attention I got.  Yes, some of it was superficial, but people also started taking me more seriously.",False,False

I have always taken issue with the link between EDs and ""control."" To me it is much more about access to power and protecting it. Nearly a decade ago when I was 20, I lost a bunch of weight very quickly after a breakup. I was also getting heavily politicized after being sexually assaulted my freshman year of college. After I lost weight, suddenly, people wanted to hear what I had to say. Suddenly the things I cared about were important and and I was interesting, and these urgent issues that demanded attention were finally getting it. I still become afraid that my work or struggle will be rendered invisible if I gain weight and look Blah. by now, it's probably all in my head. I could probably still get people to listen, still get people to collaborate with me and trust me. But I can't forget how people treated me pre- and post-weight-loss.",False,True

By inquiring about their body 'image' I was taking for granted that they imagined themselves as having bodies, an assumption that many women quickly dispelled.""  Holy shit thank you. I always thought it was just me. I never imagine my actual body. In fact I often have feeling of forgetting what I look like when I'm not in front of a mirror. I'm super disconnected from my body tbh.",False,False

My answer of why I have an ED and why I can’t recover is that I want to look good, up to societies standards.  But that sounds so vain and it always confuses me because I’m not vain.  It’s because thinness, being up to societies standards, is power.  To the degree of power it gives me?  Who knows, it may be minimal, but it’s power none the less. I have a power hungry personality so this makes so much sense.  The irony is that I totally lose that power when I let the ED take over my life.  Gotta work on that..  Thanks for posting.",False,False
