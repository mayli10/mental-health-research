I hate it and I am just not going to anything this year, tbh.   BUT clothes-wise you can’t go wrong with a loose/flowy dress, especially one with big sleeves and a very bohemian vibe.

You can also conceal your body in a more fitted outfit by wearing a HUGE loose-knit cardigan over anything. I also just love a lot of bracelets because my wrists are the only skinny part of me lol.",False,False
