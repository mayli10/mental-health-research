I know it's easier said than done but cutting calories down slowly or even eating at maintenance for a couple days is the only way I've been able to get out of and avoid binge/restrict cycles for long periods of time. It's enticing to want to fast or extreme low restrict after a day of binging but hormonally you're going to be soo much hungrier the day after binging due to blood sugar levels and chemicals that affect appetite, plus the psychological demotivation of breaking a no-binge streak and knowing you ""already messed up"", it's too easy to keep perpetuating the cycle and binging over and over when you try to restrict heavy to compensate.   I think you'll have a much easier time permanently breaking the cycle if you can eat 1200 or even more for at least a day or two after the binge then slowly work down. ",False,False
