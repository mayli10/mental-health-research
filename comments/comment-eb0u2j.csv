Less guilt! Even if you have one piece he would probably be happy to see it and you wouldn’t feel guilty because you wasted because you two were sharing! You guys love each other, it’s so sweet to see :)",False,False

It seems like he likes coming up and seeing you. Secondly, you sound sweet too! Oh hey, you’re not a bad daughter at all. Remember, your eating disorder is like if you had a physical disorder. It’s like if you couldn’t eat the fruit because you had no teeth. It’s the exact same. It’s not your fault that you can’t do it. The only difference is if you had no teeth your dad would know and see it, but he can’t see your mind.  I’m sorry ❤️ I know the struggle. I used to feel very guilty when I didn’t eat the dishes my mom would make me when I lived with her. She obviously was making them because she  felt bad about having being emotionally absent more when I was a younger and I think she wanted to connect.",False,False

You clearly appreciate your dad and what he does for you. He loves you much more than a silly pear, he doesn't care about that. You're not failing, in fact you're trying very hard, and for the sake of others at that.  It's all too easy to channel the pain of this disease in to self hatred. The disorder makes things complicated, not you. Eating disorder and recovery is always a struggle for everyone. Take it one piece at a time. It'll be okay.",False,False
