I just got tired of it. It’s really difficult to restrict so much and once you get to a low weight it’s impossible to maintain without binging because you restricted for so long. ",False,True

Maybe those spurts of motivation and neuroses will get shorter as I get older because I'll just give less of a fuck. 29 year old me right now still interprets that as ""giving up,"" even though I know that's just a gut feeling and it's not rational.

Plenty. Most women, especially as they get older, feel sexier in their skin and more comfortable/start giving less of a fuck. I know you can beat it. I’m sure I can too. Eventually. I just had to vent :( ",False,True

I want this to ""the last time"" but posts like this make me scared it'll just happen again, and I'm kidding myself by trying to be optimistic. ",False,False

At 150 lbs and at 110 lbs I felt just as fat and still not happy. Emotional fulfillment will never come from food or our appearance unfortunately. ,False,True

I’m weight restoring now and this time I’m much more confident about it bc I’m doing it at my own pace, and my husband is accommodating and trusting so I don’t have any of those „not in control“ feelings that would trigger a relapse.

I also don't feel any enthusiasm about hitting LWs anymore, the whole process of losing weight again is just, ""whatever, big deal, still not good enough."" I'm currently hovering a few pounds above my lowest weight ever, but I feel like I have to surpass it in order for any of this to ""count"", whatever that means.  Recently I've been getting overwhelmed by the mental and physical strain of just maintaining a low weight, not even aggressively trying to lose... I think, X months ago I would have been thrilled to be this weight, right? But I don't feel any better about myself. I feel just as fat as ever.",False,False
