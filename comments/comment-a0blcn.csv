I know he is doing it because he wants me to be healthy and he doesnâ€™t care what I look like, I mean itâ€™s sweet that he would rather I eat enough than be skinny and he knows my ED has wreaked havoc on me before ..... but itâ€™s also really frustrating because I am always having to reassure him Iâ€™ll eat more when I eat half of dinner...or like today I was sick and puking and he kept making me stuff to try to eat because he said its not healthy to not eat .... I wish I could do this in peace without worrying about disappointing him even though I know my health IS important, because I want to be skinny....",False,False

I canâ€™t express how happy I am for you. Having someone now (and that you really trust) know about food struggles makes it so much better. Sometimes when itâ€™s really bad I know I can call him or text him and heâ€™ll listen to me. Then weâ€™ll have a moment of silence and then he always finds a way to calm me down. Heâ€™s the only one who current knows I have an ED. He tries to keep me alive (keeps me warm and gives me vitamins) but never forces me to eat or not purge. I try to avoid purging bc I donâ€™t want to see him sad but itâ€™s a struggle still.   Im really happy that you have found that. Someone who can just be there, whenever you feel like crap. I hope he treats you well and that heâ€™s a keeper.",False,False

I straight up called my so today because I had a miniature crisis and was afraid I was going to throw up. And I was like ""I'm on my break shopping right now and my budget is going to hate me but I really don't want to throw up because that's gonna cause me to start purging"" and he just took it in stride she was like ""between your body and your budget I think your budget can handle it sweety"" ðŸ˜…. God I love him he makes me feel so much less crazy than I am. ",False,False
