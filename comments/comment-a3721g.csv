The ED hangs that cloud of negative emotions over you but remember those things it tells you are not true. You deserve happiness. What kinds of hobbies or activities help you feel good about yourself? Maybe when these feelings come up you can do something, even as small as laundry or organizing your room, that will make you feel that you’ve achieved something in other ways. Take care of yourself and know there are plenty of people here for support.",False,False

I get you're distressed and filled with guilt but anorexia is a DEMON not a friend. Trust me I've BEEN to hell and back.   So take a deep breath and try to remember that the eating disorder is talking and she's a evil bitch trying to consume you. ❤  Do something distracting go take care of yourself read a book watch YouTube. Push the bitch down for a bit ya know.",False,False
