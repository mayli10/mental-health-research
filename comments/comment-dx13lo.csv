So we already got our engagement pics done, but you make a really good point. I love those pics and feel awesome in most of them, so I just have to trust that the actual wedding ones will turn out great too.  I even booked a boudoir shoot and am waiting to get those pics back, and hopefully those will make me feel a little better about my body.  Thank you",False,True

I actually eloped so I wouldn't have to deal with wedding stress, lol.   As for the pictures, maybe get some cheaper engagement photos done first? By a friend even? It can help you have a realistic idea of what the wedding photos are like and help with posing on the big day. I didn't realize I have the same two (bad) smiles until I had pictures done by someone else!",False,False
