Always eating out, always taking leftovers back to the hotel to spoil and remind me how much money we wasted. Constantly feeling fat and gluttonous and inspecting my body in every bathroom mirror and guessing how much i gained because i couldnâ€™t weigh myself.... it was not great...  But!!! I still had some fun and honestly only gained like... 2 pounds. For being forced to eat three calorie-dense restaurant meals a day for 4 days straight AND giving into the driving snack trap that is a road trip... i really wish i had known it wouldnâ€™t have been the absolute end of the world because i would have relaxed a heck of a lot more...  Moral of the story: relax, order salads every so often, and have fun. Because you and youâ€™re body will be fine after a holiday vacation ðŸ˜Š",False,False
