According to BMI I’m severely underweight but I think I look normal, mediocre even. My SO says I don’t look sick but my therapist says I do. I don’t know what to believe. I just want my body to reflect the work I put in.",False,False

My BMI is like 15.1 I guess.. I recently gained a few lbs and it’s fluctuating like crazy but that’s what I’m at for today. I look fat in the stomach and normal everywhere else  My bf rudely/ in a drunken rant of a fight told me I look like I’m dying recently.... but now he says he didn’t mean it just wants me to gain weight so idk. I don’t look sick though. Most people compliment “omg you’re so thin, I can’t believe you had 2 kids” which I can see from looking at me with clothes on they’d think that. But my bloated belly making me look 5 months pregnant says otherwise",False,False
