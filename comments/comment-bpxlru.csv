They probably managed to get just under that 5 cal/serving threshold that allows them to report it as zero in the US. An EU monster label I’ve seen a pic of online reported 10 cal for the whole can. It’s frustrating when my brain logically knows 10 cal is essentially negligible in the overall scheme of how accurate my tracking can possibly be.....yet my brain still locks in on it and gets upset.,False,False

I suspect that the 4g carbs might be coming from the sugar alcohol they’re using to sweeten it (erythritol). Technically it’s a carb but my understanding is your body doesn’t digest it - so, zero cals. If the drink had 4g actual carbs, that would be 16 cals and the bottle would have to report that.",False,False
