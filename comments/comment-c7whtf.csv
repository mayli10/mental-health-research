However, with your own struggle w/ an eating disorder I’d say you’ll probably have to do more than just tell him you’re worried this time. It’ll be all too easy for him to rationalize to himself that you’re projecting onto him or reading into his behaviors too far.  The best bet I think would be to do some good research and put some stuff together for him. Showing him that it isn’t just in your head that he’s doing these things, that his behaviors ARE disordered, might be the push he needs to help himself. It’ll be a long road for him, much like for you, but if you stand by one another and support each other in a healthy way while ALSO taking care of yourselves, i think things can change for the both of you.  Best of luck. ❤️",False,False
