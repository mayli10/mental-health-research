I used to have the mentality of ""oh theres only X amount of something left, I might ad well finish it."" But, I've been learning to leave leftovers and that leftovers r ok (idk why but leftovers or unfinished food things bug me big time). To draw parallel, my thing makes sense on paper but dorsnt work out in reality. In your case, learning to set aside only a certain amount of X (chocolate in your case) per time period to ensure u ""stay on track.""",False,False

Christmas isn't over here yet, it's only 15:08! More food... Yay... I can't do a long fasts because I need to eat dinner with my family every evening and evading other meals is sometimes difficult, but I plan to just fast as much as I possibly can. Today I'm just filing away... I'm going to forget it ever existed. The leftover chocolate scares me though... I don't know how I'm going to fast with it in the house.   Merry Christmas to you as well though! We're all just trying our best to make the best of the day here.",False,False
