This isn't because of ""brain fat"", fat doesn't prevent the brain from working. It's quite the opposite.   If you feel like your thoughts are slowing down it's because your brain lacks nutriments, food. If you want your full potential to pass the exam, please give your brain what it needs to study and what it needs to stay awoken during the exam itself.  Also, please remember that even if you fail, it's not the end of the world",False,False

In order to do well on your exams and in your classes, you need to eat well so your brain can function! If noodles are what's available, eat them! They give your brain energy it needs.   Hang in there! If you can eat maintenance at least your concentration and general brain function will improve and your test results will too!",False,False
