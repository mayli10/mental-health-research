The thing is that the weight gained from hypothyroidism comes from a minimal reduction in metabolism (BMR may be reduced by 100-300 calories, in most cases) combined with an increase in appetite and fatigue/lower non-exercise activity.  I think the issue comes when people claim that weight loss is impossible under these conditions and that the only factor is their thyroid. It sort of obfuscates the reality that they are consuming more calories than they burn (because they burn fewer calories than they should be because of the metabolism change and are also getting less activity).  Imo, this is only really ""fatlogic"" when it's people who say things like, ""I eat 500 calories a day and still gain weight because of my thyroid"", which is improbable and not a scenario represented in medical literature on hypothyroidism. I think some people speak about it as though it is the same as Cushings disease or other conditions that can cause lipoma or fat-like tumors.  And then the other thing is that if the condition is treated and under control, then this shouldn't be a problem anymore.   Does that answer your question? I know people can get really vitriolic about this sort of thing but I tend to take a glass-half-full approach and view discussions of fat logic as, like, actually about logic and scientific reality, which they are unfortunately not always. I definitely don't think expressing views that some would consider fat logic is a sure sign of unintelligence or lack of discipline, for example.",False,False

Many people with eating disorders have expressed that they see others within normal ranges and think that they are beautiful and fit or thin, but they do not think the same of themselves even at the same or lower weights. I have an eating disorder and do not feel that a normal range BMI is fat.  There are women on Earth in the 20-21 BMI range that would be considered skinny.
