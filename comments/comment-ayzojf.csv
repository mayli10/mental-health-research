My girlfriend has an ED and she went through the same issues with not believing me. But one day she just sat me down and talked to me. I had to reassure her that I LOVE HER NO MATTER WHAT. And that is the absolute truth. I don‚Äôt prefer anyone but her, not some hot model, not some celebrity, no one but her. Of course she didn‚Äôt believe me, but over time she started to get better, she started to feel comfortable in her skin, and she started to believe me. She‚Äôs 8 months recovered right now and I‚Äôm so proud of her. She‚Äôs never seemed happier and I‚Äôm just proud she‚Äôs finally happy in her own skin. My point to this whole thing is, believe your boyfriends/girlfriends when they say you‚Äôre the most beautiful/handsomest person in their eye. Trust me they are telling you the truth. Sorry if this offended anyone! That was not my intention!  Ps. My girlfriend has a reddit and used to go on this subreddit all the time that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm using a throwaway   ",False,False

He says he loves me at any weight.. when we started dating 6 months ago I was 50lbs heavier.. i havent lost over the last 2 or so months and the comments have stopped at it now triggered me to restrict again and stop this ""binge purge shit""( that doesnt fucking work for weight loss just maintains while I eat like shit). Its not his fault just me setting these weird goals like fasting until he takes me out at the end of the week..  Ive hit the goal weight that he prefers for women but its not enough, Im going to lose more bc his goal weight is a more normal mid range BMI and mine is sitting on the line of normal and underweight.. I also have this weird thought like "" hey if this doesnt work out I can be skinny enough to get someone else"" (not that im afraid to be alone or think we are going to end anytime soon I just really like sex..lol) sooo basicslly I feel you and it's going to be okay, you do you boo üòò",False,False

Personally all the guys I have been with preferred average/chubby girls except one who made a point that they like thin women and I found that wayyyyyy more triggering - at the time with the other guys I was a little insecure because I'm thin but when I was with someone who actually liked thin women I found the pressure to stay thin coming from someone else so much worse. I still felt insecure at the start with all of them and tried to lose more weight but it balanced out eventually (with the guy who liked thin girls it didn't really).,False,False

I'm also long distance and since dating him I have lost 13lbs at least (when you're short it's a lot visually). He keeps telling me he preferred me a bit meatier but I honestly think he's lying. I mean it also doesn't help that I know his big celeb crushes were like WolfieCindy and Selena Gomez or like fitness people. Okay but basically I get where you're coming from and I even take a lot of things he says as calling me fat or something but I have no advice just know you're not alone,False,False
