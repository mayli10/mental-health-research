I was going to make a post about it.  I feel like 80% of what I eat is the stuff off of stuff.  Like I eat the chocolate chips off out of cookies and the chocolate off a Reese’s.  Or I’ll buy ben and Jerry’s and then only eat the chunks.  Me and my friends call it “de-skinning” ahah.,False,False

I guess it feels dainty and makes the food last longer...?,False,False

I've been trying not to count calories, so for some reason I feel better when I just absolutely nitpick at food, especially when it's dense/sugary/caloric stuff. The other day I scraped the chocolate nut coating off a bunch of almond rocas and tossed the middles... you're not alone. For me it's also satisfying to ""have"" a certain food without actually eating it all...",False,False

I eat the crusts on my pizza for the same reason.  I do have the chip habit though! No one in my house eats the crumbs so I make that my chip fix.",False,False
