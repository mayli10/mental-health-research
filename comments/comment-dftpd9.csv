I realize I kinda flipped out and lost my shit for minute there and I forgive myself for backsliding.   I feel good today. I am fasting, just drinking water, tea and coffee with flax milk. I am using today to reset myself, body and mind. After work I am going to walk to my favorite coffee shop and I am going to read and write. Then, I am going to take myself on a hike if the weather stays nice. When I get home I am going to soak in the bath and watch a movie.   I promise myself that I will not go crazy with the fasting this time. Just a few days and then I'll reintroduce food. I have to get my shit together this time. I will be a raw vegan after this fast. I know that is the best food for my body and for my mind. I will not waste anymore of my life.   I commit myself to my highest intentions.",False,False
