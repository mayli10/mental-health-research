Recovery record is an app that helps you analyze your behaviors and notice trends and practice coping skills. It's useful for all types of ED. There are also lots of books. If you have trauma I recommend the body keeps the score. If you're struggling with eating I've heard the intuitive eating workbook is helpful. And if you have trouble managing your emotions a basic cognitive behavioral workbook is a good start. Pm me if you can't afford to buy your books I might be able to uh Lend you some  digital ""copies"" I allegedly have access to ðŸ˜‰",False,False

I grew up with food insecurity too and it majorly fucked me up. My mom was bulimic at my age (mid-20s) but didn't engage in behaviors in front of me. She did, however, mention how expensive food was, which made me feel tons of guilt but also binge whenever food was available.  Seconding the sliding scales. These often aren't advertised, but clinics are likely to work with you if you ask.",False,False

I refuse to be a bad role model for my kids.  I always think, ""Am I treating myself the way I'd treat my child?"" Would I make my child over exercise, take ephedra, take laxatives, binge? Of course not. So why do I not treat myself with that same kindness?  There are a lot of good resources online to get a sense of ""normal"" eating and exercise. One of the hardest things to do is to trust those resources and not let your ED-logic get in the way.   I recommend looking at the diabetic exchange list. It's crafted for those with diabetes, but that doesn't matter. On the last page, there's a table that recommends exchanges based on your TDEE, which you can also calculate online.  [http://www.lillydiabetes.com/\_assets/pdf/ld90772\_dailymealplanguide.pdf](http://www.lillydiabetes.com/_assets/pdf/ld90772_dailymealplanguide.pdf)  Look at the way your daughter eats. She knows exactly what she wants. She can put down half a cookie when she decides she's had enough. She knows when she's hungry and knows when she's full. It's not because she's learned how much is too much, but because her bodily signals haven't been clouded by diet advice and unhealthy ideas.",False,False

My mom was constantly crash dieting, and forcing me to do them with her. I grew up in a food-insecure household so i think sometimes the diets were just a way to stretch out our food as long as possible, sadly. She's doing better as after we were out of poverty she started going to therapy regularly, and I refused. My mom is now healthy and happy, and she's helping raise my niece in a much healthier enviroment.   If nothing else it's important to talk to a specific clinic with a ""sliding scale"" because thats what a sliding scale is for, is to be able to slide to accomodate any income, including a firmly middle-class one. They'll be able to work with you so you're not straining your income for this. Take it from me, your daughter's mental health, body image, ",False,False

I have felt like I've been in a similar scenario, I have never had enough money to go somewhere nice like a talk therapist/art therapist with modern approaches but when I go the route of getting an available help I always get the vibe that I am a bit too ""high functioning"" to need the type of bare-bones free assistance I have been provided (once a month psych appointment, prescription for anti-depressants etc.).  However, I do know that I don't spend enough time looking for hidden places to find help and when I do I am surprised at the resources available.  Where you live may have an overeaters anonymous if that appeals to you?  You could look into parent groups for parents in crisis as well... anyway I hope other people reply with better suggestions than mine.   Also I think you might be wrong about places with a sliding scale not being able to assist you... I think usually sliding scales mean that a wide breadth of clients can be taken on, not just those who can only pay low rates",False,False

Iâ€™m at the stage now where my daughter is starting to look more like a woman, and Iâ€™m not. Also sheâ€˜s almost the same age I was when I first developed AN. I donâ€™t want her to think that Iâ€™m what a grown woman is supposed to look like. Being a better role model is definitely a big driver for my determination in getting in shape. Every time I want to give up, it helps to remind myself that :)",False,False
