My psychiatrist is very upfront with showing me studies that pertain to anorexia/recovery and parts of the brain literally atrophy (die) from malnutrition. You can gain the bran mass back but it takes *years* of recovery for it to get back to normal. Don't just blow off a professional's advice OP.,False,False

It's just that the average person can't function at 100% while underweight.

You are malnourished which will cause your brain to not function efficiently. That is why some people report having ""brain fog.""",False,False
