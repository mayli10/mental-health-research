I knew the risk and potential.  I emerged from hatred/grief and now I feel confident again with that hard choice for myself!

Iâ€™ve been allowing myself to snack more during the day, which is helping with the brain fog. Iâ€™m still restricting, but Iâ€™m trying to be better about it.   I weighed myself for the first time in a few weeks and Iâ€™m up 1.5 pounds. I panicked but when I checked the stats (I have a scale that does body fat, muscle, etc.) the whole increase was in muscle. So thatâ€™s good. Iâ€™m still underweight and I still want to weigh less but if Iâ€™m gaining muscle I can feel better about it.",False,False

Not binge OR purge   Also, unrelated, but I've been thinking about how my last relationship ended lately and while my ex and i are on friendly terms, I'm sad about what happened. He left because things got hard and I needed him to carry me through it, the same way I carried him through his struggles over the summer. He didn't owe me anything and in hindsight, Im better single right now anyways because he just wasn't mature enough to handle what I was going through.
