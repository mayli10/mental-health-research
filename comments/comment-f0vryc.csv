It really helps me refocus when the ED brain is shouting about something. Cello and running are the main ones for me :) I’m only 2 years into learning cello (adult learner) but it is such an amazing and rewarding experience.   It kinda sounds like your dad doesn’t understand that EDs are a mental illness (my dad doesn’t understand my mental health issues at all either) but it sounds like he cares about you, and I hope you’ll be able to have a good and supportive relationship with him &lt;3",False,False
