It's definitely sort of masochistic in nature, or the restricting/fasting is, and I definitely relate to wanting to feel like a medieval saint. I realized sort of recently that I have, ever since I was a young child, felt like there was something inherently evil and grotesque about me - might be from being abused, idk. And I have this idea that I can essentially starve away the evil. And that's the root of it for me, not control, not vanity, although those come into play too to an extent.  The good/bad thing about realizing this is knowing my primary reason for restricting is that it makes restricting so much easier. ",False,False

It gives me a sense of control, and it's easier to lie to myself about what I'm doing to myself because it's not leaving gaping wounds all over my body. I struggled with disordered eating for a good portion of my life, and before I fell pregnant in January, I was at my lowest weight. I recovered during my pregnancy but experienced an emotional trauma shortly after giving birth and hit a full relapse. I dont know what I'm doing at this point but I'm in too deep to give it up now.",False,False

Seeing the effects of starvation isn't even pleasant for me (might be uncommon with ED people? but I don't find thinness attractive), it's like  **TRIGGER WARNING** seeing the wounds when I cut or burn.  I like to know what I'm doing is damaging my body.  I don't care that my hair falls out, that I feel shitty 24/7 because it's reassuring me of ... something.  It's punishment and also a relief to know I'm punishing myself.  &amp;#x200B;  \- *I absolutely love it when my stomach twists and contorts itself as I lay in bed at night*   I can watch my stomach for so long when I see this happen.  When I feel that a gas bubble's developed somewhere, or food's moving in my pipes I like to watch it deflate and move somewhere else.  If I don't get that happening in the evening then I panic because I think I've gained too much weight to be able to see it.  It looks revolting, but I want to see it and feel revulsion.  EDs are so fucking complicated, the reasons why we develop them.  That's why I think recovery fails so hard a lot.  It's a mixed bag of reasons with me - self punishment, control, not wanting a body that's going to attract men, loads more lesser reasons, but for sure it's another form of self harm.  **BY THE WAY YOU ABSOLUTELY DEFINITELY DO NOT SOUND LIKE AN IDIOT.  x**",False,False

My binge/purge/restrict/fast etc cycles is very much a depression thing, and self-harm replacement and while part of it is wanting to have some self-control and a lot of my self-hate and disgust at my weight is for my lack of control/lack of discipline and i see weight loss/thinness as a sign of self discipline and worth?? i guess? a lot of my behaviours are expressions of self hate and a form of self harm ",False,False

I also do this vicious cycle thing where I'm scared that I'm inadvertently triggering other people, and that therefore it would only be fitting and just for me to waste away and die. Ana tells me I'm unlovable and that she's the only girl who'll ever stay with me. And on bad days it feels like yeah, maybe she's the only girl I deserve to be with.   But then I think that maybe it would be even more fitting and just for me to just binge/restrict forever until my body and mind are destroyed and I end up falling hardcore into BED until I'm too huge to walk and die that way.

Some of it is definitely related to my bipolar disorder. I get sad and angry and embarrassed about being depressed for ""no reason"", so I punish myself for it.
