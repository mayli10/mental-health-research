I got used to it and I really missed the productivity it gave me. Strengthend my suspicion that I have undiagnosed ADD.       Worst thing it did was make me look like a caffein junkie to my classmates because I'd chug that shit mid-lecture and be like ""Yeah I *really* needed a caffein pill just now!""     My sleep was shit. Like 4 hours of sleep, then waking up at 2am but unable to sleep until 10pm again yet never really energized.    It's really not that dangerous if you ask me. It's been studied thoroughly in humans as a weight loss drug.  As usual, the best precaution is to not be fucking stupid.    Don't think it makes hunger disappear. I did at first and I upped the dose more and more because I still kept getting hungry. Later I discovered that it just makes it easier to forget about food and busy yourself with something else. But if you sit around all day waiting for the next meal it won't do anything!   Anyways, I'm down to like two pills and don't intend to order more; these will be saved for exams at the end of the month.",False,False

It contains ephedrine. You usually go to the aisle and pick up the plastic card (since it can’t be on the shelves), bring it to the pharmacist, and they will get it off the shelf for you. I don’t wanna encourage it though, it can be really unsafe if used too often.",False,False
