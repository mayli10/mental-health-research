Was just very rapid weight loss and/or low nutrition and extremely long fasting periods. Got it back when I stopped the fasting and not because I gained weight!,False,False

Starving and low fat you'd lose a lot sooner and at a higher BMI. Whereas slow weight loss with appropriate calories but for an extended period of time you're less likely to lose. So like a high fat and high restricting type thing! Read that somewhere so don't quote me. :),False,False

Never took BC either. I was torn between feeling smug for somehow “outsmarting” both my own body and my treatment team, and feeling like a failure or a fraud because if I was “really” anorexic I shouldn’t still have my period.  I don’t really have an answer as to why I (or you) never stopped menstruating. My theory for myself is that I made the most of the calories I did consume— lean protein, vegetables, whole grains, fortified cereals, nonfat dairy products, plus a daily multivitamin. So while I definitely wasn’t eating enough, I was still relatively well nourished. I don’t know for a fact that that’s the reason, but it’s my best guess.",False,False
