Initially you'll still want the bad habits even when equipped with the good, but the more you utilise what you learn, the more you can step away from using food to cope. And that doesn't mean you won't ever go back to that way of coping, which can put people off even bothering. But you can learn to recognise the warning signs, like you have done now, and chose to take back your life once more.  It's not an easy decision to make, it would be hypocritical of me to say otherwise. But even just talking it out with a professional can help you see things from an objective viewpoint. My counsellor doesn't tell me what to do, doesn't make me feel bad for coping through food, she just helps me to take a look at things from an angle not shrouded in negativity. Reaching out for help doesn't mean you're committed to changing for the better, but it's that curiosity of how things could be that keeps us fighting, no matter how small the steps.",False,False

Tbh, I've  been avoiding treatment for almost a year now which I know isn't good. I'm in such a stuck place and this has been a crutch. I know it has the potential to go bad really fast but it helps me cope. It just feels like I'm achieving something. Its  just do hard because I have literally nothing else to cling to at this point in time.",False,True

People fall into EDs through dieting because of the way people around praise them. The feeling as a result of that feedback becomes addicting, and before you know it, you've fallen into ED territory striving to keep losing so you keep getting praised. You'll feel like you're in control at first, but it will always end up controlling you. Unless of course you get help now to stop it from getting that far.  You might see the issue as trivial, that it's not a big problem that needs addressing, but that's exactly why you should. You wouldn't leave an infected cut because ""it's not that bad"" until you develop more life threatening conditions. The same goes for this. Take the fear you feel and let it push you away from this disease and into treatment.",False,False
