Once someone knows, that's it. They'll watch you and anything you do now is ""because you have an ED"".  And absolutely on leaving. My best friend of over 10 years told me that if ""it ever got bad"" she would leave. You wouldn't have even known anything was bad if I didn't tell you! I'm opening up that I might have a problem (which is already incredibly hard to do cause a lot of the time I just think I have weird eating habits) and you just... leave?  But then comes that can of worms: you can't expect them to stay while you kill yourself. You want them to know. But you don't want them to worry.  What do you want from this? Help? Support? If you're not ready to recover... I'm sorry to say, but you probably shouldn't say anything. But maybe that's just me. I told my best friend in a moment of extreme weakness on my part. And I wish I never had.",False,False

So w my experience my friends knew very much about my ed and when it got rly bad they didn’t want to be apart of my life anymore bc they said it hurt them too much watching me slowly die and were tired of me not listening to them. But that’s just my experience. It depends if what you said was true that you love her so much that you would rly consider recovering. If so, maybe this will be a great thing and she would help and support you.",False,False
