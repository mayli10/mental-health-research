The thyroid is very treatable, yes, but you still need all the nutrition you can get to help fight it off and heal yourself. If you are to gain any weight at all from your hormones being out of balance, that is something that will quickly restore itself once you are better. Being thin is the least of your problems right now.   There is no need to feel guilt over any of this. You did not wish yourself into getting cancer.  I really do hope all the best for you!
