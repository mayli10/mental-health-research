I'm so proud of you for trying to recover. This is hard as hell I know. But always remember that weight does not say anything about whether you deserve recovery or not. Because you do, you're human and you deserve to be happy and confident and feel loved - especially by yourself. I'm gonna say it again, I'm super proud of you for not counting calories and not stepping on the scale. Keep up the good work, one day at a time. I believe in you. ❤️",False,False
