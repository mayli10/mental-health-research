You deserve to be happy. You deserve to be healthy. You deserve recovery. I promise, it's never too late to start working towards it!   Recovery is hard work. It's so hard. I have been in recovery and relapsed multiple times. But just because it is scary or daunting doesn't mean it isn't worth it!  Stay safe. ❤️❤️❤️",False,False

I hope it gets better soon. I was feeling like that a few weeks ago. Racing heart and dizzy and tunnel vision I figured out it was a combination of anxiety and not eating haha, which was probably causing the anxiety. It was a hard few days. I really hope you know that we all care and want you to get better. I'm glad your here and able to talk about this. ❤️",False,False
