It's like it created a rift in my routine. I spent all day watching recovery content and feeling ok. Came home and was gonna treat myself to a microwaved Quest bar and hot chocolate. Was mixing up the hot chocolate when I realized that I ran out of Quest bars and my comfy plan was ruined. Ugh. Somewhat minor but still distressing binge ensues. I've now spent all night meal prepping and plotting to restrict much lower than usual for the next little while because I'm so lost and out of control lately. Unstable times. ,False,False
