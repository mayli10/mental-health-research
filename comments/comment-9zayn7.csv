Eat something small for lunch and have one normal sized plate for dinner, drink lots of water, don't calorie count. Stop before full to avoid discomfort and purging thoughts. It's better to eat at TDEE than to over restrict, binge and then retrigger my bulimia....  Check in with boyfriend for reassurance (he knows about my relapse) and try not to embarrass myself with his family. ",False,False

It’s so hard to pin down recovery because it’s so non linear and EDs never quite go away...it’s hard to know where you’re at and what’s real, and the mirror still constantly lies to you. i still exercise a lot, and I still feel like I’m gaining all the time.  I still don’t like eating pasta or French fries. The only thing that’s gotten me through it is to be really logical with myself and only act on rational things, but I wish that I didn’t have to spend so much time talking myself into self care.",False,False

Even though I've been more or less physically recovered for over a month now with normal hunger signaling, I still struggle on those days where my body is desperately asking for calories. I'm getting a lot better about listening and giving it what it wants, but when I wake up the next morning and still feel hungry, I'm like, WTF is wrong with me? And I just want to restrict so badly. At the same time I know it's telling me it's hungry for a reason. I need to get it into my head that it's going to use the calories to make me stronger/healthier, not fatter. Sure when you first recover, you put on a bunch of fat in your abdomen and that sucks, but that's temporary... I'm well past that at this point so I need to just have at it today and try not to feel guilty.  Restriction gets so gray. I don't know a single ED-recovered person that totally ceases all ED behavior. I don't think I ever will. I still obsessively eat high fiber high protein foods because they are satiating. Today on Thanksgiving my tendency is going to be to eat lots of turkey and veggies and avoid all of the fat-laden side dishes (even though they are delicious and I want to eat them) because I know how metabolism works and how your body can't store excess protein as fat. I'm going to delay eating carbs today until Thanksgiving dinner... I've been doing spinning past few days and going hard in the gym and keeping my diet low carb to deplete my glycogen reserves and take advantage of glycogen hypercompensation. These are actually legitimate strategies ""normal"" athletes and normal fitness community people use. But I'm not a competitive athlete. I'm just a stupid guy that fears fat more than death. It's crazy how intellectual our battles with ourselves can get, almost like a chess match at times.  The reality is that even without doing anything but my normal routine, there is nothing I can do in a single day to significantly change my body composition. My body composition is dictated by genetics and my dietary and athletic habits, period. It is insanity understanding this, but feeling powerless to stop the fears, and the disordered behaviors.",False,False
