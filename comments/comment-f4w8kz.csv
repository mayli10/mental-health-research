If you ate at maintenance but avoided many foods that require certain enzymes for the digestion process and then stopped avoiding those foods, you could still undergo refeeding because your body needs to readjust to getting those enzymes working on breaking down your food.  You're probably going to have the same symptoms again, yea. The only way really to avoid that is to have a continued normalized eating pattern.",False,False

I guess because I’m still overweight and did eat something most days, even if not very much, I don’t let myself believe it can be anything to do with refeeding. It feels like an overreaction.   If I restrict Monday - Friday this week and then start eating pretty normally again, am I going to have the same symptoms next week? (I think I know the answer, I guess don’t want to believe it.)",False,True

Thanks.  (I know climbing Kili sounds like a terrible idea given my current situation - hence me trying to work on it now!),False,True

It may help your head feel better some, I wouldn't drink a whole lot at once but maybe try a little bit and sip to help get some in. Electrolyte imbalance is scary  I don't have much personal experience with heavy restriction but it does sound like your body is trying to adjust. If you feel like your symptoms are getting worse please do go see about getting some medical advice.",False,False

It's pretty normal in refeeding. If it starts to get to where you think you might pass out please see a doctor. Try to work in some complex carbs to help make sure your blood sugar isn't rising or dropping drastically, and make sure you stay hydrated, and see if that helps.",False,False
