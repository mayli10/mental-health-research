I had horrible problems with calorie counting from it and now am really trying to break that, but it's become so automatic that I haven't needed to use the app for several years.",False,False

I downloaded it last year even though I didnâ€™t need to lose any weight but wanted to get back to my weight when I started college (102). Got annoyed when it meant I couldnâ€™t eat any of my favorite things and it was taking too long. I stopped using the app.   Fast forward to this year and some personal shit happens so I decided to put all my effort in loosing weight and starting using mfp again. I use it every day and I can mentally log foods now.,False,False

After i lost some initial weight i was also eating like 600 calories but then i gained all the weight back AND MORE!! I ended up being 160 and iâ€™m also 5â€™7. When i tried to lose the weight again, i deleted the app but because i knew the calories to everything before i would just secretly mentally log my foods and still restricted to about 900 calories!!! I lost 30 pounds. However i started binging AGAIN. i downloaded MFP and now iâ€™m macro counting and calorie counting! So far iâ€™ve binged less i donâ€™t think itâ€™s MFP I think its that we are afraid to eat more because we donâ€™t think weâ€™ll make progress at 1500 calories but we totally will! just a slowe and more sustainable pace! this time iâ€™m determined to keep the weight off!",False,False

I'm (yet again) trying recovery while also losing weight and added MFP back in a few months ago and really have to be very intentional and conscious of the habits and decisions I make. I've taken the week off from MFP because I feel really easily triggered right now and will add it back in once I feel like i can actually make good choices.,False,False

It led me to restrict low, the estimation on when you'll be at your ugw when you keep up the restricrion was so motivating! But all that led me to binge eating and eventually bulimia. Not worth it.  I hope we'll be able to live without these kind of apps one day ðŸ’•",False,False

Now, even though I'm not using it, I know the calories in so much shit without looking it up. I never eat salad dressing (only lemon juice and black pepper) because it's such a bitch to estimate. It's really impacted how I approach food.",False,False
