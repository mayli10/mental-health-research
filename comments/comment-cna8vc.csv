Prior to having arm lipo a few years ago, I didn‚Äôt know that shapewear for arms existed, but after my surgery, I had to wear a compression garment (basically like Spanx for arms, lol) and it really helped with the swelling and made them look slimmer while they healed. I‚Äôve obsessed about my arms for my entire life and I wish I‚Äôd known about shapewear when I was younger because it would‚Äôve saved me a lot of anguish.    Also, I wear waist trainers when I want my waist/blocky rib cage to look smaller and I even bought a pair of butt-lifting compression shorts so that I can finally work up the confidence to wear jeans without fear of my ass looking wide but flat (I haven‚Äôt worn jeans in public in well over a decade and I wouldn‚Äôt even consider it without ‚Äúhelp‚Äù).",False,False

Although I can tell the difference no one else ever can.   The thing I do get is super fat arms! Like I am pretty sure they are the size of thighs...

I can't hide them under skirts or even sleaves. They are always in pictures, they are so terrible from the back! ...

I remember crying in my mom's arms about how I'll always be ugly because of my double chin.
