The best thing you can do is be extremely neutral about her body. My friend's boyfriend told her that she was looking ""thicc"" and had a nice ass the other day, and she took it as being fat. My ex boyfriend used to say similar things as a compliment, and it just echoes in my mind as ""fat.""   Whatever you say, her ED will twist what you say to mean ""fat,"" because it's screaming that at her 24/7 and your voice will just become a projection for the one she hears in her own head. Even if you comment about how she's looking slim, she'll take note and think, ""If I gain weight then he won't want me anymore because he only likes me when I'm slim.""  My point is that the best way for you to help her is by keeping your meals as regular as possible. She's likely experiencing something that's on  the brink of a relapse, so making sure that you support her at mealtimes might be helpful. For me, it was helpful for my ex boyfriend and I to sit down and have the same meal, but be mindful of your portion size because she might be watching to see if you eat more than her so she can for sure be eating less.   At the end of the day, the best thing my ex boyfriend ever told me about my body was that it was the vessel for my soul, and that's the part of me that he loved. Making me feel like my body wasn't even a part of our relationship really helped me with my mindset. And not centering every date around eating, because it was stressful for me.   Hope this helps you!",False,False
