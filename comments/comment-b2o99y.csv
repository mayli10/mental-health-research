I think it's flexibility and moderation around food. It's eating healthy and exercising for the sake of being healthy and feeling your best, not to be skinny. It's eating healthy, well-portioned meals that you actually enjoy; cooking, trying out new things and eating a variety of food groups instead of limiting yourself to ""safe foods"". Same with exercising. Exercising should be doing activities that make you happy and feel good instead of, like, slaving away at the gym for hours just to burn calories. I think normal eating is listening to your body. So, eating when you feel hungry and stopping when you're full. It's being able to be flexible. So for example, if someone at work brings in donuts, you should be able to have one if you want and not have it be a 20 minute internal debate. And then you don't feel guilty after, or let that unplanned food trigger bingeing or purging behaviors. There's no rigidity around food and no arbitrary rules. So if you want a snack, you don't think about it. No internal debate, no rearranging all other meals to account for it. You just eat it and move on. A healthy mindset is not obsessing over and thinking about food all the time. Food is not the center of your world. It's neither Christ nor the Antichrist. It's just...food. I even think healthy eating can be overeating at times. Not a binge. But for example, maybe having drinks and pizza with friends and eating a bit too much. Or coming away from a holiday dinner feeling very full. I feel like that's okay when you're in a healthy mindset because you realize it's not the end of the world and sometimes we have fun, treat ourselves and eat a little much. That's ok. As long as it's not an every-day occurrence or something you're doing in secrecy or shame. Because I don't think a healthy mindset is giving into your every desire and craving all the time either. I tended to do this when I thought I was recovering, but really I was just bingeing. A healthy mindset is knowing that it's okay to have ice cream and pizza, but not letting yourself ONLY eat those things. It's moderation between treating yourself and knowing that's okay, but also nourishing yourself and making sure you're getting the nutrients you need.  I think it's also having a more harmonious relationship with your body, even if you don't love it all the time. Especially for someone recovering from an ED, it's finding ways to cope with dysmorphia and perceived flaws in a healthy way and not getting hung up on weight or a bad body image day. Because I don't think those negative voices necessarily go away 100%. EDs are diseases and there's no magic cure. So recovery is finding a way to deal with them and not let them control you when they sneak into your mind. I'm told by people in long-term recovery that eventually the negative voices get quieter and quieter. And if they do rear their ugly heads, you have the tools to deal with them. I think the end goal is to genuinely love your body, though I feel like it takes time and work. So I think the first step is just accepting who you are and taking it one day at a time. ",False,False

You wake up, go to the kitchen and heat up some milk (a whole mug of it). You sit down and pour your granola while watching YouTube or something. The food is enjoyable but it sort of feels like background noise, you're not hyper-focused on it. You finish in 10 minutes tops. If you want more cereal, you pour in more cereal. You go to school and food doesn't cross your mind until lunch time and only because you smell the food your mom is making. You have lunch with your family and talk to them, the food on your plate being nothing more than background noise. You move to the couch to watch TV with a cup of ice cream. Again, the ice cream is nice but it doesn't even cross your mind to think about portion sizes or sugar content. Once you're done, you feel satisfied but not unconforfable  Next you go do your homework. You start feeling hungry mid afternoon and you go the fridge and grab anything that looks good (most likely avo toast because #basic) and then just keep going. Maybe you get hungry again so you just... Eat again. After you're done, you go for a run because it's enjoyable and it helps you clear your mind after working for so long. It's relaxing, you don't think about how many calories you're burning, you don't think about how it'll change your body. You stop when you begin to feel tired. You dedicate some time to something that's enjoyable to you (reading, writing...) and is completely unrelated to food. After a while, you start feeling hungry so you make dinner, probably something out of the freezer because you're tired. Most likely spring rolls or pizza. While it's heating up, you snack on whatever is lying around (tortilla chips, hummus...) without even thinking about it. You eat until you're full and then just sit on the couch and enjoy some trashy TV program. Day to day, food is not this super exciting thing, but something necessary that sometimes tastes specially good. You're not interested in supermatkets or cooking and your brain doesn't go ""OMG"" when you pass by a bakery. You have no interest whatsoever in ""What I Eat In A Day""s and mukbangs and wonder why anyone would be so interested in food. Sorry, I probably went a little overboard but I was aiming for ""descriptiveness"" lmao. Hope this helps!",False,False
