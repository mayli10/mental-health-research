I know there will be the occasional outing where I’ll end up eating more calories than what I do regularly, but I feel like all of the stuff I planned will help me damage control some of those things.  You should definitely allow yourself to eat some of the good old home food, especially if you won’t have the opportunity again for awhile. That’s what vacations are for! When it comes to being stuck in a binge cycle, you just really have to figure out how to pull yourself out of it. I’ve definitely had some bad, BAD binge days, but at a certain point I just ask myself what it is that I want. I feel like sometimes I try to minimize the damage of my binges by saying, “Okay, well I want this thing, but THIS thing will be less calories so I’ll do that instead” and then I end up eating more calories than I would have anyway because that thing didn’t satisfy me and I keep going. So now when I get binge urges that won’t go away, I ask myself what I really want, and go ahead and go for it whether it’s a giant piece of cake, a full fat pint of ice cream, or a whole goddamn pizza. And then let myself reset the next day. That may or may not work for you depending on what’s driving your binge, but maybe just pause for a second and think about what the driving factor is behind it. If it’s just your bodies hunger cues from restriction, then maybe work on eating more, and more regularly, for the time being until they subside. Just some ideas. I hope you enjoy the time with your family and the food is the least significant aspect of your trip! :]",False,False
