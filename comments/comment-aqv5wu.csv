I think you get health problems faster at a lower BMI than at a higher one, because it has more immediate consequences for your organs whereas health problems for being overweight/low end of obese can take a good decade to kick in so yeah underweight are definitely at more risk of dying due to their weight.    It’s not my thing either, so I just don’t look for it, lol. It’s so gross to make fun of it, encourage other people to make fun of it and share it around. I doubt someone with that kind of mindset respects any kind of woman, healthy weight or not. I think it’s a thinly veiled way to let out his misogyny in a way that’s more “acceptable”.    Yeah, not everyone needs to fit his ideal. He’s just too egotistical to think about that.  ",False,False

Ffs. WE ARE ALL DYING, OKAY.  But christ, are the chronically/dangerously underweight in more danger of dying?  But I agree with you. It's not my thing but the girl is seemingly enjoying herself and people are enjoying it. So how about they get left alone to enjoy their consentual, mutual fun. It's more gross to make fun of her than what she is doing. You think it's gross? Then don't watch it. It's very simple.  You don't want to be overweight? Cool. Then work on it. But accept the fact that some people are overweight and okay with it. They are still people, they still deserve happiness and respect. If it bothers them so much, then they just need not associate with those people. ",False,False

It was fat fetish porn and he said such horrible things about this woman who was just doing her job for her audience. Sure it isn’t for everyone but what’s your deal if YOU’RE searching for it? Normal people don’t look up fetishes that they don’t enjoy in order to “make fun” of them/in order to encourage weight loss.  I reported it and the mods didn’t do shit. In what fucking world is it appropriate to post PORN on any kind of weight loss sub? Especially if it’s with the intention to shame the sex worker.  It honestly makes me so angry and disgusted at the sub.   ffs automod keeps removing my NP link so you can see in my profile the comment in the fasting sub,False,False

I do 18/6 or 20/4, sometimes 24 but i have a demanding schedule so i don’t usually do more than that. Not gonna get into cal count to avoid triggering anyone, but it’s definitely restriction and I’m still losing weight just because, well, physics? ",False,False
