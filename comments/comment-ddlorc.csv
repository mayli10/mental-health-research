It's not that strong in my experience especially if you only take 2 like it says. I promise you laxatives don't just make people shit themselves the first time they use them AS DIRECTED. No one but ED ppl would buy them otherwise lol. They're a safe medication.          If you still don't wanna, grab some fiber supplements. Powder, pill, gummies, brownies...doesn't matter. Just take some fiber. They're not laxatives but they help move stuff along. Worst case scenario you'll get kinda farty but you can hold it, it's not like crazy gas.",False,False

It's the weekend- most colleges I know don't have class on the weekend. Also, if you take a gentle lax, can you not just excuse yourself from the classroom if you need to go?  I'd try black coffee if you don't want to do lax, but personally lax may be the way to go.",False,False
