I worked in restaurants for almost ten years and now I manage a farmers market so most of my safe meals are a locally grown rainbow on top of some oatmeal.   My friend that did the granola just gave me some beetroot and apple and it’s the prettiest color. And delicious like holy shit. Her granola is the one of my typical scary foods, but I’ve never binged on it. Just a small amount on my breakfast every day. I figure if I’m eating for keeps its going to be pretty and delicious.",False,True
