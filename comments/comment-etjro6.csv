I‚Äôve struggled with BED for years and I‚Äôve always felt that I‚Äôd rather deal with Ana since then I‚Äôd at least be skinny and disordered. I feel the exact same way about wanting to relate posts too. Of course, I‚Äôve always felt that I‚Äôd rather have no ED, especially since I know the dangerous of Ana from my family who have a history with it, but I still would‚Äôve rather had it than BED.  Now though, I‚Äôve gone the other way and actually developed Ana, which as a byproduct has mostly beaten my BED. To be honest I‚Äôm much happier now in some ways but I hate myself a lot more in others and my physical health is worse. I‚Äôd still rather just be normal, but if it was down to a choice between BED or Ana I‚Äôd definitely pick the latter still.  Of course though, don‚Äôt try and develop Ana or Mia or anything, just work on beating your BED and being ‚Äùnormal‚Äù. I know how that feels and it is better than the alternatives.",False,False

I always tell myself: tomorrow will be better, tomorrow you won't binge on everything in the house. And then I fail again and hate myself, but apparently not enough to starve myself.

When I hit my highest weight after bingeing for a whole summer, I was nearly obese (like 5 pounds away from an obese BMI), and the worst part was that hardly anyone said anything or asked me if I was okay. If I had dropped 25 pounds over a summer, I feel like people would have said something (although I wouldn‚Äôt have been underweight if I had lost that much). But because it‚Äôs socially unacceptable to comment on people‚Äôs weight gain, no one said anything until after I had lost the weight. And even then, they chalked it up to stress because I was in university at the time.  At the time, I desperately wanted someone to ask if I was okay, because I was terrified to say anything to anyone.   Do you have access to counselling and/or medication? I ended up going to day-patient treatment, which helped with the emotional side of things, and then taking a couple of medications have helped me. I do still binge some times, so it‚Äôs not a miracle cure, but if you are able to access some type of support, it might be helpful. Feel free to PM me if you need someone to talk to, I honestly feel like BED is on par with a drug addiction, and is seriously hard to overcome.",False,False
