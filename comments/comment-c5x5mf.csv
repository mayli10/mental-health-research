They do say the camera adds 10 pounds lol, especially with the face since it's a flat image vs. the contour and 3D image people who look at you IRL will actually see. Also, focal length of a camera can change how your face looks in a pic: see [http://www.danvojtech.cz/blog/2016/07/amazing-how-focal-length-affect-shape-of-the-face/](http://www.danvojtech.cz/blog/2016/07/amazing-how-focal-length-affect-shape-of-the-face/)  &amp;#x200B;  His face looks widest with the 200 mm lens while the most ""accurate"" is around 70-100 mm. More amazing is how much puffier his hair becomes. Taking a photo from a distance (which the 200 mm lens does, in a way) flattens you out and makes you look heavier. You may have people in your life who'll brush you off with a ""what? You look the same in real life as you do in the picture"" (which may be an ouch) but personally, I've seen a LOT of photos where the person looks completely different, possibly less flattering, than they do IRL. My boyfriend also has a rounder face in photos, and it's a very obvious difference to me. Sometimes photos just capture you with a less-than-ideal expression or angle that makes you look super puffy (also, your cheeks will naturally look rounder when you smile), but you likely don't look as horrendous as that picture made you out to be",False,False
