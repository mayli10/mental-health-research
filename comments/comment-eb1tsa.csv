It doesn't have quite the same taste or texture as regular. I don't eat it by itself or as a straight up replacement, but I've used it as a substitute in some recipes w/ cream cheese that use several other ingredients. If you're looking for a straight up replacement the whipped cream cheese or reduced fat taste pretty comparable for lower cal.",False,False

Comparing the ingredient lists would probably be highly amusing. I’m not sure the biggest name-brand here (Philadelphia) even *makes* a fat-free version.  I have tried the reduced-fat version and it’s pretty ok. I like the whipped versions too.,False,False

Maybe it's one of those weird things that turns out to be good even though it shouldn't. Super curious what they're using in place of fat. I associate cream cheese with sweet stuff so maybe if they added sugar it would still be tasty.  It's *cheese* though. If cheese is already a nightmare I'm not gonna punish myself by removing the part of cheese that makes it taste good. But I'm the type that would rather eat a fork full of something tasty instead of a filling plate of cardboard.  My comment is not helpful I'm just bored and lonely today lol,False,False
