I just like to because then it's kind of like I know what is being fed into my brain haha but they seem to work with or without reading them!,False,False

Like I listened to subliminals a few times but not because I thought the frequency would make my body burn more calories, but because it really was motivation.  The dainty sounding music made me feel and want to look dainty so I just started eating less.  I also find that the fact that some listeners believe others can put ""bad messages or affirmations""and have an affect on our subconscious.  Like no.... that's not how it works.  It really is just some notes and frequencies like any other audio, it's up to you to put a meaning to that.  Anything can be a subliminal.  Like the freaking cars driving outside can be subliminal for me, I just have to listen to then with the intent to motivate myself to eat less.",False,False

Thank you for the good explanations, well appreciated. Last question: do you need to read the affirmations during the vid or before, or not? Looks like a powerful tool. I will begin softly",False,True
fbsa1p3,t3_eeaq1m,t1_fbs7pvn,mochalatte101,2,2019-12-22 16:05:20,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/eeaq1m/subliminals/fbsa1p3/,"Yes. Personally, it took about a month of consistent listening while sleeping to notice. His videos all have the affirmations listed in the description too so it helps to read that too. I started noticing that I had an easier time making healthier food choices and was able to follow my hunger cues better too (bc overeating is my favorite thing to do lol). It just helps change your thought process! An example of how our subconscious works is like this: we think, ""i want to eat healthy!"" but we still choose to eat something unhealthy. While we're consciously trying to make the effort to eat healthy, our subconscious takes over and we make decisions where we may feel like we're not in control or something (idk if thats just me). Another example would be overeating. It's like SOMETHING in our subconscious mind is engrained that leads us to poor eating decisions. Sorry this is such a rant lol long story short i've had a positive experience with subliminals and you should ALWAYS make sure you know what affirmations are being used in a subliminal video!! Because sometimes people will put in negative phrases that really can make its way in our subconscious and we wouldn't even know it.",False,False

His Youtube channel has a lot of subscribers and he has a wide range of different kinds of videos (rain sounds, nature sounds, classical music, binaural beats, spoken word). You should check him out, he has a few videos for weight loss! I hope this helps ðŸ˜Š",False,False
