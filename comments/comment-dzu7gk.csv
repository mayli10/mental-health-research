There are a lot of people on here who have really low goals and sometimes it can feel like you're not as sick or something, but I promise, you are just as valid. I'm underweight too and I restrict so high lately that I doubt most people would even consider it restriction. You are valid. I'm so sorry you're feeling this way though.",False,False

I eat breakfast and I swear by it for weight loss I’m also an athlete and was lifting for years before I was diagnosed I have body builder friends who taught me the ins and outs of it all! The thing about body builder friends and they don’t understand your sick.  I usually make a smoothie for lunch and eat a protein bar for a snack but I also am trying really hard to eat more for running:) but breakfast dude I usually will make anything healthy like avo toast with an egg or an egg white omelette with veggies and then I have less brain fog during the day,False,False
