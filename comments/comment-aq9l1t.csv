A ton of water before and after helps me feel full too. And I rinse my mouth out with water between bites. Plus seeing it all in the ziplock bag afterwards and mushing it around, knowing that would have been in my stomach and looking at how gross it is really helps me.",False,False

Especially if it‚Äôs not carb or sugar food that dissolves in mouth and I‚Äôm like cool that‚Äôs the only thing I do ,False,False

I would get really bad acid reflux after. I think my stomach was preparing/hoping for food and would start churning in anticipation, then get pissed off at me when I'd spit everything out. I also grind my teeth at night, so my jaw pops on the regular, but it got 10x worse when I'd C/S. I guess it helped control cravings, but the issues with my stomach and my jaw didn't justify the satiated cravings. I feel like it can't be great for your teeth either. Please be careful! It's just one more destructive behavior to deal with, and it's not great for your budget either. I always felt really guilty about spending money on food I wasn't even really eating. It was just an all around yucky, nasty experience. 0/10 do not recommend. ",False,False

Regardless, I think it‚Äôs really bad for you. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm a chronic c/s‚Äôer, and have been doing it for years, but I‚Äôve been trying to decrease my frequency, amounts, etc. but it‚Äôs really hard. It turns into a rather addictive habit, but if it‚Äôs the ‚Äòlesser of two evils‚Äô I guess, then it‚Äôs ‚Äúbetter,‚Äù if that makes sense.  Anyways, c/s has severely fucked up my stomach so ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è and I do find it harder to lose weight on it, like I retain a lot of water and really only lose weight through fasting. It could be insulin related, but I‚Äôm not sure. My body is so fucked up at this point, so who really knows. ",False,False

If I'm just c/s then I'm extra careful to spit everything out &amp; rinse my mouth in between, but sometimes when I'm too full binging but still have food left then I c/s the remaining and don't really care if I swallow wee bits coz I'm gonna purge anyway What I will say is that I went through a period of lots of chewing &amp; spitting and continued losing weight, so personally I'd say the calories are negligible, but I can't confirm",False,False
