All of that happened over the span of months. If you try and get to 20 hours within a week then you're bound to fail.  The only two things that are making this work for me are keto and lots and lots of distractions. Without keto my blood sugar would still be all over the place and thus I'd be hungry much more often. Then I just need to stay out of the kitchen for the rest of the day.  There's also something else I've been doing for a couple of months now, which has helped me a lot: getting rid of a lot the things that I used to binge on, or just managing to not put them on the shopping list again. Now everything I eat makes it so that once I reach my daily calories I seriously cannot eat much more than that because I'm basically filled up.   I'm not trying to persuade you into changing your diet, but sticking with the three basics of /r/zerocarb - which are meat, water, and salt - has more than helped me fight my hunger. After all, that was the main problem I was facing with IF.  Also, remember to drink lots of water. As sort of a coping mechanism I still drink a 1L bottle of water whenever I'm hungry (a glass just isn't enough) in hopes of it going away.",False,True
