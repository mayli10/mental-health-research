My motivation is not consistent, at all. Some days all I want to do is go back to restricting. But on the days I have no motivation, I try to be disciplined. If I have enough self control and self discipline to have an ED I have it in me to recover. My mind is so strong and powerful. I just try to use it for good, not evil.     I have a list of pros and cons of continuing recovery, both in the short and long run. If I'm having a hard time eating a meal or snack or feel like I can't bear the thought of returning to treatment, I look to that list and use that to help me make my decision. I stick to the RAVES model of recovery, which is where you focus on Regularity and Adequacy of food first. You can google it to see the rest of the strategy, but those two have been so important. Eating regular meals and snacks has nearly become a habit. It feels wrong now NOT to eat, which is obviously so hard to accept, but that's just where I am.  The habit of eating has helped me.     You won't want recovery every day. Just like there is a part of you that doesn't want to have an eating disorder forever. You have to try and grow the part of you that wants recovery. Who do you want to be? What is your identity without it? Answering those questions, while terrifying to me, have also been crucial to my recovery.  &amp;#x200B;  TL;DR Motivation gets you started. Discipline keeps you going. Don't give up!",False,False
