I like to believe it’s the LW but the ED brain likes to tell me it’s the highest number that’s real.",False,False

I’ve had similar experiences where I felt like I ate too much, weighed myself the next day with full intent of triggering myself so I get back on track only to see a new LW. Then I get excited and restrict very well that day only to weigh 6 pounds more the next day. Weird how our bodies work so hard to make sure we are as confused as possible at all times.   (Yeah I know about water weight, seeing big fluctuations still sucks though)",False,False
