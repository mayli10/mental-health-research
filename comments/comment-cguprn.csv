I'm here to learn myself.  Do not make it your concern. What I mean by that, is that when you know something is wrong, and you have the ability to help, you tend to OVER help someone. You make it your main concern, because you want the best for that person. When you do this you constantly walk on eggshells and pry at the person's life. The person you are with begins to resent the nightly ""what did you have for dinner?"" Question. Even if it's innocent, it becomes an annoyance.  Keep active. This is important. When you are done eating, go do something. Walk around the neighborhood, go to the store, hell even get up and dance. But keep moving after you eat. This does two things, stops that OMFG I'm full and fat feeling, and helps burn calories and stimulates metabolism and digestion.  Most important, be there for her. Notice the signs of when she is stressed, try and not push things when she's in that state. Now, let me stress, this does NOT mean turn into a pushover and let her walk all over you. Some people will use their illnesses as emotional leverage to manipulate people. You need to be aware of this, because hypochondriacs can be soul sucking. They will force you to submit to their life style, and use the guilt of their illness to do so. This doesn't sound like your case, but you need to be aware of this as well, and anyone else in our situation.",False,False

That's really helpful advice thank you!  Most things we do aren't food related, we have gone to restaurants or gotten a bite to eat along the way which thankfully has never caused an issue so far. I try to make sure that food isn't the main activity.   I'm also aware that there is no 'one-size-fits-all' kind of thing here, but any general tips that I can have in my back pocket that can be adapted to her needs at the time would be a great asset for me. Thanks so much!",False,True

Secondly, in my humble opinion and experience (and I'm sure a lot of people are gonna disagree with me on this), I think everything depends on whether or not she wants to keep pushing her recovery forward. If she does, you have to be there for her and help her do that. Talk about *how* she would feel if she ate something out of her comfort zone, *what* she would feel if. However, if she does not want to move forward in her recovery, you have to respect that...  Also, do things that are not food-related: watching movies, going to museums, taking walks, listening to music, whatever you guys please.  Keep in mind that everybody's recovery is different, so most of what you can do to support her depends on whether she wants to be helped.",False,False

Be neutral about food in general and don't make a big deal about it.  Eating disorders are an endless looping obsession with food, and it becomes an even bigger deal when other people are focused on what you eat.  Let food be as much a normal background activity as possible.",False,False
