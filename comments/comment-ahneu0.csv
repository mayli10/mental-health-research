Sometimes it makes me see my goals and want to be strict, and other times it brings me back to reality because I see someone who is goals and is a higher BMI than me.",False,False

But in thinspo online it's so hard to gauge someone's height. I'll mourn not having that 22 inch waist I see on tumblr while forgetting that they probably got short legs.",False,False

I'm constantly comparing myself to others but it's all so messed up I can't tell if I'm even close to looking like these thin girls. At least with photos it can all be down to angles and lighting and posing but you can't argue the same for true life. :(,False,False

Like, I feel like if he were to fall down the stairs, and landed on his back, he'd be done for.  He wouldn't have 2 pillars of fat on his upper back like I do to cover his fall.  And just when I was admiring how my forearms slimmed down, his look slim from all angles, and have no chub to squeeze on there!  I know that boys have less fat than girls, so I shouldn't even be comparing myself to him, but it's so triggering sometimes!",False,False
