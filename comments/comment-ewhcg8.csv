I 100% recommend you write it down before you sober up. Sober you needs to read that and it’ll be so much more meaningful than hearing other people call you skinny.

I’m happy it helped you to see past your perceived imperfections! I had a love hate relationship with weed. Sometimes I’d get high and I’d be FEELING myself like damn I have some great hair and I’m hot and I’m killing it. And sometimes I’d look in the mirror when I was stoned and think that I literally look like a monster and don’t understand how people could stand to look at me. It really do be like that sometimes.,False,False

I always found myself so much more beautiful and was so much more accepting of myself when i was stoned. I’m sober now and it’s probably the only thing i miss.,False,False
