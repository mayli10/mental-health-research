I'm always thinking ""Well I should really get my calories in today since I have to be capable to pay attention to class and do my assignments today. I'll just fast all weekend!"" And then the weekend comes and I'm like ""Its the weekend, I should enjoy it by eating. I'll watch my calories when I'm at school."" Lmao it's never ending. Kill me. ",False,False

I think it's because I know once I am heavy restricting/fasting I won't have the physical or mental energy to complete all my tasks. I've been in beast mode this week cleaning and getting rid of old junk so that I can have a clean worry-free space to restrict in. I meal prep too so that I know what I'm having and how much with nooo distractions :) I only want one thing on the mind haha!,False,False

This is my #1 issue when it comes to losing weight. I'm a serial procrastinator, I know exactly how long it will take to lose the weight if I do it in multiple ways, high restriction or low restriction, fasting or not etc. My one and only problem is procrastinating with starting but I'm still obsessed with losing the weight.  &gt;Doesn't help that I pretty mucxh work on an ""all or nothing"" basis so if anything fucks up my plans I just can't stop myself from ruining it even further until I'm crying myself to sleep over it.  I relate to this so much, I'll lick a spoon and give up for the day. Half a slice of bacon means I can start tomorrow. Is it Tuesday, that's a weird day to start on let's wait until Friday. I'm working Friday and Saturday let's start with the week on Sunday. Hmm, maybe Monday with school? Over and over it goes, driving me mad because I hate my body and loathe myself for not doing anything about it.",False,False
