In 2017 January-February I went to gym for 2 months and went from 75kg to 71 kg. Stop fitness. I did difficult part exercise there pushup and situps help from my training partner.  I eat junk food there and still loss weight doing   Again in 2018 I went to gym for one month but didn't loss the weight and I was agian 75kg. In this I ate junk food.   Again in 2019 I went fitness between  August-september and I bought one 1 month membership. This time I avoided eating white bread from Monday to Friday but ate white breads at weekends because it's tradition to eat with ginger milk tea.  I didn't avoid to drink milk because it's addicted and don't know how to stop it. But will in future i Stop drinking milk maybe from Monday to Friday.   This time I counted how many session I went and I went about 7 sessions training and went from 85.5 kg to 82kg.   At this 7 session I did double times legs workouts machine likes leg press and squat press after I did cardio for about 30 minutes.  Because I have too many fats in my legs, thighs, butts like a girl.   What can I say from my experience is changing diet to loss weight is scam.   You just need to eat what your parents made when you were child or do the foods you like and doesn't need it be special like famous fitness people eat.   My list is avoiding foods from  1. white bread,   2. maybe avoid milk if you can do it or not,   because I know it's difficult to avoid milk   3. limits snacks by eating about 1-2 piece biscuits per.day.",False,False

I tried to eat between 1500-1700 calories recently so I could have energy for working out and started lifting and I thought it would be so easy because that's so much food!   And I have binged non stop for months. Could not stick to 1700. I seriously have been eating 2000-3000 every day. So tomorrow I'm going back to limit of 1000 and starving myself.   Then it will be a few months until I'm back to binging.   Like what the fuck why is it so hard for me???????,False,False
