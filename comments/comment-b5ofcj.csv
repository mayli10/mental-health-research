Recovery isn’t just about weight restoration and it may seem easier to convince yourself that healthy weight means healthy mind, but imo when you do that you’re only managing the symptoms and not fixing the issue. It’s even easier to do that if the issue is so complex or so buried that you don’t know how to address it, and ime the symptoms just keep coming back. It can be really hard for non disordered people to understand especially when the symptoms are not visible and that can lead to retreat and denial, if you don’t have people close to you who “get it” then you might want to consider professional help (you might want to consider it anyway, even if you do have support from loved ones). EDs are hard to manage completely alone because they can manipulate your reality and it takes an outside perspective to keep that in check. Good luck with your recovery.",False,False
