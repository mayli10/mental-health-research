For example: a normal person probably wouldn't eat two entire packages of oreos in a sitting;  that would be an objective binge.  A subjective binge is when you consume an amount of food that feels like a lot, relative to how much you normally eat, but that a normal person would probably not consider excessive.  This is more like what you are describing.  The mindset/mental effects of the two types are pretty much the same, though.",False,False

I consider it a binge when I eat and just cant seem to stop/feel like I've lost all control.   So not really the quantity of food, but the emotions I experience during eating.",False,False
