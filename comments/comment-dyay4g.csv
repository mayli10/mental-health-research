I was heavy restricting for a couple weeks and I was in the same state you were in, being dizzy and light-headed all the time and barely having the energy just to think and get through the day. then I decided to have a day where I ate closer to my TDEE, and I immediately got more energy. I had so much more motivation to study and clean and do things I enjoy like drawing or playing music. I never realized how much life I was kind-of wasting away my restricting so hard. Iâ€™m gonna try out high-restriction and see if I can find a good balance between losing weight and having some energy.",False,False
