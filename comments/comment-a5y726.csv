Convince yourself it‚Äôs illicit, off limits to eat all that stuff as in ‚ÄúI cannot eat this‚Äù. Just as simple as that and dont give it anymore thought. If you have to think more about it or it eats up at u its ok... ur human, but in order to break habits you‚Äôve gotta have mental strength/resilience. It requires a bit or lying to yourself and mind games as well as some double think but u can do it, 4 sure. Source: I practice abstinence from a good few things and have a gastric problem which prohibits me from eating probably around 90% of your diet. Also am vegetarian (my parents insist im pescatarian tho since i eat fish every once in a while lol)",False,False

It's also less violent to exercise that way when you're overweight, compared to gym equipment as they can hurt your joints. ",False,False

I go through phases of pure barre nonstop then will catch one glimpse of myself in the mirror during class one day and not be able to go for weeks after I see my fat squeezing over my leggings or out of my sports bra.

It's why getting a VR headset did so much for me. I play Beat Saber to exercise, since it burns 7-8 calories per minute (it's been compared to Tennis, but I count 5 calories just to be safe) and being in virtual reality helps the feeling a lot.  I'm sad this isn't something available to everyone. I hope you can find the motivation to get started sometime. &lt;3",False,False

Walking is my best friend because I can go for hours without feeling too much jiggle. I think a big part of why I restrict so much is because I can't handle the feeling of exercising in my fat body.,False,False

I keep binging and ate myself up almost to my starting weight. The worst is knowing how good it felt to exercise when I was skinny but I'm trying to use that feeling to fuel my workouts. Starting to workout is the hardest but I think if you stick to an exercise routine, you'll be rewarded immensely. Good luck and stay safe ‚ô•",False,False
