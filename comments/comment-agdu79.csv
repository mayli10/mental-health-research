Not to be tooooo depressing just coming from someone with... 5 years experience with this (damn 5 years what am I doing with my life) and then usually (at least for me) at some point your latest goal weight is just straight unsustainable or deadly and you end up gaining and you feel like you look even worse than you did when you first were at that weight. Rinse and repeat ,False,False
