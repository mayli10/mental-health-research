But when I went to the pharmacy I saw something called Relacore was on sale. It’s a two part pill. So I take two in the morning. Then I switch them every time I get an urge to eat.   The first day they made me nauseous. But my body got used to them pretty quickly. I feel like they might have a laxative in them as well because that’s definitely a side effect and I’m not complaining about it. ,False,True
