So do shoes, especially heels. Seatbelts in cars are more comfortable. Being cold means saving money on air conditioning. Less sweaty, so your hairstyle stays nice longer. Quieter footsteps - nice perk if you live in a creaky, rickety house and/or are a stealthy assassin. People are nicer (mostly). Your veins are easier to find for medical treatments.
