I eat my scrawny little heart out on vacation and literally ate and drank like 10k every day.     The water weight gain was dramatic at first (I wish I wouldn't have looked, but I wanted  to traumatize myself) but after about 2 weeks I was completely normal. Mind you this was after 7 consecutive days on vacation treating every damn day like a 10k challenge so 2 weeks wasn't horrible recovery imo. I also found that after several consecutive days of over eating that I was very energetic the whole week after vacation and was zooming all over the place.     Don't know if that helps but there it is.",False,False
