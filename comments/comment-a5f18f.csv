As we age, we become acutely aware of how we must eat less to maintain our weight. For some, it results in a hyper-awareness of health. To those more educated about nutrition, it may coincide with taking up an activity (lots of people turn to cycling, hiking, running, etc) as they get older. It might look like vegetarianism or any other altering of diet. To others who have fairly basic knowledge of nutrition (the majority) it probably looks like a general avoidance of sweets, carbs, and fatty foods. All simple and good strategies, but harder to adopt as you get older because of habits. And if you're family is filipino...well, Filippino cuisine is some of the most indulgent out there in terms of fried, fatty and sugary, plus the social element of food.  2. You went home with your boyfriend...a lot of parents (especially those from other countries) born in the 50's-60's still have quite a dated outlook on the female role in society. She may just be in what I like to call 'bride' mode where it's engrained in mothers to want to prep their daughters for marriage (for example, like in the Disney movie 'Brave'). Even if that isn't the case with you and your boyfriend, it still is a default mode that some moms still have.   3. And finally, Californian here... we're all like that. Healthy living is our trademark. No one bats an eye at calorie restriction and extreme healthy eating habits. It's normalized here.",False,False

Not that that means your mom has an ed, but I would definitely keep an eye on her and encourage her eating without being too direct. Hopefully it's nothing and she's just being healthier ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False
