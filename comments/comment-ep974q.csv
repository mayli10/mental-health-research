Set an alarm for 15 mins, and in that time, try and get as much down as you can, even if it's crap. It's so much easier to correct a bad draft than to start a perfect one. If you are struggling after 15 and not in the zone, take a break, and do some more later. 2% is better than nothing. Do it now.",False,False

So like I'll tell myself I'll work on it for 10 minutes, then if I want to stop I can but if I feel okay then I'll keep going. Usually I don't need to stop, because starting the work is the hardest part for me personally. I take a few deep breaths, count down from 10, set a timer, and start, and by the time the timer is up I feel fine continuing to work. I like the Pomodoro method too, you set work intervals and break intervals so for example, you'd work for 25 minutes, break for 5, work for 25, etc and every 4 work intervals you take a longer break of like 15 minutes - you can change those numbers to whatever works for you. It helps to think about just working for 25 minutes instead of thinking about getting all the work done, breaking it down into chunks makes it seem more manageable.",False,False

You need energy from food to fuel your brain. If it's tough for you to eat enough to work than you can always tell yourself that you can restrict after the assignment is done.,False,False
