That said, not all calories also provide the nutrients necessary to maintain all of the body's processes. It is possible to take in more calories than one uses but still be undernourished in terms of all the chemicals necessary to maintain the body. Likewise one can undercut caloric intake but receive adequate nutrition....like maintaining your car really well but not putting enough gas in it to get anywhere; The car is still useless to a point.  From this persective it is useful to focus on both macro and micro nutrients rather than over-focus macros.  Orthorexia is real. MFP is not a nutritionist.  That said, kudos on taking steps to be mindful. You can do it!",False,False
