I hardly drink much at all and the insane amount of sodium I get from my soups helps hold onto a little bit. I've noticed my body getting used to the increased sodium though and my body has been going back to just not holding any water anymore. But for those first few weeks I was holding onto the water pretty good. So if your scared of the water weight like pretty much everyone here then just give it a little time and your body will adjust to the increased sodium. Your mileage may very obviously.,False,False
