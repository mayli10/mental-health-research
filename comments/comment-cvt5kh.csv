This part of town also happens to have a large Asian population. Basically I seem extremely average in my part of town despite being underweight. I've also spent time in places where I'm more likely to run into older women though and it seems that being overweight is just less common when you're young. Among older people I'm almost always tiny in comparison. If you're spending a lot of time around people in their teens or early twenties they're a lot more likely to be thin, but older people are significantly more likely to be overweight. This is largely due to a decrease your calorie needs as you age. People don't typically adjust their needs over time to maintain their weight. They usually just eat as much as they always have as they age.",False,False
