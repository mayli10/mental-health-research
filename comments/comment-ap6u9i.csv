She refused to do anything and threatened me if I said anything to anyone else.  Of fucking course I talked about it to RAs, the university, the police, and just about anybody I could think of.  I showed photos and everything, but the most anybody ever did was talk to her and tell her to clean up.  She would promise that she had done it, but nobody ever came to check, and they just brushed me off when I sent them dated photos of the mold.  It was fucking *insane.*",False,False

For me it was like I didn't want anyone to think I was sick, I just wanted to hurt myself. I was never hospitalized or anything but I was fucking nightmare to be around and I feel like I alienated myself from my family (who sucks) and friends (who are great but very busy). I would freak out--and still do-- about stuff that literally no one else would even notice and it's upsetting for everyone around me. So now, I'm just praying they don't leave because I'm so ""crazy"". But you wouldn't think I had an eating disorder looking at me, absolutely no one ever did not even at my lowest weight.

But at the same time, ohh man it is so hard to actually believe that, especially because society in general doesn’t take eating disorders seriously at all, and I know that you probably know all of this intellectually but it still just really really hurts, it just does and I’m really sorry and if there is any solace it’s just that you are not alone in feeling that  (Honestly I your roommate probably doesn’t feel like he is sick enough that there are people who are way sicker than him)",False,False

She had a *serious* food hoarding problem.  She kept mountains of food in our shared room.  More food than the whole convenience store.    She never ate any of it, just left it sitting out uncovered, often just straight on the furniture and floor.  It just kept rotting and molding until it attracted flies, and I got very seriously sick from constantly breathing the mold.  I coughed a lot, felt tired and ""foggy,"" and got nauseous every time I walked in the room.    Oddly enough, that was the *second* roommate to seriously threaten my health.  The first actually hospitalized me, but that's another story...    Restriction gave me some control over my life while it was spiraling out of control in every other aspect.  My grades were shit because I couldn't focus.  I was a social pariah because I always smelled like mold.  I started the school year borderline obese, and ended it underweight and diagnosably anorexic.  Food was repulsive, revolting, vile.  Every minute I spent out exercising was a minute not spent in that toxic hellhole.  The photos I took to document the mold ^^^(because NO ONE EVER BELIEVED ME) trigger me a thousand times more than any thinspo ever could.    ...all this to say, I completely empathize with you, but you can't let a roommate drag you down with him.

Imposter syndrome and the idea of not being ""sick enough"" is super common with eating disorders. I've had an ED and body issues since around age 11 or 12. I'm 24 now and I've never been underweight or hospitalized. I still refuse to seek help or really open up because I feel the same as you; like I'm not valid. I find myself jealous of people with severe EDs. Like, those before and after pictures on Instagram and whatnot where someone is emaciated and then they gain weight and everyone comments how amazing they look now and how strong they are. I feel like my recovery wouldn't count as much as theirs, I guess? Because I've never been truly sick. It's so fucking hard. So you're not alone.   It's not your fault, either. So many people don't understand EDs. Society tends to tie the severity of an ED to being underweight. When, in reality, most ED sufferers with EDNOS and bulimia and BED will never be severely underweight. But they're still suffering. They're damaging their bodies, they're suffering mentally, and they deserve help. You deserve help. Think about your own symptoms and what you're going through. If your friend/sibling/family member/significant other etc. came to you and said they'd been doing the same things, would you tell them they're invalid and not sick enough? No. You'd support and help them. So try and extend the same kindness to yourself. ",False,False
