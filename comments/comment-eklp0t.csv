Purging right now is really not a good idea medically and also the doctors will definitely find out. I know its really tough but doing what the doctors tell you to do as best as you can is the quickest way out of hospital. Best wishes and hope things get easier soon,False,False

This sounds really difficult for you right now, i'm sorry you've got all this going on. I know how hard it is, but purging will likely only do a couple things: 1. Lengthen your hospital stay. 2. Absolutely land you on stricter watch/in a psychiatric hospital. Purging messes up the whole body, especially hydration levels. I know it's hard, trust me. I've had my share of purging addiction, but I highly suggest trying to use this time to recover from your overdose. Even if you aren't actively recovering, it's good to try and challenge your ED.  I really hope you start to feel better, in whatever capacity may come first, and I'm glad you're still with us. &lt;3  Edit: I want to say-- I'm no medical professional. Just someone whose had an ED for years, and has purged a lot in recent months, who wants you to try to take care of yourself as best you can.",False,False
