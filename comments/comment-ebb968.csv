Theres something about mother daughter relationships (screwed up ones) where mothers project all their own insecurities onto their girl children. I honestly wouldnt take too much what she says to heart because it sounds like she is projecting on to you.,False,False

Stay strong, and remember recovery is worth it for **you**.   Protecting your own mental health, and your own recovery is important. If it means having a conversation with your mom about how her comments are damaging you, or being more mindful about what she says to you, or if that isnt safe for you or she wouldnt be responsive to that to simply try and distance yourself from her while you are still in a fragile headspace or prone to relapse.  If nothing else, remember you have a whole community here willing to support you in these struggles ‚ù§",False,False

None of them have ever picked up on my disordered eating either they just think I like to eat ~healthy~ which isn‚Äôt ENTIRELY wrong, but like the last time I was home for a weekend I panicked and basically didn‚Äôt eat because there was nothing in the house that I felt okay eating except for like.

I've been underweight for years and even when I wasn't I was still low normal BMI. My aunt recently lost a lot of weight (not sure how much, but from plus size down to a size 4ish?) and ALL THE WOMEN IN MY FAMILY keep talking about how unhealthy she looks. My grandma calls her anorexic all the time to me. Last time I was home she said ""your aunt was wearing a SIZE TWO dress the other day!"" and I had no idea what to say because I'm at least two inches taller and I wear a 0 or 00. Last Christmas my aunt said ""Why does no one say anything about *my name* being skinny"" and they said ""because she's ~naturally~ that way."" It's SO triggering and makes me feel terrible and bad like if I ever gain any weight I won't be me anymore.",False,False
