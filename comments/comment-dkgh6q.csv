A partner should never say something to hurt you. They should be there to support you. And him knowing you have ED and then knowingly making a comment about your eating is super toxic. Please don’t let this slide. This is a huge red flag.,False,False

Is it possible he said it like an idiot but might mean it from a place of love? I literally make that mistake all the time.  Please don't lose your recovery, your body is strong and happy and it deserves to be treated well and so do you! You deserve happiness...remember that.",False,False

He admitted right after he told me how poorly I eat that he does too, so at least he wasn’t just standing there saying I eat terribly and he eats perfectly, but I felt like if he’s not willing to make a change in his poor eating habits why is he calling me out about mine? Also, he was super hung up on the instant noodles I like to make to eat (cup-of-noodles) and the frozen dinners I make for myself, both of which I DONT binge on (huge success for me) and both of which usually are enough to get me to my daily maintenance calories. I just wish he’d see that eating anything in the first place is a good thing and if my instant noodles are something I feel comfortable eating that’s not something to ridicule or belittle.",False,True

I don't even know what to say. I always compare EDs to drug addiction. It just takes one hit/drink/comment and you are back in the cycle. I think you need to dump this dude if this is his version of understanding,False,False

f4gzpyv,t3_dkgh6q,t1_f4ef88i,krupickaj,1,2019-10-20 10:50:24,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/dkgh6q/boyfriends_comments_got_me_back_on_my_bullshit/f4gzpyv/,Thanks friend. I’m definitely going to at least try to go back to eating when I’m hungry but we live together and just knowing he could say something at any time makes me anxious. I hope you’re able to process your girlfriends comments better than I am!!,False,True

It was kinda hard to hide it when for the first month or two of our relationship we’d go out to restaurants and I’d order something and then eat one bite and be finished with it. He was VERY supportive and helped me so much back then and he’s probably the biggest reason I recovered as much as I did. Which is why his comments were all the more hurtful since he knew about my ED and my fucked up brain went “maybe he doesn’t like you at your recovery weight”. He knows what to say to make it hurt, that’s for damn sure.",False,True

Even when you're skinny, people will comment if it's junk food. But still, what the hell? Did you ask him how healthy he thinks he's eating since he bought and ate those foods? Maybe take a look in the mirror before criticizing you, ya know",False,False

She's always treating me out and buying me junk food, and then she turns around and tells me that I need to start eating better.  Please don't let it get you down too much, though. Just chalk it up to him being dumb. You even said yourself that you only eat it when you're hungry.",False,False
