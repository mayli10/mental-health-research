Well, I shall stick to practicing what I preach and confirm that the things that Iâ€™ve listed above are what I do to combat it.   Instead of doing things that focus on my body, I do things that focus on my mind - as the mind is all that we are at the end of the day.   Iâ€™ll draw, listen to music, even start researching interests or learn something new just to get out of my own head.  Sometimes, Iâ€™ll just have a lie down or a nap when Iâ€™m more anhedonic; just try to focus on resting and let the bad thoughts pass, because eventually, they do.  Try to counter them with a positive thought.",False,False

I do not have BDD, only when it is co-morbid with my anorexia when it gets bad.   Iâ€™m sorry that you are going through that.   Remember that people are most beautiful when they show passion, when they do what they love. Nothing can beat the way a person glows amidst the exploration of their dreams :)   When you get into moods, pick up something you love, or used to love, despite if youâ€™re anhedonic or not - it helps!",False,False

Iâ€™ve been normal weight, Iâ€™ve been underweight, and Iâ€™ve been everywhere in-between, and I feel the same as I ever did - depressed severely and completely dead.   Only worse, when being underweight. Then you just get anxiety from possible health complications while simultaneously not caring if you die.   Calorie counting, exercise, thinking about food are just distractions from whatâ€™s really going on, from what youâ€™re really not dealing with.   I see these posts all the time and it is heartbreaking.  My disorder was never rooted in looks, however. It was always internal.",False,False
