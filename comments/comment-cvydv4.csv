I feel like my depression is at an all time high and I literally don’t enjoy anything besides eating and getting drunk  Find a good tv show (I just recently binged in the dark, euphoria, working moms, big little lies) they were all good and kept me looking forward to watching more. Only downfall is I like to snack when I watch tv so as long as I avoid that, I’m good  If you like video games, find one to play that keeps you entertained for a while. Minecraft, Zelda botw &amp; Skyrim keep me entertained for a long time and hold my attention. Games like super smash bros where it’s just a short round and then I have to start another one give me time to go get snacks or something  Find books to read. I like to read in the bath. No food around.. I’m not going to get out to eat.. and usually keeps my attention for a while  Go for a walk or run an errand when you really want to eat but aren’t actually hungry. It at least postpones the boredom eating for a while  Cooking or baking is my main hobby but then I have to refrain from wanting to eat it lol. Make cookies and give them to someone else??",False,False
