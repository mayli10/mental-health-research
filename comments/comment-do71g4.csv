I was about to have a panic attack during school and my friend was trying to hug me (to comfort me - I kinda like hugs) and she said ""my arms can't fit round you"". Rationally, I could easily have understood that she said that because I was against a wall in a tight space so her arms couldn't physically get around my back. However, my lovely brain translated it as ""you're such a whale that my arms can't get around your layers of fat"". This comment consequently sent me over the edge and I broke down crying. Great.",False,False

I bow down to your literary skills and on point humour, and I relate so hard to how you're feeling. I always take that stance when something happens, like I did something wrong or they don't really love me. Thanks for making a joke though. Made my day üôè",False,False
