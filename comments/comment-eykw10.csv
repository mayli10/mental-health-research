I feel like measuring weight in lbs is more ~powerful~ because it’s a bigger number - saying I’ve lost 5lbs sound so much cooler than 2.25kg but gaining lbs feels like so much more lmao,False,False

Usually I use kilos, naturally, and the satisfaction in kilos is... better? But since I'm trying to break a binge/restrict cycle, I need to trick my brain into thinking I'm making significant progress . Therefore more change on the scale works.  But these ""mindgames"" are really interesting since at the end of the day, the weight is the same",False,True

If I'm losing, I want to see it in KG.  I think it's because pound losses only feel ""significant"" if it's 5lbs, or 10lbs, or a whole stone. Going from 12st 8lbs to 12st 2lbs is a 6 pound loss, but it doesn't feel like much because I'm still in the ""12s"".   Whereas because the increments between kg are much smaller, losing .5kg can mean the difference between (for example) being in the 77s and being in the 76's. A 6-pound loss is just over 3kg, so I drop down three whole ""categories"" in my head - even though it's the same amount.  It's probably also coz I live in Europe, so I'm just used to kilograms and know how they work. If someone asks me to imagine a kilogram of (insert thing here), I can probably picture it relatively well. On the other hand, pounds/stone are a mystery to me ngl. So I'm more comfortable with kg.",False,False
