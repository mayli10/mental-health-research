It's just more heavy restrict and bingemode every so often. I used ""saving money"" as a reason to not eat  My biggest trigger to binge was being at home, specifically my kitchen. Every time I go back home, I get back into my binge eating habits like grazing the fridge and eating literally whatever.   Now I've got my own apartment room, and I'm so lazy that I don't cook for myself (even though I easily can). All my classes are at least a 1/2 mile walk, which only makes restricting easier.",False,False

I'll feel great, but someone says one thing to me in a different tone that usual, or makes a comment to me about something, and suddenly I don't want to eat anymore. The situation wont even be related to food, my Ed is just like ""oh hey let's take this situation that has absolutely nothing to do with me and let it consume the rest of your day!""",False,False

I don't even feel shitty yet except when I try to sleep and can't get warm. But I know the crash is coming lol. Yesterday I was daydreaming about resurrecting my tumblr,False,False
