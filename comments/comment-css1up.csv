It totally sucks that it has to be that way. I wish I could just push the thoughts down and never let them out and I feel so selfish that I’m not capable of that. I can’t afford a therapist and I don’t have the time so I will have to start journaling I think. Thank you so much for the advice.",False,True

If not, then an online or phone counselor. Last resort, hardcore journaling. These are thoughts that need to be expressed somehow because eventually you will just burst if you try to keep it all in. Up to a certain point it’s okay to confide in your friends but it’s not fair to expect them to bear it all themselves...learned this the hard way. Once I was safely in treatment, two of my closest friends told me that they would be stepping away from our friendship for a while because I had totally burnt them out by subjecting them to my breakdowns and crises prior to receiving professional help. It took me a while to stop feeling guilty about that, but we are all friends again and I’ve realized we were all just doing our best in a shitty situation; I was extremely sick and that wasn’t my fault. But yeah, moral of the story is that your friends have their own mental stuff to deal with so ideally you talk to someone who gets paid to listen instead.",False,False
