He was admiring you and was trying to strike up conversation. Sometimes you need to be objective when it comes to comments from strangers. They know nothing of what you're going through as it's not tattooed to your forehead as you may feel it is.   Sometimes old people want to be friends with beautiful young people as it helps them fit into a world that's in a twilight for them. They feel like they are a minority and not contributing to the world anymore, have no worth, and don't belong. Not everyone is judging in their comments, rather it's your own perception of what they said that is judging.   &amp;#x200B;  I'm older, under 60, but as a retired paramedic and closet people observer from contacts well into the 10's of thousands, you learn about people. I don't expect you to understand from this short response, but trust me, while there are a lot of judging people out there, you'll know a mean response when you hear one. What you typed in quotes wasn't meant to be mean. ",False,False
