This post just reminded me that I forgot to weigh myself after pooping today because I got distracted trying to UNCLOG MY TOILET before my boyfriend woke up because I ate chick-fil-a for dinner last night instead of the easy to digest soup I’d planned.   I’ve lived with my bf for six months, but I have zero interest in subjecting him to seeing (or smelling) the mess that my bowels created this morning. Thank god for essential oil diffusers.",False,False
