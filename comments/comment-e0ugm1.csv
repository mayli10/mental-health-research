You feel shit but do the recovery option anyway, and then you feel even shitter afterwards.     I'm just gonna say, you've got this. üí™You're gonna have good days and bad days and even weeks, and that's okay! Think about where you are now compared to in the depths of your ED. Besides gaining weight, what else have you gained? For me it was my period (so my bone health will be so much better), not feeling cold all the time even in summer, and actually having the mental capacity to enjoy spending time with people and not thinking about food 110% of the time.   I'm currently semi-relapsing too, but also have the clarity to see how if I get caught in an ED spiral, I don't think I'll manage to get out again. And that fear of being trapped in my ED keeps me from relapsing completely.   In terms of how you feel in your body, just remember this body now is just your ""recovery bod"". It's not the body you'll have forever. Bodies change and especially in recovery the way your body stores fat etc. is very different to how it would if you hadn't had an ED.  It's amazing you have a team - use them! You have a lot of support and you can do this. Try to keep in perspective why you started recovery in the first place.  Btw check out MegsyRecovery on YouTube, she has tonnes of videos about quasi-recovery, gaining weight, relapses, etc. Her videos have literally saved me.  Hope you get through this and don't beat yourself up too much. We got this!! üíï",False,False
