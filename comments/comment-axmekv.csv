I would really suggest looking into it and searching up Dr. Greger, Iâ€™ve literally never felt healthier in my life. His website (Nutrition Facts) is just hundreds (thousands?) of videos that dissect scientific studies and what they mean for how we should be eating. A bit addicting honestly. The guy is quite literally addicted to health.  For me, the Daily Dozen kinda took the gratification I got from counting calories and turned it into something that was still destructive (since I was obsessed with it) but much healthier. I swear I reverse-aged on that shit.",False,False

Personally Iâ€™ve always lost the fastest in that mid-range restricting so you might be surprised. Also energy/mood-wise youâ€™ll feel better so thatâ€™s a bonus.

Sadly when you get so used to so little food itâ€™s really hard to stop getting bloated constantly though. (Heck itâ€™s been a year since Iâ€™ve started increasing and I STILL end up looking pregnant after eating.) Itâ€™s just what happens...
