Also some artificial sweetness are okay,  but I know splenda has some nasty side effects, so in spite of all the terrible things I do to my body (hello cigarettes and starving myself) that's a line I won't cross",False,True

OCD manifests in weird food mentalities often. And stuff like Splenda and Diet Soda tends to make me REALLY sick. So I just kinda assume itâ€™s bad on everyone. Sorry about that!,False,False

Iâ€™m not here to shame anyone but I can NOT fathom drinking any kind of soda- much less diet?? And Splenda?? That stuff is all chemicals how do yâ€™all not get sick??
