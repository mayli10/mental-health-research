The same, EXACTLY same happened to me. Always been fat, lost 60ish lbs, got praised and people talked to me who never talked to me before, althought I was really really unhealthy. Made me fail law school, was always so cold that I cried almost everyday because it hurt SO bad existing in the winter, and then the binging started and I gained almost all back and nobody can shut the fuck up about it (and if not to my face, I know exactly that they talk behind my back). It's so frustrating because now I have to start all over, but mostly just to shove it into their faces that yeah, I can lose it again, no need to gossip Karen.",False,False

I always went back and forth between ""you're too skinny you're gonna die"" and ""you're too fat you're gonna die alone"" according to my family.   Right now, in recovery, im in the ""too skinny"" camp but apparently I'm too skinny to get married? My BMI is 20 right on the money, for the record, so I'm not *too* anything. Wtf, family?    If it helps, your body, your recovery, and your ED are between you and you. It's good to have a support network but the reality is, family or friends cant always be a part of it. For me, I had to limit talking to my family and my long-time childhood friends to once per week and keep the conversation either light or about them. I did that the majority of my recovery (so the whole last 2 years of college) and it really helped. Nobody was judging me because they didn't know, and I was free to really sit down with myself and think things through, meditate on what behaviors were connected to what thoughts and how to mitigate my actions. I also didn't have a Facebook or any method of sharing what I looked like with friends or family outside of curating and sending them myself, so the only people who could comment on how I looked were the people I chose to spend time with (hint: people who would *never* talk about how I look).  I guess I'm just saying all of this to point out that you're not alone, this is a super relatable experience for ED-havers and it can definitely get better if you limit the triggers while you work on the internal stuff, assuming recovery is what you are aiming at.",False,False

My friends ask me to go to the gym with them. My fuckass sister straighup calls me fat and says i looked better before  You live in an impossible environment. no one can be happy or work towards their or happiness in such a place. You don't have to build hate or resentment towards your family, you just need to completely separate and sever all contact for some period of time while you experience life without their negative words.  when I was going through exactly what you are, I went away to college because I just knew it would solve all my problems. it didn't so I dropped out after 4 months and moved back home. I spent another 4 months letting the same negative environment that I came from consume me. Then I called a military recruiter and was at boot camp 30 days later.  The military is not a good environment. it isn't fun. it feels shitty to live that way. But for people like us, it gives you a chance to just live physically without thinking. It gives you an easy way to break out of the negative environment that created you.  the silence alone is worth it. not having to hear all the people you've heard all your life telling you you are bad then when you chance telling you that is bad too. All your world becomes is physical exercise and going where you are told to.  Dont resent or hate your family and friends, but they are a large part of why you are unhealthy. To get better you need to get away from them and let yourself see how the rest of the world views you.",False,False
