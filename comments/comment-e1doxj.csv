For me it was stress and happiness (which really surprises me cause I had no idea). What helped the most was when I felt like binging I didn’t eat the unhealthy foods I was craving, I grabbed healthy foods and ate enough so I wouldn’t be hungry. I really crave those unhealthy foods, but I know that for me one thing turns into a downward spiral. I found that if I eat enough healthy food I won’t be hungry and it makes the urges die down. They’re still gonna be there, but at least I have a way higher chance of resisting them. I still binge sometimes but it’s rare if ever because of this. Who would’ve thought, the solution to binging is eating lol.",False,False

If it's bulimia you need to work on the purging before you can start to work on the bingeing. It's shit like that.    It's impossible to *not* binge when you are restricting, it's just biology; no matter how hard you try to not binge eventually your lizard brain will come into play and be like ""wtf nah you gotta eat"" and make you impulsively reach for a pack of cookies and like 2 large pizzas   (Basically the only solution is recovery)",False,False
