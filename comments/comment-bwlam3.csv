Here's why:  I was on Wellbutrin for a while with great results for both my ED and depression. I love it and missed it. It made me feel human again. But as I am an American, medical care is lacking and I could no longer afford to go to the doctor. I tried to buy Wellbutrin online from overseas, but that's incredibly expensive. You can only get a 90-day supply from CVS once and it's not pretty to go off cold-turkey.  My grandmother died back this past fall. It was 'planned' - she chose to stop treatment. She left behind all of her medications. We were told to take them to a pharmacy where they can dispose of them properly.  I gave them all to the pharmacy tech, except the Prozac. I had recently picked up her last rX and it was full because she went into hospice days later.   I thought I had lost it, but I found the bottle last night. It doesn't expire for 5 months and it's a 3 month supply. I'm starting them today. It says it's used to treat depression (check), anxiety (check), PMDD (check) and even bulimia (check, check, check).   I read all the instructions and cautions; I'm not totally stupid. But it's 3 months. In 3 months, my house will be sold and I'll have money for the doctor again and hopefully a job.   I will make notes of how it affects my bulimia though. I don't binge and purge as much anymore and it tends to be smaller binges if anything, but the urge is always though. If Prozac works, I'll cry tears of joy. And I know it's said to cause weight gain, but we all know CICO and how it just can increase appetite. But I already track my food and am aware of it, so if it's makes me insatiable it can fuck off.  Self-medicating is dangerous and don't do it. But I'm at such a low point that I'm willing to try anything.",False,False
