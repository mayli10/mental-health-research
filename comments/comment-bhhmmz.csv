It's based on how much food and body image affects your self worth. Obsessing about food, and weight and calories is very disordered behavior. I would suggest talking to any kind of doctor about this.   I've had an eating disorder for the better part of 10 years and wasn't diagnosed until 4 months ago. I thought because I wasn't underweight and because I wasn't ""sick enough"" my behaviors didn't count, but they do.   If you're concerned about this at all I really think you should seek some help.",False,False

I think it’s more your attitude towards it. do you get anxious or guilty about eating too much even if it’s a normal amount? or do you feel like your attitude toward food is normal and healthy?   same can go for exercise, and here is another example: exercising 2 hrs a day because you play sports or really love working out and are eating enough to sustain Versus working out to punish yourself for guilt you feel about eating",False,False
