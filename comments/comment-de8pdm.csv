Thank you very much, I really needed to hear that, EDs are ready ingrained in us and they are not just about eating behaviors, it's the whole mental package that comes with it.   I didn't know about this community and I just subscribed, thanks for linking the sub.  I hope you get better and beat the monsters surrounding you.",False,True

I spent about the past year in relapse with my ED- it developed when I was 15, persisted through high school, wasn't prominent during college (and thank god, because if I'd had to balance my ED with everything else I definitely wouldn't have done well), and resurfaced about a year post-college (I'm 23 currently). I'm currently engaged and struggling with being unemployed and having recently moved in with my fiance, which ramped up my ED symptoms from Mild to Oh No.  And a few weeks ago, at my worst, I decided I was sick of suffering. I reached out to my partner for help and have started eating like an Actual Adult. I'm looking into therapy and getting set up for a doctor's appointment to check my health, because I know having an ED can really fuck a person up.  Recovery is worth it. I won't lie, I have felt like an imposter; going from restricting heavily to eating normally with no tears or much pushback makes me feel like I was just ""performing"" the role of someone with an ED. But every day I'm bombarded with the same thoughts: ""I don't like gaining weight!"" ""I can see my hips filling back out, oh no"" ""What if I went on a liquid diet?"" ""What if I cut out carbs?"" ""I'm too heavy.""  And, like the commenter above pointed out, that's the proof. Still having to fight those thoughts, every day, is proof that I'm engaged in a fight against a serious mental illness. And feeling healthier in this process of recovery is proof I'm doing the right thing.  When you decide to recover, just know that you can always reach out for support here too! You might be ""alone"" in terms of isolation from healthcare/family, but online communities like here and r/fuckeatingdisorders are here for you.",False,False

I don't think I have any other choice but to recover alone, because my family doesn't even know what EDs are, we're not taught about them (I learned about EDs on the internet, a huge factor in me thinking that I gave myself my ED). And mental health Care is inexistent where I am, so I'm really helpless here, the idea of having a therapist is so foreign, that's what I get for living in such an under-developed country..    &gt;The fears you have, that's your ED trying desperately to keep its grasp on you. But there is truth, you have wasted the past two years by engaging in it rather than living. But I would rather I wasted two than an entire decade. You can't get back that time, but you can work towards making the future yours and not the illness'.  This really makes me feel better, I don't want to waste anymore time obssessing, and I know people wasted entire decades of their lives, this is just so dark...",False,True

Wowzer I haven't eaten anything all day and when I finally eat it's noodles that are impossible to chew and the broth has almost no flavor??

This led to a cycle of binge/restrict that I am still struggling with.  That's exactly what happened before my binge/restrict cycle !!  And I think your idea is sooo clever, because a huge factor in my purging is the disatisfaction with the food I eat, it's either junk or nutritional but doesn't taste good, which leads to a lot of stress, and after a whole day of starving, it certainly leads to binging.  Anyway, thank you for taking the time to write such a detailed reply, I'll definitely go grocery shopping tomorrow and buy a bunch of fruits and veggies and ""direct the obssession"", as you said, into another less unhealthy area of eating.",False,True

I got super annoyed with all the fake zero calorie food substitutes in order to keep restricting (shirataki noodle, soup that is just a bullion cube with hot water, oat fiber bread, baby food, icecream that is just frozen almond milk and vanilla).    I was so mentally exhausted from thinking up crazy recipes with super expensive, special order, or hard to find ingredients just to make anything as close to zero calories as possible. This led to a cycle of binge/restrict that I am still struggling with.  I am too afraid to go back to eating a normal amount of calories, so I switched to OMAD using bento boxes  Preparing the bento boxes satisfies my craving for ✨aesthetic✨ . OMAD let's me put all my calories for the day into real food and makes me feel like I am not a ""fake"" because I am fasting most of the day  Example:   Egg white tamagoyaki (slightly sweet and savory egg roll): 45 calories Katsudon (pork cutlet with sauce simmered in egg and onion) made with egg whites and a gardein cutlet: 200 calories Pickles chunks and mini peppers: 30 calories Strawberries and Mandarin slices: 45 calories Mini babybel light cheese:40 cals  Dessert: vanilla halotop and lite chocolate syrup: 90 calories  TOTAL: 450  I try to keep it balanced (carbs from the breading on the cutlet and the veggies) (protein from the eggs and the cutlet)(fats from the cheese)(sugar, vitamins, and fiber from veggies and fruit) and supplement with vitamins  But I also make sure that it looks extra cute and presentable, so eating it feels more special and I can look forward to it at the end of the day  In reality, I'm just moving my obsessive tendencies to another area of my relationship with food, but at least I can actually find some satisfaction in eating this way where as before I literally felt like jumping off the bridge near my house",False,False

If you still have thoughts about feeling guilty, a fake, and that a little compensatory behaviour here and there won't hurt, then you would still be sick. EDs are first and foremost a mental illness, they just come with a hell of a lot of physical attributes.  The fears you have, that's your ED trying desperately to keep its grasp on you. But there is truth, you have wasted the past two years by engaging in it rather than living. But I would rather I wasted two than an entire decade. You can't get back that time, but you can work towards making the future yours and not the illness'.  Reach out to someone you trust or seek out medical help if that's accessible to you. Don't try to recover alone, it is so much harder to get through the bad days when you have no one to lean on for support.  You will only grow more tired if you continue to feed the ED, and the more life you give it, the harder it is to separate yourself. Your struggles are valid and your are deserving of help, of being free of this nightmare. The earlier you seek treatment, the better chance you have of reclaiming your life. And if you relapse, that's okay too. Recovery is never linear.  Thinking about recovery is a good start. The next step is seeking help and support, which will be the absolute hardest since eating disorders thrive on isolation and secrecy. I believe you can do it though.",False,False
