I followed all the rules, did what I was told, WASNT a problem, didn’t cause a problem. Admitted at 85 lbs, left at 120-125. After, gained 20 more lbs, got to around 145. Currently in the process of a relapse. Back at 110. IP showed me the food rules I want to avoid forever, it’s ingrained in my stupid ED brain that doing things healthy will lead to weight gain.",False,False

IP really didn’t help. I spent months there over 2 stays. Then I did residential and things clicked. I was really better for 13 years until my sister died this year.  And even now, I’m nowhere near where I was before.",False,False

Didn't help the first or second time but the third time I decided to go and was more open to it the process which helped set me on the path to recovery. But I went from a residential/PHP straight home and that was really hard. I probably should have done OP but didn't have a place to stay.",False,False
