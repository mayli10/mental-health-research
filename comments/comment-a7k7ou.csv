I had never thought anything about being fat so it instantly made me cold. A couple months later I took a selfie and thought “it only my thighs weren’t so close...” and then my friends step mom had us stand next to each other to decide who’s stomach was bigger. I started to *try* to purge and then it spiraled from there. Currently, I know I’m not fat, but I’m not where I want to be, but comfortable(?) however, I’m fixated (bipolar probzzzz) on proving a point. Idk what my point is, but 20lbs in 3 weeks is all I keep saying and I hate myself everyday for it. ",False,False

So I decided to control my body and make it disappear. Now I no no longer want to disappear, nor to I hate myself because I've had good examples and experiences with people who love me.

I also had an extremely abusive teacher and suffered from several other traumas for which I received no support. It's kind of hard to love yourself when you learn you're not worth the time and effort that love requires from people whose sole responsibility is to care for you. I don't really blame them anymore; both of them have mental illnesses of their own that made it really difficult to respond consistently and appropriately as parents. I developed Borderline Personality and that created the need for self-regulation that I try to acquire through anorexia.  It's taken me a decade of therapy to find these answers so don't worry if it takes you a few years. Just keep being mindful of your thoughts, emotions, behaviours, and the connections they have to your past.",False,False

But the more I thought about it, the easier it was to see.  Long story short, I was bullied a lot as a young kid for being chubby, especially when I was 9. I was never overweight, statistically, but I went to schools where for whatever reason the faculty cared more about athletics than grades. I, as you may have guessed, was not an athlete. My year 4 teacher would actively mock me on a weekly basis for my lack of athletic prowess and my weight.  So I was conscious of that for my whole childhood, basically. Then I got sexually assaulted at 16 by someone who gaslight me into believing that because of my weight, no-one else could ever love me.   Bang. Anorexia diagnosis 6 months later.  My mum said she had a fear of me developing an ED ever since I first told her about what was happening with that teacher after I was diagnosed. I think I had some BED tendencies prior to my AN, too.

The whole concept of loving yourself seems completely alien to me still. It's pretty easy to explain the self-loathing, though. I grew up with a mother who made it abundantly clear she never liked me. I have five younger siblings that I'd usually take care of for her, and she always just loved whoever was youngest. The youngest was born when I was 16, and I love her to death, but damn is she spoiled. She never got beaten, she never got told she was a mistake. I had a talk with her a while back about the violence and she said she had doubted if it was even true because she's only heard of it from our other sister and she has a pretty casual relationship with honesty. She believed it when I said it, though, But she just couldn't imagine it. Our mom likes to take her to restaurants or on vacations. The rest of us are never invited.  I remember once as a kid, I was maybe 8 (though I think all my childhood memories happened at 8 for some reason) and I was wondering if my mom loved me. Then I brushed that aside, because of course she didn't. Then I wondered if she even *liked* me, so I asked her, and she told me to fuck off and stop being such a moron. That episode sums it up pretty well. I have this intense conviction that no one can ever love me, and they must have good reasons for it, so... Yeah.   It's been confirmed over and over, too. Used to have a lot of friends in my teens, the type that said they'd always be there for me if things got rough. Then I got homeless and depressed and they all just kinda vanished. I don't blame them, I just wish they hadn't lied about caring. Got a lot of examples like that. People don't really seem to get invested in me.  Oh, and my dad, what a fucking joke. Human equivalent of a cardboard cut out. He was gone all the time. Still is. He forgot my 30th birthday, in spite of the Facebook notification and all. I wrote him a few weeks later and he just went ""Whoops"" at it. Gave up on him after that.   In my case, I never really had a reason not to hate myself. The world just kinda repeatedly confirmed all my fears and showed that yep, I'm not good enough and never will be and no matter how hard I try, I will always fail. The sad thing is that seeing this shit doesn't really seem to help. I try to be kinder to myself, I try to make good choices, but ultimately I'm just a big fat fucking failure who will never do anything memorable or be anything more than a temporary amusement for the people around me, until I get sad and they ditch me.

Spent hours and hours in therapy trying to unpack my childhood and what led to me having issues so big that they developed into an ED. Still have no idea where I got lost. I had a great childhood, no family issues, no bullying.. and yet I can find diaries from when I was as young as eight describing everything I disliked about myself.   I don't know what caused exactly me to develop an ED, but it couldn't have been only body issues. Me and a couple of friends started a ""diet club"" in elementary school, but they never developed any issues with food apart from saying ""oh, I should stop eating this crap, haha"" while eating chocolate. Then there's me. I think it's mostly about control and managing emotions for me, to be fair I've always turned to shitty coping mechanisms. Which is why it's so insanely hard to recover.
