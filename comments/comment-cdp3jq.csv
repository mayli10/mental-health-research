I was sitting at the lunch table at school, not eating, as I had done every single day for the past couple of years. I don’t even remember the context now but my best friend’s words still ring clear “you look sick! Your eyes are literally sunken in!”  I didn’t even know what to say. At the time I was bordering being overweight. I associated sunken eyes with being deathly skinny. How could she say I looked sick when I was legitimately dozens of lb away from ~skinny~ Ig it just goes to show how differently people see us than we see ourselves   Sending u love darlin💕",False,False
