This happened to me in the past where I gained to 119 and then dropped to my lowest weight ever of 107. So I’m hopefully I’ll get out of it and drop again.. I just don’t know how to do it. Last time I just had to push myself so incredibly hard to tolerate the urges to eat and lose sleep bc of my stomach pangs.   It did feel worth it to have control again and lose and feel comfortable in my body and I just need to remind myself of that. I feel so outta wack and scared it won’t stop but I gotta remember I stopped it before and I will stop it again.,False,True

I'm constantly going in and out of binge phases too. I think the only real solution is to just wait it out and try to keep getting better and better at not causing them in the first place,False,False
