Lots of things in your post I really related to. I‚Äôm not too good with words recently, but I guess I just want you to know that I read the whole thing and I can appreciate the pain you‚Äôre feeling.   I hope someday soon you won‚Äôt feel that you need to be this ‚Äúbetter in every way‚Äù type of person. You are enough as you are, and you‚Äôre stronger than you think. Thank you for sharing your story, and I hope this comment at least helps you feel heard.",False,False

I just cooked for 3 hours after getting into my apartment.   I really do love to cook. I wanted to make something that I‚Äôd want to eat. Wanted to cook myself my favorite things. I just had a bowl of shepherds pie. It was good. I‚Äôm glad I had it. I‚Äôm too tired to torture myself too much right now.,False,True

It may not seem it, but that takes self awareness and rational thinking about your situation.  I also struggle with time alone. Obsessive thoughts get to me then. What has helped me a little is easing in to it. Like, if I'm dreading being home alone, I'll go somewhere where I'll be alone in my head, but there are still people around, like a library or a park.   Also, I'll play podcasts or YouTube around the house, conversational ones so it feels like other people are home, just maybe in another room.   It isn't much, but maybe that could help you feel a little more present when alone.   As for recovery, it is so much a crazy winding road that doubles back on itself and then comes back around. Be gentle with yourself. Ask for help. It is amazing the compassion you can find in others. I wish you comfort as you work through these hard times. :)",False,False
