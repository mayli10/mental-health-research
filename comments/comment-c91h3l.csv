Part of why I’m struggling is that I had a really strong reaction of dislike to the other participants. My first go at treatment was maybe 6-10 people, mixed ages with an average of around 30. I was on the young end. This time it’s more that 15 people, the vast majority of whom are in the 18-22 range. There’s one or two other working adults around my age and one woman who is significantly older than everyone else. But I walked into a room of young college age women gabbing about tinder and makeup deals and one girl talking about running away from home and I’m over here married, worried about bills, work, etc. just so far out if that frame of reference. I have zero idea how to relate and literally could not relate to most of what was shared in group. Tbh I’m about the same age range and life stage as the staff. It’s weird. I’m hoping I get sat next to some of the older participants at meals eventually.  Good luck with your shift up in care. I had to do that my first time around, and it was super helpful.",False,True

I've found it to be useful so far but it's also made me confront how entrenched my ED has/had become; I am stepping up to a higher level of care bc oof, but I know that's not an option for most people. I hope your treatment progresses well!",False,False
