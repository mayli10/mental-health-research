And besides if you aren’t using all those calories on booze maybe you can get a small snack out and people won’t blink and eye at your behaviour. There are tons of reasons a person might not want to drink and while you might have to throw out a quick explanation if someone asks it shouldn’t be more Than that.   Examples:   - taking a medication where you can’t drink  - a new diet (careful with this one)  - doc recommend for stomach problems  - you don’t enjoy booze or getting drunk really  - you have plans in the morning - you had some drinks the night before and don’t want to tonight  - you have recently had a bad reaction to booze and don’t want to repeat it. ( I know several people with allergies to alcohol)  - you want to drive  - you have somewhere to be after (If it’s not too late)  - you aren’t feeling well/ are sick  - booze makes you sleepy- I’ll have a coffee/tea instead please   There are a million reasons not to drink,False,False

Plan the day after so you know you'll be back to losing weight afterwards that's what I do over christmas, enjoy the Christmas festivities then fast for like 3 days.  Also just going for a walk or having a bath always help me or cleaning. Cleaning is the best way to relax from over thinking. It also will kind of help you think things out since it's a mundane thing to do",False,False
