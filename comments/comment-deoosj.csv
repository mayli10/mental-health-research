Though it sounds like the overexercising was a large physical factor too. Eventually I ended up craving mainly sweet foods like OP, though with sugar AND fat (so chocolate or pastry breads were far preferable to gummies or sour candies, which I used to love), but yeah, seems like getting used to mainly sugar meant that reintroducing a larger percentage of savory foods satisfied me more easily",False,False

I mean I didn't HAVE to have carbs with everything, it was just preferable over fat although I think if I were low carb, I'd have a hard time adjusting since it was quick energy. Did you restrict carbs before? In recovery it's probably a case of ""wanting what you couldn't have before"" then, though in my case at first it was just gravitating toward for more calories for less volume in that short period of time I let myself eat after fasting",False,False

It's like a switch flips. Only thing that worked was to have a BMI of at least 18.

The body can be pretty smart about making sure you get what it needs by making it more appealing. For my entire life pre-ED, I've preferred higher carb foods over fat, even if only minimal, and with zero idea of calories and portions or any worry over weight. I didn't like the mouth feel of peanut butter or yogurt. Always chose tomato over alfredo sauce, and cashews over almonds. They just tasted...better (I was pretty active then too). When I started fasting and became underweight, I gravitated toward high-fat foods as well as acquiring a preference for sweet over savory foods (which are more filling). Guacamole and sour cream started tasting amazing. I'd somehow always choose the higher fat option before seeing the nutritional values. Creamy Alfredo sauce? I was salivating over it to the point where marinara became unsatisfying. And this was before I ever binged, so it's not like my body might have been already ""addicted"" to sugar and fat.  Honestly, I never really bothered fighting it, but years later I did find savory foods to quell it slightly only because I'm so used to eating sweet foods in reduced volumes and being nutritionally deficient that even the few vegetables and heartier meals doused in seasoning (like my bf basically pours garlic, garlic salt, garlic powder, and chili flakes onto fried rice) helped up my vitamin and mineral content and reduce the cravings somewhat :/",False,False
