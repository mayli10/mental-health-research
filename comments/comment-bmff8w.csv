Like, it almost sounds like the very problem OP is talking about: being told they don’t deserve something because of food.  It’s actually relatively easy to become deficient in any one of the *huge* array of micronutrients needed by the human body, especially if you aren’t eating a wide variety of foods or a diet tailored for this purpose. Vegans are advised to supplement B-12, for instance, because the most available sources of it come from animal products, and being deficient for long enough can permanently damage your nervous system or even kill you. The tannins in tea can inhibit calcium absorption, and calcium is crucial for, yes, bone health, but also heart function. So if OP is getting barely any they’re probably absorbing even less.  I’m not saying multis are perfect, but the more restrictive and imbalanced the diet, the more likely one is to be multiply deficient.",False,False
