Your lack of knowledge on exercise really baffles me. Please, PLEASE, do some research on your own. Livestrong has good info while keeping it basic.  *****  Any good exercise will replace fat with muscle, and though it weighs more, muscle just has a smoother and firmer appearance than fat. Skinny fat to me like a little spongy and it'll jiggle more. When you see someone walking and there is that nice ""line"" going down the sides of their leg - that's the muscle definition. Looks good, right? Look at K-pop stars and how great their legs look, and they are always dancing and exercising.   *****  (I'm not sure your weight, this is my experience and I'm not overweight so it would be different if you were)  Weight lifting raises your metabolism and keeps you burning calories longer, cardio burns more in the moment.  I used to lift weights, my legs and butt were thicker, but very ""toned"" I guess you could say. They were firm and solid, and my butt always perky and tight. But yes, I was bulkier, but at the time that's what I was going for so I ate a lot. You can eat at a deficit and lift weights and you will probably gain a more wiry look, though that would be hard on your body.  I can't lift anymore due to unrelated injury, so now I do more cardio. It does generally give me a more slim look and I would say makes my stomach look better than lifting did (though I didn't focus on my abs much in lifting).   Unfortunately, cardio doesn't give me as much satisfaction and as lifting did, and my butt never has been as amazing. I always felt absolutely destroyed after lifting, a really great feeling. Weirdly, my appetite was not high when lifting weights, while cardio makes me really hungry.",False,False

They really are only for defining your muscles more, and only slightly to make you look more toned. To get more muscle definition youâ€™d need to add more weight to your exercises - the more weight the bulkier the muscle, and I donâ€™t believe using only your body weight will get you any bigger. The comments under the videos probably came from people who also restricted their calories, cause just doing body weight exercises wonâ€™t really burn enough calories to actually slim down, only lifting heavy weights would increase muscle mass enough to have a noticeably higher bmr . Sorry this is long this is everything I know ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚",False,False
