I got a to-go cup of Raisin Bran (no milk) and started snacking, and my hubby said how unhealthy it was and I just put the container on the table and walked away. And then one time I got a turkey/cheese platter and he started going on about processed foods. Acting like that wasnâ€™t the only thing I was planning on eating at that time. And now I have to hate myself the rest of the day.",False,False

If I look back I think being hangry played a big role for me to be in this mindset. Tell him it's not his thing what and when you're eating. I surely needed to be put in my place from my bf at that time",False,False

My boyfriend also does intermittent fasting and talks about it way toooooo much. We finally got in a huge fight about it where I told him I donâ€™t think itâ€™s healthy that heâ€™s fasting, counting calories, and literally measuring his body fat with calipers.   He told me stop projecting lmao. Which is accurate I mean my brain just cannot understand how someone could be putting all this mental energy into measurements without it being disordered.   But basically we came to the conclusion that he needs to stop talking to me about his weight and calories. And so far so good with that new rule :)",False,False

My ex was aware of my eating disorder, at least some aspects of it, but was careless when it came to commenting on my eating.  We were trying to eat healthier together, which would usually trigger me and it was always a struggle. One day, after I had went without eating for the majority of it I decided to cook some dinner. Some dish with pasta in it. He came in to comment on how I would never lose weight if I eat like that, if I was serious I'd stay away from pasta and other carbs and just kept going. I left crying with the food still cooking on the stove. I'm pretty sure he ended up finishing cooking and eating it. It sucked.  I'm sorry you had to hear that from him. It's still important to eat and it doesn't hurt to tell him that just because something works for him doesn't mean it's for everyone.   And I'm sorry if this just seems like rambling.",False,False
