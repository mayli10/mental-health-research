It kind of makes me wish I was into guys because I'm taller than average for a girl, but sober me tried dating guys and I'm just not comfortable with them. I was still questioning when that happened and my first instinct when he came to dance with me was to tell him I'm not interested, but I decided to just let it happen and I'm glad I did because that was a fun night.",False,False
