I didn't interpret your post as you only valuing others based on physical attraction at all. Sometimes I don't understand how people can go to a subreddit about *a disorder* and then shame *disordered* thoughts. Like accusing an apple tree of growing apples.,False,False

Sometimes when I'm with him, especially if we're making eye-contact and I notice the way he looks at me, it's like everything melts away. I can even eat with him and feel completely relaxed. It's not until we split to go to work that I pull out my phone and feel the need to count and log the meals. Then there are the tiny little things that my brain manages to spin into cruel lies about him not being attracted to me, that he's going to see me for what I am and break up, that he's only with me because he thought I was cooler/prettier/nicer than I am, that he probably regrets everything now that he knows how fucked up I am, etc.   That old saying about how love can't fix a person seems to be correct, sadly.",False,False

Im absolutely not only dating my bf just because he‚Äôs attractive ‚Äî he is loving, caring and thoughtful with a great sense of humor and when I get those thoughts I mentioned, the thought of ‚Äúthey love each other and she is probably great for him‚Äù does often follow. It‚Äôs the first part of that process that‚Äôs frustrating and negative for me and that‚Äôs all I was focusing on with this",False,True
