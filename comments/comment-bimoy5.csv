I mean, I had a brief phase (no longer than three weeks) of binges (never more than \~2600 mind you, no purge and certainly not daily) -- but as I'm someone who personally has come to hate food (which I find is actually quite rare in the ED community, but ding ding orthorexia gold star over here), I quickly realised that I was only using the discomfort I experienced from consuming these 'unsafe' foods in such excess as an active cycle of self-harm, and that my inexplicable BED was merely means to scapegoat a petty problem that I knew I could easily solve (control over food) rather than confronting my real issues. It's worth mentioning that my hunger/fullness cues stopped when I was about eleven years old (for a reason I still do not know?) so when I was 11-13 I adopted BED behaviours out of sheer confusion... I no longer felt hunger, so I ate out of routine compulsion. And no longer fullness, which had previously functioned as my only cue to stop (based on what I'd been told my whole life) so I would just keep going until I felt sick. At that age, sickness *became* my fullness. It was an awful cycle that was nothing but pain, but I didn't know any better. Combine my desire to *never* feel that pain again with the militant weight-checking and meal-watching of the people around you once they discover your ED, and it's probably not all that surprising that food is nothing but a chore to me.      I'm not a common case, by any means, but I think it was my past experience with BED-type behaviours and my awareness of the *purpose* of the binges (as stated in paragraph one) that drove me away from it so clearly and quickly. I don't know if my personal (rather stupid and illogical) sob story is going to be of much help to you, but if you can get anything out of it... here's this: think about *why* you binged, I guess. And I mean *really* think. Some form of extreme hunger from the restriction, or is there something else going on? If it's the latter, then please try and sway yourself from it (and focus on the real problem) before it becomes too hard a habit to break. Restriction's bad enough -- you don't need the mental and physical strain of a BED cycle too, believe us all!      Sorry for talking (typing?) your ears (... eyes?) off... Hope you get something out of my rambles! And that by some extension of miracle, you're somehow better because of it... Good luck :)",False,False

I know logically that one binge (gargantuan though it may be) won’t make me gain. I don’t purge ever. I usually restrict. I’m afraid that eating this way tonight will trigger more binges. That’s why I’m so strict about my restriction. I either have control or I don’t, and tonight in my intoxicated state I just didn’t. I knew I was eating too much but I kept doing it. I’m not used to that kind of thing and I hate myself for it! I was wondering if any restrictive AN people ever lost control like this one day and then didn’t switch to binge eating regularly after?",False,True

Number one advice -- never trick yourself into thinking you can use that as an 'escape', it'll only breed even worse behaviour down the line :(     There is no one thing that works for everyone -- by God do we all wish there were! And I'm sorry if I sound generic, but *please do* remember that one binge isn't going to kill you. You'll feel sick and terrible, no doubt, but just because you did it once doesn't mean you've 'failed' and have to make a habit of it; it's through these petty justifications that people develop b/p in the first place! I know you feel awful, we've pm all been there (or at least can relate). But all I can suggest, I guess, lame as it might be, is that you take a breather. It's going to take a lot more than 3000 calories to manifest as actual, noticeable weight gain (and *certainly* if restriction (no b/p) is your routine) if that's something you're worried about... and there's no divine power in the universe that decrees that *must* happen again -- and even it does, there's no shame, the world still will turn.      It sucks, but you'll make it. :)",False,False
