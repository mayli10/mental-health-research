Now I don't have that type of self control or discipline :/",False,False

In highschool I ate like 5 Breton cra kers with cream cheese a day, sometimes I dabbled in the dinner my parents made. Gym 2+ hours after school every day and then yoga in my room.  Now, I'm old and need breakfast to function, I'm dying by lunch, then dinner and dessert at night, having a hard time cutting weight but trying to stay healthy and make sure I'm eating enough. When I see old pictures I recall how easy and effortless it seemed.",False,False

After refeeding following heavy restriction, I couldn't stop eating. I was always hungry. It was frustrating because initially, I gained some weight and my body held on to a lot of fat. I've been eating consistently now &gt;!(1500kcal+ daily)!&lt; and my weight has evened out. I've lost a few pounds from the refeeding process. But even in recovery, it's sometimes hard to not romanticize how you looked at a lower weight. I know I still felt like shit - much less confident than I am now, but I was objectively thinner.",False,True
