I eat three meals a day, with snacks. I feel full and satisfied after each meal. While, yes, I still have body image issues and a pressure to look a certain way, I never had a “goal weight” or desire to be as underweight as I am now.",False,True

ED brain tricks us into thinking that our unhealthy minds are correct and everyone else is just.. over eating, being normal and lazy, etc. Right? It seems like you are worried about your weight if you are actively doing things to be under weight- but I know what you mean. When I was underweight, it started without me even realizing. It was once I developed ""thin privelege"" that I got obsessed with staying that way. If you eat enough and feel energized through out the day than that's all that matters.",False,False
