I have two younger brothers so I was used to it but it was still shocking when I got married just how much $$$ my husband (so me now too lol) spends on food a day. He eats four full meals plus snacks a day and is inactive, and he's 33 now so this is even down from when he was younger lol. Even now, between him and my toddler we go through gallons of milk, loaves of bread, dozens of eggs, huge things of peanut butter, pounds of lunch meat in no time. I don't eat any of those things so it's not me. He doesn't have a sweet tooth, like most men I feel, and I could literally only eat sweets and be happy (but super queasy so I limit myself) so maybe it all evens out.  He's a big guy, his bmi I'm sure is overweight but he's definitely one of those people that you're like okay bmi is baloney haha, he'd look absolutely bizarre if he was in the ""normal"" range, not to mention he gets hangry haha.   Men burn calories much differently. It's why they think all the younger men in the dahmer party died first, they were expending huge amounts of calories but also need huge amounts as well.",False,False

Sometimes I think the metabolism of an average male lifting weights (2500-3500 cals) sounds pretty good because I can get to that amount with low volume sweets/pastries, but 5000? What a waste of time that would be on my day  At a TDEE of 1700 (active days, I'm short and underweight), I burn an average of 70 cals/hr, so 350 from 6 to 11 pm isn't bad. Your friend burns over 1000 cals in that time on average, maybe less if he settles in and doesn't move around much, but damn, that's basically a 2-day ""healthy weight loss"" deficit lol",False,False
