You just print the little chart and it has check mark boxes to track progress. It also has little pictures so you donâ€™t have your wtf face on the whole time :) I really like it! This is my first time really trying to workout. I usually just starve it off but trying a healthier approach! Good luck out there :) ,False,False

They give you a tour and show you how to work the equipment.  I keep it simple and walk the treadmill for an hour on an incline. Was about to burn 460 calories and not have to do anything too complicated. Ive seen all kinds of people at the gym. But I pay them no mind. We're all just there to get in shape. ,False,False

Weight machines have the pictures and instructions on them.   Ellipticals are a lot more gentle on ur shins and feet if a treadmill is too much. ,False,False

I know its daunting and I still havent gotten over this fear for myself. I want to do yoga and I used to really like this one class where I was the youngest person by like 30 years. Working out in a mirrored room with a bunch of thin women now just makes me cry.   Before my gym by my apartment closed there was even an overweight instructor. I was going 1-2 x per week and feeling better but sometimes it would trigger me to skip meals bc I felt more connected to my fat body. I think I'll go back when I lose 20lbs, even though I know if I went back now it would make losing easier. I'm a walking contradiction. ",False,False
