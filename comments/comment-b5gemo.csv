But this guy is known to sleep around like I said, so itâ€™s not like heâ€™s new to sex, or even sex with the girl. ",False,True

But it was just like, oh someoneâ€™s sexually interested in me? Sike!  Like I said I donâ€™t know what exactly the trouble was. But I think he was caught with either weed or alcoholâ€” his parents are very religious and conservative and him being associated with anything off the straight and narrow is a bad thing. Heâ€™s been caught before having sex with the aforementioned girl, and is a low key alcoholic.   I donâ€™t know. Iâ€™m not mad at him, or her, I just thought that if I were a bit lighter, if I had a smaller waist or bigger boobs or a more pretty face, theyâ€™d wanna risk it, you know?",False,True

If he seemed down to do it the first time, then seemed hesitant the second time and you didn't change or do anything bad to him, then it's probably on his end. Maybe he got self-conscious? But even if it is you then it shouldn't matter - people have preferences; it's impossible for absolutely everyone to have the same taste. (I hope this didn't sound rude?)",False,False
