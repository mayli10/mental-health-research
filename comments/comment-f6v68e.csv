I should have been getting support. It likely would have eased the suffering.   When I started eating again, the binges became harder to control and the weight was coming on. So I cycled from bingeing to Ana to b/p for a few years. It was super painful emotionally and physically.   Eventually I got comfortable with a higher weight than when I was restricting but less when I was bingeing. I think it‚Äôs my set point.   But even with a good year at that point, I fell off the wagon and the cycle started again. Eventually it died down again.   That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so important to have to support. There‚Äôs less chances of these cycles and you have support as you‚Äôre going through them.   Recovery is something we have to fight for everyday. Some days we won‚Äôt even need to think about it. Some days we need to give ourselves more self care.",False,False

Have been living with an ED for about 8 years. It was really hard, fun and relieving at first, to be able to eat whatever I wanted and let myself do that, but after a while I did gain weight and I did NOT like it. But that is part of the process. When your body is used to being in a deficit for so long, when you start to eat normally your brain is like ""ooh, finally some good f*cking food"" and goes ham on you. You might binge a lot. This is normal, but it goes away after a while. Remember that this is all temporary. Remember your goal to not have an ED, it will be worth it. My advice is to prepare to gain weight and be okay with it. Remember it's okay, it's part of the process, and it's not forever. Also at this time really get good at listening to the signals your body gives you. If you feel like having something salty, do that. If you feel like exercising, exercise. Think of it like water. Do you plan out how much water you're going to drink in the day? No, you just drink water when you're thirsty, and drink as much as you need to. Think of it kind of like that. I know it's really really hard but the sooner you get this part of the process over with, the faster you will recover. But you also have to take your time. The weight gain is the hardest part but one of the most important parts if you struggle with body image/dysmorphia like I do.",False,False

I just want to be thorough bc the process can be super rough. I‚Äôve had an ED for over 10 years, so recovery took a long time.   Seek support and help from local ED charities and clinics near you. Spend the extra on a really good psychologist or see if you can do a sliding scale. But the biggest thing is actually wanting the things from recovery more than wanting the things from the ED.   ‚ÄúAnd the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom.‚Äù  That quote helped me a lot. Someone told me that and I thought I got it. But I hadn‚Äôt. Then eventually I could feel that quote in me.   I want that connection with my friends again and with dating even if it meant eating out of my comfort zone. I want to be a healthy role model and the best aunt for my nieces and nephews. I don‚Äôt want to miss out on events with them due to binging and purging and feeling ‚Äúfat‚Äù. I want to get pregnant and have physically/mentally healthy children. I don‚Äôt want to pass this onto to them.   I didn‚Äôt use any support at first. I just thought I got into this alone and I‚Äôll get out alone. For years, I cycled through the bingeing/purging/restricting phase. Until those reasons I mentioned above become stronger and stronger. I went on some medication (lexapro and Wellbutrin) to help with my anxiety. I started seeing an amazing psychologist. It‚Äôs crazy expensive but worth every penny. Along with the CBT classes at the hospital.   I should also mention that the eating disorder became physically painful too. I stopped getting my periods. I started losing hair eventually. I purged so much by throwing up or taking laxatives that everything began to hurt my stomach eventually.   When I started eating regularly, not restricting and not purging, I‚Äôd always be afraid of gaining weight. Before I‚Äôd weigh myself, I‚Äôd guess a weight. Eventually, I found that magical set point that the doctors kept talking about. I felt l like I would have gained at least 3-5 lbs from all the eating but I had gained nothing or maybe 2 lbs that would go away in a few days. I know I‚Äôm not supposed to weigh myself often but I do it a few times a week and only really pay attention to the average weekly weight.  It helped me realize that when I starved myself, i would pack on weight much easier. My body really was in starvation mode and clinging onto anything I would feed it. So my weight would go bananas. But now I‚Äôm not and it doesn‚Äôt go bananas anymore.   I still don‚Äôt love my body. I‚Äôm not the happiest with it. But I wasn‚Äôt happy with it even at my lowest weight. Things aren‚Äôt perfect but I realized that it‚Äôs something I need to work on everyday and needing tune ups/refreshers is ok. It doesn‚Äôt need to be perfect.",False,False
