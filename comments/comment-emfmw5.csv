Since I save up my cals for dinner and I get home from work late my goal is volume, protein, and taste for as little cals.

I already feel like such shit for eating anything, so I'd better at least enjoy what I eat before I start hating myself. I almost never eat food that merely tastes okay, let alone food I dislike.   It blows my mind that normies will stand around, like, eating a crappy piece of cake or a bad pasta dish or something, while literally saying, ""Enh, this isn't good..."" They may even detail the things they don't like about the food. As they CONTINUE TO EAT IT. I mean, I don't like food waste either, but avoiding waste often doesn't even seem like to be their goal. It's more like the food is disappointing enough to complain about, but okay enough to keep eating, because it's still a hit of sugar/starch/whatever. This is weird af to me.",False,False
