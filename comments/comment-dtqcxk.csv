And he KNEW about your ED? I don’t know your boyfriend or relationship so that could just be a one time thing, but he sounds like an asshole. Being tired or cranky doesn’t mean it’s okay to take out your anger on the people you love. The fact that he targeted your ED to insult you is disgusting.",False,False

He doesn’t have to understand it but he should be trying to instead of assuming he knows what its like and being an ass about it. It’s easy to say the wrong thing to a person with an ed but he’s not even being supportive. I don’t think he thinks you’re a whale it didn’t sound like he was implying that he thinks you’re fat. It sounds like he was being a dick and trying to use his knowledge of your ed to hurt you which is just as bad :p. Sorry you had this experience. I hope the communication in your relationship improves (or if he’s generally unsupportive I hope you find the strength to dump him..).,False,False

I’m mainly recovered but the behaviours are still there time to time. The thoughts are there all the time. I don’t really like or want me my body. It’s better than being bigger but it’s not as good as when I was teeny tiny.,False,True

Like I was stupid to think I could be an extra small. And like I’d be lucky to even fit in a small or medium. It was like he belittled my intelligence about my size.,False,True

We have EDs here, but I find it hard to believe that you really think your bf sees you as a whale. So, by whale do you mean average? Does it bother you he doesn't see you a teny tiny?",False,False
