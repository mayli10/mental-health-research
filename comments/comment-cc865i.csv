Recovery has been going pretty well for me lately and I got back up to a healthy weight, but I've been staying at my dad's place for a few weeks and he owns a bathroom scale. I don't own one for exactly this reason; I have been constantly weighing myself and it makes me feel good when I see I've gone down a pound or two. I feel like it would be so easy for me to just let myself lose weight again, but I also don't want to deal with all the problems that being underweight causes. I've been making sure to at least eat whenever I feel hungry and trying to have normal amounts when I have dinner with my family. It's so tempting to just let myself go though.",False,False
