Back when we lived separately, I used to go back to my house specifically to restrict/fast because I didn't want to eat dinner. The fact that I would want to leave someone who is kind and treats me well just so that I could get deeper into my ED and depression is just idiotic. I say this all the time, but EDs are just stupid. But I can't help it :(",False,False

When I had a bf he was really supportive and he tried to help me even if it was a little detail. I would get mad (of course I wouldn't tell him, it was just my thinking) because he was helping me, he wanted me to get better and I felt so bad for thinking in the wrong way about him.  I can say that I am better now and it is sad, because I'm not with him anymore and I'm better that way. Before I started having these ED habits he made a comment about my appearance, he basically said that he didn't find me pretty anymore (we were not together at that time, we had broken up) and it took me so much to feel better with myself. Then we got together and I was way skinnier. I was honest with him and told him how was it when we weren't together, how I lost the weight, etc. He wanted me to get better and the time we were together I did not get healthier. His comment was just constantly on my mind and it was awful.  We recently broke up, my confidence went up, I'm starting to enjoy meals —even though I still have my hard times—, and I just started going to the gym.  Maybe you don't want to change your ways and it's so frustrating to have a person daily checking on you, I know that, but please be grateful too.",False,False
