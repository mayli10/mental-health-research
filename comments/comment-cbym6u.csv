It only makes sense for those things that are unhealthy or disordered. You shouldn't constantly avoid things that will be affect you in your everyday life just because it makes you uncomfortable. It only makes it worse.,False,False

I understand it in theory but I think people go a bit overboard with using/expecting them. If I’m on an ED forum, I expect to see talk about ED related stuff which yes includes numbers and behaviours. What’s “triggering” to me may not be to 90% of the rest of the community, and vice versa. So I guess I just don’t see the point.   (I do try to remember to use them in certain situations out of consideration for others, but I still just really don’t get it. I don’t want to upset anyone but I also don’t want to censor myself, and it feels pretty ridiculous to me when I do add a tw to things. Kind of feels like yelling at someone to look both ways before they cross the street— stating the obvious and kind of condescending.)",False,False

I’m not actively avoiding anything so I’m more like ‘oooo TW numbers? let’s go!’   I imagine that if I was legit trying to better myself and not keep losing weight I would avoid the TW. I’m glad we have them here because I’m sure a lot of people need support but don’t want to read about self harm/other people engaging in the behaviors they are trying to avoid.   REAL TALK I wish there was a TW for allll the food on my other account. Everything looks so delicious and it LEGIT triggers me. But I switch accounts depending on my mood and what I think I can handle.,False,False
