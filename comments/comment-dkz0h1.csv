This is what happens when you replace restriction with heavy drinking as your self destructive behavior of choice.   Plot twist:  family thinks I’m doing a Sober October but it’s actually a Don’t Fucking Eat October,False,False

For as long as I haven't been counting calories, I've been trying to get back into that mindframe. It's not fucking happening.  My lw was 117lbs, after losing a couple of lbs I'm currently at 147lbs.  I'm PISSED.  It's so hard to go back to calorie counting after so much time of not doing it. I don't know how to get back into the habit because every time I lose 3lbs I gain 6lbs. I'm going out of my fucking mind.  FUCK.",False,False

I went through the same thing and here I am- a relapsed once happy girl who wasn't so scared of food and starving myself. As the comment above said start trading junk food for more nutrient dense foods like fruits and veggies. Did you have obsessive issues with exercise? If not then incorporating some more walking or a quick HIIT session would help as well.,False,False
