Point is, some people maintain on 1200 calories a day, some people lose weight on 1200 calories, some people could end up in a hospital on 1200 calories a day.   Those Youtube comments are not nice, unless they know that specific peron's stats and lifestyle, they have no right to imply/assume they have an eating disorder or suffer from disordered eating. Especially since this is only an experiment.  You could take this chance and educate people on this matter.",False,False

Just because you might high restrict at under 1,000 calories and believe that is somehow a personality trait, really is not evidence to support the fact that 1,200 is ‚Äòplenty‚Äô of calories for most women.   Maybe just try to check your attitude a little because this is the kind of shit that makes people say ‚ÄúYour ED makes you judgemental of other people‚Äù, while everybody here loves to proclaim that‚Äôs ~soOoOoo~ not the case sweaty and we‚Äôre all only ~jUdgMenTaL oF oUr oWN bOdiEs~, it‚Äôs not a good look.  1,200 is not the magic number, it‚Äôs simply low enough that almost anybody will lose weight eating this much - it doesn‚Äôt mean this is a *sustainable* nor healthy caloric intake for most young women. Even people who‚Äôs BMR is 1,200 still need more than that to function or maintain a healthy weight as the BMR is literally a base level of energy required for normal bodily functions.

And while it‚Äôs true plenty of people with restrictive EDs eat less than 1200/day, most people will lose weight at that intake level.
