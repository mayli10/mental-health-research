Every gross thing I've done, other people have done, and the amount of shame I feel in general is moderated a lot by knowing that and being able to talk about it.  No other community talks about the pants-shitting, garbage-eating side of EDs.",False,False

Everyone has multiple coping mechanisms, bad and good. One thing that pretty much everyone can relate to is having used a not so great tool at one point or another to cope with some serious stress, pain, etc. whether it‚Äôs an ed, smoking, alcohol, too much netflix, whatever.
