Like I shouldn’t be maintaining at this activity and intake level. Do you think eventually I would start losing again?",False,True

What is most likely happening is you are gaining water weight from increasing your carbs and rapid weight gain is common when adding any amount of calories after restricting so low (especially for so long).  You’re eating a healthy amount of calories so I would stick with it. Stay at 1500 until you start maintaining and then add 50 calories a week. Eventually you will probably be able to eat 1800-2000 calories / day while staying within 3-5 pounds of where you are now.   This is a bit confusing but it’s not fat you’re gaining, it’s water weight and your body WILL even out.",False,False
