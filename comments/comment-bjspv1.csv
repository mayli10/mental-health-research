That'll only make it an anxious endeavour for you.  Find an exercise you love and do it because you love it. Something where you think, ""even if I knew this wouldn't change my body, I would do it.""",False,False

I can't do a lot of super intense stuff because of my fibromyalgia, so I try to do 10,000 steps per day because I know I can USUALLY handle walking. But some days I can't even do that, and I certainly couldn't do that in the beginning!  When I was trying to go out and walk more, I started with 2500 steps per day and went up as my body became used to it. Same goes for the exercises I can do on good pain days - like pilates and weight lifting at home. I'd start with 3 minutes of pilates, and 2 sets of 10 reps for whatever weight training exercise I was doing that day. Again, starting small and gradually working your way up is the important thing.  Think of the type of exercise you want to do, and take a slow and patient approach to getting back into it.  And remember: if there are days when you can't do something because of your pain, that's okay! Don't beat yourself up. It's better to take a break or a day off when necessary to make sure you don't overexert yourself and cause more pain in the process. ðŸ’—",False,False
