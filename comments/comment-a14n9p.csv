You can diagnose a junkie with their addiction (and they'll definitely know themselves)  but you really can't get them to stop until they truly make the choice.    It's like sure I fear out of control binges and the health damage that comes with it. Same with purging / nutritional deficiencies that come with extended restricting...  But I fear being fat more and whilst I try my hardest to not binge, for me to get help I'd have to stop restricting / purging. I really hope one day but for now I'm just too fat to consider maintence..    I don't think I'll ever have a healthy relationship with food either. There's no nutritional value to certain foods I enjoy and so no matter what there will always be bad and good foods. ",False,False

Last March when I had a lump looked at the doctor got a little too questionable about my weight loss and that I shouldn't loose more. Very awkward.
