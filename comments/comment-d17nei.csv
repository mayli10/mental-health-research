I've tried everything, too, and nothing has worked. I use an app called ""habits"", have been for 3 months now. I track when I binge so I can hopefully notice trends but all I notice is the binges getting more frequent.  Next time I get a binge urge I will say no, sit on my hands and stick with it and I will come back to this post for motivation.",False,False

The binges are getting worse. I need to sort my shit out because I KNOW that if I gain to an overweight BMI I will probably kill myself tbh.   I'm so proud of you, I can't imagine how hard going 10 days has been! What's your secret lol",False,False
