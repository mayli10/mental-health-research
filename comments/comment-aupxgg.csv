They swallowed me. To be fair, the last time she had seen me I was a size 22 in plus size Jean's, so I would have been skeptical, too.",False,False

I wear a size 6.5-7 and my mom thinks I'm a size 8 even though I've told her multiple times that I'm not. So for a lot of high school my feet were just sliding around enormous shoes. I think it's because she wants to think her feet are smaller than mine.,False,False

Sometimes the 14+. But the smallest in the Men's section will always be so long and the proportions are way off.

Even if the medium is too big, it's like they have a hard time picking up a small for some reason. Might be because I was super chubby as a kid, though. ",False,False
