I’m horrible at taking pills but I could add the powdered stuff to my oatmeal or similar foods. Maybe I’ll try this first for a week and see how it goes, but I’ll keep the laxative plan for when I’m really uncomfortable. Thank you!!",False,True

It adds ""bulk"" to waste so it's physically easier to... evacuate it. But it's negligible calorie wise (maybe it's like an extra 2 calories a day lol) and you won't develop a tolerance to it or anything so you should be able to use it indefinitely. it also has a slight stomach-filling effect and can help with hunger.",False,False
