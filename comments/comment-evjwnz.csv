My stomach is too strong on hangover mornings. And right? I woke up out of a blackout to find myself trying to order Dominoâ€™s even though Iâ€™m in the middle of nowhere ðŸ˜‚",False,True

Booze makes me binge, which sucks.   I try to save alcohol for special occasions. The weight gain that initially triggered my ED was a result of binge drinking for like a year (like 3+ drinks a day), so I have to be very cautious.",False,False

I'm a fan of dry red wine but that's a little calorie heavy since been opting for prosecco lately... I wish I could just stop drinking. I've had only one meal in 3 days but I'm sure I'm gaining because I've finished four bottle of wine in that same time.,False,False

I feel better the next day too. I've been smoking consistently for long enough that I don't really get the munchies, but the drunchies are a beast.  When I drink I go for spiked seltzer, diet Coke with rum or whiskey, wine, or some basic lager like PBR or Narragansett. Light beer is vile imo. Twisted Tea makes a light version that I want to try... I love twisteas but they're so calorific",False,False

I also have the lovely habit of not eating much before I go out to avoid feeling bloated and then I get drunk for less money AND calories! Truly a win win :')  And in terms of the hangover munchies I don't count them because if I'm that hungover, which I usually am, I'll probably end up puking back up anything that i can manage to get down :)  I usually struggle more with the drunchies than the hangover munchies tbh. I went through a phase where I would black and then wake up surrounded by $30 worth of chicken tikka masala that I door dashed to myself at 3 am hahahaha",False,False
