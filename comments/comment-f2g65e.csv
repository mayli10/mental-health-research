I have to hit you with some hard facts tho. Just because you fail at something or lose something important to you does not mean you're good enough. You are good enough.   It can be hard to believe, but really such thoughts as ""I am worthless"" come from perfectionism. Being perfect is an impossible standard to live by. We are all human. Of course things can go wrong with us or something we love, but it does not mean we're not good enough. You defeat yourself with inappropriate goals and standards. If you settle for nothing short of a magnificent performance in anything you do, frequently you have to settle for nothing.   Most people find the loss of livelyhood incapacitating because of the widespread assumption that individual worth and one's capacity for happiness are directly linked with professional success. But you are not worthless. Would you say that to a friend if they lost their job? Of course not! You have probably achieved lots of things in your life that overshadows this one blow. Don't let it define you. Do not give in to all or nothing thinking. Maybe you could have done more, but at least you did something! Now you can let that experience define you or you can learn from it, move on and go on with your life just a tiny bit stronger.  Lots of hugs to you. Let out your feelings, cry if you must, but don't let this experience bring you down too much! ðŸ¥°",False,False
