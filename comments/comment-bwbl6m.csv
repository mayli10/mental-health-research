Literally the only people who are so supportive, caring and understanding are the people on this sub. All the other support type subreddits I've always had bad experiences with.  Honestly this helps you so much and it means a lot to me for someone to take the time out of their day and care.",False,True

It seems you're in a bad place mentally and I know exactly how it feels and wanting to hide your ED away, as well as crying a lot and feeling alone (yay, depression).  Your teacher might just be sensing you're not happy and trying to help.   If you want someone to listen to you and help you, speaking to your teacher could be a good way of getting support.  My advice is don't be ashamed. You'll be surprised how understanding and helpful people can be.   If you don't want support, then there's no need to worry, you aren't obligated to do anything, and perhaps your teacher was just asking, but I hope whatever you choose leads you to a happier place ðŸ’œ",False,False
