I realized recently that I’ve NEVER just stopped eating when I was full (been a little fat since forever), so it’s especially hard to figure it out now that I’ve gone through all of my disordered nonsense.   I’ve found that scheduling my eating, eating less calorically dense food (fruits and veggies, whole grains, that kinda stuff) and finishing each meal/snack with a glass of water has sorta helped me (but make sure to get some protein/fat for satiety too). Thing is, binge eating for me is a lifelong ingrained habit, so it’s been taking me a looooong time to get rid of that habit.   The good news is that the changes are slowly becoming permanent. I used to binge multiple times a week, now I go multiple weeks between binges. So I guess what I’m saying is recovery is NOT impossible, it’s just hard, and it takes a long time. Your willpower is a muscle, and as you train it it’ll become easier to straight up ignore the binge impulses that come, and they *always* pass. Sometimes you have to sit there acknowledging it for a long time but if you don’t act on it it *will* go away.
