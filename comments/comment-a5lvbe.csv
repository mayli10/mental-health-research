I did it for the purging high. It felt so satisfying too. Having physical results of this good awful disorder right at your fingertips. Now like others I don’t even think about forcing it. I’m good at it and it’s the one talent that I could never put on a resume. But the worst part is now it’s almost an unconscious reaction so while I am back to heavy restriction, I have to catch myself and remember not to purge just because you feel slightly full.",False,False

This is why it’s so hard to stop (for me at least). I don’t care about the eating. I care about the purging. It’s so strange to me that people think self-induced vomiting is gross.   I mean, I get in a non-eating disordered mind it is, I guess. Just not in mine. It’s like self-harm- there’s nothing weird about drawing my own blood?   Damn if I could do one thing I think I would go back and never purge that first time. Ruined my life. ",False,False
