Try tums or Gas-x pills for gas bloating. Tea with ginger and turmeric might help your stomach feel better (and help ease the food down). Drink warm water not cold, if possible. Idk if this will help, but in Korea if we have stomach pains we press squeeze the flesh of our left or right hand in between the thumb and forefinger until it hurts. The pressure on your hand is supposed to relieve pressure in the stomach.  I hope you feel better soon, swim meets are stressful enough without a block of pain in your tummy ðŸ˜­",False,False
