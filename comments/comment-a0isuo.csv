I have a lot of shitty health habits and I’m in full on restrict mode, but I don’t fast because it makes me crazy and I don’t EC stack.  I eat nutritionally dense foods. Lots of veggies (fiber is your friend!), a bit of grain, various sources of protein (animal &amp; plant). I also supplement my electrolytes.  Most recently I’m trying to kick diet soda and stick to tea and sparkling water. It helps a lot.  Yoga practice also keeps me on track and stabilizes my mood / contributes to my overall mental health.  Again, I am by no means a paragon of healthy weight loss but I’m trying to be less awful to myself this time around.",False,False
