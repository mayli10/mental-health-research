It's even more weird for her to not stop the moment she realized you were uncomfortable. She doesn't need to understand you to be able to respect you.,False,False

What I ask the people around me (who are aware of my issues) to do is to not comment about food or weight in any way. They never know what can be upsetting to me so it is easiest if they avoid the topic completely. Maybe this could work for your mom? No asking if I want food, commenting in what I am eating, telling me I look too thin or healthy. Nothing.",False,False

And thank you for your concern, but we were both just really upset and hurt for different reasons, and I guess we both reacted pretty poorly  I love her to death and she’s my favorite person on earth but we don’t know how to argue or disagree effectively without both taking it personally and getting mad and hurt, which I think is our main problem that we both need to work on (which is more info than you asked for lol but helps explain the situation a bit)  Thank you for talking to me though!",False,True

So it would seem illogical for your mom for that exchange to move you to tears. It does appear she is severely lacking in empathy tho, is she not aware of your eating disorder?
