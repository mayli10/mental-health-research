(The ones that are nice, and actually talk to people).  I mean, you serve kids/adults food for a living. They see how people behave around food, little reactions that even the person isn’t aware of. Maybe this person doesn’t like this, this person always gets an extra apple, this person doesn’t get anything “unhealthy”. They’re surprisingly observant.   I’ve had a high school lunch lady do something similar when I hit ED rock bottom a couple years ago. I only ate fruit, usually a clementine or grapes for lunch. One day I was running late and forgot to bring something, so I went in line to get some food. The lady said “we have some fruit over there if you want it, I always see you bring fruit”. It was kind of sweet, I never really got in line to get food but she still noticed me as the awkward sick girl who only ate an orange for lunch.",False,False
