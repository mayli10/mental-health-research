I was never a good competitive swimmer, but I swam enough to have muscle and be skinny (a.k.a. no tricep jiggles). That was also 5 years ago and I still can't let go of it hahaaaa",False,False

My girlfriend lost a ton of weight from keto and is super slender and has the most perfect flat stomach I've ever seen. Shes always complaining that her stomach is huge. Mean while, I'm over here with a size 38 waist from having type one diabetes and gaining tons of weight from recovery. What's even worse is I see her developing disordered eating habits that I had, and now mine are coming back. I'm pretty certain it's happening to her now and I dont know how to stop it because it's making me spiral with her..",False,False

Nothings hurts more than when they'd tell me about their cut cycles working out just fine, when it's all restriction that I can't manage to do - even now. They talk about cutting, and I just kinda sit and say ""yeah that's what a lot of people with EDs do."" It's so strange how some of them manage to have a healthy relationship with food.  I also know people that walked out of sports with ED's, but the healthy friends baffle me. You mean you don't continue your detrimental diet/mindset outside of the sport??? I just can't imagine living a life happy with food after going through competitions like that.",False,False
