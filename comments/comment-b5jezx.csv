IMO, op is probably pretty close to done growing height-wise. I would guess that the 95 number would be ok only for someone who just went through a big growth spurt and is waiting for their weight to ‚Äúcatch up.‚Äù Personally, I‚Äôm also 5‚Äô7‚Äù and my growth plates were basically completely fused when I was 12 (ugh).",False,False

It's not unreasonable to assume that a girl of her height may have peaked early and be mostly done growing. I wouldn't assume that she's completely done with things like breast growth or hip growth at that age, though that kind of makes me lean more towards saying 95 lbs is probably too low for her. She might otherwise be able to stay healthy at that weight, but it might impact her development in other ways. And of course that includes mentally. The human brain tends to stop growing around the age of 25, though some studies have witnessed brain growth occurring in participants all the way to 30. 95 lbs is about 25 lbs below what is considered the minimum healthy weight for adults at 5'7"" and that's a huge difference. I would think it's pretty uncommon that for a doctor to conclude that a child of that BMI is completely healthy. At least if they were being thorough.",False,False

It's important for children and teens to have a higher body fat percentage. Personally as a teen I didn't eat enough and my health was awful. It's not something you would want to go through. I'm not sure that I was even underweight back then. I just had very little body fat. In my experience it seems to not be as much of a problem as an adult to be underweight, but it's still terrible. I get migraines constantly, I've wrecked my digestive health so I'm constantly dealing with abdominal pain and bloating, and I get sick all the time which likely means my immune system is suppressed by poor nutrition. And yet despite all of this I was still worse off as a teen. You're already at a pretty low weight for someone of your height, especially for someone at your age. If you can you should try to figure out why you feel the need to lose more weight and challenge that every time you feel like restricting. It's a lot of work, but if your ED isn't too bad yet you don't want it to get worse. It's absolutely normal for teens to eat a lot and if you don't try to suppress that you'll be better off as an adult for it.",False,False

My two best friends are rail thin naturally and are consistently underweight to the point where it looks unhealthy but it is their ‚Äònormal‚Äô and they aren‚Äôt starving themselves. But I‚Äôve never understood bc usually we eat the same things when we‚Äôre out together and they both love food so I‚Äôve always been like how ???   Well recently went on a two week long hiking trip w them and THEY NEVER FUCKING EAT. Like they didn‚Äôt even get hungry until 8 pm and I‚Äôm just like ???? I mean ok I guess we aren‚Äôt eating then ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  But that was the first time I actually realized that they just don‚Äôt have very large appetites. They‚Äôre also shorter than me by several inches and are sedentary for the most part so their caloric needs are much lower, which is another reason they don‚Äôt get very hungry.   But please, my ED started exactly when I was 13 and 13 years later I still have it and it‚Äôs ruined so many things in my life and is completely derailing it now. You are going to change so much over the next 10 years and I know being a teenager is honestly the worst and most anxiety provoking thing in the world, but it‚Äôs so important to establish healthy habits now.

The exception to that is really between people of the same age but at different points in their physical development while in adolescence. Like at your age.

I know it's hard, but I hope you can find some love for yourself and your body right now. It's so important that you stay in your healthy weight range while you're growing.
