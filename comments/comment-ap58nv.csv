I have a naturally skinny upper body but large bottom, I’ve always been told I have a “nice shape” or look “fit and healthy” but I just don’t like how sexualized that sounds. I rather have a more fashion-sequel physique with thin legs too.  I really have no idea how to lose leg muscle because cutting calories all over. It’s definitely harder than losing fat.",False,True

I’ve been active my whole life and have been going to the gym since I was 12. I could never figure out why my thighs were so huge compared to the rest of me. My upper body could look so tiny and dainty and my legs always looked like the Hulk. Finally it dawned on me—all my favorite machines (stair climber, treadmill, elliptical) build leg muscle. I used other machines targeting arms and back but not NEARLY as much. Now I’ve stopped working out after 13 years of going to the gym and my thighs are finally shrinking. I’m torn because I feel less healthy—I loved being “fit” and strong and improving my mile time. But I’ve never had tiny thighs even though I’ve been underweight for a lot of my life and I think that’s my goal for right now. ",False,False

I want to be the best ballet dancer I can be, which requires me to build strong legs. But I also want to be thin. My boyfriend doesn't know about my eating disorder, but I talk with him about needing to build stronger thighs. He will grab my thighs sometimes when we're making out and say things like ""there's so much muscle here! You're getting so strong!"" and he laughs while he says it, but I'll pretend to be flattered and say ""really? do you mean it?"" and he'll say something like, ""yeah, they're positively massive! Quads for days,"" while still laughing and I'll pretend to be disappointed that he doesn't really think my thighs are bigger but inside I'm like ""thank _fuck_ he's just joking"". ",False,False

As a 90’s child I dream of fitting into the ‘Heroine chic’ look. Like I know that fashion fad moved on, but something about how thin and whispy and badass and also elegant those models looked back then.    That’s all I want but I’ll never have it In this  body, legs are too thick and my shoulders are too broad plus the whole being a fatass.   I just wanna be thin too. ",False,False
