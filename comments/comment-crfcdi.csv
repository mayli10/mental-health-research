The skinny girls who would make fun of me were watching as the coaches made me stick my arms behind my back and try to touch my fingers together. I saw them watching me to see me fail and laugh. When the lady came by to see if I could do it I just said ""I cant"" she asked me to do it for her and show her. I told her ""I can't, you think I actually can?"" (I was morbidly obese) she forced me to do it and wouldn't just trust me even though its obvious I couldn't. When I turned around after failing like I knew I would, they were laughing hysterically. I left to cry in the bathroom.  Guess who's fingers touch now, bitches",False,False
