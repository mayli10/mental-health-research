I guess with cooking I‚Äôve had to accept that I‚Äôm just not skilled at it, and no amount of reading recipes will make me skilled at it. So if I cook a meal for my family and it comes out shit... ‚Äúahaha sorry guys! I‚Äôm still practicing!‚Äù  It‚Äôs been like... 3-4 years since I‚Äôve started making eggs for myself. I can finally crack an egg with one hand! But I still burn them sometimes. *eggs*.   I guess we can‚Äôt be good at everything... ",False,False

Once I forgot to adjust someone's schedule and the building didn't open on time because of my mistake. I was expecting to be deservedly chewed out. When I went to face my boss I started to tear up while apologising. She was usually an extreme hard ass who would make you analyze your mistakes out loud so you wouldn't make it again. She smiled and said it's okay, we all make mistakes. Go calm down and we can talk about it another time. There was no crazy talk later, she knew it was an honest mistake and all was forgiven.",False,False

Super proud of you.   If you want an example, last week i went out drinking, and drank a lot of beer. I got drunk of course and did some dumb things, i late found out that i was the only one who got worried because of it. The others simply did not care that much. ",False,False

I am always so self-conscious at work and terrified of screwing up!   One time I went to my boss with a mistake I made and said ""I uncovered a disaster!""
