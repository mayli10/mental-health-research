When I met my BF I was quite underweight and not eating much. But my relationship seemed so so promising that I didn’t want to mess it up for anything so I decided to eat more and more and figured it was time to actually recover. I gained 20 pounds which I “needed”. But it wasn’t long until I regretted it. But I haven’t managed to lose much yet because I’m so scared of my BF being hurt by all this. Whenever I saw I feel too big he tells me how good I look and how I looked like I was sickly before. I feel like I can’t win. Lose weight and hurt my relationship. Or stay healthy weight and hate it.,False,False

My boyfriend believed the same from the beginning.. he kept complimenting my body and telling me he’d prefer “a little more meat.” I felt so guilty I listened to him, gained weight, and now the compliments stopped.   I also now have difficulty regulating how much I eat. I really can’t tell if I eat too much or a normal amount. I didn’t know that forcing yourself or someone to “recover” can just throw them on the other end.   I struggle to not be upset and frustrated with him. I can’t help but feel like it was his fault. He’s the one who made me think it was okay to eat, to gain weight, etc., and now look at me. I actually am fat. I actually am overweight. And worst of all, he’s stopped complimenting me too.   So now I’m struggling to get back to how I used to be. I’ve learned to not listen to anyone else. And it saddens me because I know that’s just throwing me down the more disordered thinking (both for eating and for mental health in general).   It’s an internal battle between blaming my boyfriend and blaming myself for not having the willpower to ignore my boyfriend.",False,False

Now I’m overweight and struggling with the consequences of letting myself listen to him.  It also doesn’t help that I spend some time over there and there’s not much food in the fridge, so he orders unhealthy fast food. The foods he does have are stuff in cans that are really unhealthy.   He’s an overall unhealthy person and I’m having to deal with the consequences of being unable to properly prepare for my stay over. (Because then he’ll want some of my food and I can’t afford or bring enough over for him, then we’ll run out and he goes back to buying unhealthy food.)",False,False

Way easier to restrict when I know someone’s going to be taking my clothes off.  I totally relate though because “i lOvE GuRLz wHo nO hoW 2 eAt,” amiright? It can be hard to take a stand on food.",False,False
