I went on a vacation a last weeks and before I left, I was 108. Came back and weighed 112. It didn't matter when I weighed myself, night or day, it would not drop. I tried to be logical with myself because there is no way i gained 4 pounds in 6 days. Maybe 2 max  And then this week I was retaining water like crazy! scale hardly moved at all and I was freaking out that it was legit weight gain but today it finally dropped two pounds so I'm hoping if I keep restricting and chugging water it will go down to where it was by the end of the week.",False,False

I'd say I'm usually 7 pounds heavier right before bed. If I eat too much sodium, I've seen it go up by 12 pounds. ",False,False
