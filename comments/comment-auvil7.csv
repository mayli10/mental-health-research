When I restrict, i become *delusionally* optimistic about my life in general, I think I’m pretty(ish), I look forward with great excitement to reaching my goal weight and finally being attractive. Then l binge (like, every third day lol) and suddenly I’m convinced I look like I’ve ballooned, I can’t stand the sight of myself, I feel like the lowest piece of shit, and I’m just irritable and defeated. And even though as I’m thinking these things I understand that these thoughts are literally 24 hours apart, I’m still convinced the way I feel is absolutely based in fact and 100% true. It really does feel bipolar lol",False,False

(During my binge cycle, I feel so bloated and sluggish and hate my body and hate that I gain. During restriction, I feel a little more energetic for a little while, and still hate my body lol but I focus on ""I'm getting close to my GW, not farther! Woo!"") (I by no means meant to imply that restricting is a good change lol)",False,False
