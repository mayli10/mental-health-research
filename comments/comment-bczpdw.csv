The stress of going into a weekend thinking about all times I might have to avoid eating and then it being the weekend and unplanned eating being thrust into my plans is just so much worse than accepting that I will end up eating. I think acceptance of it actually helps me eat less overall on weekends, because i don't end up stress binging from trying so hard to get out of eating.",False,False

I get up and go to work first and she knows I don’t often eat breakfast anyway. We’re both at work for lunch, so I don’t eat. And then in the evening we often eat separately (and I will engineer situations as much as possible to make sure I’m ‘eating’ before she gets home, then just leave food for her).
