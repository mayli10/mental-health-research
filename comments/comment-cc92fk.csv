This happened several years ago now but I still shrivel up and want to die when I think about it. It sucks because in a twisted way, it validated my ED brain thinking that I need to keep losing because I look bigger than the numbers.",False,False

I know you're not a woman, but one example is that many men think that all women weigh 120 lbs. Besides, his guess of your weight might not even have been a serious attempt at an estimate—he could've just been throwing out a number without thinking much. I also noticed you're shorter than average for a man—perhaps this guy is taller and picked a number closer to what he'd guess for someone of his height. So, just because he estimated your weight wrong doesn't necessarily mean you look fat.  And yes, you are correct in that you didn't eat a lot. If you eat 800 calories every day, that's actually quite low for someone's daily intake. you DON'T need to cut the number of eggs just because of what ""normal people"" do.  Many people do not do OMAD or they don't like eggs and get their protein elsewhere so saying that it's a lot of eggs maybe is just because he doesn't do OMAD and/or he does not like eggs as much. It is as if I really like black so I own lots of black clothes and someone says ""That much??"" after I talk about all the black clothing I own. Doesn't mean that I have a lot of clothing in general! Just that I have lots more black clothing than usually people do.",False,False
