The place I'm going has a large variety of tropical fruit available so I'll eat a lot of that. I guess I'm most worried about dinner time... My friend is Chinese and I'll probably get offered rice at some point üò£ (over 1 cup and it's a fear food). I'll try and keep busy during the day like you said, so if I do eat some rice I won't panic so much ",False,True

I recently went travelling and had to travel light too, I couldn‚Äôt bring my scale or anything. What might help is to find foods that you can use to make meals you can usually make easily at home, it‚Äôll help ease you into the new environment!   Ie, one of my easy safe meals is a wrap with some avocado and laughing cow cheese. It doesn‚Äôt require too much prep and even if the brands are different, I‚Äôll know realistically the calories won‚Äôt differ too drastically!   One thing that helped was also to keep busy! I had clear plans made for every day that I was travelling so I focused my energy on following my itinerary instead of stressing about food, it helped ease my worries a lot!  Last thing, remember that one trip where you indulge a bit more will not make a significant impact! I know it‚Äôs easier said than done (I struggle with this too), but it‚Äôs true and can be something of a mantra whenever you find yourself beginning to get anxious ‚ò∫Ô∏è",False,False
