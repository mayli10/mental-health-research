However, what I can say is that there are SUPERIOR sources of fat that would be more beneficial to you.  Of course, ideally, what I would tell a patient would be to add something like walnuts to their diet without eliminating the fats in the meats they are already eating. However, Iâ€™m giving you advice as a fellow ED patient. I know that Calories are limited for us by our brains, so in order to get the best bang for your buck nutritionally, it would be best to replace the fats. It would be essentially replacing a 6/10-level fat with like a 9/10-level fat.  EDIT: Some people take this to the extreme and ONLY eat nuts, which is also bad. Continue getting some fats from meats too :)",False,False

It can perhaps help a little bit, but it 100% will not fix malnutrition.
