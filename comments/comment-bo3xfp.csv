What a sweet gesture, itâ€™s probably so tough to be conflicted in this way. A normal steamed shrimp is only like 7-10 calories AFAIK so treat yourself if you can.",False,False

If you feel like you don't deserve a gift, then revel in that gift.  Fuck that inner critic telling you that you aren't worthy of it.    Also, those shrimps aren't going to reanimate themselves and hop back into the ocean.  May as well enjoy them, allow yourself to feel deserving, and give your gf the important message that she is allowed to care for the person that she loves.  It's hard, but you might end up benefiting from swallowing this, metaphorically and literally???  Do a shrimp cocktail OMAD, maybe??  If you don't eat too much of the sauce, they're pretty low in calories!",False,False
