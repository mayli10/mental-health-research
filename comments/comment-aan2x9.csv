The black and white thinking of EDs often affects purging too: it's easy to forget that purging once every day is still a big improvement and only half as harmful as purging twice a day. Purging every meal for two weeks causes more damage than purging once every week for a year.",False,True

I think I read from someone on /proED who had successfully broken the dependence, and it's helped me a lot:  - commit to not purging just one meal a day, it doesn't matter which one; for me, I started with snacks because it was the smallest and easiest to start with - keep that up for a while until you feel confident that you can always eat that meal and not *have* to purge after - move to another meal, while still not purging after that first one - repeat, until you're consistently not purging multiple times a day, and eventually you'll get down to only a few times a week, to a few times a month, to very very seldom - remind yourself that it's okay to overeat, eat fear foods, or binge, and to not follow it up with purging: that habit is far worse and far deadlier for you than any single day or week or even month of overeating, or any amount of weight gain - slipping up is okay; it's a really hard habit to break and it will take a while, probably with lots of mistakes and lapses along the way. The important thing is to not move backwards: even staying still is progress.   I'm not all the way there yet but I've reduced my purging from several times a day to only a couple times a month.   Sorry if you weren't looking for advice! Hopefully this helps you or someone else who needs it, if you or they want. I hope you're doing okay today ðŸ’—",False,False

When I actually do plan on eating I struggle to actually keep food down and or even not feel nauseous. My stomach just rejects food now and it's gross and painful.,False,False
