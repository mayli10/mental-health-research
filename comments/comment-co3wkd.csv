Small town doctors do suck.   I told mine about a it a few weeks ago because of some heart palpitations I wanted to get checked. She told me I was fine and hadn’t done any damage at all. Also told me I should lose a few pounds since I was up a few since my last visit (binge/purge cycle from hell). And that I exercise more because apparently my current 2-3 hours of cardio a day must not be enough. When I told her I compulsively exercised and it related to my ED she told me you can never exercise enough. And then some horseshit about cutting the cord and simply not doing this stuff anymore.   See her again this week to follow through on more testing for the heart thing and really not looking forward to it.,False,False

People only come to work here for experience to go back to the cities. At best we have ten doctors at a time. I do plan on looking into a different doctor while I am in post secondary in a few weeks though.,False,True

I’ve lived in a small town for about 7 years and all the doctors suck and there are like 10 options unless you wanna drive 30+ min.   I went to a doc about my hair loss and how it’s prolly about my weight loss and he said it’s okay and hair goes through cycles of grows and loss and to come back if I get bald patches. Didn’t care that I I’ve lost 25 lbs in 4 months.,False,False
