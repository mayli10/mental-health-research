I'd sit down after a whole day of just coffee and tea and could happily feast on 1,000 cal meal while knowing I'm still losing weight. I'd be able to go to sleep full and satisfied. It only works if you take it seriously though!",False,False

Fasting, especially intermittent fasting, can have health benefits. If you aren't getting nutritional needs met, it is dangerous. Most people who do prolonged fasts take supplements for electrolytes, but particularly in IF it is possible to eat enough to not have to do that.  Generally not something I'd recommend especially to people on this sub and especially not if you're not ready to do what you have to to make sure you're healthy but there can be health benefits.",False,False
