And it's true that there are many kinds of eating disorders - they don't all present themselves in the same way.  Also, I think that those thoughts of feeling like a fraud are normal and come with having any mental illness.  I think that those thoughts arise from us wondering if we are right to complain about what we are going through, wondering if we actually need help or deserve any sort of sympathy.  But that doesn't matter, because if you are feeling what you feel and it is affecting your life, then it's valid.  You don't have to prove yourself or anything to show that you do have an ED. That label just puts a name to what we struggle with.   I really suggest asking your parents if you can see one, even if you're not sure that you have access to one!  You can just say that you're having lots of problems with friends at school and you want to talk to someone who can help you sort it out.  ",False,False

It's better to have a smaller circle of good, supportive friends than be around lots of toxic people.    Are you seeing a therapist or counselor at the moment?  If you have access to one, I think you would really benefit from talking to someone who is unbiased and can point you in the right direction.  You don't necessarily have to go into treatment if the timing isn't right for you.  It's just another figure in your life who can help you out.  ",False,False

Canada's weird so I'm still in elementary school.

I really struggled with it myself when I was younger and literally let my best friend control how I acted and what I wore because of it.  As I got older I realize how other people's opinions on me don't mean anything. They have no bearing on my life nor do they understand who I really am. The only thoughts that matter are yours. The only person who can look out for you is yourself.  The only person you need to make happy is yourself.  :),False,False

They're mostly immature and have a lot of growing up to do.  Your friend most likely doesn't understand what it's like to have an ED and hasn't had the life experience to be able to put herself in your shoes and try to view things from your perspective.    I promise that your feelings are valid.  I promise that your friend's opinion doesn't hold any weight.  I promise that you are more beautiful than you think you are.  And I promise that there will be people out there who will understand and support you through your hard times.  ,False,False

Later one she said i didn't have one. Why am I like this. I  don't like this. I stand by it and it's so stupid I'm so... invalid everything i feel is invalid. i don't have an eating disorder because i wouldn't be so stupid to tell people. i hope they believe me when im dead and ik that's so awful but this is so much fuel. i feel like I should validate myself and the way i feel but i cant. They can't see my brain but holy cow they know how to get in it if it makes sense.,False,True
