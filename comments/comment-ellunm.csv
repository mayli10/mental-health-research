By saying you didn’t have to eat, she could be trying to make you feel more comfortable attending. Eating disorders are inherently isolating. I can’t count how many times I’ve said no to fun events with friends because of the food situation. But without the pressure to eat, she’s assuming you can go and have a good time",False,False

I think they see my pain. They don’t tell me I don’t have to eat explicitly, but they don’t make me. They have seen what this has done to me and I don’t think they want me to isolate myself. I appreciate when they are like this honestly.   My friends who try to force food on me, especially publicly, make me want to crawl under a rock.",False,False
