I think if i had done it on the stove/toaster oven it would of turned out much better. The apple kinda just went soggy in the microwave and had an unpleasant texture. I also didn't have any vanilla so i just used cinnamon. I think it would be pretty good if not done in the microwave though.,False,True

For a while at work I subsisted off of free cheese sticks and protein bars but could feel myself wanting to eat a whole one after being ok with half just the previous week.
