I broke down in front of my mom one day and she took me to the doctor. I was diagnosed right away, then referred to outpatient treatment initially. I had psychotherapy, CBT, group therapy and hypnotherapy.",False,False

She went hysterical and dragged me to a therapist, but I was in complete denial and the therapist couldn't really do much at that point, so I stopped therapy and continued purging, just hiding it better. Fast forward to 2008 and I had a complete breakdown (I suffered from extreme anxiety on top of ED and depression), had to move back to my hometown and drop out of the school I was attending 4 hours away. Started therapy for real and got diagnosed with anxiety, depression and EDNOS. It wasn't until I started therapy that I went from a normal weight to underweight, ironically enough, so after a few months in therapy I got diagnosed with anorexia nervosa. Therapy helped me a lot with coping with anxiety, and today I can function pretty much normally. My depression comes and goes. Anorexia, however, has been a real bitch. It's been 11 years since I got diagnosed and I'm still here. Yay /s",False,False
