Its mainly because I own my ed, like I dont hide it and am very blunt about it. He does get to his points where he's like ""babe, please stop this, you're the best woman I've ever had or will have, I'm afraid you'll die."" But for the most part he leaves me the fuck alone lol",False,False

People have stared at me before for taking so long in the shop lol... I've checked labels with my boyfriend before too but I have since we've know eachother, so I think he just knows it's a part of shopping for me lol",False,False

Sometimes on the weekends my fiancé and the kids will come in the grocery store with me if we are stopping on the way home or just need to get out of the house so we go get some stuff for dinner  Normally I know exactly what I’m getting before we go and it’s usually stuff I know the exact brand and type of thing I want bc it’s already something I buy a lot  But if I’m making a new recipe or wanting a new snack and I have to look at like 500 things to find the perfect one I feel so awkward,False,False
