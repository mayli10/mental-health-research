I put an empty pizza box in the fridge (stole it from a friend) and just said  ‚Äúsorry I‚Äôve got no food. Its been a busy week so I‚Äôm either going out to eat or ordering a pizza. We can go grocery shopping later if you want‚Äù  Worked like a charm. I got a ‚Äúdon‚Äôt you just love those weeks‚Äù and a story about their busy week experiences in return.,False,False

If you want to buy stuff she‚Äôll eat, ask her what she likes. If you just want your kitchen to look like a normal person‚Äôs kitchen, my recommendations are:  Fridge: Fruit and veggies Cheese and eggs Some yogurt   Pantry: Couple grains, like quinoa, rice, pasta Canned foods, like beans, sweetcorn, chickpeas Box or two of cereal Condiments: ketchup, soy sauce, hot sauce, vinegar, honey, maple syrup Spices: salt, pepper, garlic powder, parsley, etc   That should cover it.",False,False

I got her: bread, cheese and lunchmeat for sandwiches, cereal and milk for breakfast, granola bars, fruit and nuts for snacking.  That seemed to get the job done nicely.  We did also have fudge pops in the freezer, but she didn't end up having any of those.",False,False

A sleeve of bagels, some eggs,  normal cereal can‚Äôt hurt for breakfasts. In case she wants to eat before you‚Äôre up?   I don‚Äôt think you need to stock an unhealthy pantry for her.

Like you said, buying some snacks that your sister likes seems like a good idea.   You dont really have to go overboard imo, just buy some essentials and if the need for something raises you could always go out and buy it? Dont stress, I'm sure itll work out fine! :)",False,False
