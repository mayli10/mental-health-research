Better to eat a 500 calorie deficit and maybe also exercise. It's more sustainable, you'll be less likely to binge, and your body will be getting the nutrients it need so you'll be less likely to faint, lose your hair, or fuck up your heart. ",False,False

I used to have egg whites for breakfast (sometimes mixed with some seeds or raisins to make a mini-omelette), low fat yogurt mixed with a tiny amount of chopped pear and apple for) lunch, and  fish (smoked salmon or prawns) for dinner. This usually came out to less than 400 calories and over 85% protein, which made me feel full and also let me exercise gently. Lots of water and ice, chewing gum only once or twice a day, and diet soda only once a week. I always drank as much tea as I wanted, though!  Once a week I would fast for 24 hours and break my fast with a 200 cal protein bar that had a small amount of chocolate or caramel in it, kind of as a treat. This kept me on track, plus the slight rise in calories always seemed to trigger a 'whoosh' for me.  Ultimately CICO is key, but I never lost weight as fast as I did eating like this because it seemed to dissuade binges bc of the variety and high protein levels. This is also the diet I'll be returning to for 2019 hopefully xx",False,False

No matter my diet or exercise during the day, if I only eat veggies for dinner (even a HUGE amount), I wake up the next morning with a flat stomach. You can mix it up every night too! A salad, or unlimited cups of veggie soup, or sautéed veggies, or oven-roasted. They’re so low cal that it’s literally all you can eat! ",False,False
