If I'm understanding right, it sounds like you worked really hard to lose weight, possibly by assuming some disordered eating habits, and now you want to be congragulated for your weight loss by somebody other than your mother, like your doctor.   - If you want your doctor to say something... Your doctor cares about you and wants you to be healthy. But doctors are very busy and focusing on other things. If your weight is good, the doctor might skip mentioning it. It might also be because you are too young. When I was 13, the doctor measured me to be overweight, but he didn't tell me anything -- he had a private conversation with my parents and told them they needed to get me to lose weight. Only when I turned 16 did my doctor talk to me, not my parents, about my weight.  - If you want your dad to say something... Sometimes it can be hard for dads to talk to their daughters about their bodies when they are developing. Maybe your dad doesn't want to say anything wrong so he isn't saying anything at all. - If you want people at school to say something... People probably noticed that you lost weight but do not want to say it to you directly. There can be a lot of reasons for this. Maybe they don't know how much effort it took you, and they assume you just ""grew into"" the weight naturally. That is common at your age. Maybe they did notice that you have disordered eating habits, but they didn't want to make you feel bad so they didn't say anything. When I was 16, I lost a lot of weight very quickly. Nobody at school, not even my close friends, mentioned my weight loss or disordered habits. It's an awkward topic, and everyone avoids awkwardness. In my opinion, it is much nicer than the alternative, where people judge and bully each other!    Finally, here are some generic facts.  - Obviously, you are younger than most people on /r/EDAnonymous. A lot of the content here is written by adults who assume they are talking to an audience of mostly adults. Some of the people who reply to your posts might not realize you are only 14, so the advice they give you might not be applicable to you. Please keep this on mind -- I would strongly recommend you make a flair for yourself which has your age. - If you don't know already, ask your doctor what a healthy weight range is for you. Don't try to figure it out on your own -- BMI is not completely accurate for you because you are under 18 and your body is developing. You seem to have learned to control your weight well -- if you can, please try to stay within the range your doctor recommends! As you have probably read on this sub, being underweight can be unhealthy.  - *Important: * I looked a bit at your post history (sorry to stalk! it's a good cause! &lt;3) and saw you mentioned being disappointed at getting your period. I was exactly like this when I was 16 and losing weight quickly. My period stopped for about 6 months. I was normal weight at the time. I was proud of my period stopping because I hated my period (blood is gross) and it made me feel like I was good at losing weight. I went to a doctor after 6 months of no periods, and here is what he told me. *For girls under 21, naturally not getting regular periods is extremely unhealthy.* Periods have something to do with bone growth, and your skeleton is not fully grown until age 21. If you are not getting your period, then something with your hormones is not right, and *your bones are not growing properly.* This will cause massive health problems eventually. At any age, not having a period is concerning, but for a 14 year old, not having a regular healthy period is extremely concerning! Whatever happens to you, even if your eating stays disordered, *for the next 7 years (at least), please do whatever you can to have healthy hormones.* The easiest option is to have a regular period, which hopefully indicates healthy hormones and bone growth. If you really really hate your periods, like I did, another option is going on the pill (birth control). The pill is not only for contraception, it can also help get you the estrogen you need for bone growth. My doctor wanted put me on the pill at age 16 with the original intent to force my periods to come back. Then I told him that I really really hate my periods, and he told me about another option, the ""long cycle"" pill. Basically, the normal way the pill works is you take 3 weeks of medicine, then take a break for 1 week, during which your period comes, and you repeat every month. The way the ""long cycle"" pill works is, you take 4 weeks of medicine and no breaks. So your body gets the hormones it needs and you have no periods. In summary -- *if you ever stop getting regular periods, please talk to your doctor about solutions. Having healthy hormones is important. You do not have to be a certain weight or be recovered from an ED in order to have healthy hormones.*   I know some of this advice is unsolicited. I just want the best for you. Please remember to ask people for help. Obviously /r/EDAnonymous is here for you, but also your parents and doctors are hopefully good resources. Feel good and stay safe &lt;3",False,False

I am proud that you are talking about this and I want you to know it does get better. I hope that one day you'll be able to love yourself.
