Everyone feels like they’re not sick enough, and usually there isn’t truly an end point where you feel like you’re ‘sick enough’ for help. You deserve help regardless.   It doesn’t matter exactly how much you’re eating, it matters how it affects you and how you feel",False,False

We’re all at different points in our eating disorders and there’s no reason for you to swear off all help just because you’re maintaining. The same is true for other mental illnesses—some people aren’t actively trying to kill themselves every day but still talk to therapists regularly, for example. The point is—as long as you need help in any way, you shouldn’t feel undeserving of help! And besides, you could look at it this way—you even got a diagnosis, so at least one person thinks you deserve treatment. (or else why would you be diagnosed??)",False,False
