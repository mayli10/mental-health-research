I honestly had like a cow milk addiction during my life, so when I turned paleo for 3 months, this was a sad alternative at the time. Anyway, by the time I tried cow's milk again after the three months, it tasted incredibly sour and gross to me. Cow's milk used to be sweet to me; now it all tastes rotten. The plus? Almond milk tastes fucking amazing, especially this brand. It's creamy, it goes well with everything milk would. It tastes exactly how cow's milk used to taste to be before I became intolerant to it. Like, even if I they were the same amount of Calories, this shit wins for me every single time.",False,False
