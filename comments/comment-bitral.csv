Unfortunately I feel like I restrict and exercise too heavy so I lose fat and muscle, and then I don’t gain enough muscle eating at maintenance for a bit. It’s a vicious cycle. I’m currently at a ‘try to eat at maintenance’ phase but it is a struggle to accept how high my maintenance is and that I really can eat that much without gaining weight. Especially since eating more means more weight fluctuations.  I wish I could just delete the part of my brain that cares about weight.  Sorry I don’t have any helpful advice but wanted to say you aren’t alone. Hopefully we can all be kinder to ourselves.",False,False
