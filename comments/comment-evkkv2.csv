I was asking purely health wise if its okay to fast would those calories sustain me for today kind of? Like they would be part of todays calories.. Idk. Im not tryna die to lose weight lmfao. Also its soo true I dont really binge anymore but when i did Omg ""restricting"" next day never worked and my self hatred would just nake me binge more. so due to ur comment i had a coffee w some milk (3%) and a sugar, and 2 petite buerre cookies as my brunch/early lunch. in a few hours ill probably also eat a toast w a hardboiled egg, and possibly even eat a small dinner of some steamed veggies or something (but yummy u know or a tuna salad  w lemon !! )",False,True

Going over by your TDEE for one day, even by a notable amount, isn’t going to derail your progress or cause you to gain weight. I know it’s easier said then done especially when an inner ED voice can be so loud after “overeating”, but the best thing you can really do is go back to eating a healthy amount tomorrow and move on like the binge never happened. Either way, you’ve done nothing wrong by enjoying some tasty food, so please don’t feel the need to punish yourself for it!! Having something yummy is one of the pleasures of life :)",False,False
