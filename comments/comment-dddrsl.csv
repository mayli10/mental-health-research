It’s taken me awhile to finally accept that my frame is physically larger than most Japanese girls’ and my hips will always be wider no matter how much I lose. I had a friend who was a ballet dancer here and suuuuper skinny and even her hips looked big next to most jp girls.   I love everything about japan but the body dysmorphia is the hardest thing. I look at other western women here who don’t care and accept that races are different sizes and I’m jealous...I wish I could just accept it.",False,False

To me the skinnier the healthier??  Part of my mind is like ""Nonono, that is wrong, don't do that"" but the larger part of me is screaming ""Do it.  Show everyone that not every single American is a fat lazy fuck who rides scooters in Walmart.  Starve yourself.

It is nearly impossible to look modelesque without restricting calories to an unhealthy degree.  I lived in Hawaii briefly and followed thin people’s IG accounts from the island; while it looked like they were eating so much all the time, the calories they consumed per day were low.    Having an iced coconut water or unsweetened coffee, a small fruit bowl or 1 slice of avo toast for breakfast, a salad with some nuts (or more fruit) on it for lunch, more fruit for a snack, and some tofu/tempeh with a side of roasted veggies for dinner comes out to less than 1000 calories per day.  Very few adults have TDEEs under that amount.  Combine that with an hour or more of exercise per day and you have a beautiful body that’s pretty underweight.",False,False
