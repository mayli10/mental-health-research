A part of me is doing it because I want my weight and heart rate to drop again. I don't know why, I think i just want to be sick and validated :/",False,False

I sort of think of all that as a superpower - I was thrilled my bloodwork always came back fine because it let me say ""ha! no reason to be hospitalized!"" ... if that helps you any",False,False

I got mine back this morning &amp; they’re the best results I’ve seen in YEARS. My family doctor called me on the phone just to tell me that everything was great &amp; my mom was so happy for me (I’ve had issues with severely low vit d, low calcium as a result &amp; low folic acid &amp; iron in the past = context as to why they’d be so overjoyed). I don’t want to be ungrateful for my good health but I didn’t expect it all when I’m used to having deficiencies even when I’m not restricting/purging etc. &amp; I personally feel so sick all the time... now I feel like I’m exaggerating everything :/ (sorry for the rant - feels still fresh lol)",False,False

I was hospitalized earlier this year (for something unrelated to my ED.)  I had a BMI of barely 16.  My blood tests were quite unremarkable.  RBC count and blood pressure were a bit low but nothing anyone was too worried about.  Guess I'm fine! :'),False,False
