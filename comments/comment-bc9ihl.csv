I got distracted and forgot about it.   I asked my SO to empty all the trash cans in the house on trash day this week, then suddenly remembered my shame. I ran into the bathroom and said ""oh, I'll take care of that one"" and blurted I-don't-want-you-to-see-used-tampons excuse (I use a cup. Literally no pads or tampons in there).   He commented that the bin smelled weird.   Ooooops.",False,False
