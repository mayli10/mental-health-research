And it tends to happen when I'm lying down. Haven't really figured out why or whether it's serious enough to go to the doctor. I know if I went, my heart would just act normally so they'd think I'm lying.",False,False

It does happen most often now when I have a change in blood pressure IE flopping down in bed.  I assume it's somewhat normal, but it is annoying.
