I get 200g of protein a day, and get all my amino acids in, and I don't understand enough about nutrition to grasp why I *wouldn't* build muscle when consuming that.",False,True

I know because I tried haha. Maybe if you eat at less of a deficit during the week you won't have the urge to binge so much? How much do you lose in a average month?,False,False

I eat at around 1000-2000kcal daily deficit, with my workouts and active occupation, so theoretically I should be losing big time, but I also tend to binge/intuitively eat on weekends which fucks up my fluid balance, so idk.",False,True

The idea of gaining fat is so sickening to me so I can't seem to let myself gain weight even though I want to be muscular. I also eat protein and lift weights, but running is my main thing. I run 5 miles a day but it used to be more when I was losing weight. It's amazing for burning fat but I'm trying to cut down on it a bit so I can gain weight. If thin with no muscle is your goal you should definitely do a lot of cardio. But you don't really want to end up like me so maybe don't take my advice haha",False,False

Me, I used to be, technically speaking, on the edge of morbidly obese. I'm about 45kg lighter now, but my stomach is FUCKED up, I have weird puffed skin.  The typical male body of being ""ripped"" isn't something I personally like. I just wanna be thin with no fat lmao, whether or not I have muscle is not as important to me, I'm just tormented by the fat on my body.  I frequent fitness forms, amd it seems like I need to at least lose another 10 kg if I'm gonna get any type of body I want. I just eat protein amd lift weights in the Hope's of building muscle , so my fat isn't as pronounced, and my BMR goes up.",False,True

I'm 6'1 126lb and I thought I was bad.   Why do you want to look like that?? I always wanted to be lean and ripped but never wanted to be delicate.. i guess because that's not really the classic male body standard? Though i guess I am delicate now lol. Most guys dream of having large shoulders and chest so embrace what you have! I know it's easier said than done though.   I've never told anyone about my body issues because I don't want people thinking I'm gay or a pussy so I get you there..,False,False
