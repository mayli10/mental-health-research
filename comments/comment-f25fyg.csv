When completely sedentary your TDEE is 1.2 times what your BMR is. That is a 20% difference. So if you are sedentary eating your BMR you are undereating by 20%.,False,False

It’s kind of like if you think about obesity. You can live and maintain an obese BMI for years, but the health impact of doing so will catch up to you. I’d be most worried about your heart giving out prematurely.   As for the energy I’d ask; do you feel good now ? Are those things manageable for you to do now? If not, then there’s no way in hell they’ll be at that bmi, I’m sorry mate but I think your body will be too busy dying 2 care about coursework",False,False

Sorry for being repetitive I just want to make sure,False,True
