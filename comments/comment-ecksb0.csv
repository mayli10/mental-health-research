Now she wildly oscillates between trying to feed me even more than she did before, while nitpicking how much protein I get, and taking food away from me when she does see me eating to ""help"". It's frustrating but at least I am away for college 90% of the time",False,False

It got to the point where she was threatening to throw me out, threatening to apply for guardianship, almost hit me, during our fights. She would go insane and as I got older, I stayed much calmer. When I was 21-23, I was doing a bit better myself and so she wouldn’t get mad at me but would make smart comments just being rude. Now I’m 24, have relapsed, and she doesn’t say a word. I know she is mad about it but at least she keeps it to herself.   I have no tips except I can tell you that over time it got less and our relationship has improved.",False,False

She makes mean comments and pretty much encourages me to get worse.  My dad is so supportive and I don't know what I'd do without him.",False,False
