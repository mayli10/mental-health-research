I guess we’ll see tomorrow. I’ve heard that sometimes when you do exercise the scales can go up the day after.  I think it’s just so annoying because I keep losing and gaining the same 7lbs over and over again. Hopefully this time when it comes off it stays off.",False,True

But. You say it wasn' to get the better of you but went for a run to burn it off which to me feels like it did. If it was a run to clear your mind/get away from temptation then yeah but ""burning it off"" implies to me at least that it got a gripe on you.  Sorry if I am saying the way I view things as something you did, I just know for me I always trick myself into thinking I am just going out to clear my head but really know it's to burn off calories and therefore I didn't actually win",False,False

Likely you would have gained a lot more otherwise. I'm proud of you for not binging too crazy and doing your best to take care of yourself.,False,False
