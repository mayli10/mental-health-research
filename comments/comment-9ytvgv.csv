There's sadly, not much you can do but : Be gentle, be aware.   A really hard lesson to learn (and you'll even struggle with this 18 years from now !) is : *The way your parents is not a ""cap"" on how you will be.* Their shortcomings and weakeness do not have to be yours. How far they got in life is not some ""maximum end point"" for how far you'll get.   Your Mom is clearly suffering. And to repeat the first paragraph : It's absolutely unfair that her suffering becomes yours. You can be better than her, though, more gentle, more compassionate, more aware of the affect of such behaviour on others. When she is hurting, behaving in ways you can identify with, first *see it.* That's not as trivial as it sounds. And then, gently, treat her how *you* would want to be treated. And remember that you are resistant, and her actions made from her suffering don't mean she intentionally wants you to suffer. Remember what you would feel in such a time, if she hadn't started all this. Act like you wish she would act, with the gentleness you deserve to recieve yourself. You can teach her, with compassionate awareness, how to be a better person. That means being a better person both to herself, and to you.  It's not fair you would have to take the ""Mom"" role with this, and be the more patient and resistant person, but you can do it. I know you can. You deserve better than the situation you have, but you are a warrior, clever and kind, and you will teach. I send hearts. ðŸ’•ðŸ’žðŸ’•",False,False
