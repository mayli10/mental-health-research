These days I put cold eggs in cold water in a pot (covered about an in or so above the eggs). You can let them get to room temperature if you care about there the yolk is I guess... anyway I put the cold/room temp eggs an water on stove and turn to high. Once it starts to boil I turn it down slightly and set timer for about 7 minutes (you can do less or more depending how you like your yolks cooked. I prefer slightly under done to fully cooked). After the timer goes off I put them in a bowl of ice water until cooled (or as long as I can wait to eat them).  Older eggs peel a bit better but I find the ice water to stop the cooking helps separate from the membrane and helps with the peeling process.,False,False

Hope you are feeling better now :(   Eggs are my #1 safe food and I can eat 4 boiled eggs in a day so here are some tips for a clean peel:  Boil your eggs with a “hot start” AKA roughly room temp/cold-ish egg into water at a rolling boil. Pricking the egg on the narrow side with a thumb tack before boiling also helps to get an easier peel. As long as the outer membrane is cooked quickly the egg will peel easily.,False,False
