I've mainly my switched to green smoothies, it gives me the cold + sweet that I've been craving. Also I've thought about getting those party cups of ice cream, where each serving is like 100 cals! It's much harder for me to rationalize going back for a second whole container of ice cream than it is for me to refill my bowl. ",False,False

In general it's an unhealthy coping mechanism to use food as a response to emotions. Even for non-ED people it's not good. Is there an activity you really enjoy? Or something else you'd want to buy that would treat yourself? Cute makeup? A video game? Really it could be anything that cheers you up a little.,False,False

Or get some low fat fro yo? That way you can eat it and not feel so guilty. Or portion out some ice cream in a bowl, so you're indulging your cravings but not risking a binge.  You definitely should treat yourself - and chin up, there'll be way more opportunities out there! üíï",False,False
