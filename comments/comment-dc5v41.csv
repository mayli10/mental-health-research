Try to lie down, sip slowly on water throughout the day. Buy probiotics or digestive enzymes if you can, it's a life saver.  And uuuh I don't want to be that person but if you can find a nutritionist specialized in EDs (or just a normal nutritionist, it's always better that a dietician) if you're able to. It sounds like her advices aren't really adapted to your case.",False,False

Lay on your left side for gas pain (sharp pains in your torso) and honestly just try and avoid fixating on any edema/distention because it’s crazy distressing and it will pass with time. It’s your body trying to relearn how to regulate itself!,False,False
