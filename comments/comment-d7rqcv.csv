There’s tons of skinny people that feel that their bodies are above the laws of thermodynamics lmao,False,False

I have girls who are my size or larger (I’m a size 18 right now) who I think are gorgeous and look great. But I look lumpy and gross. I have always felt this way even when I was underweight.,False,False

So many juvenile prediabetics/diabetics. So much heart and fatty liver disease. I just find it very upsetting that their physical weight and their related health problems prevent them from participating in everyday activities, and that their lifespans are almost undoubtedly being shortened (especially with our family history of high cholesterol and related cardiac events).   As a result of my family experiences, I would be terrified to have a life partner who was significantly overweight, bc I'd worry every morning that this is the day they're going to have a massive heart attack and die young.",False,False

When it comes to partners though, I start getting picky in order to reduce how much I will be triggered. If they're too thin then I feel like a whale. If they're heavier than a bit chubby/husky (like higher end of average range, maybe a bit over), then I worry about how their lifestyle and eating habits will effect me. That being said, everything goes out the window for the right person.",False,False

Otherwise I honestly see most people as good looking in some way, and there's plenty of people twice or even three times my size that are way better looking. It makes me sad thinking that a lot of attractiveness comes from carrying yourself with confidence, and I'm severely lacking confidence in my appearance no matter how much weight I lose.",False,False

But I do care in a sense about other people's weights, but more about how they look in comparison to me. I'll do a mental note if someone is smaller or bigger than me, for example. It's an ugly habit, but I never think negative thoughts about someone else's body, at least. I love, love how in the summer, it's so much more normal now to see stretch marks and cellulite on display, and I think it always looks cute on other people.",False,False

I think reverse thinspo only really works for me when the person is clearly suffering because of their size. It’s not how they look that bothers me so much as the hardships they’re enduring as a consequence of it like having a hard time moving around, exhaustion, anxiety about how they look and are being seen by people, and fitting into spaces. I think I relate to it just because I have such a distorted view of my own body.   Meanwhile there’s this one girl I follow on Instagram who’s easily twice my size and I’m always like holy shit she’s perfect. She’s insanely pretty, way more fit than I’ll ever be, and wears stuff I’d be terrified of wearing. It makes no sense. I think she looks amazing in tank tops and revealing dresses and here I am afraid to wear shorts and short sleeves in public.",False,True

It makes me feel like a horrible person but I know it’s the ED talking. Reverse thinspo is the most powerful thing in the world for me and it sucks. It sucks so much because I love everyone so much, and for my brain to judge that based on someone’s size is fucking sick. I wish things weren’t like this.  If someone’s skinny or looks good, I’m just happy for them though, and use them as inspiration and admiration. It’s never competition",False,False

I can look look at people of all sizes and think to myself ""they look fine"". Other people's weight usually doesn't even register to me. People around me can lose or gain weight and I don't think of them any differently and often I don't even notice.

I am a huge advocate for Health at Every Size and that skinny doesn’t mean healthy and fat doesn’t mean unhealthy.
