I don't want to trigger anyone on here by providing numbers, but I experienced a rebound weight gain of about 10% of my body weight in under one month, which is a huge change for me. I use calipers to estimate my body fat and of the weight I gained, I estimated only about 40% of it was fat. I did experience mild body fat overshoot as a result of the rapid weight gain. I carried noticeably more particularly in my abdomen area, which is a well-documented phenomenon for recovering anorexics. This was extremely difficult to deal with to say the least, but I was willing to accept it because I had read many studies about body fat overshoot in recovering anorexics and knew it was necessary to heal my metabolism and that over the course of time, it would go away. Surprisingly, not even one month after that, my skinfold measurements were back to normal levels, and the total ratio of lean mass to fat mass gained (from my lowest weight) looked more like a 4:1 ratio.  &amp;#x200B;  I know plenty of former anorexics for whom body fat overshoot caused them to gain upwards of 20% of their body weight. Alice Olivia on Youtube is a prime example, she needed to go way above her body fat setpoint in order to heal her metabolism. But this is all just part of the process. In time your body really will deal with the excess fat on its own without your interference. The amount of lean mass you need to put back on after AN is substantial. Everything in your body atrophes and loses mass, even your brain and digestive systems, and it also takes a while for your digestion to speed back up (took about 6 months for me) so you'll be holding on to pounds and pounds of food and not passing it efficiently.",False,False

It takes one week to lose 1lb eating at a 500 cal/day deficit so that should give you an idea on how long it takes to gain or lose fat (which is the weight weâ€™re really trying to lose). All other weight fluctuations can and should be attributed to things like water weight, poop, etc. Water weight alone fluctuates constantly depending on the amount of sodium in our diets, the amount of exercise weâ€™re doing, the TYPE of exercise, hell even the weather. So you definitely havenâ€™t gained 6lbs of FAT from eating your TDEE for two days, fear not ðŸ˜‰",False,False
