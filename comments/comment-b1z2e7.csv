I've been trying to gain from about the same BMI, but I might have IBS so I think the reason it isn't working is because my body isn't digesting food properly. I was weighed the other day and was apparently 4 lbs heavier, but that was fully clothed when I was really bloated. I feel like if I didn't have anything in me at the time that I would be the same weight as always.",False,False
