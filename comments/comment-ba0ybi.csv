Especially when 2 of them were 2k, if you're active that could still be your TDEE.  But I get ya. I've been working SO HARD on getting below 120, but every time I get close I eat a bunch, so I have been in the same like 3-5 lb range for like 2 months now. To be honest your body probably doesn't want to get much lower in weight (same with mine), so you've gotten to the point where it will probably be harder.   But, don't be discouraged by a few ""bad"" days, or let that lead you into a spiral since you've already ""ruined"" it, because you haven't! ",False,False

It took you 4 months to lose, you're not going to gain it all back because of 1 day. It was just a temporary slip-up, and tomorrow is a new day to try again.
