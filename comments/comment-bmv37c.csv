I wouldn't consider it the healthiest mentality, but striving to be like him is nowhere near as appalling as using disgust towards him to lose weight. You're good :)  Tbh, I use my boyfriend as thinspo too, but more so because he's over 100 pounds more than me and muscular, and I just want to juxtapose him to make myself as much smaller than him as I possibly can (he enjoys the gap too and wants to get bigger on his own end to make the differneve between us even larger than 100+ lbs)  I think a lot of us here compare ourselves to our partners in some form or another tbh  My boyfriend is also an ex bulimic and lost 40 pounds in four months when he was like 17/18, and I often compete with that figure in my head rip it's so stupid",False,False

Because as thinspo, that's meh, but as reverse thinspo, yeah that would be kind of really fucked up. By your post though, I can't tell if his ""worst"" is thin or overweight, so I don't know which you are doing.",False,False
