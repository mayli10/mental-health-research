The dr said it would get more manageable with age and it definitely has. Its called non diabetic/fasting/non reactive hypoglycemia. I’m not sure what causes it, honestly. There are other members of my family with it and a couple with type 1 juvenile diabetes, so maybe genetic? That said, I think for any of us low BG is a big risk. If it’s not happening while restricting or fasting and that’s new for you, I’d go see a dr.",False,False
