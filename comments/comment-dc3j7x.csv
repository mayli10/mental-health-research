I know good and well I'm not going to lose shit but I check anyways and get upset *anyways* as if I literally didn't know that was exactly what would happen. Periods are the absolute worst because you could have actually lost 2lbs but the scale goes up 1.2lbs because of it. It's dumb and stupid. Who thought this system would be a good idea? Why not a seasonal cycle instead of monthly? Oh wait, that would actually make sense.",False,False
