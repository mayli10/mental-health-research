I asked if he said sorry (since it sounded kinda like an accident) and she said that he was being cockey and trying to prove hes still strong in his old age. My dad was mentally abusive growing up so I'm kinda really confused. My mum is messaging me like it's nothing and said he was being silly and I hope it was accidental but then my dad is like ??? Ughhh I don't even know man. Can not deal.    Every day I think my life won't get more stressful and then this stuff happens and man oh man it is clear why I have issues lmao ,False,True

The takeaway is that it's never about you. I know it's hard to hear such cruel things said so directly, but I guarantee that person is projecting their issues on to you and you don't have to listen to it. Cut them off and move on hun, you've got bigger fish to fryüñ§",False,False
