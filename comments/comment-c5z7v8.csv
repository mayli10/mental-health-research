I don't think that you should actually focus on the headline of your medical history, but rather on the ""why"" behind it",False,False

I have like three friends left because I‚Äôve pushed them all away to focus on my self destruction and I may have even lost one of those because she doesn‚Äôt even really talk or text much anymore. I‚Äôm here if you need someone to talk to. Take care of yourself. I know I‚Äôm a big ole hypocrite because I still struggle almost constantly with recovering but I honestly want the best for everyone here even if I can‚Äôt seem to want it for me sometimes. I believe in you and your health and happiness. You can do this. And if you need support or a shoulder to cry on or just someone to vent to, my inbox is always open. üíô",False,False

I‚Äôve dealt with some shitty ones that didn‚Äôt help, some even shittier ones that made me worse, and some that just didn‚Äôt know what the fuck an eating disorder was. Having the right therapist makes SUCH a huge difference. Things will get tough. Not gonna lie. But those tough days give way to lighter days and those are the days we make progress.

My singer once told me something that stuck with me when I complain about calories. To paraphrase what he said to apply to your situation: It's not 50 calories, it's 50 energies!  I'm glad you're doing the work. It's hard. It's grueling. But you will thank yourself for it in spades.",False,False
