The name served a function for me because the last time I was seeking out support (a zillion years ago), those are the sites that I found, so once I relapsed I was able to search for pro-ana/proed stuff and ended up here on Reddit to give and receive REAL support. However, now that ship’s sailed, yeah? Might be a good time to bury all those ‘pro’ descriptors and re-brand, lol",False,False

And I remember seeing others like them in the past. If Reddit had even looked at any of those and seen the agreement, maybe they wouldn't have banned us. :(",False,False
