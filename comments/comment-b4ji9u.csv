As the name states, he trains models of all sorts: bikini, lingerie, high fashion, etc. so he knows his stuff. I bit the bullet and purchased his priciest plan ($400) but genuinely have had insane compliments every time I stick to it consistently.  He does a couple leg exercises but not enough to ‚Äòbulk‚Äô or add muscle. Actually, his entire program is based off of the aesthetics that models cannot add inches on their waist or hips, so he focuses nearly solely on inch loss. Horrible for body positivity, but hey. It works for me.  https://m.youtube.com/results?search_query=john+benton+workout  You can get results with the videos here. Also, I loved pvolve for shrinking abilities and he has streaming for $30 a month I think? Only reason I stopped is because I actually prefer paper like workouts or guides, not videos.  I used ballet beautiful for a while and had the same problem with my thighs and actually developed a bit of a boxy waist, which sucked :(",False,False

I thought this would be a safer exercise that would build leaner muscle and not bulk. I wonder if it will even out as I lose some fat on my leg?
