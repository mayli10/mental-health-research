It shows previews of user updates by last post and your friends list is just organized by most recent activity.

As for using it to cope, I think it can be more useful than reddit since it allows users to spam their own profile without spamming others.",False,False

I had so many thoughts running through my head, an unsettling number of which were about suicide.  I'm okay now (or, as okay as one can be while starving themselves :\^)) but taking down proed was the dumbest, most harmful and ignorant decision they could've possibly made.
