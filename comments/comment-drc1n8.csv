Because frankly I’m always gonna look ugly no matter how thin I make myself but I can surround myself with beautiful things. I got really into a ton of styles (many of which are kind of body-hiding) and I basically collect clothing. The uglier I feel the wilder I dress, it’s like a shield because people don’t notice my body they notice my duck print pants.",False,False

Try looking into things like “hairstyles for X face shape” or “hair color for X skin tone” and “makeup looks for X-shaped eyes” and colors/contours for your face shape and eye color. I’m not saying you need to change yourself, but sometimes doing things for yourself (and following rules bc we love that) can make u feel more confident. Also try making a Pinterest board with styles you find cute (maybe even someone u feel has your body shape) and try to recreate them.",False,False
