Through reading stuff about it, it seems it's like your metabolism might reduce by 180 (only 55 of that is unattributed to other things like reduction in fidgeting), which isn't much.

The effects of all kinds of fasting and feeding on metabolism have been studied *extensively*;  It's one of the most well-understood variables there is, and it's definitively untrue that skipping meals will lower your metabolism.

People tend to over estimate how active they are and then wonder why they aren’t losing weight, or are gaining weight. The best way to keep track is by counting calories in AND calories out (via bmr (resting) and activity). That way you can ensure you’re in a true deficit.

People who skip meals are more prone to losing their willpower and eating more for their next meal. This creates a false sense of ‘slowed metabolism’ because you’re more likely to overcompensate throughout the day.   If you eat a low calorie lunch and a low calorie dinner you’ll probably have stronger resolve and stick to your diet.   This more in reference to the experience of the average Joe which is what perpetuates the myth of a slowed metabolism.,False,False
