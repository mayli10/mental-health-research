I gotta up my calories to heal better (my injury was a really bad burn) and the doctor wants me to get about 40-50g of protein to help. But ofc that’s terrifying because I’m used to eating one meal late at night.,False,True

When people say starvation mode is bullshit, what they mean is the idea that your body will gain loads of fat when you start eating again, because your metabolism slowed, is bull. Your body is complex and very good at adapting to survive. When food is reduced, your metabolism will slow to help conserve the energy you do have.  I prefer the term starvation syndrome, since various psychological and physiological effects can crop up, but the extent of which is individual to each person. That, and ""mode"" makes people think your body goes into a preprogrammed state that's identical for everyone.  When you've been in a state of starvation for a period of time, your body slows down the unimportant process and directs the remaining resources to surviving and finding food. When you begin eating again, your body doesn't immediately revert back to its pre starvation state, many of the effects will persist short term when re-nourishing yourself. It's generally this initial stage where you see a great increase in weight and appearing bloated. This gives the false impression of having gained fat, which has resulted in misinformation being spread.  That initial weight is food and water, since your body isn't used to digesting large amounts of food. Therfore, the longer it sits in your GI tract, the more gas is produced and the more you appear bloated. This is a difficult stage to get past, but it's only temporary. As you continue eating more, your GI muscles regain strength so you can digest food at a more normal rate. Your brain realises that actually, you're no longer in a situation where food is scarce, so it ramps up your metabolism. The more you continue to eat, the more diverse your gut microbiome will become, reducing bloating.   It's at this point hypermetabolism is experienced. Your body has had to rely on its own energy reserves. Initially this is through burning excess fat, however, the longer you experience starvation syndrome, the more the body shifts towards breaking down its own muscle. This can be dangerous, especially since the heart is a muscle and loses mass at a preferential rate. So for the body to make it through the other side of this ordeal, it needs to repair the damage done.  Since muscle requires more calories, this is why food plans tend to be excessively high in calories for some people recovering. The body not only needs extra energy to sustain the additional mass, but it needs energy to carry out the basic functions to build it in the first place. You do gin some fat during this process, which is frequently deposited around the abdominal area. This is to help protect the vital organs, but eventually with continued nourishment, this fat will be redistributed.  If you don't up the calories to match the body's requirements for repairing the damage, you'll find you'll start losing again. That might seem great at first, but your body is smart and will slow the processes it needs to, and then you'll maintain until you give yourself more energy. If you don't up your intake and you start losing after maintaining, then you're likely back experiencing starvation, and all the mass built is being destroyed again, just to keep you alive.  Any weight gain is horrible to deal with mentally and physically, but you need to trust that your body knows what it's doing. You're not suddenly going to get fat, if that happens at all, you'll be allowing your body to repair the damage you've caused.",False,False

On the one hand, people say it’s bunk. On the other hand, wasn’t there a legit study of the “Biggest Loser” contestants that showed their metabolisms had absolutely tanked?",False,False
