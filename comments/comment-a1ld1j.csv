I‚Äôm glad someone else can relate, but also sad because I wouldn‚Äôt wish this stuff on anyone.  Thank you for the advice, it‚Äôs helped a lot already!! :-) ",False,True

Yeah, I think I live in denial of how bad my disorder really is a lot of the time and it‚Äôs hard to face the direct consequences.

I never thought about the cotton balls thing lol.  I think in my head the ED and my GAD like to team up with stuff like this and make it seem way worse or time consuming than it really is.  And the guilt about wasting food/money too.  It‚Äôs hard to face up to such a tangible manifestation of my disorder staring me in the face, you know?  Again, thanks for the help.  It means a lot to me and it‚Äôs really helpful to just hear it explained in a rational way from someone else.",False,True

Put some thrash metal rock on and do it's as quickly as possible.  I have these kinds of issues too with a lot of areas in my life and I always find the best way to deal with it, is just force yourself to do it.

I know I should buy healthy fresh stuff but it just rots and then I end up feeling guilty for wasting resources.  Put on some gloves, shove some cotton up your nose, and make quick work of it!
