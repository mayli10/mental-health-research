I have a permanent knee energy which keeps me from doing most strenuous exercises. However, I love to hike! I like in a place with literally NO hills or anywhere to hike at all so I compensate by walking a few miles on the treadmill each day.",False,False

I used to workout for hours and it would all go to waste because I would binge. Restricting works better for me weight loss wise but if u want to be toned and fit exercising helps. I think it‚Äôs best to find a balance with exercise you will still see results from working out if u only workout 2-3 times a week and it won‚Äôt  make u binge because you aren‚Äôt over exercising.,False,False
