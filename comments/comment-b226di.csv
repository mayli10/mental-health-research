I've been starting with adding things to meals I already make. Occasionally I like an egg/cheese burrito. Now I add jalapenos and hot sauce to it. Or making ahi with a mix of cajun seasoning instead of plain. Small things to start, but nothing to write home about.   I've been also baking veggies with cajun or jerk seasoning. Super good.
