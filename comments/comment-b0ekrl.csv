If it seems wrong you could show/tell your doctor about that too. It takes a few weeks to collect a good amount of data to work with. It also helps to show you what your tdee really is because mine was a lot higher then I thought it was when I tracked over the summer.   I think meeting with a gastroenterologist is a good idea for sure though, I really liked mine. It actually taught me a lot about how digestion actually works.",False,False

And there are actually several digestive issues that can arise from eating dissorders.  -IBS -gastritis -gallstones/ gallbladder dysfunction -gastroparesis -ulcers -pancreatitis  I have pretty bad gastritis and I had my gallbladder out in 2009. I'm not certain my gallbladder issues were ed related but I know my gastritis was a result of my poor diet/food choices between binging and restricting. Its better now when I eat the correct foods and eat small meals through the day. Binging and the resulting urge to restrict can and has caused flair ups. I was also tested for gastroparesis but the test was ""mostly normal"" except for a slight delay durring the 2nd hour (its a 4 hour test).",False,False
