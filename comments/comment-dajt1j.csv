And what does he think other people think as the average fit male...? There will always be SOME women and men who expect their partners to look lean/ripped or like a Victoria's Secret model while the vast majority aren't picky about looks, but is he basically saying women have higher standards for male aesthetics now while completely ignoring how biased he is??",False,False

It's like, he thinks that the OONLLYYY thing you could care about is whether or not HE cares. It's like, ""Oh hey, you got fired from your job! Haha it's not a big deal because I'm still attracted to you."" He's not treating you as an INDIVIDUAL with your OWN goals and desires.",False,False

What does he gauge as a healthy size that ""most"" celebrities have? Like Scarlett Johansson? She is at a healthy weight, although with an exceptional waist-to-hip ratio. Or someone like Lily Collins?  Also, just because overweight is ""average"" in the US doesn't mean it's normal. IMO the majority of Hollywood actresses ARE at a healthy weight",False,False

So i feel like partners would have been a better word.  My girlfriend is the absolute best, but she doesn't understand all the time. In addition to being anorexic, I'm partially disabled (recently). When we were driving past a park today, my girlfriend said ""if you were in better shape we could go for a walk."" I immediately got embarrassed and apologized for being fat, she was taken aback and said. ""No, no, no. Not like weight wise. I mean with your disability."" She can be not the best with words, but I love her.  She also called me thicc once. Once.",False,False

It honestly blows my mind how men can be so casual about eating and so comfortable in their bodies, and then turn around and tell girls with crippling body dysmorphia or eating disorders that men have it worse when it comes to societal expectations of their appearance. Apparently he grew up being a fat kid too but I can’t make that connection in my head because like,,, surely he didn’t get bullied for it if he can comfortably walk around in his underpants or sit around nude and not spend 40 minutes in front of the bathroom mirror pinching his body?????? How are non-ED boys so dense and incapable of sympathy? /rant",False,False

He’s basically forcing me into recovery so I thought I’d ease into it with 20:4 intermittent fasting. I got a half hour long lecture about how I should t starve myself then binge, and about how I should just do what he does, which is drink meal replacement shakes or pour them down the drain when he eats real food. I wanna shake him and yell “I’m not you! What works for you won’t work for me!” I tell him this and he just says “ok calm down I’m just trying to help”.",False,False

But I don't think it's selfishness that makes my boy act like that, I think sometimes when you don't have an unhealthy relationship with food, it's hard to comprehend that it isn't as simple as ""well.... just eat better.""   Whenever I talk to him, he says ""don't starve yourself and work out too often, just watch your calories and exercise a normal amount so you don't hurt yourself."" Yes buddy, I'm aware of what I NEED to do.... the ED gremlin in my brain doesn't allow it though.   He genuinely doesn't get it. He tries but he admits he just doesn't understand.",False,False

I thought it was something serious like an STD."" -_- This boy then went on to say, ""I don't really care, it's not a deal breaker to me."" Like bitch, I'm not telling you for your sake, I'm telling you for mine. I guess he knew how upset I was by how I acted the rest of the day and he apologized and said that he just doesn't know how to react to big news like that and he will help me, but now I don't even know if I want to try to recover. It obviously doesn't bother him so why don't I just keep going?? Man I love him and I swear he is a good man and a fantastic person, but sometimes he's just so selfish it hurts. 1",False,False
