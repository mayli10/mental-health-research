Leggings and pants I still get in Jr because I'm too damn tall (even when I was a kid😂) and I'd prefer baggy over high waters. Shirts are a mix depending on style (long torso too 🤷🏻‍♀️).  Freaked me out the first time I bought kids clothes again, but now I'll take the savings lol. Bought a couple pairs of bermuda/mid thigh shorts for the same price as one pair in Jr's!! Husband likes to joke that our daughter will be sharing clothes with me in 5-6 years lol.",False,False
