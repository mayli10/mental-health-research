I was killing time at the gym between work and a mandatory work meeting four hours apart. Got upset at the gym two hours in, ended up aimlessly and emotionally wandering to a random park in a really nice neighborhood where I proceeded to sit under a tree and SOB like a crazy person while well dressed people walked their designer dog breeds around me, avoiding eye contact.",False,False

Maybe it'd have just been food to someone else, but you're not someone else, and someone else would likely have their own meltdowns over shit that you breeze by.  I'm sorry they got your order wrong. :( That sounds like it was a really drawn-out, overcomplicated phone call over something you were sensitive about, on a day that already wasn't going well. Sometimes a straw just breaks the camel's back.  Hope the rest of your day is more peaceful and chill.",False,False
