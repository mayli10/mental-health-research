I was just all in my feels when I made this post.

My dad has texted me bad family news. I think its because it was too hard for him to say over the phone.   I know you wanted an encouraging response but he may have been a little taken aback and guys are not socialized from a young age like women are to know how to handle these situations. I bet he is proud of you but he feels to awkward to say it. He probably thinks ""sounds like shes got this solution under control"" and figures nothing else needs to be said. ",False,False
