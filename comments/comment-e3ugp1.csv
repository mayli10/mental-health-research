Also they’re not specifically trained for EDs or anything so I just feel ridiculous for bringing it up. Also I was complaining about how I hadn’t lost weight for 3 weeks and was freakin out/annoyed by it, which I regret. I don’t think you should say that to a therapist.   I don’t have another appointment for 9 days so I’m just gonna be regretting it until I can go and explain more then!   But thank-you, I might watch a movie to distract myself.",False,True

You'll be ok. Do something nice today.",False,False
