Even if you eat 1000 calories for takeout AND ate 800 at work it is not mathematically worth it.     The 800 is gone. Processed already. No point crying over digested milk. You will get up some of the takeout depending on when you purge but even if you don't purge at ALL you won't gain any real weight.    1800 calories is maintenance or under for most women. At most you have stalled loss a day and caused a day of bloating with fake water weight due to the salt in takeout. In 2 days it will have never happened.,False,False
