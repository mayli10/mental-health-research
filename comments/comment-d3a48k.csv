She is obviously jealous of you, there's no reason she would act like that if she weren't. Someone like that is not going to take a conversation about your ED, concerns etc well and may even use it against you. I also understand being anxious and not wanting things to get confrontational.   Could you maybe gently call her out instead? If each time you say something like, ""You're always so interested in what I'm eating"" or ""You always say that"" or ""yeah I know you said that yesterday"" etc etc she may start feeling too embarrassed to bring it up as you're always shining a light on it.",False,False

I know it‚Äôs one of the MOST triggering things when you‚Äôre in recovery, being around someone v actively disordered, but every time you pick an ED-driven choice you‚Äôre going a little way back down that path. At the moment you still have insight and some control, you can still stop it ‚Äì it will likely be harder than you think, but you can. However the window for stabilising yourself is likely small, under this kind of intense pressure.

I promise I don‚Äôt just go around lecturing people about recovery ‚Äì I definitely see the value of communities that don‚Äôt judge people who are actively in their illness, and that promote things like harm reduction.
