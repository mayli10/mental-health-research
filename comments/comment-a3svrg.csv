I'm already a restricting type so skipping breakfast and dinner yesterday and just substituting with 160 calories of pretzel sticks (56~ sticks) was really easy.. I had 490 calories yesterday and that was totally fine for me.,False,True

And that's a pretty good age just because you have so much of a better recovery time.  Awesome! Thank you so much! I did end up quitting cold turkey, and it sucked for a little bit but that's fine. I love coffee though.",False,True

I love salmon, I unfortunately also have a shellfish allergy, so I can't do some Seafood but that's incredibly good to know about the turkey as well. 10 calories is a good amount.  I'll start there and if I need to I will!! :) Thank you!",False,True

Apples, pears, or any non citrus fruit. Salmon or seafood is really good. Whole wheat bread and deli meat turkey (you can find some turkey that’s like 10 cals a slice) message me if you want more that’s just what I can think of at the top of my head",False,False

It was laparoscopic, and I got to go home the same day. I was only 19 when I had it done though, so maybe I was just able to bounce back faster. The only real restriction I had was not to lift more than 10lbs for a while.   The drinks I mentioned don't have carbonation or caffeine.   If you have a high caffeine tolerance I would advise against cutting it cold turkey if you can avoid it. When I cut coffee I used green tea to mitigate caffeine withdrawl.  I drink coffe again though. A lot of coffee. ",False,False

If that's my only meal I could probably get around the tbs of oil. I also think that I can have sushi.  Ugh a gallbladder removal surgery it's not easy. I'm sorry you had to do it, my mom had it done and I saw the difficulty but I can't imagine how bad it was.  I can call and ask my GP if I can drink either of those tomorrow. I guess the only problem would be if they had caffeine. Thank you I really do appreciate it.  They're not the *exact* same thing, but either way you look at it, it's still help that I need, and I'm super open to suggestions right now. ",False,True
