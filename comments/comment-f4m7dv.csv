I feel like I sort of have it but not to the degree others speak about. Like I know I’m not fat and have never been fat and I don’t full on hate my body but I see myself as larger than I truly am and constantly want to “improve” it. So for me when I’m quite underweight I see myself as just sort of on the thin side and want to be thinner. And when I’m healthy-thin I see myself as average sized and realllyyy feel I need to be thinner. But I’m not sure it’s BDD or more so perfectionism and the need to be the thinnest possible for me.,False,False

In other words, they are completely unrelated but they often coexist with each other. I’m not 100% sure about this and what I’m saying could be completely wrong so you might want to do your own research after if you are still wondering. BDD is a preoccupation with a certain part of ones body/face - the preoccupation could be both real or perceived. This means you don’t literally have to see your body different than it actually is but another probability that you are just unaware of it which is quite common. Basically, it’s just constant negative thoughts about your body that cause a concerning amount of distress. Just to be clear I’m undiagnosed and don’t really think I have BDD but then again I might just not know. So here’s my experience with BDD symptoms but maybe not actual BDD because it’s not that severe. I’m super fixated on my legs so every single time I pass a reflective surface like a window, mirror or metal I will stare at my legs every single time to see how they look even though I hate seeing them. I also miss social situations because I don’t want people seeing my legs. There was someone I really wanted to see but I couldn’t because I hated my legs too much or like I would try hiding them. Sometimes I stare at other girls’ legs (like a creep) to compare myself with them and it’s the only thing I can think about. Those are just some examples from my experience and I’m sure it’s different for everyone so be sure to do your own research or better yet, ask your doctor. Some people avoid mirrors some people are obsessed with them so it’s not all black and white. Also, the severity for everyone is different as well. One person could have these thoughts 100% of the time but the other could have 60%. I’m not a fan of self-diagnosis, I do think it’s valid (in most situations) but I am not confident diagnosing myself or others so it’s best that you get a professional evaluation from someone who knows what they are talking about because I’m probably just rambling. A quick Google search should give you the basics though to know if BDD is a concern for you. :)",False,False
