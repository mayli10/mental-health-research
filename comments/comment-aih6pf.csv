I‚Äôm not really sure how I managed to do it. It‚Äôs just fake it till you make it.   I don‚Äôt know if I would suggest doing this, but I‚Äôm overly conscious of everything I do and that‚Äôs helped me adjust. It‚Äôs just observe‚Äî often from movies, or TV shows, really‚Äî and copy. If people like it, I keep doing it, or I‚Äôd adjust it depending on how I want to appear. I just kept going and changing a little at a time until everyone forgot how I was once an extremely shy, withdrawn, and uptight girl.   The thing is, I feel like I can fake it but I‚Äôm always overwhelmingly aware of how fake it is. Maybe some people actually do become more carefree, but keeping up this image has sent my perfectionism into overdrive and honestly, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs worth it. But if you want to give it a try, go ahead. Some people can actually fake it for so long it becomes their reality.",False,True

I‚Äôm a big, uptight ball of anxiety and perfectionism nearly to the point where I can barely function around anyone I‚Äôm not already very comfortable with (never used to be this bad though). The idea of portraying, let alone pulling off a carefree persona is something I‚Äôve always tried/wanted to do but I feel like the more I try to, the worse I end up acting.   Can you like, please legit give me your tips on how you‚Äôve done that? It seriously would improve my quality of life so much at this point. üôèüèª",False,False

Between personality disorder problems and an eating disorder, the fake identity I have created and keep creating is so easily fractured by slow weight loss or tbh anything.

I finally had an awful depressive episode at age 28 because I had too much on my plate and couldn't juggle being perfect at everything anymore. My psychologist told me that it was ""coming for me"" one way or the other. I'm 31 now and doing much better.

It's good to vent once in a while. You can't vent if you're trying to make people think you're always happy. Idk if you're into lesbians or anime, but I actually recently watched a yuri series that started a few months ago where one of the main characters is always trying to seem perfect in front of everyone. You might find it relatable. It's called Bloom Into You.",False,False

You literally just described me in high school. Then of course after being broken for like 2 years I tried again in college and that didn't work out. I'm sure you'll find that this persona isn't worthwhile. You'll be happier if you let the people around you see the different sides of you. The people who really care about you will still be there for you and you'll have much more fulfilling relationships because of your openness. Admittedly it is very hard to get from where you're at to where you could be happy, but I think that it's worth it. Although I kinda went from not sharing any honest facts about myself at all to sharing absolutely any detail at the slightest sign of interest and now I'm working on reeling that back in a bit to a reasonable middle ground, but this middle ground is starting to feel pretty nice.  I think this is a situation where seeking some form of outside council would be beneficial. You don't need to be open about your eating disorder, that's not what I'm referring to. Just find somebody, probably a professional, who you can talk to about this persona you've put on and see if they can help you find the real you somewhere in the rubble of everything that came crashing down. You're in there somewhere :) You just need to find where.",False,False
