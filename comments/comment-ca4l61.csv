You could need a probiotic or more/less fiber.   You could have an undiagnosed allergy or intolerance.   It could be stress induced.   Story time: I was told to take a multivitamin my first time in treatment. I hate pills so I got the powder that makes a fizzy drink. When my GI symptoms werenâ€™t resolving after weeks of eating, my dietitian took a closer look at the meal plan including the vitamin thing. Turns out it had sorbitol, a fake sweetener, in it. That was acting as a laxative for me.",False,False

You've fucked up your digestive system, even if you didn't do permanent serious damage, you still wreaked havoc by doing something the body shouldn't have been doing. So it is re learning some core things, like how to properly digest food on a regular basis.   And of course, digestive issues cause farting.",False,False
