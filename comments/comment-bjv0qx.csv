Tell him once you don't want to hear any more jokes about your food intake, write it down, and then when he inevitably does it again, report it and include the date you warned him and the words you used.

Like the kind where people can just say whatever they want to each other? Or would this be something that if others had been around they would have been shocked and uncomfortable? Not saying go to HR but simply writing down the date and time and a quick summary of it and keeping it for your records may be a good idea.

There‚Äôs all kinds of quips and advice that could be suggested but 1) you didn‚Äôt ask for advice and 2) those things always come off brilliant in movies but are a little different in real life.
