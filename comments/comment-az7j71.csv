It turns out I just had chronic gastritis after being on some medication from a recent sickness that irritated my stomach. They gave me some medication that helped reduce the vomiting, ate plain foods and I had to stay away from stuff like ibuprofen, and then I was better in a few months.  You may not necessarily have gastritis, but you may have irritated your stomach in some way that it has caused this issue. Definitely please see a doctor, some issues that can cause vomiting like you are describing lead to other complications such as stomach ulcers. ",False,False
