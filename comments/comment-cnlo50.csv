I was a really chubby teenager, I ate whatever I wanted. My family had a very poor diet that consisted of us eating mainly chicken fingers, fries, onion rings, hot dogs, bacon, soup and pb&amp;j sandwiches. loads of dressings and oil. And everything cooked in a deep fryer. Whole boxes of granola bars as snacks. Chocolate milk and Popcorn as a daily snack. I had no idea what most vegetables tasted like.  Fast forward, I'm near my late teens. I lose a lot of weight from depression, OCD and just disinterest in general. Lived in a very mentally unstable home. Both parents depressed, controlling and distant. I fought with my dad hours per day. I spent most of my time in my room. My teens were very traumatizing to me, so many not so great memories. I've blocked most out by now.  I move out when I'm 18, across the country. I develop HORRIBLE binge problems. I had no idea what calories were. I just ate whatever I felt. Because I was an adult who made my own decisions. Whole large pizzas in one sitting multiple times a week. Double BLT quarter pounder meals. With cheeseburgers. Always getting seconds at dinner. Fried chicken for lunch. Drank so much Coke. So. Much. Mayo. Lordy. I was just shoveling it down.   About 2 years later, I've definitely packed down the pounds. I decide to start ""dieting"". I had/have horrible body dismorphia and I couldn't even look at myself in the mirror. I have never been able to wear shorts. Or anything tight. My body made me want to cry.   First was the Paleo craze. I followed that without calorie counting for a while. No weight loss change, until I cut out sugar completely. I came to the conclusion that the paleo diet wasn't for me, and i needed my carbs back.   I went vegan.  This alone was the final trigger. I adopted the whole plant based diet. I dropped pounds like CRAZY. I thought it was the miracle diet. I became obsessed. Slowly, started keeping more track. Couldn't stop tracking my calories. Dropped about 50 pounds total. I was weighing myself constantly every day. I started developing fear foods. Started getting stuck in food routine. Caused many issues in my relationship. Could not stop thinking about food CONSTANTLY. How to eat MORE food for LESS calories. Cookies? no. Pizza? DEFINITELY NO. Ate very little for about a year.  Fast forward to now, still hate myself as much as ever. Threw away my scale. Gained probably around 15 pounds back. Keep wanting to ""recover"" but then by the time the evening comes, I regret all of my decisions like an endless cycle. Have started fighting with purging and urges to purge. Still cant stop thinking about food constantly. Can't eat over 1350 without feeling mass amounts of anxiety. EDs suck. I just want to be a normal person again. And enjoy a slice with my friends. Instead of stuck in this endless number game and basing my whole life around how eat less and get skinnier.",False,False

Honestly, looking back I was a very cute little kid and there was nothing wrong with me, but I got bullied relentlessly for it. Thinking about this still boils my blood because the seed for disordered eating was planted in me in kindergarten. No kid deserves to be so highly aware of food and their weight at under five years old. It didn‚Äôt help that throughout my childhood I was drawn to underweight girls, surrounding myself by friends who were always a solid 20 pounds lighter than me. I started to develop early as well ‚Äî wow did that put gasoline on my ED fire. I started needing to wear bras in fifth grade and got my period at 10. And then my hips and the unwanted comments. I was catcalled for the first time in sixth grade and that gut wrenching feeling still haunts me (while my friends laughed it off, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so lucky ‚Äî he likes you‚Äù). Additionally, more fuel for this inferno, I was an avid swimmer; I had been in a pool for as long as I could remember. I loved the sport. Somewhere in seventh grade I started to compare myself to the younger girls; no curves, spines poking out. Something changed and whenever I caught my reflection in the locker room mirror, I winced. Those racing one pieces look flattering on no one, though.  I went to practice less and less, and by 8th grade I stopped coming all together. 8th grade is also the year I became a vegan, a former friend commented ‚Äúwow you‚Äôre obsessed with food, are you capable of talking about anything else?‚Äù, and I began to purge. The spiral that was my high school experience revolved around a constant cycle of relapse and recovery. Bulimia took away any chance I had at a happy adolescence, plucked my friends out of my life one by one, walled me off from reality.

Both my parents have messed up relationships with food so I don't think I ever stood a chance of coming out without some kind of disordered eating, lmao.  I can pinpoint when I started restricting to the day. I went out and met a friend of mine - ""friend"" - and the whole experience was so disgustingly unpleasant because it made me realise that not only did this friend never give two shits about me, and never would, but also that the vast majority of average people felt the same way. We ended up talking about dieting/weight loss and it was such a thoroughly depressing and frustrating conversation that I just felt disgusted with my friend and also with myself.   I was so upset and hurt by the things they said, and how they acknowledged that they were fucked up/biased, but that they had no intention to change - and it's like the futility of existence just smacked me in the face full-force. One of my few friends didn't care about me and thought I was lazy, disgusting, etc. And their views reflected pretty much everyone else's I was going to meet. And it was no longer a matter of trying to convince anyone - the truth was that they could be fully convinced and still not change their attitude. I wanted to stop existing.  I started heavy restricting the very next day out of a mixture of self-hatred and spite. I was punishing myself for being disgusting and a fuckup, and I wanted to hurt my friend by losing weight in the least healthy way possible. Then it quickly became addictive - I feel like my eating can only exist at either polar extreme, severe restriction or severe over-eating, and flipping a switch from one to the other was surprisingly easy compared to the moderate in-betweens I'd tried before.  That was about a year ago. Now... it's very different. I don't hate this friend, and I don't want to punish them, but I don't like or trust them either. The last time we met they said something positive about my weight loss (as close to being supportive as they are capable) and it made me realise I particularly didn't want their approval. I don't want to hurt them with this. I used to think about ""revealing my secret"" and everyone feeling badly for me, and reflecting on themselves, but now I don't want anyone to find out. I just want to quietly reach my GW (if that ever happens) and see if I can stop.  Sorry this was so long, I just thought it was a really interesting question. I always wondered if anyone else could pinpoint the start of their disorder this exactly, lol.
