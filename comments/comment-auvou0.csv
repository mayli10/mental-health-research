I've been vegan for about 5 years now (purely ethical reasons, not ED related) and I honestly don't even mentally consider animal products as food anymore so when I see that I get confused for a minute. I will say that before I was vegan most of my safe foods were dairy products like yogurt or cottage cheese. Out of curiosity I looked at MFP logs from like 2012 and I was SHOCKED at what I used to eat  &amp;#x200B;",False,False

Not a vegan, but I'm lactose intolerant and cheese sets it off more than any other kind of dairy. So when one of my friends told me cheese was a safe food for them I was just like ""hOW????"" lmao  Also omg I feel you on being shocked by some of the ingredients and/or calories in vegan recipes or foods! So often I see vegan foods that are loaded with sugar, fat, or both. (LOOKING THE FUCK AT YOU, CASHEW 'CHEESECAKE'. God. Cashews are delicious but so damn calorific ugh.)",False,False
