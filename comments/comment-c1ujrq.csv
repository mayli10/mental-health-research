Especially if you both come from families where this is a hot topic. That is all.    Sending you positive vibes, my dear. This too shall pass.",False,False

My SO is a wonderful, supportive person who could not care any less about the ups and downs  my weight and skin have gone through over the last few years. I am 100% sure of this and his actions have shown as such.  However, he does feel the need to tell me what his parents say about me for the sake of transparency (and I am guilty of encouraging this)—much like how you might tell a friend if someone is shit-talking them behind their back.  Idk how to go forward with this because on one hand, I do want to know what his parents say about me... But on the other hand, maybe I should ask him to filter out the appearance-based commentary for the sake of my mental health.",False,True

It needs to be discussed.  If it was unintentional (""I was just telling you what she said"") he needs to understand why it was harmful.  If it was intentional, then it's a form of emotional abuse.
