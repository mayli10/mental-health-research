I am having this exact problem!!! I wish both of us luck and support and I am honestly going to follow this, waiting for suggestions!! the only thing i can think of doing is pre-packing some safe foods because it's only the weekend (not that long in the grand scheme) and maybe having some snacks I trust can help. Maybe you could do the same? If it's an option for you :(? Honestly this is the only thing that is maybe helping me. I've never had this much of an issue with eating before (i've restricted but im in NEW DEPTHS) and it's the first time i think i've been this far away outside of school in a social \~fun\~ time setting.",False,False
