My migraines cause seizures and stuff, and you can't die from a migraine but you can die from side effects of your migraine.   Not only that but if the diet stop my migraines (not including those triggered by weather or my enviroment), then the diet is supposed to be for the rest of my life",False,True

(I get normal migraines and they're just awful). I really hope you can find a way to manage them.   and hey, apparently abdominal migraines do sometimes spontaneously go away in some people. I'm not sure what your doctor meant about dying so young, like if it was about the mental health side of dealing with it or if you have some other complicating factor, but abdominal migraines should almost never be so fatal in and of themselves.   oh, also, you should check out lactaid ice cream. I don't think it should have coconut unless you get coconut flavored; it's basically normal ice cream with lactase (the enzyme for digesting lactose that you're lacking) added in. lactose intolerance can also develop secondary to ED recovery/refeeding and to prolonged malnutrition and when that's the case it does often go away in time, though it can take over a year.",False,False

The reason why my elimination diet is so long is because I have ocular migraines, abdominal migraines, and vestibular migraines.   I have no idea if it's zinc, it just says ""chocolate"" and under drinks it says ""chocolate milk""",False,True
