People have been telling me this since I was first in treatment in high school and I never *ever* believed it until I experienced it. Even about six months ago, I remember just deciding that being fat was worth it if it meant recovery. I had no faith in my body.  The app Sober Time has been helpful for me. It's basically just a counter for the last time I've purged. It's kind of the ""cold turkey"" solution that may not work for everyone. Basically one of my motivations right now is that I don't want to reset it. I am so proud of these 3+ months that I don't want to see that number drop down to zero. In the beginning, I would get maybe 3 days, but then I would challenge myself to get 4, and so forth.  There have been a handful of times recently (Thanksgiving being one of them) when I really, desperately wanted to purge. I am able to talk myself out of it by saying things like, ""This fullness is only temporary. Purging will not make me feel better in the long run. I would not want my loved ones to purge, so why should I want that for myself?""  I also have a few friends I can reach out to in these moments who will talk me out of it.  Comforting myself helps: putting on soft loose pajamas, wrapping up in soft blankets, drinking a cup of ginger tea if I can stomach it, cuddling with my cat.  And distractions: put on my favorite sitcoms. Nothing to dark or hard to follow. Normally a book won't do it.  Each time you refrain from purging, it will become easier, even if it's really difficult in the moment. It's worth the temporary pain of a full stomach to achieve your goals. My therapist says that quitting purging is also the first step to quitting overeating in the first place. You won't continue to overeat if you know you purging isn't an option anymore, because overeating is so uncomfortable (mentally and physically).  For me, it's kind of like exercising a muscle. It's not fun to work out, it hurts, but if you don't make yourself, you will not progress.   Sorry, this got long. I hope it's somewhat helpful!",False,True

At my LW, my face and upper body looked gaunt and hollow, but my stomach and thighs were still holding weight. I only looked good fully clothed. Once I saw the scale hit 150 I freaked out and started purging again, so take the weight loss as slowly as you can! Remember that there's nothing wrong with being at 140.",False,True

I was scared people would think I was being preachy or something, but I just wanted to share my experience in case it could help anyone.   But yes, write it down and post it somewhere!
