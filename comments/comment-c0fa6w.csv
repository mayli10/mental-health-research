I found it really entertaining in a way. She became so entrenched in her disorder that she did some of the craziest things, which I'm sure a lot of us can relate to. The part where she ran up and down the stairs to her apartment stood out to me.  I agree with many reviews on the book that she didn't discuss the recovery process until the last 30 pages of the book. All of the second half of the book was basically a spiral downwards into her eating disorder. It reminded me of the film American Psycho at times, just in terms of how dark it gets in places.  I liked that her final sentiment was that she is better. I think that's all anyone can ask for when they hit rock bottom like that. That said, I would say she's a lot better, but I find it hard to believe she totally recovered 100% (which she implied). The things she said about becoming vegan still rubbed me the wrong way, as though she was doing them because she still has a fear of fat in her food (the greasy texture of crisps?). I wasn't exactly buying that it was 100% about the animals.  It was a great book. I liked how crazy it got in places while still being completely realistic. I can see how it would be triggering for people though.",False,False
