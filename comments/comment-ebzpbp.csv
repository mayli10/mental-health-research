I’d been talking to my boss about something and our conversation stopped mid-sentence as we both just stared at her in shock and horror. She couldn’t understand why— said she “thought they were for everyone” then laughed. Didn’t even apologise.  I wasn’t actually active in my ED at that time, but I had lost and was continuing to lose a significant amount of weight due to stress/ongoing trauma/depression. Eating didn’t occur to me much and even when it did, there were very few things I could actually stomach. My weight loss was so severe that people (my boss, a few coworkers and regular visitors) would go out of their way to bring me food and remind me to eat, and people were expressing concern either directly to me or to my boss pretty much every day. So the fact that this woman (a regular visitor who must have been aware of the issue) had the nerve to take my food with absolutely no shame or regret was especially fucked given the circumstances.",False,False
