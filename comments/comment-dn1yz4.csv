And a starved brain also doesn't necessarily *need* to make sound food decisions. If you were a starved hunter who suddenly found a dead buffalo, why wouldn't you binge on it?  &gt;If someone is genuinely afraid of going into binge eating, it's not really helpful to tell them to just binge through it.   Yeah, the same goes for whatever fear. I am incredibly afraid of having breakfast and snacks (and also quite afraid to have lunch), to the point that I sometimes can't sleep if I know I'll be forced to eat them the next day; therefore, according to this logic, any meal plan that includes any meals other than dinner isn't sensible/helpful.

My blood sugar still hasn't calmed down. Night sweats are miserable. It's horrible.  That goes for normal meals as well. If anything, binges accelerate the normalization process.  Note that I do not *encourage* binges, mostly because I feel that they can make a person prone to relapses - BUT theoretically, if someone CAN make it through the fear and the anxiety and all the panic, then binges in recovery aren't anything inherently wrong or bad or despicable.

Of course a lot has changed in the last 15 years and now the data all pretty much shows that nutritional rehabilitation predicts the best outcomes for ED recovery.   &gt;Mh, do they? Or do they deep down know what they want but they are actually too scared to do it?  Our bodies and minds change in response to how we feed them. Restriction will cause people to be food obsessed and changes brain chemistry. It's not a matter of having the ""willpower"" to overcome this. It's not ""pushing aside a fear"". A starved brain can't make necessarily sound food decisions on it's own. If someone is genuinely afraid of going into binge eating, it's not really helpful to tell them to just binge through it.   &gt;Of course it's painful, you wouldn't have an ED if it wasn't  It's physical pain. That fucked up digestion catches up to you. I was constipated for months. My blood sugar still hasn't calmed down. Night sweats are miserable. It's horrible.",False,False

Or do they deep down know what they want but they are actually too scared to do it? Most recovered people say that if you do give into those cravings, whatever they are, they are going to stop at some point and you're naturally going to crave a balanced, normal diet. I am not recovered myself, so I can't say it, but I know that recovery is supposed to be about regaining that trust, not delegating it to some external authority.  Of course it's painful, you wouldn't have an ED if it wasn't. But that's not the point, isn't it. Also, I am fully aware that people are just going to listen to their ED anyways - but aren't we supposed to at least try to spread positive, motivational information on the sub?   (I am not being hostile, just genuinely wondering - it's a very complex issue after all)",False,False

Speaking from my corner (restriction), going to maintenance calories from restricting is *painful*, let alone eating more than that. I mean, making a jump from sub 1000 cal a day to 3000+ is...dangerous, to be honest.   After a little bit in recovery mode yes, absolutely go for whatever you want. Front line advice should never be “trusting your body” because for all the obsessive food information people with EDs have, when it comes down to it those bodies don’t know how tf to eat.",False,False

I mean, there are lots of people who are already so scared to give in to their hunger because they feel they can't trust it - it's basically the number 1 fear for most people with an ED.

Or they have insane exercise routines.  Can't beat biology. Doesn't work like that. They aren't packing back 4,000+ calories a day and staying that small with great muscle tone without lying. Whether to themselves or us, who knows.  Entirely plausible they think they're eating more than they actually do, though.  It's actually a huge pet peeve of mine because it's not realistic to perpetuate 1. that an eating disordered person's body ""knows what it needs"" (anyone who gives this advice - run. Your body doesn't know wtf to do after extended restriction/bingeing/purging/overexercising) and 2. that anyone can overeat for literally months/years and not get overweight. Eating disorder recovery goddess stereotypes aren't above the laws of the body. They aren't being totally honest about what they're doing. Which is their choice! Just don't believe that this is the way recovery has to go (it isn't) or that what they're choosing to show is what they're truly doing.  ETA-I don't want this to deter anyone from recovery. Proper supports will absolutely teach you how to eat again. You can totally do this. Just remember IG isn't real life.",False,False
