The only Calories that will ever be absorbed are the ones that make it past your pyloric sphincter (basically the tiny door between the stomach and the small intestine). That statistic you referenced is mostly a scare tactic. In reality, Calories expelled has everything to do with, frankly, how good of a purger you are (this includes factors like time from the start of the binge to the purge, if a person consumes dense foods he can't get up, how quick the person's stomach at emptying, etc.) Some people can't get much up, but others can get like 90%+ up. It really depends.  What is virtually impossible, though, is for a b/p to result in a net intake of 0 Calories. That's usually enough for me to get put off b/p'ing. Even if I'm an amazing purger and only retain like 200 Calories after a 5K+ Cal binge, I don't have he Caloric budget for those extra 200 Calories. I don't have the budget for even 1 extra Calorie that isn't meticulously planned/accounted for. But YMMV",False,False

I'm fairly certain they use that number as a scare tactic to convince people not to purge. But, as it is, it's probably best to assume Calories get digested before you purge. Purging is a way to get rid of some of the calorie damage of a binge, but the drawbacks are pretty severe.   Try your best not to rely on purging and stay safe ❤  ",False,False
