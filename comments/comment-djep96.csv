He has a bit of muscle tone, and he’s probably around 165 lbs. it’s a healthy weight for him, his age, and his height. When we first met, I was almost the same weight as him. It would drive me insane, especially when we would have sex. I felt disgusted next to him, especially considering I’m 5’6, so the weight disbursed differently on me than it did on him. I used that as motivation to get smaller than him. Talking to his parents recently, his dad pointed out when they first met me, I was heavier than I was now. A few days ago, we were talking about how I have to lift 50 lb bags at work, and his dad was like “ISNT that like half your body weight?! You’re like what, 100 lbs?” Idk why, but the ED part loved hearing that. I love my BF, but he unintentionally motivated me to lose weight just so I wouldn’t have to worry about being bigger than him. Even today, I am terrified of gaining, just bc I love being so tiny next to him.",False,False

My boyfriend weighs like 10lbs less than me and when he weighs himself he jokingly tells me to come over and look how fat he is. Every time it takes off of my strength not to grab that glass scale and crack it over his pretty little head 😅,False,False
