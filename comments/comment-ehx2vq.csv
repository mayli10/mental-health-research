My main motivation right now is that I legitimately enjoy exercising and being active and I just *can't* when I'm eating hundreds of kcal below even my BMR. That, and I just bought clothing in my current size and my favorite brand of jeans only goes one size lower so...would really prefer not to have to switch jeans brands.   Idk. It helps that even though my eating is super disordered, it's more symptomatic of other issues rather than me having any genuine desire to become skeleton.",False,True

I know it's easier said than done but don't beat yourself up over it. Considering change is okay and part of the process. I can't tell you how many days I spent considering adding another food to my safe list when I was really underweight. It took... a really long time.",False,False

But like, I feel like I'm not even at the point of *doing* any of the assignments yet, just downloading the syllabus for the fourth time.",False,True
fcofklk,t3_ehx2vq,t1_fcocbas,tigerchik,1,2019-12-31 16:23:51,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/ehx2vq/trying_to_recover_before_it_actually_gets_serious/fcofklk/,"that all makes sense and is totally valid. If this analogy works - it's like taking a class (in HS, college, whatever). If you looked at all the homework and projects at once it'd be overwhelming and a single assignment might not feel like you're making huge progress, but it is. A slight calorie increase will slow the rate of weight loss, and that's a step. And yes, it is hard as fuck",False,False

Like all my tastes lean naturally towards lower calorie stuff. Seeing daily kcal pass a certain number looks overwhelming, and then when I realize it's still so far below maintenance I just kind of get defeated.",False,True

The getting-full-very-quickly is very real. Your tummy has shrunk. Some digestive enzymes might help. Can you drink some ensures? Also try lots of small ""meals"", like maybe you can do 5 x 200 calories for a few days and gradually increase your intake.",False,False

I visit r/fatlogic almost habitually and breaking that habit is going to be *hard*. They're not pro-ED, but sometimes it's hard to separate higher-weight recovery from fatlogic, I guess? Does that make sense?",False,True
