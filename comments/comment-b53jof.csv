Even my family who knows I struggled with bulimia for years congratulates me, my boyfriend’s parents said “you look amazing and you must feel wonderful!” Yes I feel wonderful. My breath smells from purging I’m lightheaded because I haven’t eaten anything but coffee and green tea today, I have a breakdown every morning when I look in the mirror or weigh myself, yes I feel amazing. Idk it sucks because a lot of people don’t assume eating disorder. My family thinks I’m recovered enough to not let it affect me I guess but it hurts they haven’t even checked up once to see if my bulimia relapsed. Like they just haven’t asked. Even my boyfriend and my friend who I confessed my disordered thoughts and behaviors don’t seem to care much. Okay my boyfriend does he wants to make sure I eat enough and don’t purge but he still is happy I’m losing weight and tells me I look great and I should be happy that he’s proud of me but it just feeds into my fears that he wishes I were much skinnier.   I don’t know it’s hard because like I said most people don’t assume that. But I really want to get skinny enough that people start to get worried. It feels like everyone is happy that I’m getting thin and no one cares how I get there",False,False

I went from clinically obese to normal weight in just over a year by starving and over exercising, and people just can’t seem to fathom how that could ever be a bad thing.
