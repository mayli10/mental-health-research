Could never make myself do it even though I really wanted to. Anyway, that’s another story. I wanted to comment and say that I kind of envy this. I have too many emotions that I can’t get to go away. I binge and feel better for 10 min and then feel terrible again. Worst. Is it terrible I am kind of jealous? I know that’s sick to say. ",False,False

Like a true stomach problem that if I don't get rid of it I feel almost like I will just die. To be honest those are actually satisfying purges, but after 30 mins. that ends.   &amp;#x200B;  It's a relief for me, but then I do get that blank feeling as well.  Especially the next day. It kind of sends me in a spiral of deep depression for a few days. ",False,False
