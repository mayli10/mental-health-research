I seem see it used in the opposite way a great deal though? As if the responsibility for management lies with the outside world? (Which seems like a veritable recipe to end up in distress.)",False,False

Leaning more towards tough-ish love. Trying to shock people into reality. Don’t ask for tips, realize you aren’t living ! We’re all paralyzed by FEAR because of “calories” and “weight”. we all have different stories, all lot of us come from backgrounds of abuse and trauma. I know this isn’t a recovery sub but I thought there was a general understanding that it wasn’t pro ana either. Block Ana, that fake stupid bitch. She had lied to every single one of you. Be healthy, be happy, be free. Don’t let food be the thing you’re scared of and know there’s always hope. don’t even know ya’ll but i love you, and I’m thinking of you and I know you can be skinny in a safe way, where you don’t feel like dying every second of the day or hate yourself.

SO high restrict, if you’re under your tdee you’ll lose weight and ed’s are usually abt control or body issues. so i promise you’re getting closer to your gw and also in control. i haven’t been eating sugar too much just a little, it’s a good idea to get your daily calories no matter how low mostly from healthy food. have replacement snacks of things you’d usually binge on. i use seaweed chips (literally just nori with salt) instead of chips.  but by the same token if you rlly rlly are craving something and you’ve already drunk heaps of water and what not. eat it. tell yourself the amount you can have and don’t go over. once again self control. it’s ok if you do tho, i promise you it won’t effect your progress.  start eating breakfast later and dinner earlier and don’t eat outside of allocated eating times. it means it’s harder for you to just snack and you’ll end up eating less. if your issue is you want to lose weight there are many healthy ways to do it and i’d highly recommend you look into something like weight lifting. having a sport where you need to be strong is probably the only reason this stupid disease hasn’t killed me. it shifts your focus and helps you see food in a different light. all in all i can say “i hope you find help and stay safe and all that” and i want that for you, but it’s condescending and we anas hear it a lot. so i’ll just say i love you and i hope you find some happiness soon.",False,True
