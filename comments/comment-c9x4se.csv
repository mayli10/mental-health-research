I grew up with bipolar disorder and although I'm currently being treated for it, all of my meds are low-dosage, so I still experience the highs and lows to an extent. And because of this, I'm constantly stuck in periods where I'm ""recovering"" and then restricting. It's tough.   I'm not in a relationship so I can't relate there, but I understand where you're coming from to an extent. And it sucks.",False,False
