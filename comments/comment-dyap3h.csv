Anorexia or dieting doesn’t cause your set point to climb higher and higher every time you relapse. You aren’t permanently doomed to weigh more than you did before every time you recover. Promoting that idea is dangerous and keeps people from being willing to recover.,False,False

For most people, its unrealistic to only eat food with known calories and even a good fitness tracker can only estimate calories out. I think set point theory comes in because people have to go by hunger cues and how energetic they feel.",False,False

It's not based in any science and outright defies the logic of physics.   Weight is ultimately simple. TDEE and calorie knowledge are the only tools you need, and all this other bunk science is just scare tactics.",False,False

From what I’ve seen, though, a decent amount of post-restriction weight gain can be attributed to bingeing or overeating due to not being able to recognize hunger signals. I think this is one of the reasons people don’t advise restricting too much, even if it’s a safe amount of calories.",False,False
