Idk the science don‚Äôt take me at my word but I imagine you‚Äôre more likely to die in your sleep. I was watching Supersize Vs Superskinny and a lady was talking about when her daughter died and the poor girl just went ‚ÄòMum I‚Äôm tired‚Äô and she went to sleep and that was it she died.

Very rarely am I feeling anxious or anything, it just doesn‚Äôt know how to shut up and go to sleep. The internet says it‚Äôs my ed‚Äôs fault, and I‚Äôm not about to fight that claim but I‚Äôm also not a doctor, so who knows if it‚Äôs true. All this to say, the extreme lack of sleep got a little ridiculous and I decided to go to a doctor a few weeks ago because I‚Äôm really tired of it (pun intended) and she gave me some really heavy sleep medication. I‚Äôm not talking melatonin, that doesn‚Äôt do a thing for my disordered ass. Nah, she hit me with some sort of prescription that rocks my shit within hours of taking it and, to be frank, life is better. Now I get closer to 6-7 hours a night, which is great in comparison to the 6-7 every four days. Needing to be medicated isn‚Äôt ideal but my doctor knows about my ed and she said we can work on getting my general wellness back in line together. Idk you and your situation, but a doctor really helped me in mine, hope that info helps somehow! reach out to people who can help bc you absolutely do not have to live like that, hope you get some rest soon my friend",False,False
