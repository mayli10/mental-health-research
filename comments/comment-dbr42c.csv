And of course my digestive system is still not a fan, but it's getting better. More frequent, smaller meals are way easier on your system than trying to eat three large meals.  We can do this!! One meal at a time.",False,False

And let's not talk about my digestive system as well...That's... an unfortunate story...  I hope the best for you, tho!!I like to think that each step we make consuming all the nutritious food that our bodies desire will lead us to a healthier life and eventually  freedom... :)))",False,True

I'm on like, week 2 of trying to recover from the typical restriction-based anorexia. I think everyone hits it at a different time but there's definitely a phase of recovery I've heard referred to as ""extreme hunger""- I'm not tracking calories but hoo boy I think I'm in the midst of it rn. I cannot be stopped. I've been awake for an hour and I've already had three pieces of toast with peanut butter and jelly. God knows I'll probably end the day around 4K or more! And it's been _hell_  on my digestive system.",False,False

Your body is trying to mend itself after being denied proper nutrients for so long. You're not developing a new bad habit, I promise. But if you're super worried then talk to a nutritionist or someone who has a grasp on ED recovery. Good luck!",False,False
