As in, someone with Anorexia May have no interest in eating, no appetite or desire to eat, not really an intention of weight loss. Anorexia Nervosa being more about intentional weight loss. When you said when you get very depressed, you stop eating, I thought it might be the former. Neither is less or more, just different in approach to recovery. I wish I could offer some kind of inspiration but I can‚Äôt. You have responsibilities, you know what‚Äôs at stake. I‚Äôm so terribly sorry that you‚Äôre still struggling. It must break your heart.
