Local food is relatively healthy (I'm thinking noodle soups, rice with savory side dishes and vegetables. Steamed seafood is also a big thing there and very low in calories) and the portion size is much smaller than in, say, America. All in all, be easy on yourself and enjoy this vacation!",False,False
