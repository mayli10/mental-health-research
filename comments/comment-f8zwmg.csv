Would not recommend. I was so sick and actually regretted it so much that I forced myself to gain weight. Feel free to PM if you want to talk.,False,False

I’ve ran through 3 GWs in the last year and my newest is gonna put me in the hospital (as if my current isn’t already gonna do that). Don’t lower it please. You’re already too small even if someone said something stupid.  EDIT: Did the math. Your new GW might stop your heart and will absolutely make you hospital-bound.,False,False
