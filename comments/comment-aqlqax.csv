I have either had to avoid chocolate bars, sweets, and bread altogether (which isn't a normal mindset) or I binge/purge them. Having just one serving of my trigger foods is a challenge and really good practice.  Of course, I do agree that the snack foods should be incorporated with healthy options, but not as many people need practice eating lettuce. In a short term recovery program, I think going head first into the challenge foods is probably the most efficient way to go about it.",False,False

While they did make me gain to my current fat fuck bmi, they encouraged healthy habits like lots of proteins and healthy fats, and told me that I could just supplement my healthy diet with ensure or coconut oil in coffee if I was losing. But they definitely encouraged balanced healthy food. But not being AFRAID of sweets and stuff is important. I'm pretty hyperglycemic tho so i gotta watch those anyway. ",False,False

I used to be part of a recovery program where we’d go out to eat as a group. But it was always unhealthy places - burger joints, pizza, pasta, etc to challenge our fear foods. And yeah that’s fine occasionally but you’re making me go 3 times a week and eating like this isn’t healthy on a regular basis. I quit shortly after. ",False,False

I'm peak orthorexia at the moment, and no one gives a shit bc I run and eat whole foods or whatever.. I had a panic attack followed by a 3-day nervous breakdown last week when there was a blizzard and I couldn't go to the gym and my mom made me vegan hot chocolate.  ..... Butttttt I have a very normal BMI so everything's ok I guess. Bc 'all girls diet' lmao. This stupid fucked-up system basically encourages people to slowly kill themselves just so they can get some help :( ",False,False

Yeah, it makes me feel like all they give a damn about is how much I weigh. My health, my diet, my fitness? I can sort that out by myself when I hit their precious little milestone, they couldn't give half a fuck how I feel or my physical state as long as it isn't paired with malnutrition ",False,True

I will eat my 1000 calories in steamed broccoli before I waste them on ice cream and syrup.  Oh dude, good luck. I wore two layers, had marbles in my pockets and chugged so much water I felt like it was going to explode from my mouth every time I opened it. I still showed up as losing. I had them *agreeing to walks* before the weigh in. ",False,True

When I went to treatment, almost all the options they offered were these horrendously unhealthy foods they pushed on us bc ""cHAlleNGe yOuR FEaRs"" and shit. They preached this bullshit about how ""all food is good food"". Like bruh stop trying to convince my ortho/anorexic ass that pizza and oreos are nutritionally equal to brown rice or almonds lol  I feel you on the weight loss bit too. I'm in some deep shit if I can't figure out how to cover up my weight loss by tomorrow. Best of luck to the both of us I guess",False,False
