""BIG MOOD,"" as the kids are fond of saying  oh wow I have normal hunger cues again and more energy and hormone levels? great. but I'm also unable to control my eating and my body is a pile of bloat",False,False

Firstly, having a hobby that gives you a sense of achievement that isn't related to your body. Mine is drawing. Also I try to think positively that I have so much more time for drawing, because I'm not over-exercising etc.  Secondly, finding non-weight related ways to feel good about your appearance. Maybe I should believe that everyone is beautiful or that it doesn't matter, but I'm not ready for that yet. I used to wear the worst clothes I own if I wasn't going anywhere and didn't often even brush my hair. I've started wearing something beautiful and comfortable every day. No tight clothes that make me focus on my body.  Thirdly, I attempt to bend my ED ""rules"" and find loopholes in them instead of stopping disordered behavior cold turkey. I let myself have some less harmful ""rules"" as some kind of training wheels to retain control longer as I ease into recovery. This also makes weight gain moderately slow, so I won't be shocked by a sudden change.  And finally, I've spent some time reading about mental health and trying to figure out the root causes of my ED and poor self-image. Seeing experiences that are shockingly similar to mine printed on paper has made my attitude towards myself kinder. It's now easier to believe that I'm not actually a waste of space, but that it's the mental illness that makes me think that way.",False,False

This can be the scariest time of your life but you have shown the strength to own it and speak about it and give it form.   It must feel so disorientating and confusing. You spent your whole life scarifying life events, opportunities and indulgences for one overall goal. The control and maintenance of your weight.   Now it’s a new lifestyle, new rules and new challenges. It’s over whelming and it feels like a betrayal of who you are as person. It feels like you’re doing something wrong. Everyone around you just wants to see you healthy again so they can’t understand “why weight gain is such a big thing. Cause you need to gain weight.” This must feel like the worst time of your life. The loss of control over your weight, the feeling of despair. While around you family and friends praise and take comfort in your weight gaining (to them you are getting healthy again. Weight Gain = Old You + Healthy You.)  Well that’s how I felt. That’s what I experienced when I was recovering. I hated every moment of it.     It’s a tricky one and I can only speak for myself.        It was 3 years ago I started putting on weight. I was 8 stone 10 pounds, I am six foot tall. I felt with every pound I gained, I was betraying all the hard work I had done. I remembered all my weight land marks.   Every time I stood on the scales and looked down I would cry. I just remember all the people I had driven away, all the failed relationships and life opportunities. For me though I wanted to die. I didn’t want to get better. I got better but not on my terms.   From your post above I think your handling this well. I think you have the mind set to work with your weight gain. These days always come for us when we have to gain weight, we can’t keep going down for ever. For me talking about it helped (talk myself out), being a passive subject of it helped (I have no control so let it play out), managing the lows and preparing myself mentally for my weight in’s helped (knowing I would be up in weight I was ready for the mental blow back).   This is the next part of your journey &amp; how we react to weight gain in treatment is the Omega. Its unique for each person. Keep a journal, get the mental energy from the reaction out through drawing, writing or talking. Move with the thoughts and move with the reaction. Try not to supress them or block them. Take their power away. You will find a way. I know you can.   I don’t think I helped much but I have been there &amp; it is lonely. So I just wanted to post and show you’re not alone, We all have been there and no matter how painful we came through it.",False,False

Think about all those times where it hurt to breathe deeply, where you always felt dizzy getting up, out of breath from walking too long, tried and cold constantly, than compare it to now, because of your recovery you can get back to doing things you love, without being distracted or disappointed in what you ate, now you can ran without your legs hurting,   now you can breathe the summer/winter/ air without your body being in pain. Now you can run up stairs and don’t have to catch your breath. Now you can start doing sport and not always feel constantly dizzy or overwhelmed.   This is just stating random things, I hope this wasn’t triggering, but everyday appreciate what your body can do now that you are healthy, safe and in recovery. I wish you all the best ♥️♥️",False,False
