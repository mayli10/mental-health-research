I only realise this now that I’ve put more weight back on. Less than 10 pounds ago, everyone was super duper concerned and my mom was even making grossed out faces at me because I was losing so much. Now no one says anything (except those “you look healthier” shit comments) and I HATE it. I didn’t realise how much I enjoyed the concern until I lost it and it’s not like I can be like, “oh hey I ate 500 calories today worry about me!” Because no one actually shows concern till you physically look the part.

People know I'm sick and they don't do anything. There's very little concern, just a few make sure you eat comments. I know if I were fucking skeletal they'd say something but that would take dropping 20+ pounds and realistically won't happen. I still try tho",False,False

My dad ridicules me for it, my mom is constantly asking me how many calories I think are in something, and reminds me to ""try not to eat foods that will upset your stomach, honey"" and ""you know, the Lord will forgive you if you have to eat sometimes"". Its been especially hard now that I started treatment and have an official diagnosis, because ive had to talk to my mom about it just because of all the doctors appointments and insurance and stuff.    I think, in my familys case, its just easier for them to not research it, not try to help, and just pretend I just have stomach problems and am on a diet. :/ fam tends to be a bit narcissistic so that could factor in as well. Good luck if you ever want to vent about parents and ED pls message me",False,False

For me it's sorta the opposite in that while I'm very glad that people want to help me, I feel like I told way too many people, and because of that I feel like I'm pushing people away since they are probably branding me now as ""the guy with an eating disorder"", and it's really starting to cause me distress since I've always put a lot of weight on what others think of me.  I told too many people about this, and it's really not good for me in the long run I don't think.",False,False

Parents are supposed to worry when their kids have mental health issues. Even if they don't know the severity, it's shitty to not show interest in what's going on. I'm sorry, pal. ",False,False
