PMDD is awful and I know folks who have that and bipolar and it is a tightrope to manage, but I’ve seen them have success! A good psychiatrist who can follow you closely is a godsend - answers are amazing!! Obviously, being in the hospital isn’t a party or anything but I freaking love hearing stories like yours! Possibilities and avenues open up with knowledge and you deserve to freaking own your life!!",False,False
