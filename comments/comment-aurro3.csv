When I was living at home it was all about getting me to stop eating... lol. But my heart still aches seeing that. I hate being forced to eat, and although I cave easier than that, the thought of someone doing this to me makes me feel sick.",False,False

I'm glad it'd there though. That shit's traumatic and deserves to have some light shed on it.,False,True

I have issues with sticky/messy food and that kind of force feeding would be awful for me.,False,False

I enjoyed Let Her Eat Cake. I will have to check out Skinny Love when I have more time!   I definitely would like to share this film on here, if it turns out alright. We’ve mostly been waiting for the weather to work with us so we can begin shooting. My only hesitation about posting it on here is that it would “out” my identity to reddit. I think I would share it on Peach though, just because it is a smaller group without a bunch of desperate trolls or potential stalkers haha. Do I have you added on there? If you have an account, that is. I only just started it a few days ago.",False,False

I've watched a lot of ED/mental health short films but only a few don't absolutely suck. [Pretty Strong](https://youtu.be/ihNvR_6S2YA) caught my attention- the concept is well-executed (if a little cliche) and the writing and direction are clear and professional. [Let Her Eat Cake](https://youtu.be/Fb3KM0iknj8) is short, concise, and powerful. [Skinny Love](https://youtu.be/v2ZXZv7caYU) was cute, and I found the story compelling with very little dialogue.",False,True

It was filmed in such a way that made it easy to pay attention to, and left the viewer with food for thought. Pun intended.  I am going to be in/helping with the creative directing of a short film this year about mental illness too, so I have been spending more time watching them to get inspiration.  Do you have any other favourites of yours that you would recommend?",False,False
