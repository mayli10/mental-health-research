The shit that I think helped the most (besides actually just growing out of puberty) was realizing that I am significantly more attractive without glasses (who knew!!! People have been telling me this for years but I couldn‚Äôt see anything good about my face), doing my brows (my face is large and kinda boxy. I always thought it was just unfortunate, but now with nice brows I think they even it out and make my face shape okay?), and learning how to do a very natural face of makeup (I don‚Äôt have the skill, energy, or desire to learn anything beyond that). Tbh I still saw myself as ugly for a long ass time, especially since most of this occurred post-treatment for me and I was heavier than I thought was attractive. The final thing that really helped (and more than anything, helped my confidence) was creating a wardrobe I love. I‚Äôm really broke so it was hard to get rid of lots of clothes (I stashed a few boxes at my mom‚Äôs house to start) and then would save $10-$20 from my tips and go thrifting once a week. This helped me to connect to my body and my style- I previously hated looking at myself in the mirror but I follow the ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt immediately love it, it‚Äôs a no‚Äù rule, and tried to be conscious of buying things I liked rather than what I thought I looked small in. Okay, sorry this has turned into a rant lmao but just thought I‚Äôd share some thoughts in case any of its helpful ‚ù§Ô∏è sending ya love and support!!!!",False,False

Like, it happened when I was 22. I was legit ugly until then, thought I was hopeless. Even if you find yourself unattractive, you might still have some growing to do.
