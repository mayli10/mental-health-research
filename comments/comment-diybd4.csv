Just... very numbers obsessive, the calorie and macro rules, agonizing over restaurant menus online before going out, etc etc. You get me. I can pretty well trace the sequence of bullshit to tell me that the ED got its foothold as a stress-coping/distraction/control outlet.   But I like numbers. I knew what number would make me underweight and never really... questioned it beyond that, if that makes sense? Never had a thought of ""well the number says yes, but the mirror says no"" or anything like that. Never fathomed getting to that number, and then got scared as I got closer and couldn't bring myself to adjust the rules I'd created. I don't want to be skinnier, but the intentional recovery weight gain is still hard, ngl.   Like just about anyone, I have parts of my body I like more or less than others, but that's not me being in denial about my size, that's just me being pear-shaped.",False,False

I spent tens of thousands of dollars, lost friends, did nothing but binge and purge for hours a day, sometimes all day. I was possessed and in mental anguish nearly every moment I wasn’t binging and purging.   My mom screamed at me most mornings for binging on food in the kitchen, in front of my other family members, and every time I’d be left a bawling mess and have to get into the school bus while holding back tears. My life was destroyed, I was kicked out, and it didn’t get any better from there, only I free from the abuse of my family.   Now I’m no longer in the throes of bulimia, nor do I feel controlled by food. But I can’t get over what happened; what I did, what a monster I am. The only way I can feel okay with myself in light of who I feel that I “really am” (see: a deformed bulimic) is by restricting.",False,False

I feel like when I’m average I just hold fat in the wrong spots. It’s not even that I have too much I just feel like I’m pudgy and I focus a lot on proportions. Like that my stomach isn’t thin enough compared to my legs. But I don’t see myself as obese. Sometimes I’ll obsess over a part of me though and feel like I am a bit chubby because of a certain way I saw myself in the mirror or so.,False,False

But not like, overweight fat. I just feel flabby and ugly. Like my body isn't right and I need to lose more weight to look ok. I guess I do acknowledge that I'm skinny? Kinda? I'm small but I feel fat.               I do think you have at least disordered eating, btw. You sound like me a few years ago. I'm full blown anorexic now, and recovered bulimic.",False,False

It’s basically as long as my thighs don’t touch much I’m pretty indifferent.   I care more about the numbers and control. I like that it’s essentially a form of self-harm and self-destruction no-one can really stop me from doing. I like my numbers being smaller, not necessarily my legitimate size or whatever. I like how secure I feel when I gain that control over my numbers and body and food. I weirdly like it when I lose that control and binge and then having to “fix” it. Like it’s a challenge. I like that when I am smaller things like clothes shopping get pretty effortless.   Like yeah, I’ll say I’m “fat”; but it’s more in that I connect it to being a glutton and weak of will than the actual body fat.",False,False

I am overweight but was obese when I started.  I obsessed about calories,  if I ate over an arbitrary amount I had to exercise to burn it off, I can not see my weight loss no matter what people tell me. In fact I dont believe the size of my pants, I still have this belief that they put the wrong size label in my new clothes even though I have had to drop multiple sizes. I can not eat certain foods without severe panic. I panic if someone asks me to eat something I haven't planned on eating.  I cant eat if someone comments on my food or what I am eating.  I will beat myself up for eating over my self imposed limit.  I obsessed over my weight daily and my mood would be up or down depending on the number on the scale.   I am trying to recover now and it's hard. I have been trying recovery for 6 weeks and I am still not eating enough for maintenance.  I now have severe hypotension requiring medication,  I am having palpitations and experiencing severe muscle pain.  I want to sleep constantly and I have to work. Recovery is hard, but continuing with my disorder is a deeper level of hell.",False,False
