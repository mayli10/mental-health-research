Adults aren't meant to consume lactose. We've just evolved to have a tolerance to it because humans are dumb and always have been dumb. Someone saw a cow and thought that drinking their milk would be a great ide, then they wanted to make the milk last longer and invented cheese. Lactose intolerance is still a widespread problem though and of course tolerance of lactose only goes so far. If you down a liter of milk you will regret it no matter who you are. Maybe not so much if it's lactose free milk though.",False,False

Perhaps even a stuffed pepper? It won't be a huge increase to calories and you won't have to feel envious anymore because you get to experience the cheese. The calcium and protein will of course also be good for you.,False,False
