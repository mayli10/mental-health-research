I would drinking a calming tea (I like valerian) and wear something loose and just try to focus on him. I can practically feel the anxiety, I know how uncomfortable a situation that must be.

Literal meltdowns. I used to beg my mom in high school to let me stay home because I didn‚Äôt like the way I look in my clothes (I was underweight). Even if I wore the same outfit a month before and liked the way I looked for whatever reason now I felt horrible in it. She would normally say yes but never saw it as a sign of an ED or BD. Just the other week I put in the effort to wear a cute outfit and I felt so great wearing a CROP TOP and little skinny jeans, make up and all. The guy I‚Äôm sleeping with comes over so we can go out and he‚Äôs just in shorts and a plain tee. I have a melt down. I felt so dumb and gross. Instantly fat seeing him in such a casual plain outfit. He knows about my ed so he helped me pick a new outfit that I felt better about.   I know I should be saying fuck it and be you! Wear what you want! But if it‚Äôs gunna make you sad and uncomfortable I wouldn‚Äôt wanna go either :-(. My only advice would be like a black shift dress with a cardigan over it. That‚Äôs always my go to since it‚Äôs basically a potato sack lol.",False,False
