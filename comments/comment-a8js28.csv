My mom's had to tell me more than once that she's borderline alcoholic, sometimes without visible symptoms it's easy to forget that a loved one had an ongoing problem. My dad forgot that I self harmed until I mentioned it again, it's annoying but it doesn't mean she doesn't love you a lot!",False,False

As a kid she would forget to pick me up from everywhere.. now she forgets I go to therapy for my ED and GA. I get frustrated but this is how she is and always has being. It is absolutely horrible and nerve wrecking inthe moment but deep inside I know that she is not doing it with bad intensions. I think she has a problem with her memory and how she copes with everything, cos she is never in a bad mood, so maybe she just has a brain that erases half of everything?",False,False

When I was in college and first got the AN diagnosis I called her on the way back from the clinic and told her about it.   Her exact response was, ""No, you're just stressed and being dramatic. You'll be fine when you come home for Christmas and relax.""  I proceeded to act like an absolute lunatic for the entirety of Christmas break (doing jumping jacks in the basement, lying about eating, refusing any and all food, body-checking multiple times a day) and she ignored all of it.
