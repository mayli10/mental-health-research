Your body doesn't work on a 24-hour basis; if you go days barely eating, and then on one day eat your recommended amount, your body is still reeling from the lack of food from the previous days. Plus, if you regularly go without eating or eat very small amounts, then on the days where you're eating what you should be, the part of your brain tasked with keeping you alive is gonna be like ""we're eating, we may not eat for a while, we need to eat everything we can so that we don't starve to death"".   I know it's difficult, especially since in the early stages of recovery, weight gain is normal. But the steps you're taking to eat what you need are fantastic, and the weight gain isn't body fat.  If it's easier, instead of having some days where you barely eat and some days where you aim for TDEE, maybe it would be easier to increase your daily amount regularly? i.e. for one week, aim for 900 cals a day. The next week, bump that up to 1000, then 1100, etc. until you reach your TDEE amount.",False,False

How come my body demands food continuously on days that I eat my TDEE if that's the case?  Just checking to see if there's an answer for that because I'm struggling not to feel overwhelmed. :(",False,False

Had a low calorie soup, then after that I just kept getting more food.  Wasted a whole day of fasting only to eat 1300+ calories in one sitting before bed.",False,False

If we were to eat regularly/normally, meals would be more filling. But the ED makes that difficult. You don't notice the hunger from starving so much until you start to eat, at which point your brain/body goes HEY FOOD TIME, I NEED FOOD, I HAVEN'T BEEN GIVEN ENOUGH NUTRIENTS.",False,False
