The doctors that I see are very proficient and if I hadn't gone when I did I would have died. I don't know if you think that you're hurting my feelings by being an asshole about me having an eating disorder, but you're really just making me sad for you.",False,False

How come your doctor hasn't cured you?   You keep telling people to just go to the doctor, because doctors are experts at everything.   Just get a new doctor, you must have found an asshole.",False,False

The hallmark of anorexia is being underweight but you can have different subtypes. Going through periods of binge eating and then restricting is a type of purging, so this would be a binge/purge subtype.",False,False
