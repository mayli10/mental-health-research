Up about 1-2 pounds. ( today I weighed +2.5 but I just had a BM of legends (3lbs) sooo ? ) Anyhow, hit that stage where I feel like I don't have and never had a problem :^) maybe if I hadn't caved to my health anxiety and actually kept restricting to 12.12, I would have a new fancy LW to validate me??? That was the whole point of this last circus show... Im scared to talk to my doctor because I faked my weight since the second appointment and she thinks I weigh 15-20 lbs more than I do... (I faked it out of anxiety even before I was UW lmao). On top of that, I did go to her about ammenorhea but since I kind of knew it was from weight/fat loss, overexercise, and caloric restraint (not restriction, per se, but regulated) and I didn't want to change any of those, I ... Kind of didn't follow up with any rush. As in, I took my sweet time, like 3-4 months, between appts... I feel ashamed. I kind of want to wait until I get a job, move out, find a new doctor and start fresh so I don't have to face my mistakes with the old doctor judging me....

My mom's supposedly kicking me off her health insurance as punishment for using it for gender care. idk, maybe calls from a mental health team, begging her to let me stay in their care (and in PHP), will convince her to fucking knock it off.
