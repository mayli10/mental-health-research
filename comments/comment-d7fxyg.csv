Its hard to be body positive and love yourself when those around you treat you so different depending on your size. Feel likeI get more love when I'm skinny. I've put on weight recently (due to sadness resulting in binging) and pretty much no one has stuck around or is interested to get to know me anymore. It probably has to do with the fact that I go from being a confident, glowing happy girl to a self loathing unconfident loser when I put on weight. But I can't help it - either way, the root of the problem is my weight. Its miserable.",False,False
