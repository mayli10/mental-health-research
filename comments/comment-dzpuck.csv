Are there any local recreation centers or YMCAs near you? They tend to have cheaper rates and attract a much older, chiller crowd.",False,False

I work until afternoons and then it's generally girls who have no regard for anyone else. But one bad interaction can set me off, and it's a tiny (and I mean the size of a high school classroom tiny) gym.   Like the first time I went I wanted to go on a bike but they were all taken except one that a person stretching on the floor had put her stuff on. She had been 'claiming it' for a good half hour, so I worked myself up and asked to use it and she just glared and ignored me. I had a panic attack and had to take a 2 hour walk before I calmed down. The other 3 times I've visited have been just like that. I can't handle it lol  Sorry for the rant I just hate this situation",False,True

Like 6am? Tends to be quieter.   Also, I don’t know if it’s any consolation, but most people are so into themselves/their music at the gym, they’re not paying attention to other people. I know I’m not.",False,False
