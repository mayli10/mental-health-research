I want to get better, but part of me is scared that I've done too much damage and I'll need to get surgery and to have a colostomy bag attached to me for the rest of my life. It's a terrifying concept. I like wearing crop tops butnI couldn't do that with a colostomy bag because then everyone can see all of my waste and I would be mortified. I wouldn't even want to acknowledge that it's there, so nothing to baggy clothing for the rest of my life if I need that. I really hope that doesn't happen.",False,False
