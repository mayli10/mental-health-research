Posted something similar in the old sub before it was nuked and a LOT of people felt similarly. I was okay feeling hungry but as soon as I stopped being hungry? I had to eat until I was STUFFED. It's like I was only satisfied if I felt empty or if I felt totally and completely full - ""satiety"" just triggered a binge. And then, like you said, it turns into a spiral because each day you wake up either more hungry or still bloated lol",False,False
