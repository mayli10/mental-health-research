Remember when you eat the foods weight in youâ€™re stomach will be there but thatâ€™s just it passing through the tubes. So donâ€™t freak out if it goes up a pound or two thatâ€™s literally just it being inside you. Not your actual weight. I just see a lot of people freak out about this and I wanted to warn you that itâ€™s nothing if you do decide to up your calories.,False,False
