I rarely ever eat beans, I just wanted something reasonably low-calorie and filling. Nothing really helped ease the pain except time. The bloat is gone but I'm still tooting. I'm going to use the rest of my beans as a filler for other meals, definitely not as a meal by themselves.",False,False

Make some nice meal out of them (there's tons of various recipes where you can put them, usually soups and indian/middle eastern cuisine and they are usually low cal) and freeze it (preferably as portions) and eat it later.
