Like it sounds pretty counter productive; but I have it as a ‚Äúreward‚Äù once I hit a certain weight. I let it be like a no-holding-back binge; if I‚Äôve been wanting a pizza, I can eat a whole goddamn pizza from my favorite place. If I want ice cream, too, then so be it. Putting off the binge helps a lot. I find saying ‚Äúno, absolutely not‚Äù ends up making the cravings *way* worse. And it makes the binge pretty stress-free.   I‚Äôll also do maintenance/high cal restriction weeks when it starts getting bad. Just up my intake a bit so my body feels a bit more satisfied.   ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è it‚Äôs what works for me. I also fast a lot, so it tends to balance itself out pretty well.",False,False

Today will be day 2 :-) I think my longest streak is like 35 days. Anyway, the book ""brain over binge"" might really help you - it has helped me - and addresses the ""habit"" side of it. There's a follow-up 'workbook' that is good too. In terms of distractions - crossword puzzles, web surfing, cleaning...",False,False
