It can be half a can of soup or an extra handful of fruit.   Idk if anyone else does this but every few months I have one day where i plan and shop for the forbidden foods I've been craving and that's usually 1800-2500 over the course of a day. A lot more than my usual restricting but I don't think of it as a binge because it's planned and conscious.  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,False,False

Binges can be anything from a few hundred to a few thousand. Conversely, you can over-eat by thousands of calories in a single day (or sitting) without it being a binge. To me, a binge is a *compulsion*. You feel a loss of control over your eating, and the thought of stopping/not eating causes you to panic, feel anxious, angry, etc. You can over-eat because the food is really tasty, or because it's a social setting, or because you don't get to eat it very often, etc. But in a binge, the food is trying to change how you feel; you're not eating because you're enjoying it, you're hoping that eating will BRING you joy. And of course, guilt is often a big component of a binge - you don't WANT to keep eating, but you also feel powerless to stop, and feel immensely guilty/shameful after if not during.  There are in-betweens, too. For example yesterday I went out with friends for a picnic and consciously chose not to restrict. I ate more than I'd planned to, but it wasn't a binge because I was aware of my choices when I made them and intentionally ate more because I was enjoying the food and the company etc. But later that day, because I had already eaten over my calories and because something upsetting had happened, I was starting to feel the compulsion to binge. But I paused, decided to pick one thing that I wanted to eat, and then stop.   I still ate more calories than I wanted to, and I was getting panicked at the idea of not eating what I'd chosen, so it was kind of like a binge; but on the other hand, if I hadn't stopped and asked myself consciously what I would actually like to eat, it would've turned into a real binge and I would've eaten even more calories than before. So it's almost like I took control of a smaller binge to avoid a larger binge in the end, resulting in something that was half-binge half-overeating.  You can binge on apples, or pickles, or celery, or konnyaku noodles, and end up barely consuming any calories, and you can over-eat on cake and ice cream and pizza without it being a binge if you're in control of yourself.  The lines get blurry because sometimes people think they're in control of their eating, and so it's not a binge, when really they're not. I never really recognised my old eating patterns as being binge eating, but I DEFINITELY wasn't in control like I thought, and I was definitely seeking something from food other than simply enjoying it.  Anyway this post ended up being way longer than I intended, as usual LOL. But basically... If you feel like you lost control of yourself and binged then it's valid to call it a binge and to feel bad about it even if the ""damage"" so to speak was more manageable than someone else's binge.  Sincerely, someone who has easily binged on over 10 000 calories in a day multiple times lmao",False,False
