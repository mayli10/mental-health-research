Don't understand why, it never happened before.  One thing i can guarantee this is the correct link for the website and it never asked me personal information like my full name and email address.  Someone must be attacking the website no?  Meanwhile use this one  https://tdeecalculator.net/  It's not so complete but it works.",False,False

It has a bunch of different (scientifically backed) TDEE and BMR formulas so you can compare them, and then if you want it will average then for you.
