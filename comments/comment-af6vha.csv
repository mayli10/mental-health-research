I'm definitely not petite because of my height, but a lot of guys are into skinny guys who don't have a lot of muscle. Having soft facial features + a BMI of 16.8 seems to really hit that niche of the gay community perfectly, the attention I've gotten from guys recently is insane compared to even when I was a BMI 20.  Even though my highest weight was a BMI 29, I have no loose skin so nobody has ever doubted me saying that I'm just ~naturally this weight~. Because guys obviously don't struggle with things like that. Pretty crazy that there's a mental illness that makes you more socially accepted. ",False,False
