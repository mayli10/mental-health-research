I usually live at home and don't eat anything.. Recently i've been hanging out with my mate and he cooks like a normal person... I forgot what eating 2 meals a day felt like... Honestly..... I feel so fat and terrible, like i'm making excuses not to leave the house...   I wanna know is it normal to eat 3 substantial meals a day or am I just  not eating the norm?  I've tried takin' laxatives, which help temporally..   It's not your fault honey, we gotta get through this.. ED are huge , i'm just recovering from my situation.",False,False
