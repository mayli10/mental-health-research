Im attempting to gain muscle while also losing fat but at like 1200 calories a day¿¿ my TDEE is 1900¿¿¿ im probably doing it all wrong but im sick of my body and this is the most protein ive consumed in years so maybe im doing it slightly right :/  I wish i wasnt vegetarian in times like this because i could eat chicken, not for the taste but for how low calorie it is for the amount of protein in it lmao. I dont miss it and wont go back to eating meat  im not tempted but holy fuck i just want low calorie protein  Would get protwin powder but my mum doesnt approve?? Thinks im too young and thinks its stupid. Also i dont have money oops.  Just realised i went off a bit there lmao sorry",False,False

It’s based on weight. I’m not sure if he used TDEE or BMR to come up with the numbers. But I’m definitely going under my BMR. What I think though is that he used my BMR and subtracted a certain number of calories in order to lose.   He also altered how much of each nutrient based on my goals. So I want to cut. He put me on a high protein, and lower fat and carb routine.   If you want to gain though, you’ll need to up your carbs a lot as well as fats. Protein isn’t as high as when you’re trying to lose (is what I’ve gathered based on my experiences with messing with these crazy calculators, don’t quote me lol).   And if you’re just trying to maintain, the macros will be more evenly distributed (once again just my own experiences using multiple calculators).   To sum it all up, it’s a doozie. I definitely don’t fully get it lol",False,True

I understand what macros ARE, but I’ve never understood how to find out how much of what I should be consuming",False,False
