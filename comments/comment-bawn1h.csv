You *can* workout without warming up, but a warm up will make it feel better/easier.  It's best to stretch at the end of your workout; stretching cold muscles isn't going to help your workout and may cause harm if you do it too vigorously.  You can gain strength without gaining weight, as long as your diet is sufficient to allow for muscle repair.  Even when you're working out, weight is still a function of calories; you can't gain mass unless you're eating a surplus of calories, full stop.   As a beginner, probably the best and most effective use of your time would be to choose *one* program aimed at beginners, designed to help you achieve your desired goal (strength, build a butt, build endurance, whatever your specific goal is), and *stick to that program*, for a minimum of three months.  A lot of gym newbies kind of float around, or try a different program every week, and it wastes a lot of time and effort for underwhelming results.  Gym success requires a foundation of consistency.",False,False
