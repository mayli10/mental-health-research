But I hate what it does to my body. I am fat and disgusting and wish I was beautiful and thin. I obsess over my looks and whip myself into a literal froth over it. So I go to the opposite side of the coin. I restrict. I track calories and macros. I exercise a lot. I am elbow deep in bizarre diets and absurd supplements. Weight falls off and then I plateau or snap from the lack of calories and go into an epic binge cycle. I have been gaining and losing the same 50 pounds since I was 16.  I just ate 400 calories of melted provolone and I hate myself.  So you belong here. You and Your struggles are valid. No matter your BMI. No matter how much you eat.
