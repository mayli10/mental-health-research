How long has it been since you’ve had a bowel movement, what the sodium content on the food you eat, when do you weigh yourself, do you wear clothes when you weigh yourself, are you also exercising or exercising more than you used to, etc.   The human body has a lot going on in it; hormone fluctuations impact a lot of how it responds to things like water and gas, and even if you don’t notice it, your body could be fighting off an illness like a cold or the flu and needs that extra “boost” to keep it from fully infecting you. Which results in a lot of water weight and holding onto nutrients differently.   Either way, if you’re eating at a big enough deficit, you should be actually losing weight. The numbers don’t always reflect that.",False,False
