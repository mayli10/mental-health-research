I think a lot of my romantic self-sabotage comes from fear, and the ED is like a punishment. I was absolutely terrified of giving away too much of myself and getting to a lower low if I had to go through the emotional losses with someone again, but now that it's happened I can see how a lot of my behavior is disordered and coming from a damaged place. It's as if all of my fears orchestrate situations for myself and then I grieve over what I had foretold to be true.  I think I am in a zen mode of self-loathing and clear discipline when I want to punish myself and suffer so outwardly, and probably a lot of us feel that way.   I hope your holidays are also more pleasant!",False,False
