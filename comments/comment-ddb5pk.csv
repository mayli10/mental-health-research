I didn't start smoking bc of restriction, I did it cuz I was already a drug addict so I was like fuck it what's the harm in adding nicotine (a lot, dummy).           It really doesn't suppress your appetite much at all. Coffee does a WAY better job. I don't even like the way nicotine feels when I'm fasting, it literally just makes me feel even more nauseated.           I've been able to quit meth, opiates, weed, benzos, alcohol, and cocaine but nicotine? Nope. Can't. I switched to vaping which is a little better but I'm still hooked.          0/10 do not recommend",False,False
