Calling it a joke, even if it was funny, does not negate the fact that it hurt you. Not to mention it wasn‚Äôt funny at all, even if you had no problems about food. She literally just lied to you to get you to eat something disgusting and make you uncomfortable. It feels like she called it ‚Äúa joke‚Äù to try and rid herself of any blame, and instead say it‚Äôs your fault for not taking it. It‚Äôs perfectly understandable that you‚Äôre upset about what she did.",False,False
