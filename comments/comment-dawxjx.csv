I don‚Äôt know why they took that off, and while there will be variation in calories depending on how the barista makes your drink, they shouldn‚Äôt be making it so far off from standard that it changes the calories that drastically.   Sugar free syrups are about 5 calories, regular syrups are about 20, and I think sauces are between 40 and 60 per pump.   Almond milk is the lowest calorie option (I think it‚Äôs 60cal per serving)   I‚Äôm going to guess that whip on a drink is probably between like 110-160 calories. Also drinks that are made with sweet cream will probably vary in calories too, because there isn‚Äôt really a standard amount added. I know when I make vanilla sweet cream cold brew I don‚Äôt add a lot of sweet cream, but I also know I work with partners who leave about a half an inch of space in the cup and fill it with sweet cream. Cold foams that are made with sweet cream should have a consistent calorie content because there is a specific measurement of ingredients to make the foam the correct consistency, and a specific measurement of how much to add to the drink.   That‚Äôs probably way more info than you need but if you have any questions I can try to answer them lol.   Also nitro cold brew with one or two pumps of pumpkin and soy is my go to right now!",False,False
