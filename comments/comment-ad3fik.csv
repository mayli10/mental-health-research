He's okay now, a healthy weight, but he knows the ED thoughts and he knows calories matter. He doesn't count, but he's still very much aware of how much he eats.  I feel like he understands me without enabling me. Like he really wants me to eat at least 1200 calories a day, but if I purge, or don't want to eat, or am upset by the scale, he just hugs me and everything is okay. It's great that I don't have to hide it.",False,False

My SO wants to eat chinese and fried food and pizza ALL THE TIME.  I gained like 30lbs after we started dating because I have no self control when it comes to having that put in front of me. He tried to tell me calories didn't matter the other day. I'm like, if you eat more than you use, you gain weight. Just like he doesn't gain weight because he has a hot, strenuous job and doesn't eat enough to make up for it. He says, well i'm supposed to eat like 4000 calories a day to gain weight (he's very skinny and wants to gain weight). Uh, so you just contradicted yourself saying calories don't matter.  I'm 5 inches shorter and I *am* physically active, but not nearly as much as him. He can't seem to understand that I can't just eat a bunch of shit like he does. ",False,False
