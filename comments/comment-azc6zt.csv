If he doesn’t, then you’re asking too much. All you can ask is that he not make you aware of these things, or not put them in your face, but you can’t dictate other peoples behavior. People are capable of counting calories and exercising in a healthy non-disordered way. In fact those are things most people SHOULD do to maintain health. It’s incredibly selfish and delusional of you to expect someone to cut those healthy habits out of their life completely for you.",False,False

I feel like I'd be worried for my partner in that regard if so, but also I think it's important to remember how protective and secretive we can become with our eating disorder- he's most probably not lying to you to hurt you, but because he wants to protect it. If he's not dealing with ED, I feel like it might not be your place to make a judgement against him for it, for many reasons.  This is completely my take and perspective as a third party but imho it's his body and he should be able to take care of it in a healthy way if he wants to. I don't tolerate lying from partners, but he probably did it because he didn't want to hurt you or lose you and not because he was trying to get at you. Unfortunately for liars with good intentions, it usuallg ends with them being in the very situation they try so hard to avoid. But, I think it's important to allow room and dialogue for honesty from both of you guys.   Whether or not hes dealing w an ED (there's that whole thing with ""you can't push someone to truly recover if they're not actually willing to""), if changes to his body is going to trigger you long term, then i think the best thing to do is to have a honest and genuine discussion of whether or not you guys are in incompatible situations/lifestyles. Eating disorders are really difficult to work around and make compromises with, but maybe by talking about it freely you guys could come to a solution.  It really sucks to be in a situation like this and I'm sorry :( but please keep in mind that being in a situation that doesn't seamlessly cater to both of your guys' needs is neither of your guys' fault. Being a human is hard enough on your own already- having to share a life with another human is 10000x harder :(( hopefully being honest and nice to each other with open and nonjudgmental communication will help make it a bit easier.",False,False

If he's just doing it to be healthier you can't really tell him not to. He probably lied to avoid triggering you. Not saying that lying is okay, because it's definitely not, but it's just a tough situation all around to be in for the both of you ",False,False
