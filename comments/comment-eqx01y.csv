But you really can get your daily protein requirement in with a lot of room to spare with your parameters.",False,False

But your hair reflects your health from several months ago, not immediately, if you were going through an especially rough period nutritionally six months ago you might notice it in your hair tight now. That sucks, but the good news is you can make changes now that will be seen a few months down the line.   Regardless of caloric intake, make sure you’re getting enough protein and biotin - the former you can get from a lot of different places (lean fish are a good source and also have omega-3s, which are good for you in general and may promote hair growth as well); and the latter you can get from food, not just supplements - egg yolks, avocados, some fish, broccoli, sweet potatoes, etc. I know getting nutrition from food can be really difficult with an ED, but it really is the best way to do it. Pack as many nutrient-rich foods as you can into the calories that you do consume.",False,False

It’s very similar to yours but grew in 3 years. As I’ve been restricting more and more to lose weight I’ve been losing hair faster and faster... and I naturally lose hair a lot too. It’s getting longer but thinner... I can’t reach the furthest bits down my back anymore, but they’re just a few strands of hair.",False,False

This of course depends on your ideal body shape. If you want to look emaciated, under-eating is inevitable. But if you want to loom slim fit for example,  eating enough is really important.",False,False
