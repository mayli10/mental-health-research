Every depop running dickhead and their grandmother is reblogging pictures of pale emaciated women with fishnets pulled up past their bellybutton. You couldn't pick up a cat and swing it without hitting 7 people who will give unasked for opinions on the bodies of others but will caption their own body checks with poetry from the uwu ana butterfly era,False,False

It's awful. There's a blog that just posts anonymous eating disorder related confessions and one was about how this person doesn't feel respected as an ana that's heavier. Right in the replies was a person saying something similar to ""most fat anas are just faking for attention. getting skinny doesn't take years, only a few months usually."" And it pretty much triggered me right back into a full blown relapse as someone's who's been a fat ana for a few years. Oops",False,False

It was once on this subreddit that I seen someone word Tumblr as ""being the hub for those in the honeymoon phase of their disorder"".  I hate to sound like a broken record, but the thing about Tumblr is that they'll turn anything into an aesthetic with zero regard for anything. I could cut my tongue out and place it on a piece of pink decorative paper and post it with the tag #traumaaesthetic and honestly the fuckin' thing will get a thousand reblogs. ED Tumblr is arguably the most toxic of them all considering the community seems to lean more towards encouraging disordered behaviours as opposed to EDanonymous where we recognise that we have a problem and support eachother properly.  And I fucking hate it. I used to vent about my problems with bulimia on there and I shit you not I came across a post with a quote from my tear stained vent yelling as a caption for an aesthetic post for yellow themed thinspo.  You cannot run a community of people with mental illness by romanticising the illness, that is where Tumblr has made a mistake.  Anyway, apologies for the rant, it just bothers me so much.",False,False
