Maybe I'm just rephrasing your meaning, but I guess to me that means - you might have been genetically susceptible, but the cause was still rooted in the digestive issues that led to your altered diet.   In any case, I have similar issues relating. Developed the ED older, non-dysmorphic, just... had a perfect storm of life-stress that intersected with a ""oh, I should try and lose a few pounds ahead of X event"" and that turned into numbers obsessions and more than a few pounds and, well. Because worrying about \*that\* was more rewarding than worrying about everything I can't control going on around me.   This whole topic does absolutely fascinate me in regards to how little science and even treatment seem to understand about EDs. Sometimes I wonder if we won't one day have more types or subsets of EDs based on underlying cause.",False,False

But it doesn't mean that we can't recover - actually it might exactly mean the opposite. At least, as I always say, I truly believe that full recovery is possible (now, I am an ED mess right now so not exactly in that place but that's another story).",False,True

My family is mostly-functional. At least, it was when my ED developed. I had depression and OCD problems pretty severe, but it never really led into food much as those problems were resolved before middle school. I was always thin and it wasn’t a big deal at all. Then one day I just started restricting. I wanted to fix my life in a way? I suppose I wanted to have that control over  it, but I had no reason to start restricting. My ED just kinda... happened. So yeah, I agree. I honestly do think it’s a genetic/personality type that is predisposed to this. Kinda crappy if you ask me :(",False,False
