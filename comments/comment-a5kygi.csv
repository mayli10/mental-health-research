I mean I will look at a picture and admire a skinny body but I don’t save any pictures or visit thinspo sites.  I have some expectations (unrealistic maybe) but they are for my body, for example one of my goals is to have an 18” thigh. Unfortunately because of how my body is naturally I might never achieve it. So I’m quietly bitter ",False,False

Look at before/ after photos for waist training (actual corsets, not the elastic crap). I bought mine at Orchard Corsets.com and I absolutely love it. They also have a testimonial section, lots of ladies going from a relatively rectangular shape to nicely curvy! It's only semi permanent (you can change your shape only by very consistent use of corsets) but in a few months it's noticable for a lot of people even when they aren't wearing their corset!",False,False

I have “forward head posture”, and that sucks. Oh I also have flat feet and knock knees. I just focus on the things I do like, like seeing my collar bones and wrist bones more and more as the time passes. I find focusing on only a few features that happen to look okay rather than needing to be 100% perfect helps with the obsessiveness of body dysmorphia.  ",False,False

I'm structurally / proportionally hourglass but I have hella loose skin at lower weights from huge weight fluctuation and I'm covered in self injury scars. I will never be attractive and I just have to accept it. I can just be smaller so that's my goal.
