In all likelihood, theyâ€™ll try antidepressants that are weight neutral. There are some classes of psych meds, like mood stabilizers, that have higher rates of weight gain as a side effect, but even then, if it happens, you can let them know and theyâ€™ll work with you to find a better option.  Remember, psychiatrists arenâ€™t that dumb, they know if they tell you take a med whose side effects cross a line, you wonâ€™t take it. Theyâ€™d rather you be on medicine to help you. :)",False,False

This person should start low and stay low if they can. Iâ€™m taking it for the physical effects of panic disorder and it does alleviate them to a point so I keep down at 37.5 thankfully. I just didnâ€™t want to be on benzos forever so figured this was safer to a point.,False,False

My friend was on higher dose and it did give him sweats and shakes. I only take 37.5 so maybe thatâ€™s why. I donâ€™t suggest getting into the 76-100+ range unless youâ€™re really like depressed or suicidal ðŸ˜‚,False,False

Tons of energy all of a sudden out of nowhere and completely killed my appetite.  Didn't luck out on some of the other side effects though.

I'm kind of scarred from an experience I had with a nutritionist who refused to give me a diet plan that would allow me to lose weight (before I was even anywhere near underweight) because I told her about my ED tendencies. but you're totally right, they should understand it's a waste of time if I know I won't take it.",False,True
