I have a really busy schedule of school/work so since I have No time for the gym my compromise is to walk every opportunity I can and not take buses/taxis  2. yup. When I was a healthy weight I also got cold, especially whenever I was restricting/fasting. ",False,False

I enjoy being outside with my music and my thoughts so it works for me.   2. I‚Äôm also cold a lot, but it may be because I‚Äôve gotten used to hot weather where I live and it‚Äôs been colder than normal lately and I‚Äôm just a wimp. ",False,False

If you don't have the means for the gym membership or bicycling outside, you don't have the means. That's the way it is and you make due getting exercise the way you can (i.e. Walking). Gyms suck, by the way.  2. I too am *normal and cold*. I wear three layers all the time. I think it's because normal isn't normal anymore. Normal is overweight, at least in my country. Therefore most people are comfortable with the room a little cooler. Or the facilities guy at my office is just trying to save money.",False,False

And maybe get blood work done if it isn't expensive or is covered under insurance? I totally get where you're coming from because I live in a country where mental illness and EDs aren't taken seriously unless you're dead or dying. If you think figs are too high cal, you could eat boiled beetroot as a snack, it's low-cal, sweet, high in iron and pretty filling. I eat a cup with pizza seasoning whenever I can.

Plus I feel like I ""use up"" a lot of my self-consciousness of the day while walking (eye contact with strangers/other walkers or runners) and feel slightly more comfortable with myself the rest of day. I can't afford a gym membership either and I'd feel super awkward trying to work out there, so it's not an option.
