I hope for once we get a more 'everybody can be comfortable with themselves' trend but life is unfair ig.,False,False

Right now we're in the midst of this obsession with unnatural curves, 'thicc' bodies, and copy+paste faces, all of it surgically enhanced. Every decade the new beauty trend is a response to the last, always in the opposite direction. Skinny ideals in the 2000s led to the current fanaticism for curvy bodies, just like the 80s maximalism led to 90s minimalism, etc. I think the next decade will see a thing for natural, youthful beauty in response to our current plastic surgery/cosmetic enhancement obsession. Probably more athletic, healthy figures as opposed to all the boob jobs and BBLs around now. So maybe we will see a healthy ideal soon!",False,False

Tbh I’m surprised none of the adults who KNEW what was going on in middle and high school told my parents or reported to CPS that I wasn’t getting treatment.,False,False

Like I was morbidly fascinated with books and shows that had ED story lines, and I still remember being a precocious 8 or 9 year and reading this YA book about a young aspiring athlete that developed anorexia which was fueled by her coach and I can still remember some of the quotes (and actually repeat these in my head while running yikes): ""all good athletes diet all the time"" and ""the best way to improve your mile time is to have less mass"". There was also another book about a bulimic girl and the book is full of dog ears on the pages where she describes her b/p sessions and I would read those pages over and over again, thinking ""god she's so cool, I wish that was me"". (I wonder what my mum was thinking giving that book to a 11-year old lmao. The back of it tells exactly what kind of a book it is so it couldn't have been an accident).    I also had a friend whose mum was one of the ""cool mums"" (i.e. pretty deadbeat) and she was allowed to visit questionable websites and she introduced me to thinspo and bonespo when I was in fifth grade (this was in 2005). My own parents were extremely strict and watched over what I did online so I couldn't visit those websites at home but whenever I was over my friend's place I'd beg her to visit those ana websites. I never looked at those pictures, thinking ""I wanna look like that"", but rather it was like ""that's fucked up, but for some reason I can't look away"".",False,False

Everyone on online forums would be talking about them and you could find hundreds of videos of runway shows on YouTube from that time. It was crazy cus they were extremely underweight yet men loved them and women envied them and wanted to look like them. I'm still confused as to why we keep going through beauty trends that are so unhealthy to our body image.,False,False

Couldn’t really navigate on the old proanamia websites but definitely seeing the old house of thin homepage again was a bit nostalgic.  I would literally spend hours on there.
