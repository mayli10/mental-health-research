Sometimes it takes more effort than it's worth. But we have conflicting work schedules anyway, so it's not like there's many opportunities for us to meet up.  Trust me, any non food activity would end up with food involved with her around. I hate that my ED conflicts with her as a person and makes me dislike the fact she's such a foodie.",False,True

That way you can say you’ve had lunch already. If they want to get dinner you could say you have an errand to run/something to do during the evening.   You guys could also hang out at an museum, a walk in a park/by the sea, or any other non food related activities. My go to is usually to chat at a cafe where there’s 0kcal iced black cold brew available :)",False,False
