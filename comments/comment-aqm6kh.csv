I'm in awe of how they manage to make vegetables that calorific. It's all the PB and coconut milk :(   Also I'm the absolute worst at making decisions (yahoo ADHD and anxiety and ED) and I end up asking my friends to choose for me (deadass I've phoned my mom before to ask what I should eat) And then I get panicky when they suggest anything that's not veggies and hummus. And then I just get veggies and hummus ðŸ™ƒ,False,False

Something that also bothers me is that the things that aren't labelled with calories cause me extreme anxiety because I have to try and mentally calculate everything. I just don't trust any approximation counts :(,False,False
