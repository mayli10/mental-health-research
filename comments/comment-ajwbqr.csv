I had a slightly underweight roommate that had basically no muscle, and she always looked a little flabby and was very weak.  On the contrast, Ive been told I don't look as fat as I am (and I am fat, actually fat) because I build muscle. Not a humble brag because I'm def obese (200lbs, 5'8) and hate it but I'm grateful to look 'chubby' instead of like a melted wedding cake. It gives me hope for future me when I've lost the binging weight.    A lb of muscle is so, so much smaller than a lb of fat, and won't make you bulky on purpose. ",False,False

I don't think this weight/less a few pounds is even unsustainable for us the ~healthy way~ so I think I may do a similar plan. I hope you find your happy spot :),False,False

I'm definitely going to lose a couple more pounds, although I'm kinda swinging between recovery and restricting so I'll probably try and do it slow and healthy as I can. ",False,True

Idek how many times in my life when I've been at this weight I've heard things to the effect of ""DAMN mami you thicc!"" Like thanks but now I wanna die.

On a non-bloat day I feel really petite (especially wearing really well-fitting jeans) but on a bloat day I feel like I have very hammy, flappy, squished-together legs.   It's also annoying because my top half is starting to look kind of boney and gross (not ""unhealthily thin"" necessarily but I just don't have a layer of feminine softness anymore) and I wish I could stop losing weight there and send all the loss to my thighs.  It's very stressful not being able to wholeheartedly validate yourself as ""thin"" but also being around that weight where you really should be starting to feel thin :/  What are you thinking you're going to do? I'm bouncing back and forth between going full-steam in therapy to feel comfortable a this weight and maintain vs. losing maybe 10 pounds more.",False,False

I fall onto the opposite side of the spectrum. According to my stats (5'4, 207 lbs) I *should* be massive; yet I'm slim mostly everywhere but my upper arms, thighs, ass, and a little bit of a belly.
