Although I think they mean like if someone is more staring at them rather than just being around them. Personally I feel obligated to eat on front of people so they dont get suspicious of my weight. ,False,False

THEY CAN SEE ME EATING. I become super anxious ugh,False,True

Last week our cleaning lady (who I’ve known for like ten years) was home and my mom was in the kitchen with me as well. I made my oatmeal and wanted to start eating but broke down crying because having two people ON THE SAME FLOOR as me was overwhelming and it legit took me ten minutes sobbing over my bowl until I could get myself to take a bite. I hate hate eating with other people being there and usually will go to another room if I’m not home alone. I have no clue why.",False,False
