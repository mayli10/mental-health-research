Bulimia can cause me to lose weight in the short-term, but in the long-run, on top of all the horrible side effects, it really only causes me to binge more and gain more weight.  I know it's really hard to stop purging because you'll probably continue to binge for a while, and you'll likely gain even more weight when you do, as you're finally feeding your body something, but it really is the first necessary step in recovery. And if you can, please get help.",False,False

I‚Äôm almost 200lbs at 5‚Äô2. I‚Äôve had an ED since I was about 14. I‚Äôm 26 now.    Started as Anorexia. Then it turned into EDNOS because I was mixing aspects of Anorexia and Bulimia. Now it‚Äôs just w/e it is now.   I restrict and binge and feel like a fraud for not being underweight because if im this fat how would anyone believe me when I say I‚Äôve had and ED for years. I tried IF but that caused me to snack all day in my eating window. Now it‚Äôs OMAD but also hella restricting cuz I‚Äôm only allowing so many cals a day; 1000 min, 1200 max. Less is always better for me. And lots more exercise for me too so that‚Äôs a thing too now. Ugh",False,False

But the reality is, it can help you lose weight (in a healthy fashion), if you get a good nutritionist and a good team to support you. The way my nutritionist explained it to me was that my body may decide to drop pounds by returning to a normal eating habit, and she agreed to look into possibly healthy ways of dropping a little weight once I was more stable.   It's a difficult journey, and I am only part of the way their; it comes with some risks, but it also has great rewards as well.
