I've now been with my boyfriend for a little over a year and i still struggle to be 100% open with him about it. He's never had any mental health issues but is willing to listen and learn. New relationships are scary, but it is important to be honest about what you're going through and to communicate. If you can do that, I'm sure you'll be fine. Best of luck :)",False,False
