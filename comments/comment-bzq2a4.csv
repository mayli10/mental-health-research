I'm surprised you have trouble finding bras at normal stores. I'm sort of on the opposite side of the issue where my bra size is so small that most stores don't carry it. I've tried on the closest equivalent size (larger band and smaller cups), but they don't fit right. The cheapest I've found in my size is like $70 +shipping. I've never found my size in a store before. All I wear are bralettes which offer no support and can be pretty uncomfortable.  Something I think I should mention is that people won't suddenly be more interested in getting to know you if you had smaller boobs. You would just get the same kind of attention from people who prefer whatever your new size would be. In my experience people typically just don't mind that my breasts are small and instead focus on other physical features they like about me. They're just as superficial. I've literally only met one guy who was flirting with me and was actually interested in getting to know me for my personality.",False,False
