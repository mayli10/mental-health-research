I woke up this morning and it was like 'hello, I've come to ruin all your plans and make you feel like shit!', but it's incredibly light (not normal for me). I usually don't get mine. Had one in mid November, skipped December and now. Might need to invest in more sanitary products if it's going to be like this. This is what happens when I eat properly for little bit.",False,False

My bmi has been between 15.8 and 16.5 this year and my periods have been all over the place, short cycles, long cycles, late ovulation, no ovulation, mid-cycle spotting.  How old are you? I’m 38 this year so I’m wondering if it’s perimenopause. Anorexia is a huge risk factor for early menopause, especially if you’re underweight at 18 and underweight at 35 (that’s both boxes checked for me so I’m super high risk! :( welp.)  This cycle (after gaining 2kg and getting out of the bmi15 category) has been much more normal than the last one and I’m due any day so hopefully the weight maintenance might fix it for me and I’m hoping the early menopause is reversible *pray*  ",False,False
