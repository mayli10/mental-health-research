None of us are paragons of health here, but if we want to lend any legitimacy to the phrase, ""stay safe, lovelies"", we need to look out for each other.  For people who eat below 1300 kcal/day (which I wager is a large portion of the sub), a multivitamin is recommended to lower the risk of nutrient-deficiency-related issues. But follow the recommended daily values and try to get nutrients from whatever food you do eat.",False,False

A J Emerg Med. 2004;22:335-404."", you'll see that there were several fatalities from Vitamin or mineral toxicity. If you visit the National Capital Poison Center, you'll see an entire article on iron poisoning and the dangers involved (including death).  This, coupled with the extremely lax standards the FDA holds supplements to (I would encourage you to look at studies testing how actual amounts of various nutrients can differ drastically from the label, as well as the contaminants like *prescription medication, heavy metals, and pesticides* that have been found), as compared to drugs (which are held to stringent production standards), means that over supplementation can frequently be dangerous.  Nutrient deficiencies are far more common, but that doesn't mean that nutrient toxicity is any less dangerous.  Please don't spread misinformation that could lead to people getting hurt.",False,False

Men don't need iron supplements while women do for their period.   Vitamins and minerals even at extremely high doses are much safer than all the prescriptions that kill thousands of people each year, even properly taken, not even counting the opioid crisis.

Water-soluble vitamins are generally fine because you'll pee out the excess, but fat-soluble vitamins will accumulate and may start to cause problems down the line. Also, in large short-term doses, you can absolutely get things like iron or potassium(hyperlakemia) poisoning which can be highly destructive.   It's like insulin - the dose needs to fit what your body needs. Too much is as bad as too little.

The other vitamins and supplements sold there are equally good for price, quantity and quality. Of course, there's always online and I have no qualms in buying them at drugstores either. Just don't buy them from MLMs. They're good, no doubt, just horribly expensive.  I take three of them every day at each meal sometimes more if I eat out with friends. The brightly coloured urine means that my kidneys are filtering a nutrient-enriched blood.   For vitamins to work, you need to take really high doses ie optimal or megadoses. Nobody ever died from such large amounts. In addition to my three multis, I take a lot more of the alphabet vitamins, other minerals and supplements.",False,False
