To just think of incidents like this as little surprise parties for my body, which sound way more fun than 'ate too much fat to handle' or 'ate something that is bad'.    It helps me survive and not radicalize (even more). Keeping the positive attitude towards food, although very difficult, keeps me loving it. Cause the day I don't love it anymore I won't eat anymore.
