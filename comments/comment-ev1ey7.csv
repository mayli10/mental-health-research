A lot of this comes down to proper education. If you’re in college, most colleges have a dietician somewhere that you can refer her to. I believe mine is part of the health and exercise science program. Just thought I’d throw that in just in case she’s struggling finding good information on healthy weight loss. I didn’t realize how many people have no clue how many calories are in something until I watched an episode of Supersize vs Superskinny and some old guys guess like “100 calories” for some big ass burrito. Don’t forget we research this shit like for a living, and I don’t think normal people care nearly as much",False,False
