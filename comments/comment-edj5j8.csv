If you're trying to hide your ED you can also just go with ""salad with olive oil and vinegar"" (without saying on the side) and they'll probably bring it on the side because that's a mildly unusual request here in the US (but is how salads are served in Spain). I also think if you're trying to act normal, don't say anything about croutons - the total amt of croutons on a salad is probably 50 calories at most",False,False
