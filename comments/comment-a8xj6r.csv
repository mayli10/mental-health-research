I always assumed/hoped that it was a misguided attempt at helping. It never was! He just liked putting me on the spot and ruining my confidence in social settings. Anyway I had to cut him out of my life earlier this year and it became a lot more obvious after that that all of his good qualities were me assuming he had any and projecting my qualities onto him. Maybe this friend of yours is like that too. I'm so sorry you had to deal with that, I'm cringing just thinking about it. But I hope you don't feel shame or guilt or anything about it. HE was the one who decided to make it weird. ",False,False

You might want to either talk to them about how insensitive it was or just avoid hanging out with/eating with them in the future. They could‚Äôve politely asked you in private if it was actually out of concern, instead of taking an accusatory stance and humiliating you in front of the whole table. Please, please don‚Äôt just accept this behavior from people. You deserve privacy and discretion, and you deserve supportive, sensitive friends. ",False,False

Super rude and obviously not coming from a place of concern because they said it in front of everyone instead of privately. Definitely should have done a power move and responded with ‚Äúactually someone‚Äôs food has given me explosive diarrhoea and I was trying to be discreet about it.
