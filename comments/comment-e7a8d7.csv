Today, It's a pain in the ass to try to get it as well as orlistat. The main problem is that they stopped having these things on the shelves. Back in the day everyone took them and it wasn't considered an issue.",False,False

Like your body just recognises the iron as a good sign and probs believes you just destroyed a bunch of iron rich foods so it starts making that sweet sweet nauseating leptin. Oh yes.  I've found that iron tablets, B12 and 5H-TP reduce my appetite loads more than stimulants. Caffeine or tobacco tend to make me eat more if anything else because the rush gives me the energy to actually go and make food.  But iron tablets tend to make me chill a little. At least when it comes to hunger.",False,False
