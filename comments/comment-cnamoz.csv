From what I understand, she was forced to go against her will. It's not a game for her. It's an illness.",False,False

She’s been playing this game for way too long. Plenty of times, people told her to get help, to acknowledge her ED and deal with it. Her « fans » support her and want her to recover, but she’s more interested in her social media influence than her own health.  Instead of acting like an adult, she’s still acting like a child and willingly choosing to stay in her delusional bubble, even after all these years. *She doesn’t want to get better* and that’s a fact.   Maybe one day she’ll wake up but until then, I won’t give her attention. (Btw I’m not hating her, just saying she’s not worth our time)",False,False

And then she'll say yeah I'm totally fine.",False,False

In her hairdresser Pic her face might have looked a bit more bloated from all the food she's finally eating and now her face is just not as bloated. I hope she's okay!,False,False

There's something really unnerving about watching someone's slow death get treated like entertainment material by people. (Not talking about this thread/sub - just YouTube.)  It's like...how desensitized are some of them? This isn't Law and Order.  I don't watch her videos because yeah...she needs help, not likes.",False,False

It honestly feels like I'm giving too much attention to a girl that shouldn't have any. She should be in therapy and constantly monitored, period.  She isn't just a somewhat troubled girl whose issues are fun to be watched on youtube for some free drama and giggles. She is gravely sick from a life-threatening illness that could kill her in a matter of months. This is nothing to be underestimated. Everyone who is allowing this to happen is totally irresponsible, especially that dumb youtuber who featured her in a widely publicized video where he tried to sell her as ReCoVeReD when she had been in therapy for maybe three months and she was still visibly emaciated, yet she was still saying cringeworthy stuff like ""yeah I had kind of, like, an eating disorder"". It's disconcerting.",False,False

I think what Jaclyn said is true and that being back in that house will have an negative impact on her recavory. Also if her admission was not voluntary, she might have just gained weight but treated nothing of the underlying psychological issues. I do wish all the best to her and to all of us.",False,False
