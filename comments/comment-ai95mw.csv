If the meal+binge are combined into one ""instance"" you may want to put more and more time between them. Imagine you have 0 minutes between them at the moment, you will have to force yourself to wait 5 minutes between. Then after you can do that without thinking, you do 10 minutes etc.   The brain usually takes 20 minutes to register that you are full, so it's best to put 25 minutes or more between your meal and any extra food.   Similarly, when you eat your meal, do the positive reinforcement, and when you start binging, do the negative reinforcement. I used to have exercise as negative reinforcement but now I enjoy it so it's kinda beneficial too lmao.   Again, that can be a very long process. Curing disordered eating is complicated and I'm not an expert so you might want to follow a therapist (not a dietician in this case) for this, to at least express your feelings and try to put words onto your efforts.   And remember that binging is not a failure, that could also be your body telling you something. I do tend to binge on fortified cereals, and I guess that's because my body would like more Vit D. I also binge on chocolate because I have a (natural) magnesium deficiency -and I do like the taste haha. So a therapy might be good to help you see that not all binge means bad!   Once again, good luck, we are here to support you :) ",False,False

One very strong tool of the brain is how much you can condition it to do the same thing over and over without thinking. Pavlovian reactions, as they are generally called. This is triggered by negative or positive reinforcement.   If you want to stop binging, you might want to have a look at it. Eat at the EXACT same time every day. 12.00, you're in front of your plate. Same, at 19.00. (you can change the timings of course).    Then, don't allow yourself ANY food outside of those meals. The meal can last as long as you wish and you're free to include what you estimate healthy. But the point is to stick with it for months, maybe even years.   The conditioning part starts when you engage another thing at the same time as you eat. Something you like. Something you truly enjoy. And you do this every single time, right before eating. With time passing, you will see that you need this to be able to eat.   You can also use negative reinforcement during a binge. It's up to you to choose what's positive and negative for you, but it has to be something you can access every time you eat/binge.   Now my insomnia story:   I started experiencing irregular sleeping since I was a toddler. But it became really bad when I turned 10, probably with the beginning of puberty.   I would sleep 0 hour sometimes, up to 4h at once. Every night. Memory loss made me forget most of my experiences from 10 to 16.   Then I started conditioning myself. Doing exactly the same thing every night. Going to sleep at similar hours every night. And I got a teddy bear. I would repeatedly do the ""routine"" tasks every night, for months.   Now, I'm not able to sleep if I don't go to the bathroom close enough to bed time (usually 5-10 minutes). I can't sleep without my teddy. I need the pillow and the blanket to be in the same position every day. But I can sleep! I surely still take 30 minutes to fall asleep, but it's better than the 2-3h I needed before :)   (I had to do this routine for close to a year for it to work, don't give up!)   **Please, don't abuse this advice, it's just to avoid binges, which can be creating health issues. I want you to use this to remove the disordered eating you have now, and eat at maintenance or safely lose/gain weight!** ",False,False

I guess I should cut that out because I have a major sweet tooth. I'm on the borderline of a healthy/underweight BMI so I don't think my weight is of significant concern.   I don't really binge because I'm hungry, I binge because I've exceeded my calorie limit or ate a little bit more than what I intended to, resulting in a full out gorge fest because I think my day is already 'ruined'. I can't last a week without binging and it really sucks, restricting for the most days of the week and ending up not losing any weight because of one bad decision. Simply eating more doesn't really help, because even then I still binge :/",False,True

Cut out easy carbs (sugar) and eat more fiber and protein? And how much do you weight if i may ask. Maybe your body is telling your that youre starving? Its not enough Information to help i think. Maybe consult some doc? Non stop hunger is not normal either. ",False,False
