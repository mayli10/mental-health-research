This morning when I was at ~hour 50 of a fast and my boyfriend got home from work and I asked to jump into his arms (full on, one end of the driveway to the other into his arms), and when I did he murmured ‚Äúfuck, you‚Äôre so light‚Äù and I swear I ascended to heaven",False,False

Got the strongest urge to restrict afterwards. Just started hardcore restricting and it is probably my longest cycle yet, no signs of stopping but who knows. I binged since on Wednesday (Chinese food :,-)) and this is the first time I ever c/s. It was absolutely disgusting and shameful. Rotisserie chicken if you‚Äôre curious. Pretty sure I swallowed some too which sucks ass.  Alas.",False,False

On-and-off, altogether probably over a month. And not just over-eating a little - I have been binging on carbs, fats, and processed foods like there's no tomorrow. I'm terrified of how much weight I've gained and the thought of gaining back everything I've lost is sending me into a panic.  But. I'm not there yet. I'm not at day 1 again yet. I can still turn this around, and I'm going to. I'm tracking again. Day 3 of consistently tracking what I'm eating and staying under my goals. I don't know what or why but it's like something in my brain clicked and I can finally say no to food again, even if it's not all the time. I'm tired of binging taking over my life.",False,False

Last time I exercised, at the end I pushed so much I just could not catch a breath and I was crying‚Äîno sobbing, almost screaming‚Äîuncontrollably. Literally, could not stop.

I haven't been happy with it but I'd sort of got to a point where I was almost okay with it. Like, it's not where I want to be but I don't literally hate being in my body. And then I made the mistake of looking through old photos. Found two pics from January where my collarbones and legs look like they belong to a completely different person.   For a second there I thought I was going to have a moment of clarity. Like ""wow, back then I thought I was so fat and yet now I'm realising my collarbones were actually sticking out a little too much, and my legs were skinny after all and that just proves that I'll never be happy and I actually do have body dysmorphia"" etc etc. Instead I opted for crying about how much I've gained and my weekly resolution to get back to my goal weight. ü§°ü§°ü§°",False,False

Had plain unseasoned tilapia and unseasoned broccoli slaw.  ~350 calories.  Let me tell you when you fast for so long literally ALL food tastes wonderful so I enjoyed it.  Immediately went back to fasting when I was done and now 8 hours into this new fast.  I am trying not to be upset right now feeling bloated and seeing I went up 1.2 lbs on the scale.  Trying not to reach for the laxatives.  Trying to tell myself this is not real weight I put on.    My boyfriend hugged me, wrapped his arms around me and told me how tiny I was.  I don‚Äôt think he gets how much I live for that compliment.  I am thinner tonight than I have been for a few months and while every time he says my body is perfect and I don‚Äôt need to lose weight tonight he just couldn‚Äôt stop looking at me, touching me, saying how sexy I am.  I know he secretly loves it the smaller I get.  This reaction from him and the euphoria from fasting...these are the emotional highs I live for.  I just had to get tonight off my chest.",False,False

So I'm having some trouble with someone at work and it stressed me so I purged and cried a lot on Thursday evening but instead of going to bed and sink further into this desperate state I turned it into something positive and distracted myself by cleaning up my bathroom and my room. That made me feel really proud of myself.  I hope to make it a week without purging. That would be awesome and I hope it would make me feel way better.   Hugs and love for you all!,False,False
