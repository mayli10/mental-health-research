Or to convince yourself you're a badass for eating one garlic bread (instead of zero garlic breads ever or 10000000 garlic breads).,False,False

For instance, does the someone that remind you to eat have to be a person ? It could be some reminder you set for yourself beforehand on your phone. If eating alone bothers you, try eating while listening to a podcast (I always feel like podcasters are friends chatting around me).  Sometimes breaking rules can be hard, especially if it's a sudden change for you. But by using those ""in-between"" rules maybe you'll be able to forget about them in the long run.  I hope you find a way to make it work and heal ♡",False,False
