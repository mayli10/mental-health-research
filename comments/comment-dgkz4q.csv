I probably would have said, ""Yeah, actually, I do that.  It's part of an eating disorder I'm dealing with."" And if that was enough, I'd stop there. But if they're open to knowing more, I could explain the compulsion and all the negative health effects that go along with c/s. I know it's not for everyone. But the more people IRL that I tell about my ED, the less power it seems to have over me.",False,False
