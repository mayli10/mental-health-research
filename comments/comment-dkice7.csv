I guess this is the first time in a long time I've tried on a less than perfect pair of pants and I'd forgotten how radically differently they can fit",False,True

Sometimes they can be irregular, or the size mislabeled, or even from the beginning it might have been cut on the wrong fabric grain, making for a poor fit, or the garment can just be a poor design in general. Not every designer, clothing producer, or factory seamstress gets it right every time. I used to get similarly upset over sizing, but after a while found it helps me to remember clothes are made in service to the body, not the other way around.  ðŸ˜Š There are entire brands I donâ€™t buy anymore cause they canâ€™t get their sizing/cuts right for me.",False,False
