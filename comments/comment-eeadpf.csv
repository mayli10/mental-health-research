Juice from 1/2 lemon. 1tbs Sherry vinegar. Four big cloves of garlic &amp; Salt!  Optional: chopped olives  I just drain the chickpeas, I donâ€™t take the skins off. Blend the chickpeas and garlic first, then add the moisture to taste, itâ€™ll make the hummus smoother. You can also add water if itâ€™s still too stiff.  An immersion blender works well for me, but I bet a food processor would work even better.  Makes about a cup. Around 50cal per tbs  EDIT: formatting",False,False
