I canâ€™t even play games with my siblings like I love doing as Iâ€™m too hungry and irritable. How do people keep living their lives completely normally when I have to spent all day barely awake and in pain just because I didnâ€™t eat enough today.  I like watching old episodes of TV shows, thatâ€™s how Iâ€™ve been passing the time recently. I watched basically the entire first 4 seasons of Skins over Christmas just because I had so much time to kill where I could do anything since I only let myself eat the Christmas food and that made me hungry for 16 hours of each day.",False,False

Honestly these are terrible but Iâ€™ll list them anyway,  - I like watching food youtubers like sv3rige, milk jar, freelee and vegan gains - lavender essential oil on my chest is nice and lavender chamomile tea is also nice, just something to make me feel a bit less on edge! - I spend an embarrassing amount of my free time pacing around my living area while listening to music - if itâ€™s early in the day and Iâ€™m off work Iâ€™ll make myself coffee! I like to add vanilla almond milk to mine, and usually if I make myself coffee Iâ€™ll also... - set up my TV to play supersize vs superskinny. lol!  *Sometimes* Iâ€™ll practice the language Iâ€™m learning and sometimes Iâ€™ll message my language exchange partners in order to practice but rarely ever.
