This is not typical those psychologists should stop.,False,False

Almost all the girls I know have more or less unhealthy relationships with food. Even if they don't necessarily have an eating disorder, it's not normal to constantly worry about ""gaining a few pounds"" (that's normal??) or hating yourself for eating some pizza or candy. It's been so normalized that women have to constantly and obsessively watch what they eat and go on a diet for gaining 1 pound and I HATE it.",False,False

All my close girlfriends have various eds and bc it’s so normal to us I just feel like everyone is like this. But once we were at a party, splitting our diet squash and vodka, and some other girl offered up some really sugary drink for the table. So bc we all have Ed and avoid unnecessary calories like the plague, we were like daring eachother to drink some. Bc it’s like a generally well loved drink (bc sugar) no one else understood why what was going on, which lead to a long discussion of calories and eating. Most people really really don’t think like this, those of us who do just find eachother I guess",False,False
