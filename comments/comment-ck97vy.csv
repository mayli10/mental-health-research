There seems to be a lot of competition with other AA women in your post and seeking validation from AA men.  And attempts of entering and then isolating yourself from the AA community while questioning your own identity as an Asian woman.  Do you avoid asians because you don't want to be tested on 'how asian you are'?  Did you stay with that douchey chinese guy because he made you feel more asian?  Do you think being thin would make you more asian?  Not trying to attack, I can't think of a more tactful way to start the convo right now...    I think the most prominent AA voices out there currently cater to east asians, and it can be difficult for southeast asians to completely relate to them.  I'm Vietnamese so even though the culture overlaps quite a bit with southern china, I still feel like my body type is completely different from the ~east asian ideal~. And Filipinos, despite having an early start in the Americas, are still barely being represented in the media.  (My theory is it's partly because Filipinos are quicker to assimilate due to their English, while other asians are forced to carve out enclaves due to the language barrier.) The Philippines has a very unique history unlike most east asian countries, and as you know, has been marked by a lot of colonialism, so it's just starting to get its footing as an independent country.  So Filipinos-Americans are in this grey area, where because of colonialism they can culturally relate a lot to white-americans but genetically and geographically they also relate to east-asians.  Yet neither of these communities completely represent (or welcome) Filipino-Americans so it's a battle of identity.    In the Viet-American community there's a lot of self-hate in terms of identity.  Because of the war VAs tend to attribute more value to whites and east asians who have aligned themselves with America (SKorea, Japan). All the while hating Vietnam because well, the VAs here lost the war, but in doing so they are hating their own people and as an extension themselves... so it's quite insidious.  It's now quite popular to idolize the kpop look, which is problematic for body image, because we are genetically different!  Our faces, body types, mannerisms, and culture are different!  But I think a lot of SE asians see that there's at least a chance to look east asian, because looking white is completely off the table lol.  Me included... I hate my build.  I want to be waify.  But I have my body, which includes a big bust, butt and strong legs, and it cannot conform to east asian standards.  This however, does not take away from my asian-ness.   I am learning to accept my shape a little more every year, especially as body acceptance in America (for women at least) is broadening to include more body types. (:",False,False

Those guys who tell you ""If you‚Äôre so lonely being the only Asian, why don‚Äôt you travel and go to Asia?"" are honestly so stupid - totally misses the point of what you're saying. I think it's very important to have a strong Asian-American community in the US. Honestly I have very little connection with actual Chinese culture beyond what my parents have share with me. Therefore having friends who were raised similarly (in this case...constantly beat down by their parents/other ppl about their weight) makes working through these struggles a lot easier. To be honest, I do surround myself with primarily Asian-American friends (I have more diversity in other friendships, but my core group is Asian-American), and that's really helped me get over a lot of the self-hate, guilt, etc. that I struggle with. My friends also have similar struggles of having their parents call them fat or relatives tell them they needed to lose weight - but simultaneously Asian food culture encourages you to eat a lot and if you don't eat a lot, it's offensive. Therefore, you're caught in this catch-22 where if you eat, you're fat, but if you don't eat, you're rude and people will keep bothering you. The gold standard of skinnyness is effortless skinny, where you can eat a ton of food but still be &lt;100 lbs.   Obviously I have a lot of thoughts on this, but I know how hard it is to be an Asian American in the US - it's very lonely if you don't have a community and just based on how you look, you are clearly always ""the other."" I grew up in the South where I could be the only Asian for miles, but now I live in NYC and being surrounded by diversity but also people like me has helped SO MUCH.

The term generally used is Eurasian, I‚Äôm about half white and half asian. Live in and have grown up in Malaysia. Speak the language fluently. I got to a Chinese-majority secondary school (I‚Äôm 16) so I totally understand the pressure of twig-like girls. I can get away with a bit more because ‚ÄúEuropeans are allowed to weigh more‚Äù but that doesn‚Äôt make it any less triggering nor does it make the standards much better.  Starting from the first day of secondary school, when most of us were twelve going on thirteen, there was a hierarchy made of ‚Äúskinny girls‚Äù who, regardless of actual attractiveness, were made out to be paragons of beauty. 35kg (77lb) was a totally healthy weight and in fact was what girls were encouraged to weigh! Despite the fact that average height was probably around 4‚Äô11 and that was underweight even at that age. Despite the fact that standards now are barely much higher. These ‚Äúskinny girls‚Äù are sixteen now, barely touch 40kg (88lb) and would definitely be described as less pretty than they were because they‚Äôre ‚Äúfatter‚Äù.  Walking into the bathroom whilst girls are changing is annoying and triggering as all fuck. Girls with BMIs of 17 complain that they‚Äôre too fat. Girls with BMIs above 23 barely dare change outside of one of the stalls‚Äî heaven forbid they show off their still healthy weight range bodies! There‚Äôs only one girl in my year who has an overweight BMI, as far as I know, and she‚Äôs basically been shunned by most social circles in the school. This may or may not be due to the fact that she‚Äôs also got a fairly crappy personality, but I can‚Äôt help but feel that she would have a lot more friends if she was one of the ‚Äúskinny pretty girls‚Äù.  And the double standard is insane. The average weight of girls in my class is probably around 45kg (99lb) but the guys probably have an average around 65kg (143lb). This despite the fact that the guys are only just hitting their growth spurts. There‚Äôs also a lot of very skinny guys who pull down the average, around 33% are obviously overweight or obese. No girl in my class has a BMI above 22.
