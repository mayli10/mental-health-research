I love my life, I have so many great people around who like/love me, and I'm normally so well put-together. But then for some reason, I feel like I need to eat until I physically cannot anymore.. then throw it up so that I feel in control again. Always gotta go to parties with food with a hair tie on my person.  I don't understand it and I hate it. Maybe I love the feeling of being able to offload so much undigested crap so easily? But like why eat so much in the first place? Surely not eating so much is a better sign of being in control than what I currently do. But alas, here I am. It's shitty.",False,False
