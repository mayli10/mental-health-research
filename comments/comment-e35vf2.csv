A big part of me doesn’t believe they were being drunk or manipulative, but I guess the point is that either way it doesn’t matter and I shouldn’t give them this much thought, anyway.  But seriously, you don’t know how much it means to me. I’m kind of at a low point right now and reading this made me feel so much better and calmer than I did before. Thanks :)",False,True

I relate to you so much. I have definitely eaten my feelings all due to a guy who isn’t worth my time. Honestly it is there loss for not talking to you further.   If it makes you feel better this kind of thing happens to everyone. My close friend is drop dead gorgeous, always has hot guys around etc. and she still gets ghosted/rejected quite often. Please don’t take it personally.   It sounds a bit harsh but I have basically started to put zero value into anything a guy says/does when he is drunk or trying to hook up. When some guys are in a mood they will literally say anything to get you to sleep with them.  Its hard, but keeping my walls up has definitely saved me a few “binge eating due to guys being total jerks” sessions.",False,False
