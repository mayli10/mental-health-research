I was 25 at my lowest BMI (~15.8) and I still had my period (not on BC so it was legit).   For myself, it seems that extremely excessive exercise is more so the determining factor than weight.   I had my first period when I was nearly 15 (underweight) and I think it occurred because I was too sick to exercise. As soon as I was well I began exercising excessively again (~5hrs/day) and didn't have another period until I was 18.   I'm 28 now and I have had my period pretty consistently for the last 10 yrs.   As others have said, losing your period should not be a goal.",False,False

My lowest weight was 86, and I started at 140. I was a healthy weight prior to onset. It‚Äôs not only weight that cause you to lose your period, it‚Äôs also the rapidity of weight loss. It takes a toll on your health. It doesn‚Äôt just affect your lady bits, t adversely impacts bone health, memory, sleep, the works.
