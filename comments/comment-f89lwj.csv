I had three months of this back in 2017. 4 people ended up in jail I got my car stolen.... hadn‚Äôt registered it yet though. It wasn‚Äôt in my name. And 400 dollars stolen and did more drugs than most of my ‚Äúnormal‚Äù friends would imagine. I was always out of the way when shot when down though I did have to get up in the faces of a few dealers... I may be small and cute but I bite. Lol. Anyways. Think of the EXPERIENCES you had.   Experiences are what we collect!! They make good memories, fuel to change, anticipation that causes butterflies in our stomach.   Don‚Äôt you even give up!   I attempted 3 times. I have 3 children.... and a divorce but 3 children that now have an opportunity to collect their own experiences.   Pain is excruciating no matter where it has tangled it roots.   Live unapologetically. At least in your room. After a shower? With a song that is connected to nothing but empowerment of the amazing soul that resides within the body that is constantly making you prove you will not be beat.   There is an ebb and flow to life. Find yours. It won‚Äôt look like anyone else‚Äôs. Maybe it‚Äôs words, colors, music, smells, pictures.   Live unapologetically and collect as many experiences you can. Create opportunity to transform through crises.   üòò   I just sent you so so so much love and energy for relief. Accept it. And I won‚Äôt even say pass it on. KEEP IT! Lol use your eyes today. Look at the sky. It‚Äôs endless. And so are you my dear.",False,False

I wish I could find the right words to say to soothe and help you, I‚Äôm pretty hopeless myself.   With BPD just be kind to yourself and remember to try your best to avoid black and white thinking, it might not be as bad as you think with your friends, and if it is well then you e out yourself in a positive position to find new friends, and please choose ones who *get* mental illness and will be understanding and supporting, I promise you there are people out there that do.   Try to reach out to someone you trust, just let them know you aren‚Äôt coping and you need help now, there is strength in doing this, I know it‚Äôs hard, but right now I think it would be great if you can do it.  Please take care, I‚Äôm nobody but I do care if you are okay or not, if only because I‚Äôve felt similar before myself and it‚Äôs horrible but it has gotten better,promise.",False,False
