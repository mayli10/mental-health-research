Especially because you said there are free snacks available so why could they just eat that?? I don’t know if you have plastic bags available to you, but reusing opaque plastic shopping bags by putting your food in them and tying them with a really good knot so it’s a pain in the ass for the food taker to open up might help. I’ve learned the proper way to do the common “double knot” and it’s annoying as $@#! to untie if it’s done very tightly.  You can google “basic knots” to find one that is quick but will take some time for someone unfamiliar to undo. Also it helps you be able to tell if someone’s opened the bag at all because undoubtedly that person won’t be able to tie it back the way you had it. Sorry that jerk ate your food :( I hope the rest of your day was better &lt;3",False,False
