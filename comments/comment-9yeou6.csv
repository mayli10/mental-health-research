He's DEFINITELY pudgier than me but I just don't care. And he says he doesn't care. And I think I believe him as the only fucking person who ACTUALLY loves me whether I'm skinny or fat. Now if only I could figure out how to love me because I can only TOLERATE me when I'm skinny. I want to just obliterate myself when I'm fat,False,False

Like the person you love deserves someone skinnier and prettier than you.  Best tip I can give you is to please remember they are with you for a reason. You are genuinely loved and cared for. Remind yourself that you are much more than you weight. Sure there are other people with smaller numbers or whatever but there's no one like you. Your SO loves you for you. ,False,False

My SO is a little cubby and I still find him so attractive, but I know he feels fat and it absolutely breaks me heart watching him struggle. I hate to think he feels like that anytime I come down and tell him I feel fat, because I know I'm in much better shape than him ",False,False

I know you don't want to believe it, but you're worth it. Please let the insecurities go (easier said than done, no?) and remember his words. I definitely relate to this, it's like no matter how much time passes and how many times he repeats it but I still don't believe it and it has been very damaging to my own relationship. Please know that this person is with you because they want to be with you, not a number or an ideal weight. They want YOU. They want your personality, your company, your support, not for you to be a certain bmi. You're so, so much more than your eating disorder and your physical appearance. Please don't forget it.

My SO has been nothing but sweet about my weight, saying he loves my body however it looks. I just can't see myself the way he does, that's all.   Also, a big reason I'm doing this is because I want to be able to sit on his lap without feeling like I'm crushing him.",False,False

I know there are men with ""perfect"" bodies too but i just couldnt care less about them and their bodies and if i can find his body the most beautiful thing then maybe he really feels the same. :) much love to you",False,False
