Like, it's so easy for people to just... Not... Comment on other people's food. Yet they do it anyway. Why?? What satisfaction do they get from it? I don't get it",False,False

My grandma is horrible for it. She used to come from Florida to stay with my family for the summer while I was growing up. Every time I would grab anything to eat she had some nasty comment about it. All the while, she's eating McDonald's or going out to lunch with her friends every other day. Apparently my dad picked up that toxic trait from her because he too always had something to say about my diet. Def contributed to some last issues for me.",False,False

My friend who had an idea that something was up encouraged me to get snacks with her. So for the day all I was going to eat was a mini bag of funyuns. I got on the elevator and this professor walked in and decided to laugh at me and comment on how young people eat such bad diets.   I didnt finish the funyuns.   Looking back I get so fustrated that people comment on what others eat because we dont know who is struggling to eat anything that day.,False,False
