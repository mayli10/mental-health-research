I struggle a lot with psychosis as part of my bipolar disorder and have been on a lot of different anti-psychotics (currently quetiapine/seroquel.)  I don't want to scare you. But I am going to try to be really straight forward with you. Psychosis is dangerous, and that's not even getting into the stigma around it, which doctors are not immune to. Being non-compliant with anti-psychotics when you're experiencing a psychotic break is putting yourself on a fast track to being hospitalized, possibly involuntarily. Psychiatrists don't mess around with psychosis, and you will not be able to hide it forever. If you do not start taking your meds again, you are probably going to end up in the hospital.  And I don't know if you've been in one yet, but I've been in a few. And from an ED perspective, at least for me, being in a psych ward is the worst thing, even if they don't know you have an ED. They don't let you skip meals. If you don't always finish your meals, they get suspicious. You don't have a ton of control over what you eat. You don't get to weigh yourself. You can't purge, you can't really exercise. It's terrifying. It's exhausting. If they do know about your ED, or realize while you're there, they'll double down on it. And many psych wards are not really equipt to treat eating disorders, so it's just well-meaning nurses tell you ""well all you have to do is eat.""  Talk to your doctor. I know you said you've been on six different meds already, but there are like a billion anti-psychotics out there, and your doctor can try to find one that doesn't have it as a side effect. But ultimately, your choice is probably going to boil down to taking anti-psychotics voluntarily at home or involuntarily in a psych ward. And at least at home, you still have control over your diet. You can try to figure out what about the med is causing weight gain (is it causing you to retain more water? Increasing your appetite? Messing with your inhibition?) and address it. You can have access to your safe foods. If your ED is undiagnosed, you have a chance at continuing to keep it hidden until you're ready for recovery. A psych ward is not so forgiving, and doctors are quick to put people like us there.",False,False

Going off meds is so common among certain disorders. I went off my olanzapine and then my quetiapine for the same reason as you. This is your body and your illness - self-advocacy due to the side effects is, I think, a positive thing, so long as you also keep your psych in the loop so they can help you come to a different arrangement.  And I know you've tried so many meds already and might be so sick of that merry-go-round, but if these ones are affecting you so much that you're not taking them, that's so understandable and there are other options!   Even though they pressed ahead last time you voiced concerns, maybe reiterating how distressing you found the reality and asking for a different med without that effect would show them you're engaged in your treatment and trying to find something that you're actually comfortable with. Best of luck - it's hard and complicated and can be scary but you have insight right now, and there are other ways forward. üíï",False,False
