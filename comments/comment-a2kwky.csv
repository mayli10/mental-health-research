I saw the men's events, the ice dance and the gala at the Olympics, such a great memory!  I think it'd be a great way to celebrate recovery! Good luck! ",False,True

Did you get to see him when you went to the Olympics?   So far I just have blackwork. I'm unsure whether to stick with blackwork or get some black and white/minimally coloured trad as well. Mine as well are promises to myself for later. Partially because I don't have much money right now, and partially because I feel like they'll be good rewards to myself when I'm more recovered.

There's some great tattoo artists in Seoul that do watercolour type tattoos, I'm getting two feathers on my upper arm (I'm a figure skating fan, I went to the Winter Olympics last Feb so I'm getting in the colours of Yuzuru Hanyu's costumes he won with, if that makes sense) and as a commemoration of my 5 years in Korea I'm getting my favourite spring flowers on my ribcage.   Hopefully since I have the appointment booked now it'll give me to motivation to stick to a restriction and actually exercise so I can at least be significantly less overweight by the time I'm getting them done",False,True

Visualizing my warrior-queen body is the only thing this week that's stopped me from lapsing right back into heavy restriction/binging.   I also have tattoos planned! What are you getting? :) ,False,False
