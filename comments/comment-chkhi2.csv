He started boxing+cardio and some weight lifting 2 years ago. He is quite ripped now and you can't really see his hips, I'm sure he also lost some body fat in the process, but that really helped balance his body out.  If you have a chance to find something like that and commit to it long enough, I think that might change your life! I would recommend MMA or taekwondo or boxing or most martial arts, as you use a lot of your upper body but you end up exercising your whole body too. Cardio is also quite important for these and that's always good for general shape.",False,True
