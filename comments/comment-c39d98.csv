Water toxicity is the next stage up, where seizures and crazy stuff happens.   But don’t worry! There’s a pretty easy fix. The reason why all that water can make you sick is because it flushes electrolytes out of your body, namely sodium (this is also why athletes are at such risk- both by drinking lots of water, and sweating out all their salt). Eat something salty, like pickles, or get yourself an electrolyte drink, like Gatorade. Wait a half hour before drinking more water to see how you feel - if you’re still experiencing symptoms, have some more salt/electrolytes and wait again. Just keep doing that until you feel better.",False,False
