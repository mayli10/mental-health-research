There are lots of five star reviews for it on Amazon. The one star reviews are from people who are complaining mostly about overall carbs (which are high but are offset by massive fiber content). A couple of reviewers even said they were way better than shiritaki noodles.  I just ordered a single package... Fingers crossed.,False,False
