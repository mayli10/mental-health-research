I conquered a sugar addiction a year ago, and it's fucking hard, but so worth it. After going cold turkey on it for a year, I've been able to re introduce it and not binge on it. Not in the habit of eating it much anymore, but don't have to actively avoid it. It's nice.   Shit's more addictive than cocaine, and available EVERYWHERE... but you and I are tougher than it :) ",False,False

That's really awesome and inspirational. It's something I want to do to be more nutritious and start training for a marathon. Anyways, my dad has cut sugar from his diet for the past 2 years. If you work hard and make it a habit, it wont be hard anymore. But remember that having a ""cheat day"" in which you eat say, one cookie or one brownie, is helpful in the long run!!  Good job, you're awesome and amazing!!!!",False,False
