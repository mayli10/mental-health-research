It has helped improve my sleep and nighttime anxiety. It’s also helped reduce my paranoid thoughts. However... I definitely feel like it’s increased my appetite and helped me gain around 7lbs so far, but it’s also the holidays which makes it tough to eat healthy. I’m on a low dose of 2.5mg.",False,False

I was one of the very few people who did not gain weight. Perhaps it was because I was also on Effexor XR and Topamax at that time as well...Anyhow, I HATED that ""medicine"" as it made me feel like a zombie and sleep 12-14 hours per day!! Since I wanted to feel human again, I took myself off.",False,False

But I was already obese and using food to cope with my mental health issues. It helped me a lot honestly but I had to stop taking it because of the weight gain.,False,False

It was for bipolar disorder, and sleep problems. It didn't help my symptoms, so I stopped again, but I saw no weight gain.",False,False

One of my best friends, who has suffered from anorexia for many years, takes 7.5mg of olanzapine. The weight gain was definitely an element of why they put her on it, which she was (obviously) incredibly unhappy with. But over time things sort of balanced out and it didn't make much of a difference weight wise, she did say it calms down the ""ana voice"" if you know what that means (I class myself in the disordered eating group rather than eating disorder so I don't fully grasp what she has had to deal with). Olanzapine definitely helps with sleep though! Don't think her blood work was ever affected. Mine hasn't been while on seroquel.",False,False

I stopped taking it, kept restricting, lost the weight. I know people who had good experiences with it though.",False,False
