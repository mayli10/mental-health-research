Your right ED’s are a very irrational thing bouncing around inside our minds but you did a very rational thing. You saw you might be or maybe have slipped and had the courage to talk. Stress can be a big trigger for ED relapse. Your mother undergoing surgery and you sister getting married must be and must have created a lot of stress and pain for you at the moment.   Familiar behaviors like the weighting and counting. Can bring back learned behaviour and all the emotions around it. Like an ED self-fulfilling prophecy. The fact you can you see this being a problem without entering into a cycle, should give you strength. You adapted to the behavior around you and didn’t fall into old routines. Though lengthy exposure to these activities might make it harder to resist. Keeping a journal or posting regularly should and can help.   Finally that fact that your self-aware of your weight and where you are is only positive. Denial is big part of an ED. Blindly reacting to every trigger by denying where you are is what causes most of us who suffer with it to spiral. We will always face triggers and have testing days. Take strength from how you reacted to these testing moments. You won’t always get a win but knowing you can win helps strength your resolve and strength you for a brighter happier future.",False,False
