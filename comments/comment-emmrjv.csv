I myself am not trans, but this does not mean that you are invalid or have to be any sort of way.   First of all: You are you, and that is enough.   But labels aren't much of a help with something as complex as gender, body dysphoria, and eating disorders, because things can get tangled. It's okay to not be trans and it's okay to not be cis. It's okay to be gender fluid, masculine one day feminine the next, masculine all winter, feminine all spring, whatever brings you peace is what you need to do. If you are in a good workplace, there's even a set of wristbands you can wear that alert people to what pronouns you are feeling that day if that interests you.   My last thing is just a thought you might like to explore. I feel similarly to you, but I am quite cis. For me, it's very much related to a fear of growing up, of becoming a sexual object, and of leaving behind the peace of childhood. This may be an avenue worth exploring if it resonates with you. If not, we are all unique, and I hope you find what makes you happy and fulfilled.",False,False

I was there for a long while, and you are good and valid no matter where you end up. &lt;3  I find it interesting because I had the opposite problem for a while. I was hella gender questioning, but I was also overweight, and decided that it was cool to shove those thoughts deep down because ""it's not like anyone will ever see you as masculine"". But then I lost 60 lbs and it all clicked and I realized that if I could be skinny I could be a skinny /boy/ and that's what I really wanted.",False,False

Non conforming/queer as I like to call it.  Don't worry about not strictly fitting another category (trans/he or something else). That's just a repeat of trying to conform under a different set of constraints. You are you. And you are a lovable person as you are. Just focus on being **you** and don't give it a name. You are a complex human and 2 pronouns and a name doesn't define you.  &gt; ‚ÄúWhat's in a name? that which we call a rose.
