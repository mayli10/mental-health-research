Once you build up a few of them, it gets easier - you gain practice sitting with the urges until they disappear, and you can think ""I don't want to throw away my streak"" and you get positive reinforcement like finding food that you bought awhile ago, and forgot about. The book Brain Over Binge has been REALLY helpful for me, and others on this sub.",False,False

When I feel like b/ping OR just straight up binging I collect recipes, look at pictures of food, plan my meals.... I'm obsessed with food, but that doesn't necessarily include EATING food.    I guess the best advice is find out what is triggering you to binge (for me its a food obsession) and find a way to deal with the urges without binging. If being alone in the house is triggering you, go outside for a walk. If boredom is causing you to binge, try to develop a new hobby.  ",False,False
