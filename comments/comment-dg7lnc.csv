I had a moment at the beginning of 2019 when I was doing really well and was kind of off handed venting to my (very loving and supportive fiancé) who is a weight lifter about this whole thing and he offered to start helping me with weight training.  He’s always been wonderful and because at the moment I was *recovered* I gave it a try. Through the whole thing he was amazingly attentive and encouraging and then about five weeks in to my “fitness journey” I weighed myself like a moron and found out that I was 117lbs  Well as it turns out I wasn’t quite as recovered as I thought I was and totally spiraled and because those extra 3 pounds were muscle I couldn’t just starve it off quickly, I had to wait until my legs atrophied back down to my bs “safe weight” and it took almost a month which set me off even worse.  Of course my poor fiancé felt terrible because he felt like he pushed me too hard and was understandably frustrated that I regressed on all of my progress with my mental health.   I feel super bad about it, because trying to talk to people in my everyday life about it is like “I don’t understand why you’re bitching about this, you’re recovered aren’t you? If you want a nice ass just start weight training?”  And me being like “lol you do not understand how much I apparently cannot do that. As it turns out, I don’t even want a nice ass, I just don’t want anyone else to have one because I don’t like it when other women get more attention than me because it makes me hate myself.”  Because that is a trash, disordered opinion and I genuinely wish I didn’t have it, but here we are.",False,True

It’s like a half and half split between jealousy over the fact that being underweight doesn’t get me the attention that it used to, but also a deep melancholy when I think of all of the happiness that I missed out on as a teenager and young adult.   Then add on top of that the conflict that I’ve always felt with wanting to love and support other women but also constantly comparing myself to every girl I’ve ever seen to make sure I’m allowed to be happy in that particular moment and then feeling shitty about it.",False,True

I used to have an ass and thighs when I was younger and somehow people always find it okay to point it out. ""You looked so much better before"" ""What happened?"" ""Aren't you Latina where's your ass?"" bruh it's not like I get to choose :))))) I grew up surrounded by stick-thin Russians and Koreans that were walking thinspo and now, living in the West, I get all sorts of stupid comments about how I am too small and how I can be cute but not hot. The worst part is this is all coming from other women! What happened to the whole ""sticking together""?  One just can't win, and although the reasons for my ED don't even have to do with attractiveness that much this sure as hell brings me down every single time because it's just another dimension on how I will never be good enough :/   And in a way... this even keeps me from recovering. I am so mad at the way this new body ideal is imposed that my way to walk all over it is by not buying into it and, you guessed it, not wanting to put on weight as a result. Ugh.",False,False

So nothing really changed.  My sister is shaped like a doll. She is freaking beautiful but bigger and a few of my friends are bigger (but healthy still pears or hourglass') seeing them feel nice makes me happy.

I work with teens, and have noticed a big shift in body image over the past few years. We have an end of year pool party, and while I would have never dreamed of it, nowadays, 90% of the girls are out there in bikinis, regardless of their shape. At 15, I didn’t know that cellulite was normal, that other people weren’t perfect either. Yet these kids, they are so unconcerned, so confident, so happy in spite of being imperfect.  I’m so glad for them. Really- I would never want a teen girl to agonise over their body like I did/do. But man, I wish that came into fashion a decade ago.",False,False

I have a feeling that won't make you feel better but it's true!  I don't mean this in a condescending way but you are still so young and your prefrontal cortex and hormones aren't quite finished being incompetent assholes to you.

You need a big ass, a big chest, but god forbid your stomach isn’t flat and your legs/arms are too big or muscular (even though muscles are almost always the only way to get that ass without surgery). Your chest has to stay perky while being enormous, and you’ll be mocked for cellulite but also mocked if your body is “too” firm. Society just fucking sucks.",False,False

I went to Florida in July and I had the weirdest time with my body there. I was heavier than I am right now and felt super chubby, but I was staying with a Cuban friend of mine and hanging out with his Cuban family/friends and they all made so many comments about me being a skinny little white girl and how small I was. It was the weirdest thing ever because I simultaneously felt both too fat and too skinny and unattractive at both ends of the spectrum.   I'm a hell of a lot thinner now and am starting to get the comments that guys prefer thiccer girls. I don't know why it's appropriate to say that to me whenever I don't go around telling bigger women that guys prefer thinner girls. Plus, I'm not interested in dating at all right now because ED has consumed my life, and I don't just date men, I'm bi, so assuming that my only goal is to attract men with my body adds another layer of insult.   If I wanted to be considered attractive in today's society, I'd stop losing weight, start eating and lifting heavy (but only for your ass! nowhere else!), and gain back about 10 lbs.

This honestly is nothing new.  Look at 1910s vs 1920s style.  Not much of a time difference for the big swing in ""ideal"" body type. Or this is really screwy - 1950s.  BOTH Marilyn Monroe AND Audrey Hepburn were considered beautiful screen sirens in their own ways. The people who decide current beauty trends do not want women to be happy.
