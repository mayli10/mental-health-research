Mines 31.6 at the moment and it's been all over the charts. I've been as low as 129lbs ( borderline underweight, and I'm clear up to 190lbs at the moment ). I've been up and down for years now. It's terrible and this is what eating disorders do. I will binge for long periods. Hence why I'm where I'm at now, then I'll go though periods of not eating ( where I've been the last few days and probably much longer ). I've gone days eating 5,000 calories. Gone days purging, gone days eating nothing, gone days eating 200 calories ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Its a never ending cycle and it fucking sucks. And binge eating is absolutely an eating disorder. On top of that just like not eating, you want nothing more than to be pencil thin.",False,False
