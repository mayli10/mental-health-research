I know realistically, at one point I could have been diagnosed with anorexia and currently, I probably could be diagnosed with EDNOS or OSFED or whatever it's called now. But I feel like a fake because sometimes I will just eat normally. Sometimes I will restrict. Sometimes I binge. And yeah, sometimes I purge after, but sometimes I don't.    Anyway, I'm rambling. I'm here to say your eating disorder is valid. Just because you eat normally sometimes does not mean you aren't suffering. Even if the guilty feelings aren't there all of the time, you are still suffering.",False,False
