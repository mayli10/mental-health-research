I'll never forget that moment, 5 mL of oil, weighed on my scale.  I can't recommend it enough, it's worth any delay on your weight loss.  Get that cheesecake babe ",False,False

I went to a tea party with my grandma and there was figgy pudding. It is so dense and filled with  jelly... It looked amazing! I just had to lie and say I was filled up from tea while she enjoyed it. I want to get there, and you will too! I have worked my way up to  800 Cal max a day and it has been very tough. I wish you all the best and just know I, and everyone on this sub, is here for you. ðŸ’œ",False,False

I watch this ASMR video, a librarian role play, and she's reading about all these cheesecakes in a cheesecake recipe book and it makes me want to cry!  I'm not sure what my ultimate goal is and I was never a massive fan of cakes, but to be able to eat a slice with a coffee would be amazing.    Maybe take it slow and see how much you can manage.  A forkful or half of one might motivate you.  I think I'll start off with something dry like coffee and walnut cake and work my way up to something hardcore like black forest gateau.  Even if it's only a sliver of the walnut cake I reckon it could nudge open the door to the universe of desserts and cakes.    I'm rambling here, but I looked on the Christmas pudding my SO bought (but didn't feel like eating in the end) and a quarter of it was over my daily allowance of cals.  I'm a high restrictor too.  I hate that stuff, but it'll be good when calories lose their importance.  Thousands of people would've eaten that with a massive plate of food and wouldn't give it a second thought.    We'll get there X",False,True

I think that when I realised what I'd been missing when I ate toast recently and it was heaven (even with accompanying anxiety).  I even started picking the top, crispy part of the potato off and put it on the side because NO WAY, but then remembered THAT'S THE BEST PART!!!  Yep, a heavily restricted list of foods is misery.  I've been amazed how my mood's improved today and it's all because I effin' loved that nut roast and potato.  2019 will be a good year for us   X",False,True

Trying fear foods was one of the most difficult yet rewarding parts of treatment for me. It's so worth it to be able to eat more than just three or four safe foods without breaking down.

That is a huge goal of mine for next year. Those bad boys pack more cals than I eat in a day and that's fucking terrifying. ,False,False
