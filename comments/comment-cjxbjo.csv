Just know that they love you now even as you are, and they'll certainly love you in the future too, whether you get better or not, quickly or slowly. Pets don't judge as long as you feed them and give them attention 😃  You got a ton of great advice here about therapy, which I definitely recommend too. That was even more important for me than my bird, and if you can see someone who specializes in ED's, they'll help you even more. I know you're worried about being laughed away, which I won't say is impossible because even some professionals are horribly misguided and prejudiced.

Have a look around - maybe try looking for psychs that specialise in treating eating and mood disorders.   I’ve seen a few mental health professionals, and once I briefly saw a psych who was a man of his late 60’s, who seemed to be long overdue for retirement. He told me that my purging habit could be treated if I had a better relationship with my mother, and in the most casual disregard I’d ever heard from a psych professional. He was entirely unprofessional and unsympathetic. I dropped him after the second appointment.   Mental health professionals should be exactly that - professional. Your psych sounds pretty useless, and I’d 100% recommend finding a lady psych, or someone who specialises in eating disorders, mood disorders or addiction. If you find someone who seems to fit just go into the intake session and see if they’re going to be able to help you with what you need.",False,False

I don't know if you'd fit the diagnostic criteria, but binge eating disorder is just as valid an eating disorder as any other, even though it's taken much less seriously.      some of what you've said resonates with me. I was a compulsive binge eater and very overweight in my early teens - i'd been overweight for a lot of my childhood and it got to the point where I was eating an entire 2-litre tub of ice cream, an entire box of cereal and several servings of each meal every day. I had incredibly low self esteem, and ended up trading one form of disordered eating for several others. I've gone through binge-purge phases, i've gone through excessive purging phases, i've gone through excessive restriction and exercising phases, i've been underweight, i've had breakdowns over food and calories, i've ballooned after going on excessive days-long binge sprees. And one thing I noticed is that people *never* take disordered eating in the form of compulsive eating, or eating in excess, as seriously as they do the opposite. The concern I would get when I was restricting heavily was surprising. Nobody cared when I was fat. Nobody worried when I was so depressed that I was eating all of my feelings. The only worries anybody had for me was when I was starving myself.    One point that really stands out to me is when I'd been yoyo-ing between binge eating and restricting for a while at one point, and I had an appointment scheduled with my GP, a clinician with training in mental health treatment. She was aware of my disordered eating, and she asked if i'd been restricting. I'd been very depressed for the last week or so, and I told her i'd been binge eating. Her response? Something along the lines of ""Good, i'm glad you're eating."" That made me really angry. I was in a bad place whenever my disordered eating was becoming a problem, regardless of how they were manifesting, yet people only saw my binge eating as nothing more than gluttony.      I believe, all forms of disordered eating are harmful. But some are taken more seriously than others. See a psychologist for treatment - if your binge eating is a problem you can't control, then there are most definitely psychological factors at play and some kind of treatment could definitely make a big difference in your life.",False,False

Guess what? having an eating disorder doesn’t always make you skinny, sometimes it just makes you an even more unhealthy overweight person.   Body image is so hard when you’re not your only critic. My whole life people have been telling me to stop eating or get off my ass, sometimes strangers. So it makes self love really hard when the world is telling you that you don’t deserve it.   My best advice is dress comfy, nothing feels worse than pants or a shirt that you’re always pulling on or are too restricting. I also don’t start my day by looking in the mirror, I don’t have one in my bathroom.

I would recommend only cutting 500 calories per day. You'll lose one pound per week at that rate. It should also be much easier than trying to starve yourself. You can easily cut 500 calories just by making healthier choices. If you eat foods that are filling and low in calories you won't feel so hungry. Don't cut calories too much though or you will still feel starved. You may also want to mix in unhealthy foods every few days just to keep cravings down. It will be a slow process to weight loss, but it will be worth it when you're no longer borderline obese. Just don't take it too far. When you get to a healthy weight it's important to eat at maintenance. If you become underweight it will be too easy to get fall below your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) which could lead to increased feelings of starvation and subsequently overeating.

I have had many of these same feelings toward myself, and it can make simply existing pure torture.  Based solely on the information you give in this post, you most likely have an eating disorder. Have you ever sought help from a therapist? Having a professional to discuss these thoughts with and get some fact checking feedback and advise would probably be helpful. And someone who specializes in food issues might be able to point you toward a dietician who can help. I know living with depression and eating disorders can seem like a never ending black hole of despair, but I wish you all the best in your journey forward. Please seek help from someone who can meet with you on a regular basis.   Sending you love from one fighter to another. We may be in the midst of the struggle of our lives, but there is always hope for something better if we continue to push onward.",False,False

You feel like nothing will be better until you lose weight. One of the first steps is to try to get away from stress eating and eating too much in general. Find other outlets when you're upset. Losing weight is faster when you're heavier to begin with, give yourself time to see results",False,False
