I absolutely suck at fasting, so I feel so invalid in those subs, and even these subs when people fast for days at a time regularly. It is much better for me to just restrict heavily everyday than fast. But yeah I feel super invalid and dumb. Like how can I admit I have an ED when other people out here fasting for a week, while I usually eat every day??",False,False

I know for me heavy restriction is in part self harm. I *want* to feel like shit, I want to punish my body. In a twisted way I want to fail because I *don't deserve to reach my goals*. So tips and tricks on making it more bearable don't register with me. Add on the absolute destruction and demonisation of online spaces for people with EDs that massively limits the harm reduction techniques that most fasters use as a given.   I really like your point about them eating normally otherwise. I hadn't considered that before and even now you've pointed it out I'm struggling to envision anything other than a binge/restrict cycle. But I guess that comes along with the fact that people who eat normally aren't constantly obsessing over food. It's actually a sentiment you see a lot in fasting communities, people talking about how they're X hours in and can't stop thinking about their next meal as if that's not a thing for them even when not restricting.",False,False

I basically didn’t eat for 2 weeks other than water and Diet Coke. I was obese at the time and I got addicted to the fast weight loss. I couldn’t keep it up forever but I tried to eat as little as I could for a long time. Most obese people are great at fasting because you don’t have to make conscious decisions about food—you can just not eat at all and it’s mentally easier.,False,False

Then memes about water.   And questions about snake juice.  What annoys me more is how thirsty these guys are to get Instagram followers or Youtube subscribers. They advertise themselves like fasting is the easiest thing in the world and act as influencers. We all know, ED or not, how difficult it is to stop eating.

Wasn't saying you can't have an ED at any weight, just that it seems like a lot of them use it as a tool to achieve a healthy weight then stop their fasting and go back to a healthy diet. But yes I agree with you, engaging in the fasting in the first place means these people run the risk of not being able to stop fasting and getting into disordered thoughts.  I just think the fasting sub is a horrible place because they all encourage each other to KEEP NOT EATING. Like wtf haha!",False,False

Like, the fact that we have eating disorders makes it perfectly reasonable to me that it would be harder for us to fast than if we were normal people who had legit weight to lose.  I see it as similar to how sex workers can sleep with someone and not form an emotional attachment, but a lonely girl still letting her ex-bf come over at night for no-strings-attached sex after he broke her heart is gonna struggle to keep her feelings separate. She cares too much, but it's a practical act to fulfill a need for the sex worker.  Same deal for us. An overweight person has a practical need for fasting; we have an emotional one.",False,False

Like another user posted, lots of those people are obese/overweight and just trying to get to a healthy BMI, whereas I think most of us would agree that we wouldn't mind being pretty severely underweight. Plus some people on that sub embark on these extreme fasts, but once they hit the weight/day limit that they wanted to get to, they stop. We can't stop.   We have compulsions, and they're beyond what we can control. I think fasting can be a method of losing weight that works well for some people and allows them to eat freely when they're not fasting, so in that way it's healthy for THEM. But for others on that sub I definitely see them having signs of an eating disorder.   At the end of the day I don't think fasting should be something widespread or promoted. If someone could benefit from fasting, that's a conversation they should have with their doctor, and they shouldn't be posting their success stories online because regardless of whether they include an ""I'm not a doctor"" disclaimer, it still shows that, ""oh this person fasted for 10 days and didn't die or hurt themselves, so I can do it too.""  That's my two cents.",False,False

Frankly, it's much easier to fast when you have lots of secondary energy reserves (that is to say, body fat) since that's what you run on when you enter fasting ketosis.  Secondly, if they've picked fasting/IF as their weight loss method, they are extremely unlikely to be dieting/restricting during their ""eating periods"". they eat normally. theyre not starving themselves all the time. Really the only exception might be those who eat keto when they do eat, which is kind of restrictive but not calorie wise.  I have a lot of mixed feelings about that sub. Definitely a lot of the users are in pseudo eating disorder territory, but I also experimented (and am experimenting) with long term fasting and weirdly enough, I can see how this is possible for a normal person. Idk. I have a lot of mixed feelings  Also it takes a lot of time to work up to a 7 day or longer fast. It's not like they're just jumping in. It took me months to work my way up to a 7 day water fast, and I'm someone who already has experience starving myself lmao.",False,False

I never comment or anything, but I’m really afraid of like dying in my sleep or something (?) and going on those subs and seeing that these normal totally fine people are fasting for like 3 weeks makes me feel like what I’m doing is safe and normal even though it’s probably not because most people on those subs are v obese  I do love living in downtown Denialville though so my perspective is probably really warped tbh",False,False
