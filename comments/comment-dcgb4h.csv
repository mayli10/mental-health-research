Further, for some people, a simple-carb high diet can cause blood sugar spikes that lead to things like overeating or lethargy. If you’re just trying to straight up lose weight, it’s more about CICO than macros, but I think it’s better to aim for a balance of macros while also focusing on CICO.",False,False

Try to have at least unprocessed food though, since you don't eat enough to meet all your needs. Eating your carbs and sugars in the form of an apple is better than in the form of a Twinkie for exemple. You get more nutrients and vitamins too.",False,False
