Typically we are drawn to a fantasy knowing that’s all it is. There’s a distinct difference in what we are attracted to for a partner and lover versus just someone we’d just bang. It doesn’t make you any less than, it doesn’t mean he wants you to conform to that, it doesn’t mean he doesn’t love and appreciate your body. All it means is that those are the type of women he would bang with no further pursuit of connection.",False,False

Just because he thinks these other girls are attractive doesn't mean that he finds you unattractive. You're beautiful in your own way and if he can't tell that, then you don't need him. If you're really uncomfortable, I would bring it up to him and ask for reassurance.",False,False
