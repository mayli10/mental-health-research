I skipped dinner, the first of many times, and I cried myself to sleep, feeling like it was an inevitable part of my identity now.  I became obsessed with counting calories and how much I was or wasn't eating.  I would drink a glass of water that would keep me from eating because I felt bloated and then reward myself with a piece of chewing gum.  I lost 30 pounds in a month.  Its been 7 years since that time, and I can finally say that after getting treatment and taking medications, I'm finally starting to get over it.  It took me a long time but you can get there.  Reaching out for help and opening up to people can be scary but its worth it.  Most people are more understanding than you think.  It took me four therapists and a psychiatrist to get here but the work has been worth it.  Keep pushing.  The fact that you recognise your problem is a good first step.
