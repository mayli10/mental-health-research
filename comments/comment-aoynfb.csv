That’s my reason for having a list, but I can tell in your post that you’re fighting a different kind of darkness.

All of a sudden, things weren’t pitch black; they were just... dark, because I’d seen a glimpse of life on the other side. I had context all of a sudden, and this sadness wasn’t the only thing I knew how to feel.   I relapse all the time, and sometimes I’m a huge mess, but now I know it’s not permanent. I know I can have moments and those moments can string together and become entire days of feeling normal.   I felt like a huge idiot for getting help, honestly. Like a fraud who brought all her problems upon herself. But today I’m still here, and I can honestly say that I’m glad, even though a huge part of me always wishes my ED would just be the end of me.   I’m so glad you ate an apple.
