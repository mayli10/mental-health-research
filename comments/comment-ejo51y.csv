I gave meds another chance and went back on Zoloft...but am now on meds that work better for my needs. There's a ton of other SSRIs (and some SNRIs) that have slightly different mechanisms of action and target specific symptom clusters better than others. If your psych is good they'll know which ones are a good fit, as long as you're firm about communicating which symptoms you want to target most (or which side effects are a deal-breaker). Also adding anti-anxiety meds is an option (including some non-benzo ones if you're worried about dependency). Therapy, mindfulness and lifestyle changes can also do wonders (when paired with meds!)  It's a frustrating process sometimes, but it's so worth it if you have patience. You're on the right path and I hope you find meds that help improve your quality of life + find peace within yourself",False,False

Different people have different successes with different meds, which is what can make the process so frustrating! Sometimes the doctor will suggest an adjusted dose, sometimes a different med, sometimes adding in another complementary med. I hope you’ll quickly land on what is effective for you!",False,False
