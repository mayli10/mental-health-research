Firstly because they, as you observed, make you really sick in an empty stomach, but also because several important vitamins are fat-soluble. Essentially, if you don't eat a meal with some amount of fat in it, the vitamins won't be absorbed by your body, so you're missing out on the whole point of taking a multivitamin. Just wait to take it with your biggest me of the day (or rather, meal with the most fat; better to eat it with a tablespoon of PB than a huge salad with no dressing).",False,False
