I used to spend so much time listening to some friends. But when I eventually expressed how I'm feeling, how I was really down and felt worthless, they wouldn't even bother messaging me once in a while just to show they care. Apparently I'm not worth even a tiny bit of effort and that just got me feeling even worse. I kept thinking that maybe if I wasn't so worthless, they'd treat me like I've seen others been treated when they're going through something.   Anyways there's nothing wrong with setting boundaries. Don't set yourself on fire for others and I think that applies in your situation. You should absolutely not let anyone make you feel like a garbage bin. You're just looking out for yourself and that's fine. All the best to you x",False,False
