The party is in two hecking weeks and I'm already panicking. So I get you, you're not alone.",False,False

Unfortunately itâ€™s a sit down dinner where the host is cooking and Iâ€™m bringing dessert. Iâ€™m hoping thereâ€™s something that wonâ€™t stress me out too much (these people know my parents so I donâ€™t want any bad news getting back to them). My boyfriend will be with me too which is comforting. Thank you so much ðŸ’•ðŸ’•,False,True

I kinda get how you feel, I also hate eating around others &amp;/or eating stuff I donâ€™t personally prepare. It sucks. A hecc ton.  If I was in your situation, I would look for foods I felt safe eating and have some of those. Another thing that could work (if itâ€™s an option for you) would be to bring a foodâ€” either a small snack orâ€” if you asked the host beforehandâ€” even a dish that you could prepare.  As for eating around others, do you know if thereâ€™s a place you can go to be alone? You could also say youâ€™re not feeling well and that you need some space, although doing that might backfire.  Whatever you end up doing, just remember that you're strong. You can do this. And at worst, itâ€™s only one night. It'll probably be difficult, but you'll get through it, and then itâ€™ll be over.  Good luck! I wish you the best!!!",False,False
