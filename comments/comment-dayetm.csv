So, honestly, it eventually doesn’t seem like the big deal it once seemed.",False,False

Went to the sexual health clinic though and they said they think it is herpes. They’ve tested me for other things though to confirm. I’m just in so much pain and feel awful though :( hope the anti virals they gave me will calm it down though,False,True

Is there a Planned Parenthood near you? They tend to be much more sensitive.   Also, while there is a lot of herpes stigma out there, it's important to note that SO MANY people have it, and are just asymptomatic. After reading articles like [this](https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/j5q3gy/herpes-welcome-to-the-disease-you-probably-have), I've decided to just assume anyone I encounter has herpes, and that I won't worry about it (not least bc I too could have herpes, so *shrug*).   Unfortunately, you won the ""I have symptoms,"" lottery, but symptoms are usually worst during the initial outbreak, and get better with time.",False,False

I’ve had it going on 8 years and it’s barely an issue now. I’m sorry you’re going though this, but I promise you’ll be ok.",False,False
