I've tried to keep eating and made sure I'm keeping my fluids up and most of the bloat has gone down today thankfully.",False,True

Based on the numbers you gave it's very very unlikely that you gained any actual weight. For me, it usually takes around 48 hours for the aftermath of a binge to go away. My best advice is to stay hydrated (tea is great if you like tea, but water will work), eat a normal amount of calories or as close to normal as you can stomach, including plenty of veggies and whole grains to move things along fiber-wise, and try not to freak out.  Sorry to give such vanilla advice but nothing else seems to work for me. At my lowest point I've drank coffee to produce a BM and either worked out in the sun or bundled myself up to sweat out salt and water just to see the scale go down, but that's super unsafe and probably causes some rebound bloating from the dehydration. So yeah, fiber, water and time are the best remedies imo.",False,False
