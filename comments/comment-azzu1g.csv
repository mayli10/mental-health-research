Then reorganize that list from easiest to hardest. Do one thing per day. Then, this is the most important part, thank yourself for doing that thing. Acknowledge how hard you are working, how hard it was to do the thing, and you did it anyways. Even if it's just loading the dishwasher. And if you can't do it for you, do it for future you. I used to give up on getting off the couch after 5pm, leaving all the messy kitchen and everything else for tomorrow. My mornings started to suck, having to clean up first thing when I woke up. I started telling myself at night, even though I hate myself right now and just wanna go check out, do this one favor for my furture self. It slowly lead to me being a lot more productive at night. Mornings I can drink coffee and meditate, knowing I cleared that time for myself.  Equally as important, forgive yourself if you have days where you just can't. It's okay to take days off.
