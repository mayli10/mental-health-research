My mom's always been petite like this, I don't understand how she's able to maintain her weight despite eating whatever she wants whenever she wants + consuming a lot of carbs (she really LOVES rice) while not exercising (her exercise is doing household chores, she doesn't workout) and I'm jealous",False,True

That was the case with my sister and so many people I knew in high school.

But then I realized, it’s probably because they don’t eat/snack much at home? I know skinny people who skip breakfast because they’ll be ‘late to class’ and skinny people who don’t eat dinner because they forget. Like I realized that it’s probably it’s their only meal for the day, so even if it’s a burger from McDonalds, they aren’t really eating anything else, that’s why they’re able to maintain it.",False,True
