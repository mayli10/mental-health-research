Because I’m pretty sure that would be physiologically impossible, but I’m interested to know if I’m wrong.  And I like how you didn’t respond to the two people who pointed out how your dx will change when you get underweight.  And if you truly wanted to deter people from purging there’s a MYRIAD of side effects you could have mentioned, if you are an RN then you know this. But I suspect that’s not why you made your comment, you just wanted to feel superior to us gross fat bulimics, lol.",False,False

They’ve literally done studies and you do get rid of ~ 50% of the calories for smaller binges, and for larger binges (I think &gt;3000 (?) kcal, don’t recall), it’s even more than 50%. It’s about making sure of CICO. If your binge remainders are &gt; or = deficit from restriction you’ll gain or maintain, respectively.  ETA: also what the other responder said, once you’re underweight your diagnosis changes to AN-B/P subtype.

It only took one (successful) time to purge to send me into full overdrive. I can already feel the sensitivity in my teeth (which i never had before bc I literally bite ice cream skdhdk) , dry raw throat, weak voice, chest pains, etc. Mind you its only been a little less than 2 weeks. its honestly not worth it at all and you should definitely try to stop :( please be safe bb",False,False

We don't eat anything outside of b/p's are are usually very vigilant about getting everything up.  You don't see any thin bulimics because as soon as they get underweight, their diagnosis changes to anorexia-b/p subtype. Diagnostically, you can't be an underweight bulimic.

I told myself I would never cross that line. I tried a couple of times but never succeded.  Well, saturday I binged.  Purged and the chocolate of a brioche I ate came out.  I was... Satisfied.  Knowing that my body wouldn't absorbe that damn nutella.  Then on Sunday I did it again. I never purged a whole meal, I alway purge like a third or half so I can cut the calories. On monday I was nervous, mad with my boyfriend and I purged to punish myself... (?) WTF.  Yesterday I didn't, and we'll keep it that way.  And that will be the last time, I promise.  Purging is the beginning of the end for me. It hurts, it is uncomfortable, I have to get all sneaky about it so my family doesn't find out... No. I will not do it again.",False,False

I've always been a violent vomiter when it came to being actually sick so I thought purging was never an option for me. I hadn't thrown up in literal years and then I got sick after my brother's graduation dinner and the food just. Came up. Like that. No heaving, no crying, no shakes like usual. The next night I had taco bell with my friends and came home and thought... I wonder... And sure enough. Came right up. Uh oh. I tried to purge again tonight because I had an unexpected meal and only got about a third of it up and heaved. Shook. Cried. I feel AWFUL. So my little window of easy purging is over, and I'm (hopefully) not going to try it again. It's not worth this.",False,False
