Mine was “Hi. My name is ____. I’m here today because I need something to hold me accountable. Life is making it hard right now.” Doesn’t have to be any more specific than that! They may not even want you to name a disorder, depends how strict your group is on specifics.",False,False

I think my two biggest questions are: 1) how is it all set up, like I know there’s the introductions and stuff, but like is there a theme you stick to the whole time? do you just kinda talk about how you’re doing?? how does all that work? 2) when introducing yourself, is it one of those situations where you’re like “hi my name is jobbluetooth, and I’m bulimic”",False,True

That’s great! I just started attending a local group two weeks ago and it’s already made a huge difference in my mindset and commitment to recovery.  Second, it’s normal to be nervous, but I promise you’ll leave wondering what on Earth you were worried about. I left my first session in happy tears. It was the first time I actively felt like I deserved to recover and motivates me to keep fighting when things are hard.  Now, each group is a little different, but there are some general overlaps:  1. You’ll probably go around the room and introduce yourself, especially since you’d be new. 2. People will be asked if they have anything they want to talk about. No one can force you to talk about anything. It’s totally okay to say you aren’t ready. 3. When telling stories, good or bad, they’ll ask you to keep behaviors vague and not include numbers, so as to avoid unintentionally triggering anyone else in the group who may be in a vulnerable place. 4. Everything in group has an expectation of confidentiality, so don’t be afraid to speak up. The group leaders won’t like force you into additional treatment and no one is going to laugh at you. You’re all there for the same basic reason. You want to get better, or at least not get worse. 5. Being in contact with group people outside of group is generally encouraged if it’s something you’re up for! Always good to have that support network outside of formal weekly sessions.  I hope that helps. :) Feel free to message if you have any specific questions!",False,False
