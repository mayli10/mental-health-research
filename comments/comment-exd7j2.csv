As soon as I take a bite of something it‚Äôs over for me and I end up binging and feeling like shit. Happened to me while I was cooking. The last meal before that was like 2 days prior and I just thought that getting a little taste of the sauce won‚Äôt be harmful. I ended up eating the meal with my family and feeling horrible afterwards.,False,False

I know it's frustrating but it could be worse, like.... A sugar waffle or deep fried sausage rolls.  So your binges aren't great but they are healthy fats and that's better than what it could be.

But muffins and cookies?  Cakes?  Ugggghhggggghghfhfhfh so good.  Especially with chocolate in them.  God I am fantasising about a chocolate chip muffin.  I know its taste amazing.  But it's temporary and won't fulfill my happiness long term.  But I want it.  Even though I'm terrified of gaining weight.  Rip now I want to cry.,False,False

If I go without eating for a while like today, I may not stop thinking about when I get to eat but my body isn't physically hungry until I eat my first meal where I suddenly become a Hoover. I have work tomorrow morning and during the week I eat breakfast so I don't fall asleep in class and I feel fine at school but my job is a stressful retail one where I'm surrounded by binge foods so I'm trapped between not eating before work and being lightheaded all day or eating but then craving the cheap sweets by the register.",False,False
