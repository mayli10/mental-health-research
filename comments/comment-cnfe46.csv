I often wish I could just dissipate. Close my eyes, let go and just dissolve and float up into nothingness. I get sad, tired and frustrated of being alive but I don‚Äôt want to kill my self, and I don‚Äôt really want to die, I just don‚Äôt want to BE.   Please remember that you are not worthless. I‚Äôm glad you have your son as a reason to keep going. It sounds like you work hard to take care of him and he‚Äôs lucky to have you.",False,False

I have severe depression that makes it hard to do just about anything and all these neurotypical people keep calling me lazy or whatever. Like okay, I've been in therapy for years and I stopped because those therapists were even calling me lazy and that I needed to 'get my shit together' okay,okay I get it everyone hates me and I should die.",False,False

I‚Äôm so fucking tired. It‚Äôs my nine year anniversary of my ED this month. I‚Äôm so close to a full decade of this bullshit. Half my life wasted.,False,False

And I like to observe the world. I just wish I could drift through it at will, without any body someone could look at or see... And just jet around like a spectator in a video game. Pop into someone's POV and back out when I'm bored. Ride passenger and then float and fly over the cities for a bit. But not have to be a person....",False,False

A therapist in inpatient called it secondary suicide. Like you don‚Äôt want to kill yourself but want to die. Right there with you most of the time. Mostly what I call the ‚ÄúTom Sawyer Effect‚Äù. Ya know- he viewed his funeral therefore he knows who actually loves him. My fantasy.,False,False
