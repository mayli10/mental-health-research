I totally relapsed trying to lose weight healthily but I can tell you for a fact that your bmr is higher than 750 cals for literally 100% sure. I also have hypothyroidism and I've been able to lose weight via pure CICO in the past (with and without having an ED lol), it didn't nuke my metabolism like some people say it does, especially if you're on replacement thyroid hormone. I'm mostly sedentary for medical reasons and that never got in the way too much either, you don't need to work out if you don't want to - though it can be enjoyable ofc for its own sake :) I believe in you and fingers crossed!! Stay on that healthy shit bc god knows EDs are some nonsense bullshit",False,False
