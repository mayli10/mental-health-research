I'm only 5'1 and I swear my rib cage is so WIDE. My ribs are clearly visible at every angle so it's not like I can lose any more fat to reduce my waist any lower than 24"".

A shorter torso can just mean your bone structure is a little wider. Being so thin I doubt your waist looks big to anyone.,False,False
