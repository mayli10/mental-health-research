I say I'm not hungry and my boyfriend calls me out on my bullshit because I'd have eaten one meal the whole day. Some days I go about 24hrs without eating if I'm really going downhill. I spend more time in a day with him than I do with my family typically, so my family doesn't notice.   I feel like I can't eat without him, like I can't enjoy a meal without him being with me, but when I'm with him I'm afraid he'll think I'm disgusting if I eat, like I think of myself, which I know he wouldn't. My brain just tells me that.  He tells me ""I'd rather have a fat girlfriend who enjoys eating than a skinny girl I can't share a meal with"" I appreciate the sentiment but, to me I correlated that to me eating = me getting fat again and it fucked me up. I think about him saying that all the time.  I won't eat all day, he'll ask if I'm hungry or his family will ask why I haven't eaten all day. ""I forgot"" or ""I'm not hungry"" is my usual response but, it's usually true. The thought of eating grosses me out sometimes. My appetite has decreased insanely since I've lost a bunch of weight.  My boyfriend will ask if I'm hungry and I'll say I don't know, and he'll usually convince me to eat. It upsets him when I starve myself, he's not stupid and he knows. It hurts me to see him sad.",False,False
