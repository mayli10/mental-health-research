I'm so sorry you've gone through that stuff omg. When I was 14 one of my dad's work colleagues said I looked 17 and my dad blamed me. A lot of guys and girls are like that.   And when I was at a 17 BMI, nobody saw me like a sex doll. I got treated like everyone's quirky little sister and it was amazing.  I digress. I wish you the best too!!",False,False

What the hell. That is very much not okay and must be horrific. I’m so sorry.   This really hurt to read, and I wish I knew what to say.   I think that’s certainly a familiar thing for a lot of people with EDs though, you know, like in some way(s) relating these kinds of fears and feelings to being sexualized.   I know I’ve heard it expressed before—and I think it’s also been a thing for me personally maybe. Just in different ways,  Similarly though, I was *very* fat when I was around 12-ish and also looked much older as a result, so I think I might know what you mean there... I started losing weight at around 13 for the first time actually, but not enough weight to look totally curveless. So it sort of got worse for me at that point, even though I looked closer to my age? Possibly??? I’m not sure at this point tbh. Like it’s hard to say, but that was the first of many weight fluctuations to come.  Gahh. I don’t know! I mean, I’ve been at a fairly wide range of BMIs over the years (though my lowest weights reallyy weren’t all that low compared to many, haha, but still), and I honestly feel like there’s no way to win... I guess that’s what I’m trying to say here. It’s just awful that girls especially have to start considering this stuff at *such* young ages, and it’s so common that it’s just accepted as normal. 💔💔💔 It shouldn’t be! It’s fucked up!  For what it’s worth though, I don’t think that guys would particularly see you “in that way” based on you potentially gaining weight, though your feelings about it are 100% understandable.   And I wish you all the best.   You don’t deserve this shit.",False,False

I get these massive tits and butt and my mum likes to jiggle them and point out how curvy I am when I'm fat. I'm scared that when I get curves guys will think I want sex all the time and I don't want to look like a sex doll. My body is naturally voluptuous and my hips especially are very curvy. I just want to look like a child. Case in point: when I was 13, 5'2.5 and ~125 lbs, guys would hit on me just because I was fat and looked older.",False,False

I consider myself pretty recovered and I don't feel fat. I am generally happy with my life and think it beats the heck out of the misery of severe anorexia.   that said my anorexia was never about feeling or being fat, so ???",False,False

(And you’re welcome to if you’re an adult and it would make you feel better, without it just being reverse thinspo or something, lmao.) A BMI of 21 sounds small to me!!!   In all seriousness, there’s no doubt in my mind that you’re probably still very attractive and also *not* frumpy at all.   Accepting weight gain feels like garbage and is so, so hard for anyone in recovery, no mater what, but I’m sure you’re still a lot thinner than you feel!!! Dysmorphia is just a dick like that. More importantly, I’m sure your size can’t be the *only* thing that makes you physically attractive!  MORE importantly still, you have worth and value as a human person, regardless of your physical attractiveness.  I don’t know you of course and there’s not a whole lot of info here to be more specific with, but there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that you have many other important attributes worth considering and stuff, besides your widespread sex appeal.   This kind of shit really, truly sucks. But I do believe it will be worth it.",False,False
