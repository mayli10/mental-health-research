But your comment so was so hurtful I had to stop lurking. Please don't make toxic assumptions that the men who ""go for teeny boppers"" (which is also condescending) are *abusers* or *have short dicks*. I was 18 when I had my first boyfriend, who was 27 at the time. I was in my second year of college (a year early) and perfectly aware of the age difference. He was not taking advantage of me. He was a sweet, caring, considerate person, not an abuser, and didn't have issues with size. OP's ex's new girlfriend is 19. She is not ""literally fresh off of childhood."" The age of consent in many countries is 16. I'm sure many of us have been sexually active since before 18. 19 is not a child. She knows what she is doing, she is an adult, and it's incredibly patronizing to write her off as a kid.  &amp;#x200B;  I'm sure this was written from a place of either 1) Misdirected anger or 2) Exaggeration for the sake of cheering up the OP. But just in case it wasn't, and for the worrying amount of upvotes, I just had to get this off my chest. We can all get on the let's-hate-on-a-stranger-over-the-internet bandwagon, but let's not start throwing out umbrella terms like abuser or body-shaming towards people we don't know. And attacking teenage girls who apparently can't be desirable or responsible enough to date older men?  &amp;#x200B;  I'm sorry you've had a bad experience with men, OP, but these generalizations are harmful. I am 20 and dating a 34 year-old and neither our friends nor our family members make a big deal or even seem to particularly care about the gap at all. It's the healthiest, safest relationship I've ever been in.",False,False

I am also 26 so I am not some 17 year old who doesn't get what you are going through. You are going through hell right now in more ways than one and these circumstances are leading to dangerous feelings. You are not alone, and even if you absolutely hate yourself and want to die right now you are worth so much more than you can see. ",False,False

She is literally fresh off of childhood.  2. He is a fucking creep.    There are only two reasons I have found that men ever go for teeny boppers when they are grown: they are abusers or they are a short dick man. I highly doubt that your ex is a man worth keeping if he is 31 years old and grabbing girls straight out of high school, I don't think so. Plus if he has already gained 50 pounds, he's only gonna gain 50 more. It is project glow up time. You are young, smart, attractive, and TOO DAMN SMART TO MOURN A TRASH MAN. That is the one perk of being 7 years older than this little girl, you are old enough to know better. Have a good cry about it, and then you go get your nails done and a gloss treatment on your hair. Unplug from Insta and FB for a month and BLOCK HIS NUMBER. You need to put together a bad bitch playlist stat. Not everyone you lose is a loss, I promise you he isn't. ",False,False

Im also a lot bigger than when we  first got together (gained 50lbs over 5 years). I literally feel like trash. ,False,True
