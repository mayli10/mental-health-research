Like eventually becoming severely underweight.  BUT your frustrations with her are totally reasonable. Weight can definitely be lost in an unhealthy way, it’s probably why you’re on this sub. But also you say you were overweight and are just barely in the healthy BMI range. I think it’s unfair and maybe a little bit messed up that your mum is freaking about that. I’m sure it all comes from a place of genuine love and I don’t want to put too much on to ‘weight’ as a qualifier but it sounds like there might be more to it if everyone is overweight and they’re not comfortable unless you’re overweight too.",False,False
