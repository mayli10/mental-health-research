Sometimes(most times) all the liquid I drink in a day is energy drinks. (probs 8 small cans and one or two monster ultra cans) I always have a tray in my fridge and a couple of ultra monsters. It's horrible, I'm trying to drink more water now since it's an expensive addiction and I'm ashamed of how far it has gone. I legit freak out if I don't have any anymore. 22 years old btw for reference, I'm surprised my heart is keeping up with me. ",False,False

I'm always tired, so the placebo of ""I'm gonna have an energy drink now and get chores done!"" was more effective than the caffeine itself.
