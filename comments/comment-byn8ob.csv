I'm glad your looking out for her. Also thanks for being an ally. You are correct that there is higher percentage on the spectrum.   If she does go into unsafe territory I'd watch out and see if this becomes a special interest of hers. Sometimes that can happen, thats how it manifested for me.   Does she have other interests that she gets to indulge in or is this overriding all of her others?",False,False

There are no guarantees that she *will* develop an eating disorder; some people are able to restrict periodically without it being unhealthy. HOWEVER your friend needs to know that restriction is often a self-perpetuating cycle; the longer you do it, the more ingrained it becomes, the less satisfied you are with your body and the more weight you want to lose. She needs to know what disordered eating thoughts look like and that she should drop the diet (which is already overly-restrictive as it is), the *moment* she starts having them.   &amp;#x200B;  The good thing here is that it seems like she has support since she's told other people about her diet. You seem like a pretty caring friend, so it would be good to check up her periodically and ask her what she's been thinking or feeling lately. It would be a good idea to keep an eye on the things she does and says because even though people often deny that they have disordered eating thoughts, it becomes evident in their words and actions in ways that don't realize. Good luck with this and make sure to keep us updated and come here if you have any further worries!",False,False

Check in often, ask her how the strength training feels on the calorie deficit, and it would be worth mentioning to her that a lot of people on the 1200ip subreddit actually go 1300 or 1400 cals, especially if they're active. And express to her that 1200 is definitely below her bmr so if she does get sucked into a restrictive ED she will really quickly start to burn through the muscle she's working hard on.  Oh also mention that she wont really be able to build much muscle, if any at all, restricting cals like that.  At the end of the day tho, be supportive and encourage her to listen to her body and not get upset if she has to go over her calorie limit. Do everything you can to make sure her relationship with food stays healthy, we dont need any new members to the ED club",False,False
