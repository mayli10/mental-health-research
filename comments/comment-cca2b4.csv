Several months ago, I made the mistake of thinking Enlightened ice cream was dairy-free and I spent the entire next day with horrific cramps and pissing fire water. ðŸ˜­ Thank god for vegan Halo Top!   Also, another incentive for me to avoid dairy is that my skin cleared up so much since I had to stop eating it... I think itâ€™s inflammatory for many people even if it doesnâ€™t make it then sick.",False,False
