I am super bad at seasoning (no salt because bloating and hot spices/sauce on top of everything to make it taste less horrible and to make it more difficult to eat- that’s where it’s at tbh) so I’m always nervous about curries but I should look into it!,False,True

Or maybe I’ll even do the roasted veggies to make it less obvious that I’m cutting calories.   And your sauce sounds great - thank you so much!",False,True

If its kinda scary for you you could make a salad and fill most your plate with that and have a smaller portion of the pasta? Fry onion and garlic, add red peppers. Wait til that's all soft, add mushrooms and tinned tomatoes. Add some dried Italian seasoning salt and pepper. Add some spinach at the end if you like. All cooked in one pot and tastes pretty great. Chilli beans and rice/baked potato is good and easy too. Soup would be good and lower carb, soup is fairly simple to make most the time too. I dont usually cook proper meals and the ones I do are on the more complicated side cause I love cooking. If you don't need to do like proper cooking roasted veggies with garlic and rosemary with soy sausages is low carb and tastes good.",False,False
