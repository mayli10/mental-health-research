I’m a big guy, but get undersold in my weight by others all the time.  The only reason I can get accurate estimates of others weights is from a decade and a half of wrestling and being fucking obsessed with making weight/cutting weight/gaining weight and knowing what each weight class looked like wether they were ripped or fat.",False,False

They take their own weight, and add or subtract a like 10-20 pounds based on whether you are bigger or smaller than them- nothing to do with your actual size.",False,False

There isn't a single answer that won't fuck with your brain.  A lot of non-disordered dudes don't even attach height to weight estimates. They'll guess 150 for two different people of roughly the same BMI - even if one is 5'3"" and one is 5'9"".  He might've even just pulled the number out of thin air for something that vaguely sounded plausible.",False,False

Before I started being obsessed with my weight I never really thought about how much someone was supposed to weigh. Even now, I can’t estimate how much any of my friends weigh.  Like okay for example I have a roommate and she’s maybe **5.1 centimeters** taller than me, tops. I’m 112lbs, she’s 125lbs. She genuinely looks SO much smaller than me, even though there’s over a 10 pound difference. She just carries her weight so differently than I do.
