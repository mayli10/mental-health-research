I feel you with the struggle for long hair. It seems like once I hit a certain length, any extra growth comes with super dry ends. My UGW present to myself is gonna be some bombass extensions ",False,True

You can do it on dry hair too though! I've started doing it with my head hanging off the bed to help blood circulate that way to promote hair growth. (That's sort of a myth but I'm willing to try anything to help my hair grow longer.),False,False

I've heard that moroccan oil can damage hair too actually.. One thing that really helped my hair besides deep conditioning is that I stopped heat styling it for a few months, it really made a difference. I guess since we're here there's still a good chance it could be a diet based issue though. ",False,False

It wasn't cheap, it's a Korean brand and I reckon my white-ass hair can't handle it. I read that Asian hair is more resistant to drying out? It has pretty stellar reviews online.  I have tried hair masks and use moroccan oil pretty frequently, I also take 3000mg of fish oil most days, so I'll see how I go with biotin ðŸ˜Š ",False,True

Try doing a hair mask just on your ends. Restricting can cause hair issues so definitely grab some biotin. Healthy fats are really good for hair skin and nails so try adding some salmon, tuna, and avocado into your diet.",False,False

I would recommend the Redken Extreme Shampoo and Conditioner duo to try and help repair it!   Also taking multivitamins or biotin will help as well as giving yourself scalp massages frequently. :),False,False

Biotin might help but I heard it might also cause breakouts. Sorry this is happening ðŸ˜”ðŸ’–,False,False
