I did the same yesterday- ate 1300 instead of 800 and ‚Äúgained‚Äù a pound. It‚Äôll go down again soon.,False,False

When I first got sick, I just stopped eating. I lost a lot of weight and then my weight stalled and like you, I was on the verge of underweight but technically not. If I ate over 300, I would gain. I forced myself to eat 800 and I would either stay the same or gain.  Then I went into treatment and my calories were abruptly upped and after a few days, I was losing again on a much higher amount. I know people think starvation mode is not a thing  but your body is clever and it will adapt. It‚Äôs not permanent and it only takes a few day (max a couple of weeks) to recover in my experience.  I know you know this but 600 is incredibly low. It is pretty much impossible to gain real weight on 1200. Perhaps the same thing has happened to you?  I do understand the mental difficulties of eating over a certain amount- that‚Äôs what forced me to seek treatment so it‚Äôs easier said than done but you may find zigzagging your calories more helps your body not to adapt to the lower amount.",False,False

You might feel guilty about 1200 kcal now but it might be worth it to mix in a bit of these ""higher calorie"" days to at least slow down your weight loss so it doesnt take as much of a toll on your body.",False,False
