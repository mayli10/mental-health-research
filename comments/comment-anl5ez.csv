Because wouldnt that completely contradict CICO which says it doesnt matter when u eat only the energy you consume matters.  there's a bit of science involved that I can't explain that well (read lyle mcdonald if you want to know more) but the long and short is:  CICO is king. you can control CI completely but you can only influence CO, not control it. after a long period of restriction, your CO drops considerably and your body is ready to store calories as fat. however, after a refeed, your energy levels will likely increase, which will influence your CO ",False,False

Your body holds on to empty adipose(fat) cells after a lot of weight loss, so if you binge or whatever you can instantly put that weight back. It only holds on to empty cells for maybe a couple weeks. After that, unless you're literally starving and your body is catabolizing muscles, your body likes to maintain it's current disposition and burning (fuel) is a totally normal metabolic process. Your body has a hard time telling there's too much or too little fuel, 'starvation mode' is a pretty rare event.

There's a great scientific answer to this but I'm not capable of that lol. But eating large amounts of carbohydrates specifically have a huge impact on your appetite mostly because of hormonal changes. You wouldn't be as hungry if you had binged on foods that were very very low carb... like if your total carbohydrate intake was low enough to keep you in ketosis. During a fast you're in a state of ketosis and most people admit to a huge reduction in appetite during fasts and during low carb diets either way because your body after some time is able to create enzymes that enable you to use fat(ketones) as it's primary 'fuel' in comparison to glucose which your body creates from carbs.,False,False
