I don’t actually live in SF, I live like half an hour away? sooo maybe we’re really close wow!  They don’t tell me my weight but I saw it on the doctor’s computer lmao oops. Idk if it’s just my anorexic mind but even when I was 100lbs, I still wasn’t that skinny looking. like, people say I looked normal and so that’s why I’m freaking terrified of gaining.  Also, yesss, measuring is literally the most triggering thing ever. I want everything to be SMALLER you know? I’ve been really wanting to buy some cool clothes and now I have an excuse to lol.... so I guess that’s one of the few benefits of weight restoration!  Depression and anxiety suck ass :/ Did you do individual therapy for that along with FBT? or just the psychiatrist? I know that FBT says that the depression &amp; anxiety will go away once you’re weight restored but like I really feel so so so awful and sad all the time. I’m not motivated to do anything I used to enjoy doing, I literally just stay in my room all day and watch Netflix, which I’d normally never do. I’m also terrified of returning to school because idk how to act “normal” and “fine” again and I feel like I’m gonna have a breakdown. School has always tired me out so I’m scared to go back right now. Idk if all this is just part of the malnutrition... it’s so confusing.   I’m 14 and in eighth grade right now.

I’d say thank you again but it’s probably pointless now lol.  I go to school in San Francisco and people care way too much about each other soooo yeah.  okay so I never lost that much weight, I think. I’m 5’5, my starting weight was like 130lbs, and I got down to 102lbs or so (such an unsatisfying number, if only I could’ve reached 99!!!!!). I’ve already gained like 8lbs back so I think I’m like 110lbs now??    I’ve only been doing FBT for a bit over a week... I was hospitalized for a week before that and started once I got out. I’ve only met with a nutritionist once and she couldn’t tell me how much weight I’d need to gain cause she didn’t have my growth curve info stuff. She just told me I needed to get my period back. I’m meeting with her on Wednesday and now she does have my growth curve info so I’m really hoping she’ll tell me so I can stop worrying about it.  I really wanna buy more clothes now but idk what will fit me and shit so that’s annoying. Also if you have any store recommendations with cute clothes then that’d be much appreciated!!! You seem like you have good style haha idk but I feel that vibe.  Also this is really random but MY PARENTS GIVE SO MUCH MILK and ughhhhhh I’m so tired of MILK. It’s so calorie dense and I’m so used to drinking 1/2 cup of almond milk only everyday but they won’t stop giving it to me. and I know they’re firm on this milk because calcium and vitamin D or whatever. Well, they’re firm on literally everything high calorie. They literally go out and buy the highest calorie bread, rice, drinks, etc they can get me and it’s not like I can tell them it’s too many calories cause then they’ll just say to not count calories and that calories don’t matter. UGH sorry I just had to rant about that.  Anyway it’s nice to hear that you’ve been through this and that you’re independent now like holy shit IT’S POSSIBLE. I just gotta keep going, I guess :( oh and another question cause they’ll never stop: Did you also have to deal with depression or anxiety or anything? Like did the FBT affect you mentally? I’m hella depressed rn which sucks ass because I have no motivation to do anything and so that’s kinda why I’m not back at school yet (my vitals are fine now and all that)....  okay that’s my long ass post, I hope you enjoy it lol. thanks (even though I said thanking you is pointless)!",False,True

The meal and snack ideas sound soooo good! I’ve tried researching other ED recovery meal ideas but they’re always still too small and it’s so frustrating lol.  My teacher actually found out about my ED first and told me to tell two of my friends, so I did. I didn’t think I’d have to tell more people but then I got hospitalized and I’ve missed over a week of school and people are wondering where I’ve been. I think I’ll have to tell more of my friends, or even the whole school (only 75 kids and I’m acquainted with almost everyone lol)... idk I feel like it’d be awkward though so ugh yeah. That lunch plan is really smart and so I’ll do that when I go back!!! Hopefully, I won’t need morning snacks by then so I don’t have to deal with that.  also MORE questions ahhh I’m sorry:   1. How long have you been doing FBT? If you’ve done it for a while, did the nutritionist/your parents let you reduce your intake and get your independence back?  2. Did you meet with an FBT therapist and what did he/she do? I have my first appointment tomorrow and I have no idea what to expect, I’m kinda dreading it...  3. How much weight did you gain/are you gaining? If it’s triggering then please don’t answer. I’m just really anxious because I don’t want to go back to my original weight and I’m eating so much and it’s freaking me out. Also, everything I wear feels so tight and it’s killing me.  I owe you so much for everything like ugh thank you for being here and existing and giving me (a random stranger) advice!!!! I hope you’re doing well by the way :)",False,True
