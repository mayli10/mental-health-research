I love the appetite-surpressing effects of caffeine too, but try to avoid it after 4 so that I don’t have issues with sleeping. But then the shitty side effect of that is my appetite (and habit of boredom eating) is so strong at night! You could try taking melatonin to help you sleep if you take the pills too late again and can’t sleep.  Hope you are able to get some rest during the day!",False,False
