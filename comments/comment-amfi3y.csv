And when they do it for longer they absolutely are still neglecting their health. Your needs don't simply disappear because you have a reason for starving yourself.,False,False

I know this isn’t the right subreddit for this, but saying “going over 24 hours without food is unhealthy”  is patently false.   If you are already malnourished and underweight, then yes, that can be the case. But millions of people around the world fast for religious and health reasons, and they DONT have eating disorders, and it isn’t unhealthy for them to do so. ",False,False

There is a minimum amount your body needs every day to maintain proper function. Fasting for two days straight, especially for a week straight, is absolutely not healthy. Even if you justify it by saying your body has enough fat to burn to keep it running you still have to worry about your daily required nutrients. All of the vitamins and minerals and fats and proteins that your body needs to maintain proper function are not being replenished when you starve yourself. I can understand the appeal to intermittent fasting, but going a full day is absolutely not a good idea. You would be better off to find ways to get all of the nutrients you need in fewer calories than to just cut out food entirely.",False,False

We started dating when I was 115lbs (5’4”), has been with me at my worst (278lbs) and is with me still at 200 - obviously trying to lose more.   His ex is gorgeous... big blue eyes, tiny little feisty red head. They looked perfect together, but she was abusing him mentally and their entire relationship sucked for 5 long years. I will never compare to her physically. She will always be beautiful.  It was hard in the beginning. I learned to stop lurking on her shit later on. I trust my husband when he says he loves me more than any other girl. You need to trust that your dude is over her and is here for you. Don’t let her ruin this or you. She sounds like a brat that doesn’t deserve that kind of control in your life.",False,False

I hope your semester goes well and that you don't run into your boyfriend's ex again. I used to trigger myself with Facebook pictures of my own boyfriend's ex and that made my relationship with my boyfriend pretty rocky, ngl  ",False,False
