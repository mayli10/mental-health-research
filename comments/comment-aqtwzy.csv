Iâ€™d never given it a second thought until I read this post, but there is a method to how I do it, Iâ€™ll try my best to explain it!  If you raise your elbow up (like a chicken wing) youâ€™ll be able to feel like a sinew or tendon thing (not sure what it is!) that stretches from your shoulder blade to your breast (thereâ€™s another one at the back too, this is what causes the concave bit in between). Right so with the same arm, you should be able to press it down with your middle and ring finger. Idk you might find it hurts, Iâ€™ve been doing it daily for 20+ years so Iâ€™m not very sensitive, hopefully you can do it without discomfort. Anyway once youâ€™ve done that, lower your elbow just a little to relax it a bit and then you kind of pull the skin taut and will be able to shave with the opposite hand.   Also you need one of those contour razors where the blade pivots a bit. I use the Gillette Venus one.",False,False
