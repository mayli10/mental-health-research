I was underweight. I lost weight. She was jealous.  My mom, my aunt, my cousin's wife, my SIL. At least half of the conversation at any get together which is dinner or Thanksgiving or whatever is about calories, carbs, keto, dieting, how much you lost. My cousin's wife is at the high end of normal weight. My mom is overweight. My aunt and SIL are very obese.  So like I'm happy you're losing weight.  But here I'm at a normal weight after gaining 35 lbs from underweight from my second relapse with anorexia. And they want my input in these conversations every time.  I'm the go to expert. They know this. I say it's calories. They agree. I agree keto is good especially with hunger control and water weight and it's all calories not just clean eating, but it's portions. They agree.  BUT HELLO. I'm struggling. I lifelong want to be underweight and lose weight and I'm in recovery and gain weight. These discussions are hard for me.

I think it is great to teach healthy eating habits like the importance of eating nutrient rich foods, staying hydrated, and not having too much added sugars and such since it has no nutrition and is absolutely awful for your teeth, but like maybe don‚Äôt put your kids on a super specific diet and never make your kid fast for the purposes of diet.   If your child actually has a weight problem and the doctor is involved, definitely reduce calories and stuff if the doctor requests it but don‚Äôt tell it to them under the idea of them needing to lose weight either. It should be and entire change for the whole family to feel better and be healthier, I think. Even if the ultimate goal is weight loss, I don‚Äôt think you should just flat out tell the child that.

I think both scenarios have to be approached in different ways if there is an issue with a parent or child being at an unhealthy high weight.    If a child needs to lose weight, it‚Äôs best not to use the term diet but to frame everything with food in the context of eating healthy to be healthy.  If a parent needs to lose weight it‚Äôs fine to say that adults sometimes have to diet and work hard to get healthy in lots of ways, emphasizing that a ‚Äúdiet‚Äù is an adult thing that doesn‚Äôt reflect on the child at all.    I personally fast everyday and there‚Äôs no hiding that from my family when I don‚Äôt eat meals with them.  My choices have to be framed in the context of ‚ÄúI do this as a choice as an adult to be healthy, but you are eating healthy foods as a child to be healthy.‚Äù  Like you said, I don‚Äôt bring my child into the dieting equation and impose fasting upon her, but she *is* exposed to my choices with food.",False,False
