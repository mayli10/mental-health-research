I see my doctor like once a month or less and same with my nutritionist and they let me do pretty much whatever the fuck I want in the end. Might be because I'm an adult and can't be forced to treatment and I'm in a decent shape anyway so there's no need for that. I'm just kinda sad that I have to do this recovery thing pretty much alone if I want to because there's no one pushing me forwards except my nutritionist and doctor like once a month for 45min.. that motivation doesn't last too long..,False,True
