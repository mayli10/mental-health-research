This was while trying to encourage me to get back to the weight I was then since I weigh significantly less now  I mentioned this to him earlier bc he was trying to have me make a plan to recover &amp; I was trying to tell him that him saying that made me never want to gain weight bc if I wasn’t skinny at that weight, I definitely don’t want to gain weight. &amp; he doubled down on saying I wasn’t skinny, I was fit (Idr what word he used... fit or in shape or some shit) but I’m skinny now  Fucking idiots out there man  But some people see skinny as a bad thing.. like you need to go eat a sandwich so this person prob wasn’t trying to be hurtful",False,False
