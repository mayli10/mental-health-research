I can still remember my first ""real"" fast and it felt like my mind has never been the same. Some people say there is a ""hook"" that grabs you when you develop an ED, and for me, that was it. Perfect timing and everything. That was 10+ years ago.",False,False

I found that when I hit the 32 hour mark, I would start to struggle, I'd become extremely nauseous and barely able to stand. Was not fun when I had to go dog sit for someone in that state.  Your glycogen stores are depleted after 12-22 hours without carbohydrates, after which your body looks to fat for its energy. My guess would be your body hasn't figured out how to efficiently utilise triglycerides, and you're feeling the effects of low blood glucose. It's hard for the body to use fat, which is why it's the secondary source of energy. I would encourage you to take in some form of glucose to help keep levels within the blood constant.  Since I've made sure to take in glucose through drinks, I've found I'm able to function fairly normally. The only thing I really get is dizziness, and the more fasts I do, the worse it gets because I'm not allowing adequate time to build up my glycogen stores again. I also notice some slight weakness towards the end of my fasts where my muscles have used up their stores, and then they don't regain full strength because I don't completely replenish what's been used. And since the heart is a muscle, it's not immune to adverse effects and I have experienced chest pain, in varying degrees of intensity.   You might feel better if you pushed through, but I feel there's a higher chance you'd end up feeling worse. If you're feeling lethargic and weak, I would consider breaking your fast, or at least take in glucose. I think it's best to err on the side of caution when putting our bodies through stress.",False,False

I already restricted and attempted to fast, but once I stumbled upon IF, that was the kicker. I became obsessed with reaching at least 20 hours before eating, then I had moment where I figured I could do 72 hours once a month. Needless to say, that very quickly spiraled into 100+ hours, but then that wasn't enough and I started trying to beat my record, which resulted in a 300+ hour fast and feeling like death.  I've managed to convince myself to never go that long again, but I still have to do at least 90 hours once a week. My days are planned around my fasts now, they've become my priority.",False,False

Meanwhile my ED brain was like WHOA PLEASE DONT and everyone in the comments, more or less, were encouraging this behavior! I can’t fucking believe the kind shit people are promoting without ever thinking about the potential pitfalls. Like I’m scared because I still have fat on me and I’m like oh with this logic I don’t need food until all my fat is gone (moderately true with electrolytes) but like you said, when do I know I’ll stop?? Just because I get to a healthy ‘normal’ weight when will I stop? And I have this same worry for that guy.",False,True

I've done week long fasts before but not in a hot minute. &amp; then for no reason other than anxiety and boredom I broke mine at 69 hours a few hours ago (and purged heavily yikes). and my dumb ass is planning on fasting again until another 60 hours go by, quick low cal meal break to appease my father, then back in it for another 60...why am I like this",False,False

Eventually i reached the fantasy weight i had latched onto for ages and then some, and i vividly remember wondering to myself, ""i wonder when I'll stop?"" I scared myself with that thought and realized i needed to put my foot down. I've been maintaining ever since, but the disordered behaviors, calorie counting, and emotions haven't gone away.  I did experience health issues-- it's crazy how quickly you normalize side affects of disordered eating when they become the new norm. I've always been paranoid about my heart even pre-ED and i experienced palpitations and flutters while i fasted and just generally could always feel my heartbeat, but i was quick to shrug it off when it didn't go away, and that's crazy to me now. My bmi is in the underweight range, but i experience none of the symptoms i did while fasting, though i probably used to have more energy and just don't remember what it was like anymore.",False,False
