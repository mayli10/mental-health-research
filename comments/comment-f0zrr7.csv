This disorder messes with the mind so badly. And you feel like you can’t talk to anyone. So I have to rant here.   My final nail in the coffin was last night was when he told me I was “hostile” to speak to. And that I need to take a break from dating. I’m so paranoid about dating it’s not even funny. My brain just tells me I’m not good enough so why bother.,False,True
