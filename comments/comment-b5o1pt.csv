The fudge brownie one... It was pretty ok. Really got the ICE part of ice cream down, haha. I mean its not as great as regular ice cream but I'm deluding myself if I thought that I could just have more of the same thing but with less calories and it would be just as good.  Haven't had halo top yet (6.99 for a small thing like that? hell no) so I'm hoping to try it if it goes on sale, but it was really nice to treat myself to some ice cream for once!",False,False

However, Halo Top and other diet ice creams were instrumental to my descent into ED and now I tend to approach them with caution.  I started out with Keto (&lt;20g carbs / day) and fell into the wrong crowd with the 1200 kcal diet. It went great - lost 60 lbs over a few months, until I discovered those diet ice creams. AMAZING! Soon, my daily chore was to minimize carbs in my regular meals to fit in as much Halo Top as possible. not before long, this became an all-consuming task. Finally, I felt i was going insane counting carbs just to eat halo top. so ... I relaxed my carb counting. Alas, my life now became trying to fit in as much halo top in 1200 kcal a day. After a week or so of pretty much 100% halo top, the binges started and soon i was elbow-deep in regular ice cream and fried chicken. Gained back all weight lost, and entered the binge-purge-restrict rollercoaster.  fun times.",False,False
