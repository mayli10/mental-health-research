But people are always going to make themselves look better, more impressive, more attractive online than they really are. That’s literally, the ENTIRE point of Instagram (any wonder why it’s the app most tied to mental health issues?). The point is, you don’t know what their lives are really like. That “happy” relationship may be abusive, their job may be stellar from a financial POV, but may overwork and drain the life out of them. You’re not comparing yourself to them— you’re comparing yourself to a facade they’ve created for you to see and objectively basing your self-worth on your ability to measure up to that.",False,False

If you do end up b/p try not to beat yourself up too much,  it's absolutely not throwing away two years it's just a small bump in the road. You are doing amazing and i know that you can get better :)",False,False
