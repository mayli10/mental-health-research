I actually loved it so much because I fucking love the taste of all sugary food. And let me tell ya, I’m pretty much positive c/s is the habit that destroyed my teeth and costed me over $5k in dental work. It’s the one behavior I’ve been afraid to go back to because I just remember loving it soooooo much.   It definitely satisfied my addiction to sugary food while maintaining my addiction to losing weight, that’s for damn sure. I’m so fucked around food.",False,False

I feel a lot of shame around it and haven’t fessed up yet. So I’m proud of you for telling someone!!   I agree, you don’t hear about it often but it is dangerous and can harm your body, just like most ED behaviors.   It’s so easy to do and to keep under the radar too. Like, yep, totally still eating, you saw me take that bag of Chipotle in the other room the other day :) No problems here!",False,False

I definitely have disordered eating but i wouldn’t say i have an eating disorder. Logically i know something is wrong and how i eat is abnormal and not enough food, but i am also in denial. I also admit denial. It’s weird.",False,False

I usually log it, too, same as you   Thanks for your reply",False,True

They argued with me. I mean i do it too, but i know it’s not normal. I remember when Ryan sea crest once said in an interview that he doesn’t swallow bagels, he just chews them and spits them out and he talked about it like it was a normal thing that all people do. It’s absolutely not normal. I can see how it could become addictive. I have done it in the past, but it is not my favorite thing to do and I’m so scared I’ll get calories from it so i still log c/s as if i ate so i just don’t do it anymore.",False,False
