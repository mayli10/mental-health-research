From what it sounds like with the binge eating and starving, you do have an eating disorder. I know it must be hard to not compare yourself to what you used to weigh but do keep in mind that whether someone is overweight or underweight, neither is healthy. I'm sure you know this but what im thing to say is that right now you may not like your body but you aren't at either ends of an extreme. Which is good. Everyone should aim to be healthy, even if you are almost overweight. Numbers aren't everything either.   I think dieting or restricting is something you need to not do for now. Or ever actually. I think instead you should find outlets for your eating disorder. Such as when you feel a binge, or feel negative about your body i think you should journal, listen to music, watch YouTube, or just sit outside. Anything to distract yourself from triggering thoughts.     You said you're not able to grocery shop and you're eating at restaurants which I know is nerve wrecking.  I would suggest get healthy or the closest to healthy meals at a restaurant. Try to pick something that you're comfortable with, maybe something that you know won't trigger you into a binge and is still filling/nutrient dense. Regardless of what you eat, just aim for better choices that will make you feel better. Eat until you are full but no so stuffed you feel sick. One trick is to drink a glass of water before a meal and in between bites. This will help you differ between eating out of boredom vs hunger.   Lastly I would say is this will always be a journey. Everyday will have its ups and downs and thats normal. It is okay to have thoughts and urges but remember that actions have consequences. You have control to make the good ones. I dont know you but you are strong and brave for seeking advice. That is something a lot of times I was scared to do myself. I support you and i wish the best for you. I hope this wasnt too long but if you need me im here. Feel free to message me. :)   PS! Remember- Its just a number, put it this way: no matter what the scale says, youll never be happy with it until you mentally are happy with your body. My mom always told me that when im 80 years old, im not going to give a shit about how much i ate, or how i looked. I can only do what will make me happy now, mentally, physically, and most importantly healthily. You never know if you have tomorrow, don't waste today on your past. Focus on what good/positive changes you can be doing now.",False,False
