Dieting doesn't necessarily lead to ED. Maybe that's the difference: I was a low-healthy weight when I started and really didn't need to lose weight. Perhaps if someone does have excess weight to lose, their body can deal with restriction better.   Really though, I think most women (like myself, previously) want to believe they have to limit themselves to 1200 per day because they don't want to accept the fact that they actually *are* (or were) averaging a much higher number to maintain their previous/starting weight.   It was kind of a revelation for me to realize that I need way more calories than I ever thought (and I'm the one with the restrictive ED?!), so I just kind of wish other women would realize this as well.  &amp;#x200B;",False,False

Recovery, while it involves extreme hunger and adding fat your body, is not even close to the same thing as a formerly obese person binging their way back to obesity. That was one thing I had to accept coming from my lowest weight. Initially I gained like 15 pounds in a month thanks to the extreme hunger, and believe me, I hated every single time I chose to listen and eat in response to it, because some days it just didn't stop. It felt like I was ""stuffing my face"", same as you. If the food tasted good, it made me feel even more guilty. I had to consciously remind myself that I was doing the right thing and making a conscious decision to get better. Regardless of how you instinctively want to frame your recovery looking back on it, you shouldn't feel guilty, because you are likely objectively healthier now than you were before.  &amp;#x200B;  Body fat overshoot is part of the process. Mine was pretty noticeable/significant at one point. I had to be comfortable with the idea that it might not come off on its own, although it eventually did, like everyone else (curiously, even while continuing to increase my calorie intake). Took about 6 months for me, and for other people I've read about online, typically takes about a year. Long as you keep eating intuitively, your body will eventually reach homeostasis and you will start to look normal as your extremities fill back in and your abdominal fat goes down. Regardless of how I felt during recovery gaining weight, which was pretty much horrible, I'm still here, and I'm still alive. Gaining a little bit of fat did not change my value as a human being, nor did it stop me from being able to smash some cycling-related goals I had for myself this past summer. I am quantifiably the strongest and healthiest I have ever been. I did what I needed to do to get better, and that's what you did too. Our society demonizes body fat a lot, but a certain level really is healthy. When you are carrying a normal amount of body fat, you are hormonally so much healthier and more stable than when you are in a starvation state. My energy levels, my attraction to women, my hunger and satiety, everything is incredibly smooth, consistent, and mostly predictable from day to day now.  &amp;#x200B;  Some days accepting myself for who I am is hard. I look in the mirror, I still see a fat dude. I want to react to it. I want to restrict, cut, whatever. But ultimately not allowing that negative voice to dominate me is what's allowed me to get to where I am. Some days I really have to mentally just put my nose to the grindstone and remind myself - every time I choose to do the right thing and fuel my body, I'm not falling away from who I used to be (me during my ED) - **I'm becoming who I am meant to be**. Stronger on the outside - carrying more fat is evidence of the strength I have in being able to overcome what my ED tells me to do. The inside? Still the same person. 350 pounds, 174 pounds, current weight (???), doesn't matter. My value as a human being isn't limited to a number on the scale. Stephen Hawking, Nick Vujicic, Aaron Fotheringham, countless others throughout history, none of them allowed themselves to be limited by their disabilities or their physical appearance. Hope this helps.",False,False

I have a history of being obese at one point in my life, and I worked hard to change. I also know the statistics surrounding how few people successfully keep the weight off, and the fear of weight regain is thus very real for me. All kinds of people on /r/keto and /r/loseit lose weight. America doesn't have a weight loss problem. What I see over and over are people losing 25+% of their body weight, and then binging and gaining it all back. The idea that some force out of my control is going to suddenly overtake me some day and I'm going to binge my way back to 300+ pounds is horrific.  &amp;#x200B;  But yeah, I hear you. I got trapped in the same exact mentality, part of what sent me into my ED. The lower my weight got, the more attention I seemed to get. Eventually I was just delusional and got entrapped by the ""lower is better"" mentality and began to associate my worth and attractiveness with a number on the scale like everyone else.  &amp;#x200B;  FWIW, strictly in terms of physical attraction, although I have found myself attracted to women of all shapes and sizes, I seem to be most attracted to (on average) women at the higher end of the ""normal"" body fat spectrum, and know plenty of other straight males that feel the same way, and my weight loss never changed my preferences far as I can tell. A lot of what makes women look like women comes from how they distribute body fat. It's why female bodybuilders are often seen as unattractive to the average male. Socially, we do have an obsession with leanness without a doubt, and it's a problem, but we have double-standards that only apply to our own respective genders.",False,False
