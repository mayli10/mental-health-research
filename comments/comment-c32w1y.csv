You can't relate to what you dont see.  And stop IF. If you think fasting is leading you down a dark path then turn off that path before it is to late.   Also it might be a good idea to seek out a therapist.,False,False

Like I said, I relate to these posts and find memes around it relatable. I am just genuinely concerned that I may develop one down the line. I’m not trying to give myself the title for attention. Please don’t make assumptions like that because it does nothing but muddy the waters of what I actually meant.",False,True

You want to be validated that that isn’t normal (Which btw 1400 cal is very normal” and that you will spiral. There is no need to let yourself get there and obsessing over the fact that you ~could~ get an eating disorder (And again they aren’t going to just pop up because you’re fasting). Focus on getting healthy and staying active and listening to your body.,False,False

What you need to ask yourself is  Are you obsessed with losing weight? How do you react when you go over your calories? Do you binge and if so, why? Is it because you are starving? And what do you call a binge.  I would recommend googling a quiz to see.   Its the behaviour and mindset that makes an ED, not the calorie counting etc.  If you are eating the amount of calories the apps tell you to then that is good.",False,False
