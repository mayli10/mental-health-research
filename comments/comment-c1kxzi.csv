What happened next is she started to INSIST we were the same size, even though I was taller and much thinner than her, and buy me horribly ill fitting clothes. And then get mad when I wouldn't/couldn't wear them.  She doesn't really trigger me anymore, but unfortunately I still have a huge parental trigger in my dad...he had a borderline ED for a while, and still has certain obsessions.   So I get it, and I'm really sorry you're dealing with a parent who triggers you. It's not like they're some random acquaintance you can casually avoid :/",False,False

I brought my boyfriend because I bought one of those multi picture packs and we were doing one together. I was doing one on my own and as he was watching, my mom bellowed across the room ""Odd_Toes, suck in your gut!""
