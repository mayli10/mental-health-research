Distress Tolerance** These are primarily my distraction or grounding activities for use when distress is spiking and I’m having urges to do something destructive. That usually means I’m in a place where I have trouble thinking logically, so I keep a list of possible activities on my fridge to refer to when in crisis. (The free CalmHarm app has tons of ideas too.) Some of my go-tos... - Going for a walk and listening to upbeat or cathartic music - Breathing exercises (sometimes using the guided meditations on the Insight Timer app) - Holding a frozen orange or ice cubes and focusing on the physical sensation - Immersive creative activities (journaling, crafting, painting, playing an instrument)   **2. Pleasant Activity Scheduling** This is my slow-burn version of distress tolerance. It’s partly about regularly practicing some distress tolerance skills while not actively in distress (so that you’re battle-ready when the time comes) and partly about building calming/enjoyable activities into my life so I can store up moments of sunlight against the days when depression brings the darkness. Of course, the optimal activities for you will be a personal thing, but the general theme for me is that it’s about anchoring myself to life and to other people. Things like... - Connecting with a friend (phone call, meet for coffee, send a handwritten letter) - Time in nature (I’ve been told that sitting in nature for just 15 minutes can have a positive impact on mental health) - Learning something new (for me that’s currently cello and Python)   **3. Talking Gently and Non-Judgmentally to Myself** Soooo, this is majorly a vague work-in-progress for me, I have some deep-seated issues with feeling I’m a bad/wrong person who is by definition ‘not good enough’ and I tend to operate on a philosophy of having to hate myself first and hate myself the most. I have a really hard time with the statement, “It’s ok to like yourself”. The result is a mental habit of judging myself and talking very harshly to myself. However, I’m slowwwly recognizing that mentally screaming at myself all the time isn’t getting me the results I want. I’m essentially invalidating and beating myself down every single day. So, for now I mostly try to talk to myself by affirming that I’m feeling what I’m feeling and that it’s ok to feel that. (The concept of non-judgement I learned in DBT and I love that it includes the meta-cognition of when you catch yourself being self-critical you try not to judge your judging.)",False,False
