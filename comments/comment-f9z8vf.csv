This is covert sexual abuse. Your mother should never, ever be commenting on your body at all, and especially not in this way. You have each and every full right over your body, how you feel about it and how it looks. You are young and your body is not something to be seen in a sexual way.  She will continue to turn a blind eye to your eating habits because she cares about how she sees you, not who you are. You are worthy of your own boundaries and the limits of your comfort. You are worthy of care and love. I have dealt with this too. Please please look for someone that could help. Your mother will never stop treating you this way.",False,False

I don’t know what country you’re from so it could just be a cultural difference, but if it makes you uncomfortable and she won’t stop, it’s not okay ! Idk what you can really do except maybe get your dad to talk to her? Regardless, you’re absolutely entitled to feel the way you do, don’t doubt that for a second.   When I was younger, my mum would comment on my body as well, and when I asked her to stop she did. If yours won’t, that’s about her, not you&lt;3",False,False
