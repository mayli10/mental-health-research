I already strongly advise people not to get it in general but here I have to really double down.  I was on it for 4 years with a one year break in between.  The shot causes loss in bone density and puts anyone who uses it for any extended length of time at higher risk for osteoporosis and bone fractures.  The shot also made me gain 40 pounds...and not due to the increased appetite, because I was at my most restrictive with my diet while I was on that shot. So along with the shot fucking with my bone density, my shitty treatment helped that along as well.  It also had adverse effects on my mental well-being and is just generally a terrible form of birth-control, so if you're here because you have an eating disorder, please stay away from depo.",False,False
