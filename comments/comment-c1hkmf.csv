I was seeing a therapist and told him how I felt I had a specific disorder (bpd to be specific) and he kinda just dismissed it in a “don’t believe everything you read on the internet” manner. It wasn’t like I had read a tumblr post and immediately adopted it. I had researched it for a year and truly identified with the symptoms for years. Mostly I think he didn’t want me to get caught up in labels bc he couldn’t diagnose (he was just interning) and didn’t want me worrying about it so I can just focus on treatment. I’ve never been to a psychiatrist, so I apologize in that I don’t have any advice on that. Maybe it’s that they want to focus on treatment for depression and the issues with ed will be worked out in the meantime?",False,False

Her being dismissive is a reflection on her own lack of training and understanding, not on how valid you are.  You’re not too fat to have an ED, and your ED is real. I empathize greatly with how you’re feeling; almost every doctor I’ve ever gone to has been dismissive regarding my problems.",False,False
