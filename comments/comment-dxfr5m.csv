People thought I was anorexic, because I just had a small appetite.   I don't think it's right for us to assume either way - that somebody does, or does not have an ED. :/",False,False

They probably NEVER think about food. Its always on my fucking mind. Do I eat? Do I restrict? Can I even attempt to keep the binge at bay?! I just want to be fucking normal oml.

Binging is a natural response to restriction in the sense that your brain wants to hoard/stock up on food for the next famine. If she responds to hunger by knowing she'll be eating soon, it makes it easier to tolerate, nutrient and mineral deficiencies aside (as in, being malnourished and hungry feels significantly different from ""normal-person hungry"")",False,False

I’ve known her since we were five and she just doesn’t eat. She will order a huge sandwich, eat three bites, and wrap it up for later. She can’t drink beer because she’s full after a can and a half of Miller Lite. Crazy hourglass figure, just paper thin.  Her whole family is skinny, and I’ve taken week-long trips with them so I know their habits pretty well. No EDs, no unhealthy food talk or self-image talk.
