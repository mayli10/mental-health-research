I remember the first time I bruised my cheek bone just from resting on a flat surface and wondering what the fuck and not actually realizing it was from being uw for a good solid minute. Another first, I was sitting on a couch and I thought I set my phone on my lap but...it...fell through. I remember I giggled like a crazy person. I kept doing it over and over because I couldn't believe it. And... the very first extended fast I did, I remember the shock of not being able to hold my arms up to wash my hair...genuine shock. But I never felt concern...Just a morbid curiosity. It's so funny, how we get used to things over time. This really is a very interesting disorder. I feel I have these moments of clarity, where I can observe myself, my actions, and be rational, logical. I see that I am making unhealthy choices and that if I'm not careful things could get serious. And then I blink and I just become this disorder. I don't starve, I AM starving. Not just my body, but my entire essence, my core feels like that is right. I become it, and that's just...it. That's it.",False,False
