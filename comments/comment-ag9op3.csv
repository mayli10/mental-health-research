The two I would add is I plan my food the night before so I can grab and go instead of wasting time thinking or not bringing anything at all and binging when I get home.

I have the Kroger app and it applies cupons to your order and tells you a rough total and organizes your list based on the alies. So much less stressful.    * Check out your University mental health center. They can refer you to resourse that you can afford, or try Better help.com.    * Weed. Nothing cures anxiety for me than a good joint at the end of the night. HOWEVER you should not let this substitute real therapy and medication.    * Don't drink alcohol. At least for me, it depressed the fuck out of me. ",False,False

It's got everything I need to do, broken down by day--including every class I need to attend, every work meeting, every piece of homework, plus life stuff (laundry, grocery shopping, apply for a summer job, etc.) It really helps take some of the stress off of keeping organized, plus it's harder for me to procrastinate if I can see a list of things I need to get done.   Foodwise, I make a plan. My nearest grocery store to campus is ~2.5 miles away and I have no car, so I try to only go shopping like every 2-3 weeks. I'll figure out what I want to eat (usually 300-400 cals/day) and what's on sale (I shop at Kroger, occasionally Walmart), then I plan how much I'll need and how much it'll cost. I'll go shopping on a day I don't have night classes.   I very rarely work out, truth be told. Between work and class and heavy restriction, I just don't have the time or energy.   Sorry for the super long response, and good luck to you! ",False,False
