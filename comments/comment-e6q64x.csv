Remember that ur just as deserving of help, you didnâ€™t fail at anything and you donâ€™t have to prove to anyone that youâ€™re  still hurting. If your other friends didnâ€™t act as concerned when you were openly struggling thatâ€™s on THEM, not you. As for ur other friend who might have an ED, providing general friendship/support usually helps so you could help w/o explicitly making it about their eating disorder?",False,False
