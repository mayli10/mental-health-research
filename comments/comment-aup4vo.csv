I love baking and cooking so much but god it is a nightmare with ED. But it's also forced me to get creative wrt making low cal things, especially sweets! I know I can now make a super delicious sugar free and dairy free (lactose intolerant, sob) ice cream, but the problem is that it has to be eaten immediately or else it gets super icy since it lacks both the sugar AND fat that minimize ice crystals in ice cream. ðŸ˜­ I got close when I made sugar free ice cream with 2% lactose free milk, but it still had to sit for like 5 minutes to get a nice scoop out of it, sob.",False,False
