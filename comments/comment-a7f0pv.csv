I had a lot of digestive discomfort for honestly about a year before it settled down, surprisingly i did not gain much at all..only 3 kilos but the bloating, don‚Äôt ask i looked 6 months pregnant pretty much 24/7 for a year, all the recovery stuff i saw online didn‚Äôt really click with me at all   Please try to just have half or quarter sized meals, i still don‚Äôt eat ‚Äúfull sized‚Äù portions and May never but you know what sometimes portions are freakin huge and F what anyone else thinks (no giving a shite about what anyone else thinks is super helpful too)   I wish you all the best I know it‚Äôs a hard thing to leave something that in the moment feels so good ",False,False

I force fed myself to eat more today just to sort of try and say ‚Äúfuck you ed!!‚Äù But ended up taking laxatives after anyway. We both did a good job and it‚Äôs ok to revert back to things sometimes as long as we make an effort, and we did! We ate more! Go us! Go you!",False,False

I definitely reached a critical point where I just knew it had to come back out.... it's so addicting. Same thing with laxatives the pain is worth the empty.

One of the big keys to me ending the cycle was being super strict on myself and eating half a meal at a time even if i was more hungry it ment that i wouldn‚Äôt hit that ‚Äúgotta purge‚Äù point. Id still feel itchy and weird with food in me but it wasn‚Äôt as hard to resist the urge when i only had say half a sandwich rather than a whole one.   There where certain foods that‚Äôs i would 100% feel the need to purge no matter how little i had ..i adore pho but it was always something id purge cause it was just so huge and lets be honest that warm broth is easy and satisfying as f to purge. So i didn‚Äôt have pho for about 3 years now *wah* ice cream is another no no   I really honestly feel like purging was worse for me and my body than restricting..I‚Äôm so happy i stopped it and i hope you can work through it too, its so damn hard to get a balence xx ",False,False

Remember if its distressing you or too much next time hen you can totally eat half and put half away  and have it later on in an hour or two   I found sometimes that full feeling was super uncomfortable at first and if i stopped eating before i was full full..then i tolerated it better if i broke the meal of food into half sized portions but YMMV ,False,False
