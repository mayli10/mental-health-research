They would probably ask if you want to be weighed completely naked or in a gown. I imagine it would depend on where the scale is - I've been in offices with scales in the rooms, and offices where the scale is in the hallway.",False,False

I only weigh myself naked and I will have a full mental breakdown if I weigh a kilo heavier because of my clothing. So stupid, I know it's not real ""weight"" but I can't handle it.",False,True

At age 21 you will have an easier time saying no to being weighed if you really don't want to be weighed. You are, after all, an adult.",False,False

I'm actually 21 but I refused to get help myself that's why my dad made the appointment for me. That's also the whole struggle, like I don't want help because I don't want to gain weight but I also don't want to feel this way anymore.",False,True

You could refuse... not sure where that would get you. Probably would send some red flags ""patient is very sensitive about weight."" Sounds like you're under 18? What do YOU want out of the appointment? Do you want help, or do you want to convince people you are okay and there are no problems? Anyway my first appt of that sort I was diagnosed. That was 15ish years ago. It's also likely that they will take some blood, and compare your current weight to your past weight - it's not necessarily about your current weight, but about how much you lost.",False,False
