I ended up having to meal prep a base that could be used as my food, but one that he could add “all the extras” that he wanted. That worked out mostly well, he got more veggies than he ever would have without me being around, and he still got to eat stuff that he wanted. And with the meal prepping, I could make portions for me and bigger portions for him. And sometimes I just cooked two separate foods, ED-modified for me and full calories for him.",False,False
