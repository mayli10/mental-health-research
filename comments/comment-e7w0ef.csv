There was physical abuse but not nearly as much as there was emotional abuse. Always felt like I had to walk on eggshells around her. My stepdad was awesome, but not around a lot due to being a truck driver, so I was stuck at home with my mom, who was a homemaker, all the time. I don't have a relationship with my biological dad. We're friends on Facebook, but we've never met. It's complicated. My parents divorced 6 or so years ago and I don't talk to my mom anymore. My stepdad and I still talk though and see each other occasionally. I do feel like I should talk to my mom just because she's my mom, but I also can't stand being around her, I hate her, I hate how she treated me, my sister, and my stepdad. I can't forgive her for making our lives hell.",False,False

She just wants to let whatever emotion out and it usually comes out as anger at someone. She's not very aware of people and will treat her kids differently. She doesn't like me much and was very very angry when she found out ahout my ED and first girlfriend. And now thinks I'm all recovered and didn't actually have an ED in the first place. We are not close at all. We kinda just communicate when we have to. My dad is hella chill to the point he doesn't really care about anything I do or at least to my face he doesn't. we never talk about our lives or anything to each other. As long as we stay out of each others way we're fine but my mum will occasionally flare up.,False,False

He‚Äôs also short tempered and thinks he‚Äôs the best and everything must be his way. I grew up fearing him. To this day our relationship is just filled with anxiety, resentment, and maybe still a little fear.   My mom and I are ok now. She used to say demeaning, insulting, and mean things to me about my body and eating when I was younger. I‚Äôll never be able to get the shit she said out of my head. Maybe my mom was the one to kickstart my eating disorder, who knows? Although, I do believe that she has some disordered eating thoughts/habits. So the times that she has tried to say ‚Äúhelpful‚Äù things to me about eating and recovery, it always ends up fueling the disorder instead.",False,False

It‚Äôs been a complicated relationship with both of them ever since they divorced. There was a lot of emotional neglect and parentification by my mom and my dad just had no desire to be a parent whatsoever and it showed, so things have never been good with either of them. It almost felt like living with a roommate rather than a parent at either of their houses. I know they both love me, but having me when their marriage was already failing was probably not the best idea lol ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",False,False

My mom has a bad sense of healthy foods that make you skinny.  She literally says to me ""eat cabbage, eat sweet potato, it will make you skinny"" and then once said ""yogurt is good right... it wont make you fat?"" My older sister said no, and the other said ""yogurt still has calories"".  I feel like she enables most of the things I do.  I barely eat oil, so for much of dinner she roasts vegetables or adds less oil to foods so I can eat it.  My dad however once came over to me at breakfast and told me to eat from all food groups since I cut out oil.  He said ""God made all of this so we can eat it, don't be like these.... like these vegans or vegetarians"" (we're Muslim, halal meat, so our way of slaughtering animals is a lot better for the animals than your average pig slaughter house).  He always has something to say about what I eat.  That I should eat for sustenance, and not just because I like a certain food.  They dont know about my disordered eating.  But we're brown and our culture doesnt take mental health seriously?  Idk.  My parents have progressed mentally and culturally a lot more than my other relatives who think backwards.  But we're close, and they're supportive of me in other aspects of life and always give me reality checks.",False,False

I'm an only child, so I am basically the light of their life (as bigheaded as that sounds lol). And now the fucked up part. 80% of my ED comes from my mom, who used to tell me pretty much from Kindergarten onwards that I was fat, I shouldn't eat so much etc... I didn't care for 21 years what she was saying, cause I've always been a high healthy weight,although I always had a weird relationship with food but last year was the final straw.
