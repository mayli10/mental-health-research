I know this probably really sucks but for me not drinking has been a game changer. I'm finally losing again, I'm sleeping well, I'm not acting like a psycho (bc i go cray when drunk), and I am no longer getting rebound anxiety. I'm really sorry you are having a terrible hangover, but you could join me in Dry February!!",False,False

I budgeted (ish) for drinking so I didnâ€™t really eat much. That led me to drink waay more than I intended to. I had to go to work today and I was soooo incredibly hungover and needed to eat otherwise I was going to throw up. I got a bagel to help my body and now that I feel better I hate myself. ,False,False
