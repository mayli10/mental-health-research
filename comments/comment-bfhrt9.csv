I promise it's not worth it. I only purged for about 6 months during my initial ana recovery and I'm still suffering the consequences. I wish I could go back in time and undo the purging -it was so easy to start, so difficult to stop, and impossible to outrun the consequences.",False,False

As it is your first time, itâ€™s not an ingrained behavior yet, please try to not purge again. It becomes addictive, fast, until you have little control over your urge to get rid of whatever your ED believes is too much.  As for your boyfriend situation, itâ€™s up to you, since you know him and could gage whether or not his reaction would be supportive better than a stranger on reddit ðŸ™‚ In general though, EDs thrive in secrecy and having someone know and be concerned may keep you accountable.",False,False
