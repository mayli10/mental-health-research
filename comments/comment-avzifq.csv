I've been having a particularly rough time myself lately.  My mom would always say ""it'll all come out in the wash""  it was something my grandmother use to say too, so now I try to say it to myself.   The nice thing is we can work to rewire our brains. There are different self help Cognitive behavioral therapy worksheets you can google. Sometimes they feel silly but they do help. It's hard though, because its like weight lifting, you have to keep doing it or you can lose results.",False,False

But you deserve a life and to be happy and I hope you can find a way to see how wonderful being alive truly is, even with all the shit its always throwing at us. I've delt with suicidal ideation (more wishing to not wake up or call of the void type stuff personally) and it sucks. I tend to hyper focus on the bad and tune all the good. The bad just seems so much more prominent in my mind. I do a lot of all or nothing/black &amp; white thinking when it gets really bad. Practicing mindfulness can actually be very helpful in times like this. ",False,False
