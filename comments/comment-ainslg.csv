When I've gone a few days without pain I try to go to the gym but sometimes that sets it off, so I rarely can bring my calories down from exercise. ",False,False

Some days I can get to the gym and do a bit of walking and light lifting. Other days I'm bed bound and can't even walk. It's frustrating to see people whose TDEE is over 2000 because of exercise when mine is barely over 1000. So I'm stuck eating about 750 calories in order to lose weight. It's annoying ,False,False
