No one could stop me. I still have an ED, and it's been 16+ years. I was 14 when she figured it out, and at least forced me to go to counselling. I haven't been cured, but at least I'm not dead. Without the counselling and support groups, I would be dead, instead of alive but still not cured. I'm glad I am not dead.     Your mom sounds really reasonable, and really kind. She's not pushing you. She's waiting until you are ready. When I read your post, my eyes filled with tears, because I can tell how much your mom loves you. She knows and she's even trying not to push you away. All she wants to do is be there for you. She wants to make sure you don't die so you have a shot at life. I remember being embarrassed too, trying to deny it from her. It's really hard. But please, don't die. Your mom probably won't be mad at you. She's part of this same world that pressures women into being thin. At least somebody is there, loving on you so much, that she knows what's going on without you even saying it. You are her baby.      My mom has known about my suffering and struggle for years. Though it makes her sad, not once has she made me feel embarrassed, or disgusting. In fact, I feel like she's impressed I am as tough as I am and that I've kept trying my hardest to break through this thing. I feel like she's proud of me for trying despite my sickness, not disappointed in me for being sick. I am still ashamed, and still embarrassed that I have this. But I have 1 ally at least. In the dead of night if I'm so fucked up from this disorder that I feel like I'm not going to make it, I can call her BECAUSE she knows, and she can come help me or take me to the hospital, or something. She can help make sure I don't die. Cuz I'm her baby, and after all, that's the point of being a mom. Make sure your baby doesn't die. &lt;3 You aren't alone. Someone loves you very very very very very very much.",False,False
