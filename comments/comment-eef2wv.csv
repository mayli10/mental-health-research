You said yourself when will this stop and where is the reset button so clearly s osrt of you knows the right things to do which will facilitate recovery.   Picture yourself as a car; it needs fuel to run properly. If you don't put any fuel in, the car will eventually run out of gas. If you put in low grade fuel, it will damage the engine, despite the tank being full. Lastly, if you push the engine to hard with little fuel, poor quality fuel etc, it can only perform so long before it is permanently damaged or blows up from running at redline with inadequate fuel and oil. You wouldn't want to ruin a car by neglecting to take care of it. Take care of the car, and it will have a long and fulfilling life with many happy miles. I know it's a corney metaphor but it sums up ED sort of. Hope it helps a bit",False,False
