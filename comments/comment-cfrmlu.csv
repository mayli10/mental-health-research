Back when I had a BMI of 25 I still fit it to size 4 in some clothes and like a 10 in others it is just anarchy over here because of vanity sizing.,False,False

I really don’t think you could possibly fit into that size at that height if you were overweight at all. You’re likely in the lower/mid range of healthy, and not fat at all. Where I live, that size is equivalent to a size Small or sometimes even XS.",False,False

Yea, I had no meal plan as a dietitian was not covered by my insurance at the time and they were weighing me weekly but never brought it to my attention that I gained so much, I think I may have gained like 40 lbs.

But that’s the thing, it gets 1000% harder before it gets better. I quit the first time around when it got hard, and now I’m trying again. I hope I can stick with it this time. Also, any medical professional who gets a 5’5” person up go 200+ lbs is doing it wrong. (Just now saw your NB flair, please know I use “homegirl” as a form of endearment).",False,False

Believe me when I say I know exactly how you feel. I’m also 5’5”, except I’m a size 8-10 (I would kill a good man in cold blood to be a size four) and when I look in the mirror, I think I look like a whale. In reality? I could stand to lose about 20 lbs to get back to a healthy BMI, but I’m by no means obese.
