UNFORTUNATELY, I have an awful relationship with food and heavily restrict all week, so when we get the munchies and I’m presented with Taco Bell, Doritos, and Oreos, I cannot stop myself and I binge the whole weekend. It happened this weekend and now I’m bloated and sore. I’ve started a 48-hour minimum fast to hopefully undo the damage I’ve caused.",False,False
