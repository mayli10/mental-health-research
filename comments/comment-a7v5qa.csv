I'm not sure if someone can get fired for saying things, no matter how bad, that a student didn't like (unless she told me to kms, but even then, who'd believe me if I was the only witness).  My mom said it'd be easier to just let it go and ignore her (kinda hard when I keep running into her in the bathroom, and she makes more conversation past my initial polite ""hi""), and talk to the other counselors.  She also said it's possible the counselor was just put into that job without being qualified.  With how my school works, the middle school counselor used to be a math teacher.  While she was good (anyone is better than the bad one I posted about twice), we don't know if she was actually qualified or got the training.  The counselor in my dad's day became the principal.  So, who knows?  At this point, it'd probably be petty to bring up something that happened a month ago (it will be a month by the time school resumes January 7th).  You live and you learn ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø .  Like you said, I shouldn't have to fight a counselor to be treated right.  It is what it is, some people can just be like that, unfortunately.  The funny thing is, she's not even my counselor.  I just saw her because my counselor wasn't available that morning.  :')  Thanks again, love your advice ‚ù§Ô∏è\^\_\^ ‚ù§Ô∏è  Wishing you a happy holidays!",False,True

I think you got what you're going to get out of this, yknow? Maybe you could go to a different counselor next year? You shouldn't have to fight a counselor to get them to treat you right.

Times like this, I remind myself that I can't control people's actions, I can only control how I react to them.   Imo you were really mature, you handled this really well. You stuck up for yourself, spoke out about something you thought was being handled poorly.   Unfortunately we don't always get the response from people we think we should get. People have different values, and your parents are probably right - the counselor probably doesn't think she did anything wrong. People don't always agree on what's right and wrong.   But yknow at the end of the day, this was an experience. It'll better prepare you to put your foot down throughout your life. ",False,False
