I showed him a picture of me at my lowest weight (I was underweight and looked sick, and my period had stopped) and he said “If you work hard you can get back to that” ????????!  Dude I was dying  He makes me report my weight and measurements every week because he “wants to help me lose weight”. And also some foods are not allowed apparently? Not even in moderation  Yeah I have daddy issues too",False,False

I'm not saying getting to the point of obesity is alright, but gaining/fluctuating in weight is normal. You shouldn't have to feel scared that he'll be less attracted to you and shame you in case you for example get pregnant and gain a little bit! It's just normal.",False,False

I was with someone like this (constantly commenting on women's weights and saying how he found them repulsive, telling me his ex got fat and that's why he left her even though I saw pictures of her and she was nowhere near fat.) It made me hate myself, and it certainly made skipping meals easier because I was overly sensitive to every single bite I took in front of him. He ended up turning from emotional abusive to physically abusive. I hope you get out, and I hope you get better. It is possible, I promise.",False,False
