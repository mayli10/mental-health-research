I know a couple pretty thin people but they always have energy their hair and skin is great and they don't dodge food or going out to eat. I'm pretty sure they are healthy. I know a few other pretty thin people who are always tired and or grouchy and or depressed and they always dodge anything that deals with food. Pretty easy to spot.,False,False
