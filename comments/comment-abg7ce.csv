It always pissed me off when psychologists simplified my ED as arising from a desire to control something, because that was never the motive behind it. It manifested more as a combination two different drives that I possess (or perhaps, that possess me), one towards perfection/magnificence, and the other towards self-destruction. And another stems from the idea, common in American society, that people get what they deserve. It was ingrained in me since my troubled childhood, and I felt I fucked up somehow, I did something to deserve all of this so I ought to be destroyed. And no one can do that but me.   The closest drive related to the ""control"" issue for me is the replacing of existential horror with a ""safer"" sort of fear, that of calories and weight gain. A comfortable distraction in a sense.

When I am on my ED bullshit my whole life is more together. I developed AN as a Teen Girl^TM to cope with a vast array of things beyond my control: physical and verbal abuse from my alcoholic father, undiagnosed ADHD, emotional abuse from my grandmother. Not eating was my way of feeling some power in a powerless childhood. ",False,False

Im such a stereotypical anorexic though. Like I fit all the criteria: upper-middle class white teenage ballet girl with body image issues and s need for control over something in my life. I'm practically a character in one of those ED short films.,False,False
