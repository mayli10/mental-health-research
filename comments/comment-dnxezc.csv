The last girl I went on more than a few dates with (not an ex, but we dated casually for a few months) was 5'6"" and between 150-160 lbs and she was STUNNING. Gorgeous redhead, and genuinely had that Kardashian-esque body with the giant booty and thighs but totally flat stomach thing going on naturally. Her stomach was flatter than mine. I was very attracted to her.   But man, if I looked like that... I hate that I have different standards for myself than others.",False,False

Or, shit, maybe both? As in, am I mistaking jealousy of some men for attraction, and that's why it feels weird, or is it that I am genuinely attracted, but the thought of using this body to bang a dude makes me too dysphoric, and that's where the discomfort is coming from? Or is it some combination thereof?  All I'm certain of is that I am into women, because I'm sure as hell not jealous of at least 3/4 of the women I'm into. My most recent ex is/was one of the most gorgeous women I've ever seen, but I'd be suicidal if I had her body.",False,False
