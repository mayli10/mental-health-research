So, I know that doesn't say anything about how you can heal a gunshot wound, but... still, genes aren't destiny. Alcoholics can maintain recovery, obese people can lose and maintain weight, all manner of addictions / vulnerabilities can be managed, if not overcome. That's not meant to be dismissive or to imply it won't be an ongoing issue for some of us, but I don't believe it is hopeless.   FWIW, I'm almost 30 and I feel like even if I somehow magically got over my eating issues (which seems more unlikely with each successive relapse), I know for sure I would still live with the spectre of major depression breathing down my neck. However, I am looking into RO-DBT therapy, which has shown promising results in both treatment-resistant depression and AN.",False,False

The researchers are just trying to figure out whether there are genetic markers that predict anorexia. But diagnosis of anorexia itself, regardless of the reasons for which it manifests, is based on symptoms. Anorexia can be exactly what you describe, an irrational fear of weight. The fact that you love food but are willing to sacrifice it (and almost anything) to get to/maintain a lower weight is part of what makes it a disorder.  &amp;#x200B;  I know exactly what you are talking about though. I was in denial that I had any kind of disordered eating or mindset for a very long time, and blamed the problem on my body. This in time manifested itself as the ""war against my body"" mentality many anorexics find themselves in, and things spiraled from there.  &amp;#x200B;  Many days that go by that I myself think I'm a fake, exactly like you describe. When I've done research in the past, I've found actually this is a very common mentality for anorexics to have.",False,False

I've dipped far below a healthy bmi, 16ish, and have always eaten smaller portions than most, but unless I'm deep in the throes of restriction, I *want* to eat.

I definitely fit the cohort in the study with lifetime AN diagnosis, in the over 25 age group and several ED symptoms in the past year.

I‚Äôve found that using benzos REALLY helps my appetite.
