This ""lightbulb"" moment is still missing, and all the things you write about that have become easier for you have never been a concern for me. Like I said in my OP... absolutely nothing has changed for the better.   My absolute only worry connected with purging apply to my surgery this week, and as I've seen absolutely no improvement there, stopping purging has no value to me. ",False,True

I purged for 5 years straight up to 8 times a day. I stopped cold turkey randomly. It was like a light bulb went off in my head. Anyway. I have been purge free since March 27th 2017. It has not been easy, but I can tell you I feel so grafeful I have not turned back even when I have urges. Life is so much better now and worth living. I don’t have to worry about a toilet being around to purge, I don’t have to worry bout eating a meal and purging, I don’t have to worry about dehydration, smelly breathe, clothes stinking etc. please don’t turn back. It’s worth it. Trust me❤️",False,False
