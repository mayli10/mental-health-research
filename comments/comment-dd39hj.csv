The link above is the digestive enzymes they gave us in treatment. I was on two doses of miralax in the morning and the evening, one dose of colase in the morning and the evening, and a digestive enzyme thirty minutes before each meal.  Honestly the only way to fully get through it is to sit with the discomfort and eat more. The enzymes help. I thought that I was gluten intolerant (and I Am lactose intolerant) for the longest time but it was just because I was abusing laxatives and then getting constipated plus not eating for such a long time that my body didn't know what to do with the food. It was probably the worst pain I've felt in my life.",False,False

They’re hard to digest even in normal™️ diets so I def feel like it can be attributed to the heavy restriction. But it did get better over time! tho unfortunately I’ve relapsed w restriction.. 🤧 I just wanted to give you hope because it definitely did work eventually, just have to power through and slowly reintroduce food :) maybe have a few bites of gluten-heavy foods when your schedule and mindset allows it (don’t be a dummy like me and eat an entire pot of spaghetti at once lol not worth it) and get it reintroduced to an everyday or ‘once a week’ diet. Beyond that just keep the lax/gummies/etc to a min and let everything reset and hopefully everything goes smoothly 💖💕 you have a beautiful soul too and I’m rooting for you!",False,False

I have had moments of purging but it's mainly restricting and I think that's why it's *so* bad, even when I eat even just tiny amounts of safe foods!  I also think I have (undiagnosed) IBS, as well, and have thought this since before I developed my ED. So that, on top of my already destroyed digestive system is just a treat lol.  I am heavily addicted to diet sodas and sugar free gum so that could definitely be an issue... I'll have to start limiting myself!  I'm also wondering if I've developed a gluten allergy (is that even possible) and I know for a fact that I'm lactose intolerant (it's only gotten worse) but if I cut any more foods out of my ""safe foods"", I'll be drinking water and eating egg whites 😂   I'm going to try what you suggested and (try to) cut out caffeine and gummies and work on drinking more water and just pushing through the pain! I've already been through recovery once and I remember it being hell but I don't remember it being as bad as this. But, to be fair, I was in a treatment center at that point and I'm too broke and too invested in school to go back :/   Thank you so much, love, I really appreciate your help and support♥️ you're a beautiful soul and I hope things are going well for you!",False,True

I attribute the same symptoms to my IBS (undiagnosed but I’m pretty sure it’s what I have as I’ve had the symptoms for years.) Unfortunately I only don’t have as severe symptoms if I eat smaller amounts than normal, which... isn’t the best advice for people with eating disorders. But the symptoms did seem to go away/at least be lesser once I got used to eating normal/heavier amounts of food when I was in recovery and it was just a matter of getting my stomach used to digesting that amount and the certain types of food. It was a painful hell for the first few months tho but it was worth the push through. Have you been restricting a lot? Mine was always the worst during or after a period of heavy restriction, and it applied to EVERYTHING I ate at that point. It eventually evened out. Good luck and definitely talk to a doctor if you feel it might help 💖  p.s. caffeine, laxatives, gummies etc always made it worse for me.. might be worth taking a break from trying to ‘fix’ it? Mine gets better when I do less. As in I avoid laxatives gummies diet triggers etc and just drink water, eat safe foods, let myself drink caffeine if necessary, and take vitamins as needed.",False,False
