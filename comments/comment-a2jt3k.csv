I try to keep things like canned beans and spinach around along with tuna and frozen chicken. Youâ€™re right with the time thing.

Healthy eating can actually be very cheap!  The issue is when people believe they need acai bowls from Whole Foods or similar to be healthy.  Try things like potatoes, rice, cheap cuts of raw chicken or fish, beans, lentils, raw veggies, even sometimes frozen fruits and veggies, bananas, etc. A diet of whole, natural foods is usually cheaper than one of processed foods.   Another issue however, is time. It takes time to cook these things. But it is a small sacrifice for a healthy body.",False,False
