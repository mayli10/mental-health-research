I fly right under their radar pretty much no matter what.   But on that note, there was some satisfaction in making shitty women jealous, because the same kinda woman often try to deny me womanhood, in one way or another. They treat me like an overgrown child who hasn't outgrown her tomboy phase, or like a potential predator. But as much as that was a thing... they couldn't deny that when all was said and done, I was skinnier than them.   I like my body much better now, though.

With my ""best friend"", I realized in hindsight she wasn't the most loyal friend anyway. She'd hide things from me while confiding in other people, flake, get outwardly jealous if I got more attention out at clubs or bars, stuff like that. Still, I never ever expected the severity of the way she treated me when she finally cracked (we hadn't seen each other for a month over winter break, and I lost 10 pounds. that was the last straw for her apparently). She smiled to my face while talking extensively behind my back, secretly made plans to move, announced to me she was moving out the day before she began to move her shit out, and COMPLETELY changed her demeanor towards me, as if she was angry at me for actually doing something TO her lol. Totally out of the blue, haven't spoken since. Now we have to split time with our mutual friends like a divorced couple. It's awful and I hate her for it.  Anyway! TLDR I think the ones who are really overtly jealous of you are probably showing their true feelings already. Extremely trustworthy, loyal friends who don't seem jealous probably aren't phased by your weight. It's the ones in between you've got to watch out for, and don't underestimate the amount of nastiness that jealousy can bring out of people.",False,False

I've actually lost a good amount of friends due to jealousy, though, and it sucks. I'm not conceited in the least, but I am pretty significantly underweight at this point and it clearly *kills* the women who have started drama with me. My old best friend made a big show of moving out of our apartment and never speaking to me again, and got sympathy from all our mutual friends by telling them she was ""triggered"" by the way I look. Is it grossly satisfying to see her out, surrounded by the unkempt, overweight friends she's replaced me with (who allow her to feel like the center of attention), while I'm dolled up as thin as ever? Sure. But would I prefer to have all the friends back that were too overcome with jealousy to have me around because I attract attention from men/other thin women? Hells yes.   Jealousy really is the ugliest trait. Having an eating disorder is awful and I've spent endless money and energy attempting to recover, but I'd hate just as much to be someone so unsatisfied with my  looks and unmotivated to change them that I feel literal hatred towards other women for being thin/pretty/whatever.",False,False
