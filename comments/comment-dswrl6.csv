It boggles my mind every damn day. Just the other day I was talking to the lady at the nail place about how I’m going back to the US for Christmas and I’ll probably be fatter when I come back. She gasped and said “but you’re so skinny! You can eat whatever you want!” When she’s like half the size of me. When I was a high school teacher girls who probably weighed 15kgs less than me would always call me skinny and try to wrap their hands around my waist. I’m...very clearly bigger than them so it’s just wack to me.,False,False

He was like “oh I didn’t realize you where so tiny” by the other day I mean probably months ago but it’s stuck with me that much. I think I did a triple take,False,False
