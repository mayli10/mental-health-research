Never had julius but jello tastes amazing and I make it every night the sugar free jellos do not disappoint and i've blended them into slushies before  Also not sure if this will help but almond milk is super low in cal, maybe mixing half almond milk with half some form of creamer would help. Vanilla almond milk exists also if things are vanilla flavoured.   Xanthan gum will thicken things (super low call but makes food feel more fulfilling)",False,False

It’s pricey but really really high quality tasty and actually makes things creamy. Find on Amazon or at Whole Foods. ,False,False
