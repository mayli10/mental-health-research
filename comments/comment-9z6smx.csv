Listen... you can get hurt driving drunk, or lose your licence but you already knew that,and you do not give a fuk.  I get that you don't care about any of that. You don't care if you hurt yourself. You are reckless... your desires are so strong you just aren't seeing it.  You aren't seeing how one second, one bad decision can change a whole life. Maybe not even your life, maybe someone else's.  What if YOU TAKE A LIFE??? Sometimes it isn't always about you. Like right now. Get out of the car.  ",False,False
