Dorm life was absolute shit for my mental health. I was deteriorating and getting congratulated for it. I couldn’t focus on classes and I NEVER went out past 9 PM (because what if I got hungry?).   I told them that I was moving out of the dorm because I needed my own space (truth) and that it was so I could cook for myself more than using on-campus dining (truth). What really got them to agree to help me move out was the numbers. It was cheaper for me to rent an apartment and make my own food than it was to stay (my campus does refunds on all scholarships, so what I didn’t use for classes I got refunded).   As for triggering family, that’s a big work in progress. I had to kind of... turn off? caring about my family’s weight loss or judgement. I don’t really go out to eat with them and I usually tell them that I have something planned when time to eat comes. If they make comments that I have asked them not to make I walk out (not super dramatic, but I’ll go to the bathroom or clear my throat).   “I am happy that this kind of talk makes you excited, but it isn’t good for me to engage in. If you feel the need to disrespect this boundary I will probably leave the room”   I gave them time to adjust with reminders but when they knew better I left the room.  Hope this helped and wasn’t a bitch to read!",False,True

I live in dorms during the school year and home during breaks and my family is also a huge trigger. my dad is a personal trainer and my mom is all diet-y too so it’s hard to spend time with them. How did you go about moving out and bringing it up to them?,False,False
