It sounds like he was trying to be helpful but didnâ€™t know how to do so properly. Iâ€™m sorry you were triggered though, ED brain doesnâ€™t care about other peopleâ€™s intentions ðŸ˜ž",False,False

To be honest, I think a lot of times even the most well-meaning people donâ€™t know the right things to say to their loved ones with ED â€” and sometimes they get it spectacularly wrong. That being said, I wouldnâ€™t say they are trying to hurt you or have bad intentions.   Please set your husband aside and explain to him how certain words or phrases about food will make you feel very negatively, and hopefully he adjusts. Iâ€™m not saying to not trust your instincts if you do feel like someone is trying to trigger you on purpose (trust me, Iâ€™ve also been there). However, sometimes people really do mean well and still mess up badly â€” and they are also going to be the ones who will take your words seriously and do better.   Also, from one internet stranger to the other, Iâ€™m proud of you. Recovery can be a rocky road sometimes, and I definitely feel you.",False,False

If he's used to you eating very little in front of him, then the meal would have seemed like more *in comparison* to the usual. That doesn't mean it was an objectively big meal in light of the fact that you had just ended a fast and a five mile run. Your meal sounds like what you needed, if not more, after that. Don't let this guy get to you.",False,False
