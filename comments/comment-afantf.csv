Kind of surprised at the reply with this post being a week old lol.   I appreciate the advice and encouragement! I'm doing okay now that I'm another week out and my appetite has started to somewhat return, thankfully!   Just as a heads up though, this is an eating disorder support subreddit (judging by your post history it looks like you might not be a regular here/aware - my apologies if you know it is). For some of us here, every instance of eating is very mindful and conscious (too mindful sometimes), myself included. Working out/exercise is not always the healthiest suggestion for some of us here, for various reasons (many use it to cope, restrict, punish themselves, etc).    I hope you don't take this as being rude or brushing off advice, just explaining why it might not be as straightforward or simple here as it would be somewhere like r/trees or r/fitness. I really do appreciate the fact that you were trying to help, so don't let that stop you from trying to help others in the future as well! :)",False,True

When i run dry this is a problem for me. Me appetite goes to shit. I donâ€™t want to eat. So i turn to this mindful eating approach. Make something that smells good. Put it in front of your face or your lap while you watch TV. Make a conscious effort to experience it with every sense except taste. This makes my mouth drool and then youâ€™ll be ready to eat.   Shakes are also very good. A protein shake in the morning with a big ass wide straw can help settle your stomach and make you eat without try.   Watching food network and working out helps too. ,False,False

Right now I'm trying to eat small amounts of relatively bland/easy food throughout the day (I was doing omad for some time), but it's a struggle. With the nausea in general (your experience may be different, but I've been dealing with it on and off through all hours of the day), I try to eat ice or have hot tea and that seems to settle it. Also an ice pack on my stomach is amazing and seems to calm A LOT, similar to a heat pack for menstrual cramps. Reminding myself it's not forever either helps too (most likely a few years for myself) and all the reasons why I'm quitting to kind of power through. ",False,True
