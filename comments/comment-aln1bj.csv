I've done a lot of thinking and my purge urge comes from losing control during  the binge (which can be 2000cal or 200, anything that is more than I'm currently comfortable with) I want to undo it, but also I binge because I want the endorphins from the food and they come... for a bit. Then the regret  stamps them out. So I purge and get endorphins again. Also shame, but it's not as bad as the regret. It sucks, I'm so sorry to hear that you're feel that way. :(   If you're looking for a suggestion, I can tell you what I do. The last few times I've gone down that road, I've found the off ramp. When I'm so over purging, I'll binge and go to purge, but instead stop myself and make myself feel and think about the food in me, and how bad I feel. I really focus on that feeling but don't let myself purge and think about the fact that my binge led me here. If I binge again, I will feel like this again. I CANNOT purge. That is doing far more long term damage than the binge. But I feel awful. So I just can't binge again because I'll feel this again. I try to turn the negative emotions that I would just void while purging onto my thoughts of eating poorly. Usually I'll end up eating smaller meals more often the next day so I don't binge, and somewhat restore my eating to a more normal and healthier level. If I only eat what I'm comfortable with and let it digest before I have a little bit more, it sits so much better with me.   When you purge you get to wash away how bad the uncontrolled eating feels, but that only makes you more likely to repeat the process. By breaking the cycle and forcing yourself to face the bad way you are eating (for me is far under eating then snapping back to eating more than I am comfortable with), I find myself making better choices. Ymmv.   Good luck! I hope you're able to get out of this. Normal weight loss and/or recovery are possible. No one can force you to recover, but you can make slightly better choices every day!",False,False
