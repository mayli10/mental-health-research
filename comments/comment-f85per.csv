They're not super anorexia specific but they're better than nothing. Memoirs might be helpful for you - there are lots of those. Would that be of interest? And how are you doing today?,False,False

Would it work as well as if you were at a higher weight? Probably not, but it's worth a try. It's like saying ""this is only going to offer you a little relief so we're not going to do it"". No one would ever do that with, say, some sort of PHYSICAL pain - ""yeah this tylenol will only help a tiny bit so there's no point."" Anyway can you get some pro-recovery books?",False,False

I have an assessment at a private facility this week; hopefully I will be accepted and admitted there. Group therapy hardly even exists where I am currently.,False,True

Were you involuntarily admitted to this facility? Do you have an option to go somewhere else more accommodating to your needs?,False,False
