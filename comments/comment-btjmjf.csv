When I hear someone say “oh I ran 3 miles today” I just don’t...get it?? It’s so fucking hard for me to even run 1 and I feel so out of breath and weak.  What’s even scarier is when people say “oh I ran a mile as a WARMUP”   Jesus Christ how!!!??,False,False

Sweating and being sore and out of breath and feeling like shit just doesn't seem ideal. I've always been a weakling who hates formal exercise. Its so much more enjoyable to be active in other ways!",False,False

It’s super hard to follow an actual workout and disappointing when you realise you can’t do it, but for example maybe you can start by slowly jogging in place (as you watch TV so it’s not too boring) and little by little going faster / for longer",False,False

If I go without eating and I am doing just cardio I don't have that much of a problem.. but god when it comes to weight or other exercises it's was a mess. My last 2 work out sessions I had barely eaten anything &lt;300kcal a day (which was after work out) and oh god.. was it pathetic. So, if you want to work out (even if you hate it) try eating something before &amp; build up to running slowly. In conclusion: you don't suck, you just need to try something else. Or not exercise at all if you really don't want to. It is up to you.",False,False
