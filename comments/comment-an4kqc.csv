If you have particularly open Eustachian tubes (your ears almost never feel pressure and they pop a lot) then you could get saliva and even bile in your ears. Best solution would be to not purge (obviously)  but if that’s not on the table, don’t be forceful, in anything. I find that my ears get liquidy and mucusy after core workouts or especially stubborn shits as well, so less pressure! ",False,False

That’s why we sweat when we have the flu, because those functions piggy back off one another. &amp; it could also be anxiety induced sweat if you’re nervous while purging ? ",False,False
