It's definitely on the higher end of the scale, but *you can add or subtract ingredients as you please*, including going down to one serving of oatmeal to make the base cal count **150 as opposed to 300.** I just find two servings to be more filling, and I tend to do OMAD restriction.",False,False

Thats 250 calories. Yesterday it was chicken breast with acorn squash and parmesan. 250 calories. Most of my recipes are 1/4 cup meat, 1/2 cup veg, and cheese that is so rich, you only need a little to add a ton of flavor.  No carbs in those tho.",False,False

Vegannie is a great one specifically for super low-cal foods. Liquid-based dishes like soups or curries are also a decent bet since the bulk of the volume will be broth or water.,False,False

But I make diet Tsatsiki all the time... with light yoghurt and light cream cheese (I don't use Philadelphia since I found one with even less calories, 60kcal/100g)... and I bought wild salmon today :D",False,True

Make one ore two crepe in a nonstick pan (or use baking paper). Fill with tuna in the brine and philadelphia active, or with turkey ham and philadelphia active, or wild salmon (wild is almost nonfat). Roll. I think around 250-280 depending on the filling. Tasteful and satisfying.   Pulled chicken with diet tzatziki: grill 100g chicken, pull it in stripes. Mix 100g skinny yogurt, half cucumber, parsley and fresh garlic, salt and pepper. Mix in a bowl with the chicken. 150kcal roughly.  Hope this helps ðŸ˜ŠðŸ’ª",False,False
