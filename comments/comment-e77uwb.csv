I have an extra-large t-shirt that fits THE SAME as my size small t-shirts. I have a pair of leggings that fit well and silly me thought I could then reasonably order other leggings from that brand in the same size. Apparently this was a faulty conjecture. THE SAME BRAND I TELL YOU. And this is *with* using the waist/hip measurements they provide on the website.  I just have zero idea what to even expect anymore. It turns all shopping into some hellish emotional roller-coaster.,False,False
