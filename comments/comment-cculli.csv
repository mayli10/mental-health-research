Although when I get sick, I end up not being able to eat for a week so that’d be pretty useful.   Honestly at this point I know I’ll hate myself the next morning whether I eat 600 or 6000 cals. Don’t need to force myself to puke on top of it. I feel much better about restricting after a binge. Like I’m somehow back in control and everything will be fine until the next time I buy 10 chinese custard buns to eat in one sitting.",False,False

It made me feel happy and the only way I could tell I felt ”full” was that over stuffed feeling you get when you eat that much. To me, that feeling meant safety and satiety, a buffer for my emotions and protection against the world. Then I could settle into a happy sleep. Binging didn’t give me a lot of negative emotions or feelings of self hate, so why would I have needed to purge?",False,False

I’m just no good at it. I can gag myself for as long as I want, but that food is not going to come up.   Believe me, letting it sit in your stomach doesn’t feel good. It makes you feel like a disgusting pig. If we could get rid of the food we binge, we probably would. Not everyone is able to and even if we did purge, it wouldn’t solve the problem.   Sorry...your post came across as really dismissive of BED. As though we should be purging.",False,False
