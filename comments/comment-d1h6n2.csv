Just before I was admitted to hospital at a similar BMI to yours, my psychiatrist asked me how I viewed my body and I said ""healthy"". It was only when I started to weight restore that I saw my body as to how it actually was. Because no one ever commented on my body, I thought I must be fine. Later I was told otherwise, people were kinda concerned for me but didn't know what to say.",False,False

Like sure, on a theoretical level, a person can accept that experience is subjective. But there was nothing like feeling *incapable* of perceiving my body shape - due not to visual impairment but psychological factors - to help me appreciate that even the most ""objective"" human senses are largely illusory.  Shit's crazy.",False,False
