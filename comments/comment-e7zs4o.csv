I hope youâ€™ll consider telling them about the suicidal thoughts and plans, especially if theyâ€™re unaware of where youâ€™re at currently.   I can only speak to my own experience of course (and experiences vary quite widely) but the medical side could never offer me the rapid complete fix I desperately wanted. No silver bullet. I just wanted the pain gone and I was sure if they just understood how much I was hurting, theyâ€™d somehow help. And then when none of the meds, etc. relieved the suicidal feelings, when they had no better help to offer me...then all I wanted was to die so at least I could get out of the pain. I hated how people continually tried to make me stay when I was so hurt and so tired. I just wanted their blessing to leave. But leaving didnâ€™t work either. (Itâ€™s unclear how my body and brain werenâ€™t permanently damaged. It seems the universe is fickle.)   I *didnâ€™t* want to stick around or try to find a slow effortful way out of the pain. I really didnâ€™t. Itâ€™s just what happened. Discovering that meds can help maybe 20%, and tools from therapy can help another 10% initially and increase a lot with time, and adjusting alcohol and food could be 10%, and going for walks can be 10% etc. And itâ€™s slow and messy and I was so so angry that this was the only way out that was gonna work for me. But itâ€™s working.   What Iâ€™m saying, I guess, is that if meds (tms, ect) alone donâ€™t offer you total relief, that doesnâ€™t mean all hope has to be lost. There are other possible facets to a solution. I know we all have to find our own path, and choosing to try to end your story early is certainly a choice thatâ€™s out there. I just...as a single easily-ignorable voice...am putting out there that like you, I felt there was no way out. I felt these solutions might work for others but not for me, I who was too tired and too broken. I guess it turns out the treatment people were right about â€˜feelings are not factsâ€™.   I know that got suuuper long, and 50/50 isnâ€™t helpful at all, and I wonâ€™t bug ya any further. I know I had a very hard time digesting any message of hope when I was in the darkest places. I just...your story reminds me of my story I guess.   Wishing you peace &lt;3",False,False

Itâ€™s hard because the fear just compounds the depression and hopelessness for me....spirals and spirals.

Iâ€™m diagnosed Bipolar II and doing ok currently with just lamictal and a couple PRNs for when anxiety or SH thoughts are getting overwhelming. Iâ€™m female and a hormonal birth control approved to treat PMDD also really helped, since Iâ€™ve tended to get the most suicidal shortly before my period. Dialectical Behavioral Therapy has ended up being very helpful too, though it took quite a bit of time and practice to start experiencing a shift in my thoughts.

Itâ€™s ok to be tired, or lost, or anything you feel &lt;3 You deserve compassion and support - from others, and also from yourself. (The latter can be heccin hard)   I think if ketamine offers you hope (the infusions or the new nasal spray they released) then that hope is just as precious as the effects of the ketamine (which could itself be life-changing). Even if it turns out to be a temporary boost, that could be the leg-up that saves your life.   Over the years I tried 25 different meds, TMS, ECT, a bunch of therapy and hospital and residential time...and now somehow Iâ€™m trending out of the darkness. Iâ€™m not even sure how...not sure what finally flipped some unknown combo of switches in my brain. But it happened.   I hope it happens for you too.",False,False
