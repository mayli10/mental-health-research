I can really understand how you feel. üòû   It can make me feel the same way too sometimes. It has taken me about a year and a half to be able to manage it with like an 80% success rate of not making me feel horrible  when I think on it. It used to destroy me every single time.  I would become so depressed and could cry on the spot thinking of it.   You‚Äôre so beautiful and incomparable to those women because you‚Äôre the real person your partner gets to be with.   Sorry it has you feeling down. ‚ù§Ô∏è,False,False
