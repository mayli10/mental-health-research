This sentence really hit me especially.  &gt;Physically I cannot make eye contact with any of you thin, beautiful people because I don’t want to embarrass myself.  My fiancé knows and is supportive as well. He’s a good listener. I don’t find talking to him about most ED related things, unless it directly involves him, to be the most helpful though. I think posting here, talking to my therapist, or going to group are more helpful. Not saying you shouldn’t talk to him, of course, just that you shouldn’t read into still wanting outside support.  I’m sure it’s really hard for him to listen to you speak about hating the woman he loves so much.",False,False
