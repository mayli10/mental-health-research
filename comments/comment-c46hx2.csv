One very harsh truth - but one I will tell you because it is important, a perspective I never personally considered before I heard it, and also promotes harm reduction, is to remember is that if you are transgender, losing weight only reveals more of your skeletal structure and how you are composed. Fat deposits can change, but unless you transition very, very early, your bone structure can reveal your birth gender. One of the biggest regrets a trans woman friend of mine had was her anorexia, as in her words, she said ""It made me pass less every single day. I used to, then I didn't.""  I don't want to freak you out about it or anything. But she was so broken up about it and told me it was okay to tell other people who struggle with the same thing. I think you deserve to know",False,False
