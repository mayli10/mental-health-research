I've been considering gaining a bit just to pass the clearance but I'm a bit scared. I'm only in my second year so I guess I do have some time to think it over and maybe get a little better.,False,True

I have studied and lived abroad many times and each time accompanied a worsening of my disorder. As I'm sure you well know, a BMI of 12.4 is considered dangerously low -even critically low. I can't tell you what to do or what not to do, especially where it concerns your education. But if I were you, I would look seriously at this opportunity from a harm reduction perspective. It might be better to wait to travel until you are in a more physically and mentally safe place.   I hope you don't take this as me dissuading you. Traveling abroad has been an incredible experience for me and I would recommend it to everyone. But I also think you should consider your health and safety above all things before you make a decision either way about pursuing this opportunity.ðŸ–¤",False,False
