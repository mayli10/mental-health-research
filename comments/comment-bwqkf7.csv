Friggin. Weeks.  Personally I seem to fit the 6 week rule. I am 4 weeks into my recent uptick in cardio and I have what I estimate (because it drops this much when I fast) to be 3-4 pounds of water.   I cannot link the post I read this from, but it has very good info on the how and why this happens. If u like I can pm it to you!",False,False

The fast could have triggered something in your digestive system and now your body retains a lot of water. It should go away soon though, you can drink herbal tea to get rid of the water weight faster. Nettle tea works great",False,False
