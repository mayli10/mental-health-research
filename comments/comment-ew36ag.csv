I guess she also don't eat everything she shows/don't eat everyday like that. She might also exercise to compensate and we'd never know. Honestly I used to like her because she seemed honest and raw, but now I can't stand her. She needs professionnal help. In my opinion, she is not really recovering, just switching a bit her habits, but she's still very much controlling about food and obsessed about it. There's a ton of other recovery channels that you could watch, like Megsy Recovery, or Daphne Fischer's old videos.",False,False

Look at her first video vs her most recent. She doesn't look like she's dying anymore. Her skin has improved. There's light back in her eyes. She has gotten better. She has a long road ahead of her though. But she doesn't look as afraid. She doesn't hesitate for as long as she used to. She still has habits to break, but she's made progress and I'm so proud of her. Do I feel she could've done more in this amount of time? Sure. If she had a meal plan, a dietitian, a therapist, whatever.. just some kind of professional help. Or have her family control everything until she's at a healthy weight.   The documentary.. that was hard to watch, but her channel has always been raw and showing her reality with recovery. She doesn't just show the good days. She shows the struggles. She shows what it does to her and her family. And honestly, I love that. I can't stand the other recovery channels that make everything out to be rainbows and butterflies like it's the easiest thing in the world. And tiptoeing around too worried about triggering people. I'm sorry, but it's not their responsibility. The people getting triggered are responsible for watching in the first place. My unpopular opinion.",False,False

It's very easy to film one day of eating, but do totally different things on the days they aren't filming. In her videos she still looks terrified of the food she's eating.  I think her documentary video was extremely harmful and unnecessary. It's not showing any insight into how unwell she was at the time and is like an hour and a half of her crying and saying she wants to go home.",False,False

It's so easy to just take pics of your supposed meals then throw them right in the garbage, how is anyone supposed to know if you ate it or not? There are lots of people with ED who arent actually recovering but they want the praise and attention that anorexics in recovery get (the whole ""ana warrior"" thing) so they just pretend they're recovering and eating well when in reality they're not doing any of it.",False,False
