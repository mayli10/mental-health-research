But I'll eat on my own accord sometimes. If it were him wondering how to help me I'd just want him to tell me he is worried and wants me to be kinder to myself. But it also might not stop her from engaging in disordered behavior/ losing weight. I will say it's much easier to deal with when you have people that understand and care about you. Good luck mate!,False,False

Sometimes other people pressure her into eating and she takes a couple bites of something she doesn't finish. Other times she does it on her own. But most of the time she's just ""not hungry"". I just tell her to eat if she can",False,True

Whatever you do , don't comment in her weight or body shape even in a positive way. It can make it worse.  Is she refusing food constantly? If she's going out of her way all you can do is tell her you're worried and you want to help her ""get better"" or ""feel better"".",False,False
