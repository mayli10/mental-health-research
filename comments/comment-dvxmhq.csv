Why can’t you come during lunch or after school, that’s what my highschool would do. But to have a student run alone in front of everyone else is part of why so many kids despise their physical education, there’s no sensitivity or afterthought for what the student might be going through. I’m not sure your relationship with your teacher, but you could try asking to do a makeup after class instead of in front of the whole class. I’m so sorry you have to go through that, best of luck to you!",False,False
