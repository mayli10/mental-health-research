My sister told her after she kinda forced it out of me. My mom thought I was attention seeking, but I really wasn’t. Months later, she found all of the food that she thought I was eating, but kinda hidden in various places in my room while she was cleaning it. I had been at this for almost an entire year. She never knew the extent of it until she cleaned my room.    My advice- Don’t let your parents discover it by accident. I don’t know how strict your parents are.. but just sit them down one day and be like “hey.. we need to talk about something”. It’s basically like a “coming out” kinda thing. Lol",False,False
