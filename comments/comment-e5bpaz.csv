Not necessarily ""starvation mode"" but your body adapts to some extent (constipation, being cold, ammenorhea, hair loss, skin quality loss, nail quality loss, fatigue, insomnia, ect).   you should try reverse dieting- add 50-100 per day. you can expect a bit of gain as there will be more food in your body and thus more water. this is especially true if you replete your glycogen stores in your muscle, which hold a substantial amount of water. you just need to hold on for a few weeks to adjust and lose in a healthier manner. consulting a doctor, nutritionist, and perhaps a therapist would not hurt either.",False,False

The obsession with numbers, the compulsion to count/log, the irrational fear that something bad will happen (ie. unpredicted weight change) if I deviate from a certain plan.   Sadly, I don’t think there’s an easy way out. During recovery as a teenager it took *years* to get the obsessing down to a minimally-intrusive level. (Though now 15 years later I’m playing with fire again.) I’d hope that the quicker the disordered eating (&amp; obsessive thinking) are reigned in, the shorter that process of un-sticking the brain can potentially be.   Have you been able to talk to anyone supportive about your experience? It sounds pretty overwhelming.",False,False

My current TDEE is 2410 and my current BMR is 1996 calories. So I part of me knows logically I could eat more and not gain, but a bigger part of me is fully convinced 700+ will lead to weight gain. And I did trial 4 days of eating 1200 and I did gain weight!! I just don’t get it.  And while I was away I was still way underrating and my weight loss stalled for the first time since August and didn’t change for like 3 weeks. It’s  finally started going down again, but at extreme restriction since being back home.   So I do know the numbers, but can’t convince myself it’ll work :(  Thanks for the comment though",False,True

Numbers I know mathematically are well below my body’s needs, I worry are ‘too high’. First I’m ok with one number as the goal, but after a day at a lower number now only that new number is ‘good enough’. And I do the same intense-restriction-and-upsetting-rebound thing.   I try to flip it around though. All those intake numbers mentioned. 200. 500. 800. Projected indefinitely they will all be fatal. Soo I gotta ask my brain what it means by ‘low enough’.    (Srsly brain, if you could stop trying to kill me, that would be great.)",False,False

You said you are obese so your tdee is probably quite high.  500 cals/ day is not too high and you will still lose loads at that.  Lets say your tdee is 2500 cals, at 500/ day you would be at a deficit of 2000/ day which roughly translates to losing 4 lbs/ week which is fast weight loss   to calculate tdee you can use this ([https://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html?ctype=standard&amp;cage=25&amp;csex=m&amp;cheightfeet=5&amp;cheightinch=10&amp;cpound=165&amp;cheightmeter=180&amp;ckg=65&amp;cactivity=1.465&amp;cmop=0&amp;coutunit=c&amp;cformula=m&amp;cfatpct=20&amp;printit=0](https://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html?ctype=standard&amp;cage=25&amp;csex=m&amp;cheightfeet=5&amp;cheightinch=10&amp;cpound=165&amp;cheightmeter=180&amp;ckg=65&amp;cactivity=1.465&amp;cmop=0&amp;coutunit=c&amp;cformula=m&amp;cfatpct=20&amp;printit=0))",False,False
