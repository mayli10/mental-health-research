I’m thinking of meeting with my dietitian and giving her an update and seeing if she can recommend anything I might not have found online. Part of me doesn’t want to because she’s only ever known me in solid recovery, and Infeel embarrassed to be dealing with all this again. Ugh, I’ll figure it out.",False,True

Unfortunately the center called during the one time I told them not to, didn’t leave a voicemail like they said they would, didn’t pick up my callback and so far hasn’t returned my callback either. I think I’m on my own with this for a while.",False,True

I have anorexia nervosa along with Cystic Fibrosis and chronic pancreatitis so I struggle with this a lot. Unintentional weight loss after illness or surgery, pain after eating, along with a general lack of appetite can be very triggering for me, and I have to try pretty hard to not let myself slip. Right not I’ve had to just get myself back onto a kind of schedule of eating, and try to have something even if I am not hungry or really don’t want to eat. Even if it’s just a meal replacement shake that is better than nothing and for me it’s easier to drink calories than prepare a meal.   It can be hard when your mind is telling you otherwise, but you just have to continue to make the choice to nourish your body because if you don’t it’s probably just going to make the health issues worse. I’m not saying it’s easy, as I do still have so much anxiety around eating and weight gain, but it can get easier and I hope it will for you!",False,False
