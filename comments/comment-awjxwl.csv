I too consumed 2500Cals today, and I'm regretting it so dismally. It's a big deal 'cos it snapped my ongoing fast at 36hrs â€“ ""only"" 12 or so days short of my goal (325hrs, if anyone's counting). Story of my life.   Not that it was bad food by any means (ackchally, to my mind there is no such thing as ""bad food"") â€“ thankfully, I never rue my food *choices,* only my food *amounts* â€“ or the act of eating at all when my wish is to be fastingâ€¦  So my war with food continues! Chalk down today as another battle won by food. *But at this very moment I'm egzackly 6hrs into a new fast, and tomorrow's a whole nother dayâ€¦* ðŸ˜‘",False,False

You may go on the scale and see a 4-5 pounds gain, when in reality a lot of it is just water weight .Donâ€™t be so hard on yourself, it doesnâ€™t matter in the grand scheme of things, that I can guarantee. Drink a lot of water to flush all the sodium and what not, it really helps me after a binge.Hopefully, it will also make you feel less bloated. Just donâ€™t beat yourself over it, okay?
