Today I told them I really need to study, but invited them over to my place tonight (also have a lot of junk food that I can offer them so I wonâ€™t binge on it lol), and will do that more often as itâ€™s a safer space for me atm and I still get to see them! Saying I want to study during the day and then focus on friends time when Iâ€˜m done sounds actually like something a normal person would say too and makes them feel like I want my head free to focus better on them ðŸ™ƒ",False,True

I wish any of my friends would ever reach out to me and ask to hang out lol. if I week you I would try and pick a dedicated day of the week to hang out with them, and explain the drive is annoying on days when you're at home. a practical reason is better than saying you don't want to eat",False,False
