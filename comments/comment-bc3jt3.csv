I was usually drunk when I would to my appointments and I just knew all the right answers to give her. She always praised me for doing so well and progressing so quickly (she even said I was doing much better than other clients with my issues).   I feel really guilty that I didn't let myself be honest with her, tbh though even though I lied a lot to her the sessions still really helped me.   Oh and I lie to my GP all the time about my drinking, which i shouldn't...",False,False

She apparently did not read my therapist's notes about my ED.   Although props to her because she gave me some nutrition counseling that for once wasn't full of shit and reliant on meal supplement shakes. She told me to eat nutrient dense foods like Greek yogurt etc and to make my calories really count. It was brief but probably the most wholesome nutrition counseling I've received from a physician.,False,False

It's kinda fucked.",False,False
