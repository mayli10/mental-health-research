But I also really hate the idea that dieting causes eds.

Like MFP didn‚Äôt fuck up my brain, it was already predisposed to being fucked up.  That said, fuck WW for making this app. Kids don‚Äôt need to be on diets.

And the intended audience seemed to be adolescents rather than literal children, given that parents couldn‚Äôt even see what was being logged (just got notified that the child was continuing to use the app).   But then WW acquired the app. Just the name Weight Watchers being associated with this thing turns it from nutrition oriented to dieting oriented. And then they started adding features to make the app more addictive, and more in line with the WW brand. Like now they allow you to set goals like ‚Äúlose weight,‚Äù and there‚Äôs a ‚Äústreak‚Äù feature, and oh right the app is now aimed at children as young as eight.  They are basically just trying to get people hooked into the WW mindset and ecosystem at a young age, under the fig leaf of ‚Äúpublic health.‚Äù Like no if they cared about public health they wouldn‚Äôt have acquired the app at all, or at least not made any changes to its function or intended audience.
