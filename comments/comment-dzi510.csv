Mostly to cover my face if I got something on it before I get a chance to wipe it off and also cuz ya I don’t want ppl staring at me while I eat. And without fail someone always asks me if I’m “okay” when I do it like... they think I’m gonna throw up or something??????? Idk I honestly don’t get it like it’s just covering my mouth to be polite idk how it looks weird?,False,False
