My mom offered to buy me a postmates, I've been really struggling with money lately and haven't been able to afford takeout or anything like that. Go to her house and she said she'd had to go back on the plan after rethinking her finances and I went to the bathroom to cry. Like, I felt so bad and awful, she doesn't have to get me anything she's not obliged to but it was the fact she'd told me would and I got all hyped up and restricted all day for it :(",False,False

Then I would get home and still be upset so either a) throw out the gelato even if it's not fully melted, or b) eat it all cos it'll go weird if I put it in the freezer (probably not but 'logic'...)",False,False
