I know how it feels to not want to get a new scale because that means facing your truth. I’ll admit it was painful and hard for me to do but now I’m glad I have it. I found that not having the scale led me to honestly binge and purge more and work out less. But I’m clearly a control freak so without the ability to control my ED behaviors sky rocketed. I’m sorry! I know how you feel. I don’t know if getting the new scale will help or hinder you but we are here for you ❤️,False,False
