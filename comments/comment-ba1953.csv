Thank you for this, I needed it.   One of the few things I eat is peanut butter and it's also her binge food and that was what she stole. One of her friends replaced it for me.   I'm so over this.

Had she written a post about how her roommate was triggering her to binge and that she was feeling like shit etc etc she'd have gotten support here aswell. Why shouldn't she ask for help when something is triggering her? It is valid, just as it's valid that OP wants nothing to do with it and want to switch rooms. Seems like that would be a pretty good solution.  The only thing that is wrong here is her stealing your food OP, I would try and actually get my money back.",False,False
