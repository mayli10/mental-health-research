U can feel it! Way to go!""   My friend has been on a binge cycle and put on weight and told me one day ""I haven't been putting on what I should for what I've been eating"" and I just kept my trap shut because she looks a little swollen right now. I'm not going down with her. This is not how it's going to work.   Tbh I am beginning to hate weekend-long events with people because I gained 4 lbs this weekend and my tits are telling me it is NoT all waste weight.",False,False
