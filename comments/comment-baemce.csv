It's not about finding another escape or answer, it's in finding peace in the fact that everything, us included, is fleeting. In the same way we appreciate a sunset or a snowflake, all the while knowing it will slip gently away  I know that's a tall order. It's a big hurdle.   if you want recommendations, buddhism helped me a lot",False,False

Sometimes I spend hours throughout the day preparing or eating food.  Sometimes it’s what I use as a pick me up, “if I can make it until 1pm I can have a snack” and that snack will coast me for a few hours after that.  So that snack helped me get through 5 up to 8 hours of my day.   Without that crutch makes the day miserable.  The only time I can successfully fast is when my mood and energy are high enough that I can use that extra time to check off errands or things I need to do.  Even when I get past the point of hunger in my fast I still want to eat due to boredom and something to look forward to.",False,False
