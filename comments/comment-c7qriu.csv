My treat days usually involve a hike or a trip to an aquarium or a walk on the beach or basically anything that you feel able for that's outside of your usual routine. I find that being out in nature usually helps best for me but it can be anything at all!   Other than that I just want you to know I have been where you are and I know it feels like this is your forever but it doesn't have to be, you have more power in you than you know ðŸ’œ  If you (or anyone reading this) want anyone to talk to feel free to dm me, I might not be able to help but it can help to vent :)",False,False
