Though this was before my dumbass realise she had a disorder and not just that it was an unhealthy coping mechanism (eating then vomit).  Moving forward she'd like to work on it with me before seeing any professional as she feels incredibly ashamed but I tried to gently convince her to take small steps.     It's definitely a hard position since I feel like I do most what of you've listed (sexual activity + compliments) but she doesn't see her body the same way I do and she hates it. But I'll have to pay extra attention from now on.    Thanks for the advice definitely helps and I'll show her this comment to see if that's how she'd like me to approach it too!,False,True

First of all, I’d recommend you ask her exactly what she wants you to do here. None of us can tell you how she will react to any of our advice.  Yes, professional help is the absolutely best thing you can encourage. This might include weekly therapy, medications, and meal plans. There are also a lot of self help resources that you could encourage her to look into, or you could look into them and see if any of the information helps you to help her.  My man knows, in pretty explicit detail, about my BN. He tries to help but that’s a really hard position to be in. Here’s some things I would tell him if he were asking to help more.  I want genuine compliments about my physical appearance, but also about my personality or actions. I want him to initiate physical affection and plenty of sex. I want him to ask how therapy went or what my self help books are talking about. I want him to call me on my bullshit when I’m binging. I want him to talk me down from my cravings and offer a distraction until they pass. I want him to eat healthy meals and exercise with me. I want him to remind me to drink water and take my vitamins and medications. I want him to give me reassurance when I am anxious and praise when I am doing things right.",False,False
