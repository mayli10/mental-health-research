Eating disorders are hell no matter what size you end up at and there's not much separating the super morbidly obese from others with more restrictive/purging EDs besides the size they end up at.  I don't think there's been a single person on that show that wasn't abused in some way, neglected as a child or molested. Many also grew up in poverty and childhood food insecurity is such a huge contributor to later problems with binge/comfort eating. These are real people who were often dealt a bad hand from the start and turned to food to cope, in the same way that others may turn to alcohol or drugs or self harm or restriction. ",False,False

And you're not any better than them or anyone else, just because you're smaller.  I think that whether this realization is felt as relief or disappointment depends on your perspective. If your whole ego is wrapped up in the sense of security/superiority that you get from being thin, it could be really threatening to truly internalize the concept of fat people as existing on an equal level to yourself â€” equally moral, deserving of love, etc. But that's because you *need* to consider those others as ""less than"" in order to prop your fragile ego up. That's a toxic and false view.  The thing that gets to me is thinking about a friend who's overweight, or my sister, or my mom... would I ever want any of them to stand in front of the mirror with tears streaming down their face like I do sometimes? No, never. If I love these people with absolutely no thought as to their weight, why can't I do the same for myself?  Giving yourself ""permission"" to gain weight does not mean you're going to actually get fat. To say and believe, ""it doesn't matter even if I did gain 300 lbs,"" does not mean that will actually happen. You should be able to theoretically consider something like this in your mind. It is incredibly liberating. â€” There are people who don't understand this and will warn you that you're creating excuses, opening up the door to possibly becoming massively obese... but seriously, it is just *an idea*. It is not threatening your reality in the slightest.  I'm glad you're doing a bit better. Compassion for self and others is never a bad thing.",False,False
