(as an example in my state i have to go to a psychiatrist every month to renew my prescription rather than getting a convenient long term prescription.)  i'm not really sure if you expected people here to actually tell you how to get adderall lmao?",False,False

Without direction from a doctor it could lead to a multitude of cardiac, GI and neurological issues. It’s not worth it. You are worth more.   I think your therapist would see right through you, anyhow. It’s a commonly abused drug and at your age, it takes much more testing to get approved a prescription of adderall than just telling your therapist you have concentration issues. She’d refer you to a psychologist who would perform extensive testing on you to determine if you really have ADHD/learning disability.",False,False
