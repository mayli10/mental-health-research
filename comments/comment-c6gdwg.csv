We have no idea how long I may need it because I have this acute condition but I’ve been complaining about the same issues for over two years now so they finally said screw it we’re going to do it. I mean, it’s Mayo Clinic. I can’t really do better than that.",False,True

My boyfriend is at my side whenever I need him, he took me to the hospital and picked me back up. He’s just as concerned as I am and he’s getting on the doctors cases about it as well. I would not be able to do this without him.",False,True

Ultimately, my doctor sent me to the hospital after I scheduled a visit to them because of how dehydrated I was. An IV was very beneficial to getting the hydration I needed. Consider doing this as it may help you. I remember your other post, in fact I'm the one that had a g-tube for a time. I ended up getting on this visit to the hospital. If you ever need someone to talk to, I think I may have experienced some of what you are going through and I'd be happy to talk.",False,False

You definitely can't do this alone. Please, it's so important for you to have someone with you. Stay safe, and handle yourself like you would a fragile butterfly- your body is very weak right now and needs all the care and rest it can get.",False,False
