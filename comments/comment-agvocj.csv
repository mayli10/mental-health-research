Fast forward to now, after overcoming a massive addiction to the stuff I am now at 210 pounds. Waaaay more than the 140 I was at before adderall. ",False,False

Ephedrine doesn't do that to me. It's less of an appetite suppressant but no crash, so overall way better. ",False,False

I take ritalin (methylphenidate, similar drug to adderall) and I managed to set a new HW twice on it. it also gave me 3 anxiety disorders, a lot of sleepless nights, and turned me into a very sweaty person (you feel cold so you ball up, but you're not REALLY cold so you're sweaty)  even in the short term when the ritalin wears off at the end of the day, my appetite comes raging back. it definitely suppresses it while it's active in my system but it is no deterrent to my evening/night binging.",False,False

I stopped taking it bc I was pregnant so I ofc gained weight but idk if I would have anyway or not. ,False,False
