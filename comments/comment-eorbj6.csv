But if you are worried about purely cosmetic reasons I did see some really nice clip in veneers for about $350. They snap on and are molded to fit right over your teeth. Ive seen a couple YouTube videos and they look pretty real to me. I can try to find the videos if you want. It’s not the perfect solution but may be able to give you some confidence back. I think also you can pay in installments for some. I looked into it a while back because I don’t like my teeth lol. Sending lots of love your way,False,False

First things first - get thee to a dentist stat! Not for any cosmetic fixes, but to asses the general health of your teeth and gums. If you have cavities or gingivitis, you need to get those things taken care of first. Get a treatment plan and start chipping away at that - it won’t solve all your problems, but making progress in a positive way is so helpful. It’s self care.  Second, this might not work for you, but it’s what I am doing to fix my jacked teeth. Research medical tourism. Turkey and Hungary are two of the best places for cosmetic dentistry and have entire industries to help English speakers access dental care. I’m going overseas later this year for veneers and the cost is insanely cheaper than the states ($130 per veneer vs $800-$1200 where I’m at) and they do package deals that include airfare and hotel.   If the damage is really bad, you might want to consider crowns as well, as they will protect the whole tooth and last quite a bit longer than veneers.  I don’t know how helpful any of this is - it’s just what has helped me. I feel better about the damage as I’m making progress to fix it and being kind to myself throughout the process. Best of luck to you ❤️",False,False
