Prior to that I actually had BED. I was so afraid for my health and have a naturally obsessive personality, so in the very beginning when I was figuring out my insulin ratios I started weighing and measuring everything I ate, eating very little so I could control my BG levels, etc. As I started to lose weight and adjust to my diabetes, I got addicted to the level of control I had over my body and counting carbs turned into counting calories. I had an absolutely perfect, non-diabetic A1C with no highs or lows, got to my LW, looked fucking amazing... Ugh, I need to get back to that. I've started restricting again which is nice in that I hardly have to use insulin, but I've been slacking on my diabetes care for a long time.  I'm glad you posted about this because everyone always talks about diabulimia, but having T1D can easily lead to restrictive eating habits and orthorexia. I mean, we're forced to worry about our bodies, eating habits, and numbers all the time, which is basically halfway to an ED already lol.",False,False

She didn’t take care of herself and was very thin. She died of kidney failure. I hold the type 1 people more dearly because of it. ,False,False

It’s really hard to keep weight off for me because of treating low blood sugars and I’ve also got an under active thyroid which makes it more difficult as well. It’s really frustrating to work out too because I tend to have low blood sugar and then have to treat it so I feel like my work out at that point is pointless. I think the constant blood sugar fluctuations and self administration of insulin make everything more difficult. When I uncontrolled diabetes when I was younger(I went through a phase where I didn’t check blood sugars and stopped caring about anything) I was so thin, but I know that was hell on my body so I started doing better but gained weight. It’s like you just can’t win.",False,False
