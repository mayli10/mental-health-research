If we can't get proed back, at least we can get the subreddits that target POC and women down. I would love if we could have a master list and go after them.

There's no reason to be cruel. You can believe the things you want to believe without actively trying to hurt the feelings of others. I'm sure you are not a mean, bad person in real life.
