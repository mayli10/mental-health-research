But you are absolutely right, a severe binge could be anything from a mental breakdown because of an unplanned cupcake to 10000 cals in one sitting. It's more about how you mentally handle it and if you chose that than anything else (imo). Just trying to give some insight into what she may have meant in terms of ""severe"" tho, in case it helps",False,False

It can be validating to hear that the diagnosis sticks from what I remember when I was officially diagnosed (especially because a therapist had previously told me incorrectly that I didn't meet criteria). I think its important to understand that there is not a weight classification for bulimia, and your size does not determine whether or not you have an eating disorder. Your eating disorder is valid, and you deserve to overcome it.",False,False
