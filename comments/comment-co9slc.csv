Eco-friendly, easy on the wallet, and less pain or stress if my weight fluctuates. Stretchy boyfriend jeans and those flown dressy pants are my absolutely favourite! They still look cute and will fit even if my weight fluctuates 10 pounds upon or down. Buying clothes has never been easy for me and isn't for a lot of people. Just try to remember it is just a piece of fabric that your body slips into. also, don't feel discouraged or upset if you are wearing a size two or even four sizes larger. Depending on the brand, sizes tend to vary so you probably will not be the same size in everything and that's okay. Take it easy! This is rich coming from me and I am hoping I can practice what I am preaching considering this shit ain't easy for me either.",False,False
