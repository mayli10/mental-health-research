Have you noticed a lot of positive attributes can't be measured accurately? Beauty, success, wealth, happiness, intelligence.... One person could see you as a 1, and another see you as a 10. To you Â£30,000 a year might be good, to someone else that is slumming it. If I want to have ""success"" in these areas there is no real way to measure them. Being unable to compare accurately creates a sort of anxiety. Am I ugly? Am I failing? I don't know. And this gives me a sense of unease. I get no joy from perceived success because I never know if it is good enough compared to others.   Anxiety has crippled me for decades. Its a cruel puppet master who fills my head with doubts, with intangible concepts and fears that any attempt to grasp fails. Humans can't deal with having no control, no certainty..  But my size? It created such a beautiful illusion of success and control. And it is success I could see at that. I could see what weight I should be for my height. I could directly compare to others. In this way, I could know for sure and control it. And for that moment when my jeans felt loose or the number dropped, I felt a sense of true success, true accomplishment. I didn't feel like a failure or that there was nothing I could control, because there was this undeniable evidence that I can control something....   And that relief of finding something I can control and I can see my control....it felt safe, it felt joyous..  Add depression to the mix and suddenly that burst of joy becomes a drug. And like drugs the first hit is always the best. Those first few pounds lost feel incredible ...even empowering. For the first time you feel like you are flying high and can achieve anything. But then the highs get weaker. Once you've lost 15lbs, suddenly a 0.5lb drop isn't enough to make you feel like that. You've got to do more, lose more to grasp that feeling again.  But then you get to the point where you arent losing weight for the joy anymore. The joy shrinks and instead comes the fear. Youve associated weight loss with success and joy for so long, that the concept of the opposite makes you think youll be a sad failure if you put weight back on. Worse, you might go back to having nothing to control and somehow, that is worse?  Yet people think people with ED all just want to be a certain size and they can't understand why. They don't realise for a lot of people with ED, it isn't about the destination it was about the journey.  If it were truly about the size, every person with ED would, by that logic, just stop their ED once they made their goal and just focus on maintenance. But how many actually do that?   At least for me...it wasn't about the size, it never truly was. So these posts about how being small wont ""make you happy"" have always seemed redundant to me. Of course it won't make me happy, but it did, for a while, make me less sad.  Like an abusive partner it lured me in, with offers of comfort and control and groomed me into a state of dependency. And now I know staying is dangerous, but leaving is just as scary.  It is true what they say that sometimes holding on hurts more than letting go. And I know there are posts everywhere about the joys of being ""recovered""... But do I risk letting go and face the possibility that I will end up still without joy, but only this time with no comfort and control to fall back on? Would I handle living like that? Would I want to live like that?   With this mindset I am trying something no therapist or doctor has ever recommended...  Learning.   I am learning the guitar and recording myself. I can hear and feel myself getting better. I am learning Spanish. I can get marks and see improvement.  And for the first time I have found other things that make me feel like I am succeeding.  So while I might not yet be able to recover, I am starting to fear the process of recovery less.",False,False

If I'm UW or close enough to it, I can put on an outfit and leave the house without wondering, ""will everyone around me think I'm fat today because this outfit doesn't explicitly make me look skeletal?""  If my hand happens to graze my upper hip while I'm sitting in class, I don't freak out about taking up 1-2 extra inches of space than I'm ""supposed to"" because there's no extra mass there.  So, in that way, I am ""happier"", even if it is just the absence of an even worse feeling.  Hearing ""iT wOn'T mAkE yOu HaPpY"" doesn't cure my constant depression and panic when I'm over a certain size.     But yeah, you hit on a great point there: most ED's are not just the result of a ""diet"".  Plenty of people diet and exercise without falling into an ED trap.  Mine started when I was depressed and alone in high school after my controlling mom had banned me from the phone, internet, and basically any communication with the outside world aside from school.  It started as an alternative to cutting myself, and also as a time sinking hobby.  I wanted to hurt myself, physically experience the suffering I was feeling emotionally, ""get back at"" my mom, and have a thing to focus all my time and energy on to not feel so lonely.  Plus, I could see the results every morning -- a sort of gamification of starving.     On a separate note... lol, those kinds of messages don't help me because it just triggers my stubbornness.",False,False
