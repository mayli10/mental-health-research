I know what you mean about hypocrisy - I have so much compassion (and common sense) for everyone else, just not me.   I'm hoping that at least my DEXA scan will show stronger bones. And I'll just have to deal with the ignorant ass comments. It's so stupid how we've all been conditioned to think airbrushed starving models are the epitome of health.",False,False

Wish i could do something to stop this from getting to younger people, it really does push them in this ed direction.  Also, it’s way better that you got your period back! That’s great!
