For me getting a heart rate monitor was super helpful and gave me a lot of peace of mind- you can get a pretty good Fitbit for less than $200 or so on Amazon.  If you have a smartphone, you can also download a heart rate tracker and then intermittently measure your heart rate while you’re working out. Less accurate, but it will give you a ballpark estimate of what you’re burning. If it helps at all, I actually found that my machine was underestimating how many calories I was burning.",False,False

I also want to say that different machines over estimate differently… I hear that a bicycle is the most true calorie burn count,False,False

You should get a wearable tracker, even the shitty cheap ones are more accurate than the machines. Like shaving off to the nearest hundred would be pretty accurate with one of those.",False,False
