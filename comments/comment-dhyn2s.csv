Itâ€™s a steroid hormone so cholesterol is needed to make it, and low amounts of dietary fats can mess with cholesterol/ inhibit steroid hormone production. Also stress can mess with estrogen production by preventing the release of the peptide hormone that stimulates estrogen production (because of course it can). EDs are like a perfect storm for halting estrogen production. And a classic sign of low estrogen is dry vag ðŸ˜”",False,False

TMI but I honestly feel like the only time I want to do anything sexual is when Iâ€™m deep into a restriction period. Iâ€™m not sure what would cause that- are you hydrated enough?,False,False
