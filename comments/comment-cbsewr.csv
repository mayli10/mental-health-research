Shocking that my mental health improved almost as soon as he moved out.   Also, I weigh 5 pounds more than my 5' 7'' diabetic father so there's that lmao.",False,False

There's just some triggers- like bringing up weight in explicit numbers- that I haven't fully expressed (although i know I should).   It was just one of those moments that made me feel really shitty :/,False,True

If he is attempting to loose weight in a healthy way (but I'm guessing will make mistakes because he's not a weight loss expert... Like most the people here are!) And you also want to lose weight but in an unhealthy way, you can either compete and resent him... Or you can join forces and he can keep you from extreme starvation and binging and you can keep him from fat logic and falling off the wagon.... Learn to lose healthily together by combining your powers!",False,False
