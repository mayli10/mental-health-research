I haven’t gotten mine for years except a couple odd times and have honestly thought of it as a secondary mode of contraception. Obviously I’d assume you could get pregnant in the time between not menstruating and things starting to work again, if you’re in a period of recovery or something, but I feel pretty sure you need to be getting cycles to have the uterine lining a fetus would require.   But I have no medical background and am now feeling concerned about this lol",False,False

That's metabolically expensive and if your body doesn't think there's enough for *you* to eat, it's going to try not to get preggers. Same reason your libido often takes a nosedive when restricting.",False,False
