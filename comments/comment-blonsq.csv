My parents are west african, so I can't speak on the behalf of the Arabic community, but the black-Muslim community still seems really strict and religious, while from what I can see the Arabic community is more open minded and gives more freedom, because it's adapting more and more freedom to the Western culture.",False,False

Men and women both told me that they felt pressured and in the end they didn't even know if they believed in it because they felt like they had to or because it was genuine.  For women it's definitely harder but it depends in which country too, some countries have Muslims that give more freedom to their women in general. I'm from France and Islam is the second biggest religion but you can see that a lot of people are really really light in their faith and hardly ever follow any of the things in the book üòÅ  I hope you will feel relieved when you don't have to fake it but until then, stay safe ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False

Since the day I was born my parents shoved Islam down my throat, almost brainwashed me. Now that I grew up when I think about it sometimes it was also abusive and toxic.  I remember my father telling me it was right to beat your kids to make them pray, and I got whipped with every object of the book growing up.  I'll never beat my kids with a damn phone charger cord. And don't get me started with the ignorance and the misogynistic mentality.  So yeah, not having had a great relationship with my parents to start with, I immediately fell off Islam.  Now I just fake it, and when I'll move out in one year I'll be free from this bullshit.   (This is my personal experience in a Muslim household, I'm not saying everyone is like that.)",False,False

I'm very curious about that as I was never religious!  Also, dont pressure yourself too much. You need to take this time as a family time. I don't know if you have a good relationship with your family, but Ramadan is also about sharing and spending time together.",False,False

An example is that it is okay to eat pork or non-halal food if the alternative is starving. I should think that similarly, it would be okay not to fast if doing so sets you off to starve or harm yourself.",False,False

I started developing an ED almost one year ago, and no one knows about it.  This year's Ramadan is really just an opportunity to fast without no one questioning it.  I feel like I have the perfect excuse to not eat or binge.  It's extremely triggering to see all that food,  but I'll do my best.  I kinda feel awful because I'm not fasting for the good reasons, I'm really just using it to further fuel my ED.",False,False

I was asking for this, as someone with an E.D. (she knows)  and about other sickness or conditions (diabetes perhaps). And explained me,  that if you are sick, pregnant or your health might be compromised, you do as far you can, and that is perfectly fine. That it is a fasting not only from food but from mad thoughts, gossip, intimacy. A period to re-start with a good foot, that I found so amazing I think we can learn from.  So I guess part of fasting for those bad thoughts that EDs can bring, eating normally is perhaps something to consider?    you are all great and I wish you a good Ramadan.",False,False
