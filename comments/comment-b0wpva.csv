I feel you on the depression and lack of exercise. I used to be a decent runner, too. I used to think running kept depression at bay, until depression ate away at my ability to run. Now, it's just a huge struggle to even shower sometimes.  You're not lazy.  And your worth is not related to money. You are a good person surviving difficult circumstances. That's all.  I don't know if you wanted suggestions or just support, but since I'm in a similarly bad place, I'll just share with you some of the things I remember that got me out of it the last time I felt this dark:  Going on a short walk outside (weather permitting), not to burn calories, just to feel the sun on my face and breathe some fresh air. I would walk and look at the clouds and listen to music that made me feel good, like baroque chamber music, Mozart's piano concertos, etc.   Making some effort to look publicly presentable and treating myself to a coffee out at some cute cafe, browsing expensive boutiques full of useless knick-knacks, just walking around the city pretending I live a much cooler life than I do.  Getting out of the house in general. Getting in my car and driving.  Trying to eat nutrient-dense foods regardless of whatever else is going on with my intake. Lots of vegetables. That way even if I end up in a calorie surplus, I can at least feel good about giving my body fuel for hair and muscles and bones, helping my skin look better, etc.  I hope this isn't unwanted or unhelpful. I know sometimes nothing helps. I just want you to know you're not alone and I hope life starts treating you better very soon.",False,False

Iâ€™ve been on a solid road to recovery from binging and purging. Over the past couple years, I went from purging several times per day to several times per month. Itâ€™s almost a controlled purge most of the time - as if a good made me feel ill and Iâ€™m choosing to get rid of it to feel better, not because of calories. But the urge to be empty is coming back because of the stresses in my life.   I know my ED is related to control. I feel very useless right now and since Iâ€™m still too depressed to work out, Iâ€™ve been purging a meal here and there. No binging and purging, just occasional purging to bring my numbers down.   I hate my life right now. Truly. Fuck what people say, so much depends on money. I have 7 cents to my name and for the first time ever couldnâ€™t pay my credit cards. It just keeps piling on me. And for some fucking reason, purging gives my brain some happy hormones for a while.   Iâ€™m back to wanting to kill myself. I wonâ€™t do it, but the thoughts are there all day reminding me I have an â€˜offâ€™ button. I drove to the store and have been sitting in the car for 20 minutes because I canâ€™t find the motivation to open the door.   I know it gets better but the future isnâ€™t tangible right now. Also, I heard my mother and brother saying how lazy I am because Iâ€™m in my room so often despite the fact thatâ€™s the only place I have. I canâ€™t say â€˜Iâ€™m so fucking depressed that I canâ€™t find the will to liveâ€™. I still clean the damn house every day but wanting to die is apparently lazy.   Long rant. Sorry. Bad day.

My recovery team convinced me to eat a bit more last night. Do I regret it? Perhaps. Do I physically feel better because of it? Admittedly, yes.  I need to keep going though. That was a nice pit stop.   Today is day 15 binge-free. That's almost half a month. That's crazy to me.  I keep having binge dreams though :/ those aren't fun  And yesterday, my team brought in treats for registered dietitian day. We had two hours to eat either a piece of dark chocolate, a piece of giant licorice, or a mini muffin. That wasn't cool. I felt so stupid as a binger refusing food; I'm not skinny like the anorexic chicks next to me..or at least, I'm not bone-thin and flirting with death like them. Anyway, I cried and didn't get anything past my lips.  At least though, they convinced me to get an extra serving of mango in last night. I wasn't dizzy when I woke up because of it. That should count for something, right? It's not like I can't eat..I just can't be forced to consume unplanned junk food.  That said, of course, the scale didn't move today. I'm still at my lw, I just have to keep going. Only a couple more BMI points away from underweight..which is quite a bit don't get me wrong, but as someone who spent her whole life fat because of BED, this is amazing..this is why I refused the treat, I don't want to fuck everything up and go back to bingeing and staying fat. I need to keep going.",False,False
