Eating disorders are usually comorbid with other problems though, such as anxiety, depression, OCD, etc. Would they take any of those seriously? When asking them about it, don’t try to underplay your issues. Your concerns should be taken seriously. If they are not, do not give up on trying.",False,False

So did you get put on a waiting list for CBT because your GP referred you after hearing about your thoughts?  I'm not ready to get help yet, as I don't think I have a problem, feel more of an imposter and that there are people who are much sicker and in need. I'm just checking options to make my bf happy.

It's like telling someone with depression you won't treat them because they haven't tried committing suicide! Also it's annoying because I think these kind of services vary by area in the UK. I just don't think I'll be taken seriously and so it will be really invalidating. ,False,True

I don’t know if there are any other treatment options - I haven’t been offered any. I have a friend who’s a psychologist and she said that eating disorder services are very separate to talking therapies and I should push for another referral. I find that hard to do though.   I’ve been trying to talk openly to my GP about food issues for about 3 months and she’s understanding, particularly when it comes to checking my weight, but I don’t think she really takes me that seriously. I’d suggest trying to speak about your thoughts and feelings more than specific behaviours - that seems to have more impact somehow.   Where I am there’s also a local charity that offers counselling and I’m also on their waiting list. I think I found their details through beat.   Please try to get help. It will be so worth it.

The best time to start receiving treatment is before your weight starts swinging drastically out of control, and any decent mental health professional should know that.  I am glad that you recognize that your eating patterns are disordered. Most people will be in denial or won’t even notice that it is getting unhealthy until it is too late. If your doctors say that they cannot treat you until then, they are very wrong indeed. You need to work with a therapist to break these patterns before they become more cemented in your mindset.",False,False

My GP is sympathetic and has referred me to specialists twice in the last year but was told both times that they don’t think I sound serious enough yet that I need their help. I think they’re gonna keep refusing to see me until I’m underweight :/ I get that they only have so much resources to use on people but i’m salty that i’m basically being told to get worse if I want any help ,False,False
