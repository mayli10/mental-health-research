Talk about me behind my back . like sabotage. They found out about my eating disorder and always watch me eat now. they used to eat so much around me but now they never do! I'll always eat by myself.. I find it satisfying when they look confused when I eat whole waffles in front of them (honestly guilt free bc I will save calories) while they just pick at their food . it is honestly annoying. I'm not competitive with my friends when it comes to this like some others may feel , so I find it so obsurd. One of my friends from said friend group came up to me and mentioned its because so and so has body issues. I found it unacceptable because she's the feminist type that shouts to the roof tops about body acceptance.... üôÑüôÑüôÑ right. OK.",False,False

Either way, no matter what I'm doing, I am constantly obsessing over my weight and obsessing over food - either how much i want to eat, or what food I can eat without going over my calorie limit. Yet I am still not sure if this is an ED. Disordered for sure, but at the same time I almost want it to get worse because then I know I will finally get skinny :(",False,False

I want to be Actually Thin, i'm not satisfied w/ my ""normal"" body so i just keep doing... whatever this is. but totally relate to that guilt about being able to ""choose,"" like when I watch those ED story videos and i feel like i'm almost appropriating their uncontrollable illness... maybe i'm just an extremely vain person who just lacks willpower",False,False

I‚Äôm 25 and have been in this cycle since I was 15. Ten years of cycling. Somehow I always believe myself when I say ‚Äúthis time I‚Äôll stay skinny forever‚Äù. I never do. Living in a caloric deficit for long periods of time just isn‚Äôt sustainable. You either ‚Äúrecover‚Äù or you die. That sounds morbid but it‚Äôs the truth. So I ‚Äúrecover‚Äù. I live another year feeling fat, and then it‚Äôs back to the task of getting thin. It‚Äôs exhausting, emotionally and physically.   I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre in a similar boat. You‚Äôre not alone and it certainly doesn‚Äôt make your ED any less valid. I hope you find peace and freedom from this, whatever that may look like for you!",False,False

In my (underrated) opinion, anyone who doesn't eat when they're hungry, eats to the point of pain, can't eat in front of others, etc etc, has disordered eating. And the moment those behaviours begin to tear apart your personal/family/professional life, you have an eating disorder.   I spent this last Winter losing vast amounts of weight, then attempted 'recovery' this Spring, and am now stuck in a binge-starve cycle from hell.  And I have been just as sick in each stage, just in different ways.   Unfortunately, society continues to shove diet culture and other toxic stuff done our throats (lol).   You are very sick, my dude, and I hope you get the help and attention you deserve üíï",False,False
