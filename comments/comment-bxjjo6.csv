Hopefully he doesn’t mean it as an insult lol.  But thanks for letting me know that, it was super interesting!!",False,True

Lots of times Spanish-speakers refer to people with descriptors, like ""hey skinny"" or ""hey redhead,"" but I've also definitely heard it used as an insult or an affectionate term, even for someone who isn't skinny. For example, my mom calls female jaywalkers ""flaca"" when they cross in front of her car, and especially if they're crossing slowly and without looking, regardless of how they look. In this case, she's saying it in the same tone as ""hey stupid get out of the way,"" except translated literally it sounds like ""move, skinny,"" when the person isn't always skinny.   I can't be sure about this, but it also might depend on where your coworker is from. Slang varies greatly from country to country even just in Latin America, and probably moreso between there and Spain.   Tl;dr, it might be a descriptor or even a compliment, but could also be an insult that doesn't have anything to do with how you look. Tone of voice should tell you what he means!   Also, congrats on the job! I hope it's going well!",False,False
