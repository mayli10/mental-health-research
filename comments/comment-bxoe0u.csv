There were sooo many threads that were just thinly-veiled excuses to talk about how gross they thought fat people were. It was so disappointing because those threads were rarer in the old sub, so it really felt like people were preying on the new sub to see what they could get away with, push boundaries, turn it into another ""fathate"" sub, etc.   I think it's doing a bit better now tho. Even on those threads there's always at least one comment speaking up for overweight people, and the new moderators are really good at being able to differentiate between someone sharing their honest experiences bc they need help even if those experiences are negative, and the people who are just using this sub as an excuse to be gross.

Weight loss itself is easy (it's just math). The hardest part of my weight loss journey was actually the two years I spent exercising and not losing weight and trying to change my habits. Once I found a way mentally to give up the food and cut my portions, the weight disappeared pretty quickly. Even though it took a while, it's really not that bad because you see the drop on the scale every so often (keeps you motivated) and even after a full year of doing it, it doesn't get boring or old, and at that point you're not really ""slaving away at it"" because you've found a way to make weight loss habitual at that point. It does suck looking in the mirror and not really seeing progress for a long time though due to the ""paper towel effect"". 90% of my visual changes happened in the last 25% of my weight loss.  &amp;#x200B;  I don't think the average obese person really suffers as much as most people think. At least I didn't. It's an easy state to live in in today's age with the obesity epidemic making it more common (comfort in numbers, fat acceptance, etc), much better clothing options, plenty of hobbies to engage in that don't require physical fitness. The negatives of being obese and ostracized for your obesity are in large part offset by the fact that you're able to live a very unrestricted lifestyle where you literally eat and drink whatever you want all the time. I do remember how sad I was at times being obese, especially while growing up, and thinking to myself ""I'll never be normal"" ""I'll never fit in"" etc. Psychologically it can be miserable at times. But on the whole you don't really think about it, it just becomes your reality and you learn to focus on the things that really matter in life.  &amp;#x200B;  Even though I'm physically healthier, I am worth no more or less than I was before I lost the weight. All the weight I lost cannot buy me another single day on this Earth, cannot bring my deceased friends or family back from the dead, cannot make anyone love me, and cannot stop me from continually undermining myself and making mistakes, being the imperfect human being that I am. It cannot allow me to love myself or accept myself for who I am. It can't make me love what I see in the mirror. I don't want anyone to be obese. I don't want anyone to suffer unnecessarily from food addiction, type 2 diabetes and other metabolic syndrome complications. At the same time, it's really true what they say in that losing weight can't cast out the demons in your head. I view the weight loss as more of a consequence of God's work in my life and internal changes on the spiritual and emotional plane that I needed to go through to facilitate the weight loss in the first place. After I lost the weight and went into anorexia, I needed to do *even more* work here. Now that I'm recovered and things are starting to stabilize, I have more clarity about the fact that what led me to live at both ends of the spectrum at different times in my life was almost certainly down to things primarily in the psychological/emotional realm and secondarily in the biological/environmental realm, even I won't deny the latter plays a significant role. Deep down people of all shapes and sizes are slowly dying on the inside and yeah, Amberlynn Reid seems like a really shitty person on the surface, but there were some shitty things about me when I was obese, and there are some shitty things about me now. It's all an outward expression of inner pain. All I can say is these days I try to fight my human instincts to respond in anger/frustration/hatred which accomplishes nothing, and instead try to respond in love and empathy.",False,False

It‚Äôs an eating disorder. You want to be numb. You need comfort, you stop caring about looks and yourself.

I‚Äôm eating 500 calories now, I‚Äôve lost several hundred pounds. Before I had given up on life, and I just stopped caring, now I can recognize that it‚Äôs the same thing really. One disorder is stuffing feelings and doing carbohydrates and fat (food drugs) the other is feeling a buzz from starving and feeling your bones come to surface. They both feel surreal.  Either way I hate myself and I really want to die. The only thing about Amberlynn is that she is in major denial about her weight. To her she feels like a healthy BMI. How do I know? I knew the lbs, but I couldn‚Äôt tell my weight and I was confused and thinking that I was relatively normal at 457 lbs. Ok that‚Äôs freaking ridiculous really. She thinks she looks great, when she sees herself she puts reality in the back of her mind. Substitutes with lies.  I hate myself, I‚Äôm fucking gross. I do want to quit, I have too far to go.

Fun. But my knee bones are starting to be pronounced and I‚Äôm restricting lower every day and it‚Äôs going to be great.  If anyone wants to keep track of me you can send me a message. Usually I‚Äôm private about how much I weigh... but damn I‚Äôm tired of really big people being represented by someone who absolutely has zero self control. We really can work on it, we aren‚Äôt a magical separate species or whales on two legs. We have problems, the same but opposite of the bonespo people. I think we really want to die, or forget problems at least. But when you are big you get majorly dehumanized. ‚ÄúJust stop eating ‚Äú is the same as ‚ÄúJust have a cheeseburger ‚Äú ... it‚Äôs a mental disorder but not glorified as much as anorexia.
