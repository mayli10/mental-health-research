I'm in an intensive ED program that only accepts severe cases, and I asked what my diagnosis was yesterday and was told it was OSFED: purging disorder subtype.  I wrote a post about how I felt like an imposter. Like I don't have actual anorexia or actual bulimia, I'm faking it and taking up government and taxpayer resources.   &amp;#x200B;  But I had to do what we've been learning in DBT (dialectical behavioural therapy). I needed to check the motherf\*cking facts lol. I feel like an imposter, and I feel like I don't deserve to be in the program, but I have been told by numerous clinicians in the program that they do not accept just anyone. They take severe cases. It's a program with an extremely long waiting list (2-12 months currently I think), and I got in in 1.5 months. They wouldn't have recommended I be in the program if I weren't dealing with an ED.   &amp;#x200B;  My feelings of being an imposter, don't line up with the facts, like at ALL. But yet, I still feel like a fraud and that I'm just trying to get attention.   &amp;#x200B;  It's your ED talking, saying you aren't thin enough, you aren't really sick. That's what EDs do. They mess with your mind so bad that you can't tell what's rational and what's the ED talking to you. The ED wants you to believe those irrational things.   &amp;#x200B;  Tell the ED voice to f\*ck off, and you ABSOLUTELY are NOT faking it, you deserve to get help and you deserve love and to feel good about yourself. We are fighting a war with our EDs, battle by battle. But as you gain more territory separate from your ED, it's influence will become less and less. It's not easy, but you know what? We are fighters, and our EDs will NOT win.   &amp;#x200B;  Sending internet hugs! :)",False,False

It sounds like to me there's something wrong and the doctor agrees. Every mentally unwell person I've met has these thoughts. It can make getting treatment and asking for help hard, but having a doctor to guide you and a community of supportive people to relate to really helps.",False,False
