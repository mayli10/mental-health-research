I also think your “friend” was already insecure since she felt to need to only/mostly befriend people who she thought were inferior to her.",False,False

(Also totally unwarranted and rude) Ive heard health nuts and doctors so many times get in my face about avoiding soda to lose weight/be healthier in general. But I don’t even drink soda.",False,False

Even if she was ""like you,"" that doesn't mean you have the same struggles or will benefit from the same things. I'm do sorry that happened.  I've had plenty of ""well-meaninh"" folks try to give me advice on my health without a fucking clue about me or my personal hurdles.",False,False

This girls mother put her in bikini modeling and *very* sexy photo shoots in high school and this girl would brag about it and the advent of Facebook made it even worse, she was posting her “model pics” and then posting photos of myself and other friends at school and at lunch eating or caught off guard and definitely not touched up. She consistently acted innocent and I remember having to comment all the time “please delete this!” On photos of myself looking awful. I was very overweight and a huge bully magnet and she knew that and enjoyed it. On my yearbook signing pages, she PRINTED out a photo of us that I hated and wrote a huge paragraph mostly about herself and somewhat about our friendship.. (90/10) She, to this day, thinks she is god’s gift to this planet in every aspect, looks, morals, artistic talent, taste, skills, she thinks she’s a genius and or brilliant but she’s average..",False,True

I went to school with a girl who was telling a story about a cousin of hers, and she goes on to say the cousin was ""a big girl"" and that she was about my size. I was heavy for sure but not huge and I don't think that was necessary and she just wanted to be a bitch.",False,False

Well, that just goes to show that even thin and pretty people aren't necessarily self-confident, bc that was a clear power move right there - intended not to help you but to make her feel superior. If she were actually clueless and thought she was helping, she would have said that to you in private and in a more natural context (not that this is an okay thing to say in any context, but you feel me).",False,False
