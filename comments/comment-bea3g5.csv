My cycling performance was actually surprisingly very good during all but the worst parts of my ED, and I'm still working on getting back to where I was. It's so annoying because when you restore your weight, you're eating all these damn calories and gaining tons of weight but still have poor energy levels most days, feel like death during exercise, and it makes the whole process seem pointless. Again, trust me, the healing comes later. It took months after my weight was restored for me to feel normal again and really be able to both push myself and feel good while doing it during exercise, but it did eventually happen, and man oh man is it glorious. The endorphin rushes I get during a good spin class these days 8 months post-weight restoration are **legendary** even compared to a few months ago. I almost don't even care about my ultimate performance as much anymore - I just like being able to make progress and being able to push myself hard and have it feel good. I love being able to hit super high heartrates these days without feeling like I'm wringing my body out like a damp towel. Be patient, and keep eating. Take in quality nutrition. Get yourself a nice steak once in a while - stuff your body can assimilate.",False,False

I was in the best shape of my life this past winter when I totally hit the wall and crashed, in terms of just... not being able to go on with it anymore. I was bundling up and running 10, 12 miles in January when suddenly I just couldn't take it anymore. I started eating and sleeping like my life depended on it. I'm a bit frustrated because I know my health is better now that I'm not in such a deficit, but my mood/energy levels don't seem to have caught up with my actual body (fat, calories, etc). Really hoping that what you say is true and that the joy of running will come back at some point, because it was the best thing for my mental health.",False,False

I still enjoy it for whatever reason, I must be a masochist. ðŸ˜… But it's definitely more difficult in the depths of ED, and the mindset that accompanies it (exercise is my method of purging) is less than pleasant. Recovery makes it much easier for me, working out for the sake of getting stronger rather than to burn off binges or lose weight. Eating consistently helps a bunch.",False,False

And yeah feeling tired a lot of times during recovery was a real issue for me. I felt lethargic a lot even when my calories were more than high enough. It just takes a long damn time to heal.

It was just pain, pain, pain all the time and feeling like death after exercise.  &amp;#x200B;  It took me quite a while to consistently enjoy exercise again, even after my weight was restored, but it did eventually happen. Your body has a ton of damage to heal coming out of a restricted state, where it was highly stressed, and even during recovery your body continues to interpret exercise as a significant stress because it's already working overtime to fix all the stuff we damaged by restricting. Best I can suggest is continue to keep exercise volume low to moderate during recovery. You will have days during recovery where your hormones will surge and you will feel literally insane energy, almost like you're on drugs, but you have to resist the urge to go to the gym or hop on the bike and go crazy exercising, because later on it will catch up with you. Let your body continue to recover. Keep those cortisol levels low. Down the road, when you are recovered and not hungry anymore and are able to finally exercise out of an abundance of energy, rather than using what you don't quite have yet, then it's going to feel amazing.",False,False

But remember that going on a stroll is still exercise. Just taking a walk under the sun when it's not too hot and just breathing in the air and enjoying your surroundings. That's still exercise!   Another thing to consider is, you said you're eating enough BUT are you getting the correct nutrients etc. I know I can feel just as shitty with 2000 cals of junk food as I do with 800 cals of veggies. Your body needs more than just cals to survive and thrive.  And if you are getting enough nutrients but still not enjoying traditional working out, that's okay! It's not like healthy has to equal a ""gym rat"" body",False,False
