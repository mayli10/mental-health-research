As someone who deals with skin issues, I love the Vanicream cleanser and light lotion. No added fragrance and they are very gentle. I notice I break out rarely since I started using it. Aquaphor is good for dry and chapped lips. I like to apply a lip balm before bed so it can work overnight.",False,False

Have you noticed skin dryness / flaking / rawness too? I tend to have that along with the acne so I wash my face with a gentle non-foaming cleanser after purging, and moisturise religiously. I would be careful not to use topicals that are too harsh, if you're getting acne around your chin or mouth. Obviously talking to a doc is most ideal though x",False,False
