Dessert was these canned peaches wrapped in crescent rolls and cooked in a pan with something like a cup or two of sugar, (some butter?), and bottle of Sprite. Then, we’re sitting around talking after dinner and she busts out chips and guacamole *and* caramel cheddar popcorn. Omfg. I didn’t stand a chance! Guacamole is my eternal downfall.  I get stressed, but she’s a super nice lady and she’s sensitive about how her (admittedly tasty) cooking is received, so unless it’s actively on fire or trying to bite me back, I’ll always eat her food.
