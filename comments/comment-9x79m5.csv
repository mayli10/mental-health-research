I had to stop therapy bc my therapist wanted to do exposure therapy to help my PTSD and I was like sike I can’t handle being triggered constantly so I ended up flaking on her and relapsing into my fucked up eating habits. Be careful with bulimia!!! Purging is very damaging as I’m sure you know (none of us are rly any better than each other in that sense low restriction isn’t exactly healthy either). Did you end up writing it? Or at least starting it? ,False,False

I've been really negative and trying and I've also been hardcore relapsing on the bulimia. ",False,True

Congrats either way!! Well have you been cutting her off? Or pushing her away? ,False,False

I'm writing my 4th step now and super vulnerable. I deal with things/people by cutting them off partly because I expect people to leave me bc I'm terrible. ,False,True

Don’t feel down if they really are blowing you off they aren’t worth your time anyways ,False,False
