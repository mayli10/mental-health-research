Laxatives just make you poop the food you already sucked all the calories out of. You won't really lose any weight, except for the weight of the poop and the extra water forced into the poop by the laxatives. Losing either poop or water will just be a short term thing, the same way you lose weight when you pee.  So no, laxatives won't help you lose weight. Only eating less and working out more will do that.  If you're constipated, it's often from lack of magnesium. When you eat very little, you probably don't get enough of almost any vitamin or mineral, so you're probably just a little low. Don't go overboard supplementing, too much can be bad for you. A doctors advice is always helpful.   If you have further questions, you can PM me, but I don't log in every day, so be patient. ",False,False

Maybe try some of those. I‚Äôll use laxatives if I NEED them as in like a doctor advise me to do so. Otherwise I stay far away. Some veggies, coconut water and coffee will do the trick! You just have to be patient. It doesn‚Äôt work as fast as a ball of chemicals. Hope that helps!! ",False,False

If you have to constantly use a laxative use miralax or fiber supplements. It‚Äôs like ibuprofen, shouldn‚Äôt use it all the time, but if you really are constipated using a recommended dose of miralax daily could cause weight loss, but not actually? Like it won‚Äôt be fat or muscle, but it‚Äôll help bloating so yeah. ",False,False

Although it is a laxative, it doesn't nessecarily operate like the others. It just helps your bowels soften and flow naturally. It's perfectly fine to take daily. Since it only helps your bowels flow and soften, you shouldn't lose any weight from it. It won't mess up your digestive system or bowels, if anything it helps your bowels to work again so that you can have regular movement as opposed to your current irregular.  Personally, I reccomend taking it in the morning but you can either take it directly before you sleep or right when you wake up. It comes in a pack of flavorless powder which you then would mix into your drink (water probably works best).   Hope this helps!",False,False

There's different kinds of oral pills, substances you mix into liquids, suppositories, water flushes, even tea.   These things may make you go more regularly, but they will not make you lose more fat from your body. They make you lose the waste inside you, which lowers the number on the scale, and that can become addictive.   Like you mentioned, some of those can cause you to lose muscle control, leading to embarrassing moments. That might even happen the first time you use them. I took a small amount of oral laxatives the night before my senior pictures in high school, the first time I'd ever used them, and paid for it half way through the shoot.  If you have a doctor you can talk to about it, I'd recommend that before trying anything else. Otherwise, try starting with fiber supplements or just a cup of hot coffee, which can sometimes do the trick without anything else.",False,False
