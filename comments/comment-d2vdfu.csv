Whatâ€™s hard is that once I get going I have a really hard time stopping. Itâ€™s as if my feet will not stop. I went for hours in one to today (day after post) and I know I shouldnâ€™t have. Iâ€™ll try to make a goal of multiple shorter segments for tomorrow.   Thanks so much.,False,True

I have been dealing with hamstring strain for the last couple months. I kept re-injuring myself because I would not allow it the necessary recovery and healing time and nutrients. I would not be dealing with it now, had I allowed myself some rest. Yes, I am furious with myself (I wanna RUN dammit).  That said, try a rowing machine- it distributes the load over the entire body and is less likely to exacerbate an injury. I've been it up into 10 minute chunks with 5 min brisk walking breaks in between as part of my recovery regimen.",False,False

Impact is what I need and I need to spend hours doing it. My brain isnâ€™t doing well at all so the activity helps silence things.
