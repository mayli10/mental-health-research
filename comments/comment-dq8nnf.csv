Then a little over a year ago, I started binge eating bc of some shit that was going on in my personal life and quickly spiralled downward, gaining a ton of weight, to the point that i was fairly overweight.  When i first started bingeing, i continued and didnâ€™t restrict, even though i was disgusted with myself, because for about a month i was still relatively thin and wasnâ€™t sufficiently motivated by my disgust with my appearance, i guess. But once I did really start noticing the weight gain, i was too caught up in my own self-hatred and new-found coping mechanism/ method of self-sabotage (bingeing) to be able to pull myself out of the situation. Itâ€™s taken me months and months of maintaining this weight and wanting to crawl out of my skin before Iâ€™ve found the strength and motivation to start restricting again (much more heavily than i did initially)  so that i can Finally lose this weight. Although I know what iâ€™m doing isnâ€™t healthy, iâ€™m feeling quite good and am having no urges to binge, and am seriously wondering whether iâ€™ll ever be able to recover without falling into binge eating again ðŸ˜­ anyway my point is that please try not to let the bingeing go too far before you spiral like i did ðŸ˜”",False,False

Iâ€™m in recovery but often relapse, but always fail at continuing to restrict because my discipline is no longer there, and I think itâ€™s because I donâ€™t hate my appearance as much as when my eating disorder first began (although I still hate my appearance.) I think if I were to become overweight my eating disorder would reappear in full force. However, now I struggle with mental hunger than I cannot control sometimes, so I donâ€™t know this for sure.",False,False
