One became heavy into anorexic tendencies as a wrestler in high school. But the behaviors and weight obsession never went away even after wrestling.  I dated another guy who was bulimic. But he was restrictive also.   My husband in fact, was basically anorexic when we first began dating. We were at dinner one night (he did not eat, ordered soup and hardly touched it) and he said randomly-  ""Would you believe me if I told you I used to be fat?""  I was surprised because he was so so skinny when I met him. He showed me pictures and he was a lot heavier. His recent divorce with his first wife put him in such a deep depression he simply stopped eating and lost tons of weight.  I have/had an eating disorder as well, but was not engaged in ed behaviors during the time we first met. It took him a long, long time to begin eating normally again.  He refused to eat hardly anything for the first few years and refused the idea of treatment.  They are out there.  Also, plenty of actors and singers who are Male have come out with their eating disorder struggles.",False,False

I'm no longer FTM identified but I got my ED when I was (didn't realize it was an ED until this summer). Was dieting/fasting and watching tons of workout vids in an attempt of striving to be healthy but did also want to be macho and muscly (to pass better).   My boyfriend is a trans guy. And a recovered anorexic.   And a lot of people around me who are trans have EDs. For guys ED sometimes helps relieve top dysphoria (but really not a thing to recommend, get surgery instead boys :) ).",False,False

I watch guys openly comparing their weights to each other and living on just grilled chicken and greens and never missing a 3+ hour workout any day. Idk.

I think those people are the same who think girls only have eating disorders because they want to be pretty and thin (haha yeah that's why we starve ourselves or binge or purge) and men/boys don't have those ""girly"" issues.

It frustrates me that ED's are portrayed as romantic and only for pixie dream girls instead of all shapes and sizes. its a disease. a mental illness. not some delicate fairy dust choice with cigarettes and mascara..  I went on a tangent but. My bf in the past has claimed having one. Im open with mine. He doesn't understand my side of it but I also don't pressure him about his issues with food either.
