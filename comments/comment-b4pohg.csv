I currently have 7 different types of nut butters in my cupboard, and about 50 protein bars in my desk drawer...

I actually have a ton of high calorie foods (mostly chocolate/ice cream) that I hoard because I weirdly feel safest when it's readily accessible but I can trust myself not to eat it. But if I don't have anything binge-y in the house I start to feel like the only reason I'm not binging is because it's not available, not because I have any self control? Also I know a lot of it comes from growing up poor and empty cupboards making me panic.",False,False
