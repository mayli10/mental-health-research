My grades went to shit last year because of a relapse (that ended up in me actually having to take time out of school for a while). Readings were always a pain but when I was high restricting, it would take me almost an hour to get a page done (I wish I was exaggerating) because I just couldn't concentrate. Find resources at your uni and stay safe.",False,False

But my grades tanked, completely. Undiagnosed ADHD was absolutely a factor but so was the brain fog. If you need to restrict, at least high restrict (800-1000 is what I aim for) and don't make the mistakes we did lol, study to your potential!",False,False

On days when I feel I might be triggered more easily I try to hang out with friends who eat regularly because then I won't have a choice but to eat. University is perfect to isolate yourself from the rest of the world... I don't know about the university you're going to but at mine, they have support and nutritionists available to students who have difficult relationships with food and/or have an ED, maybe you could look into what is available to you depending on what you want to do. It's really hard but believe me, doing a bachelor's degree with an ED can ruin everything, your grades will just go down and doing your readings will be even more unbearable.   If losing your hair is what motivates you to stay strong and eat then keep that in mind, any motivation for a positive outcome is a good one!",False,False
