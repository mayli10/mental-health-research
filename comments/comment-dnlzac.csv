Who was super thin at the time was like this. And she was at a party that had brownies at the table. And nobody was eating any of them.  And was like “wtf?!” So when Nobody was looking she grabbed one and she said she ate it as fast as she could.   Well it turns out they were “pot brownies” and she never does drugs or anything like that.    She said she had a very interesting night after that. Lol,False,False
