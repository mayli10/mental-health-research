Like ok, and? Like yeah, I think I’m fat, and if you’re bigger than me, I also think you’re fat. If I’m the person you derive your opinions from yourself from, you need therapy as much as I do.

No I don't this was just a comment on a EDAnon thread.   2. You're not my therapist and have no capacity to know what I am and am not holding on to.

You asked ""when"" and unfortunately I don't know time when but the weight when these comments happened. I was trying to put a timeline to your ""WHEN?????"" inquiry and my weight loss was the best I could do. And she compared herself to me, not the other way around.

Please let those words go. They are not valid in your life anymore. I think that is where people are coming in with the ""toxic"" comments.  2. I know you don't owe me an explanation, but I wanted to know if this was a recent thing, or a historical thing, because you hold on to those moments are never healthy for us.  3. I am glad you are in a much better place with your anxiety and I know it is always a journey.  4. I am not sure what you mean by the second edited comment. Remember, you are your own person.
