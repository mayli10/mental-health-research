I read every word and it is all pseudoscientific bullshit. The part where she says that obese people probably aren't eating enough and when they get told to eat less to lose weight, they should actually be eating more is LAUGHABLE. The part where she says that obesity is not a growing issue or related to health issues is a flat out lie. It is full of lies!!! She uses big words and authoritative language to be persuasive but it is completely void of any actual valid analysis, any actual valid medical credentials on her part, and the ""eating disorder institute"" she runs the website for doesn't even EXIST and she is not a qualified nutritionist or doctor of any kind. Everything there is a lie. ",False,False

It’s not that simple. “Total quack?” Read her blog and you may find something surprising. I’m in recovery myself and I’m just trying to help others. Besides, my original comment still stands.

Some people just intuitively know how much to feed themselves, or had good eating habits instilled in them at a young age and were lucky enough to never develop unhealthy behaviours later on.  A 5'0"", 100lb, sedentary woman's maintenance calories is 1,356. You don't need overcomplicate things by spreading BS theories written by total quacks.",False,False

She is known for promoting pseudoscientific lies and is popular on [/r/fatlogic](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatlogic) where her false claims get picked apart and she gets called a ""cancer in the ED recovery world."" 1200 calories is too little for an active person, a tall person, etc. It is not too little for a short, sedentary woman, and those articles you linked are filled with absolute crap and are just as harmful as promoting eating disorders. Olywyn refuses to share her credentials anywhere and makes ridiculous claims like that humans are meant to be fat because of our ""aquatic ape heritage"" (for which she can produce no credible evidence nor find any actual scientist or doctor who supports these ridiculous claims).  To link, on an eating disorder forum, to a woman who genuinely spouts off pseudoscientific bullshit we KNOW FOR A FACT is not true like ""There is no correlation between food intake or activity levels and obesity onset or perseveration"" is annoying as hell, honestly.
