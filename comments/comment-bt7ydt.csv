Momo from Twice talked about how she had to lose 15 lbs in 2 weeks per her management, and she’d exercise so heavily and not eat, or eat and then purge. She said she’d cry herself to sleep every night because she was afraid she would die in her sleep.   And it’s just framed as a casual conversation, nobody really shows real empathy and it seems so shallow, but to me, she’s clearly suffering and it’s soo normalized??",False,False
