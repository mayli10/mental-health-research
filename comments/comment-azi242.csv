You're facing your feelings and using logic to keep yourself from indulging in your self destructive behavior. I've had TTM for years, and when I start to pull I stop and say why? Why am I doing this to myself when I hate the end result? What else can I do to relieve the way i'm feeling? It's been super helpful; my floors are no longer littered with my own hair!",False,False

I really appreciate it!   Not gonna lie I have a history with LSD and wanted to try shrooms for that positive shift you mentioned. Who knows haha.  ",False,True

Make yourself do something else for half an hour, tell yourself you can binge after that (and hopefully you won't).  Read, do work, clean, make tea, go on a walk, or just go into another (food free) room and just stay there. anything.  I've found ""active"" things keep me the most distracted, so something like duolingo, sporacle quizzes, or a game I have to concentrate on.  If half an hour seems too much, do 10 min.  If the urge is still there, just keep adding 5 minutes.  I've found that this almost always helps if I can manage it, and even the delay (with a binge) leads to better control of the urges. 2. After your next binge, write down how you feel on a piece of paper.  Remind yourself why it's never as good as it seems during those first bites.  Force yourself to read it if you get the urge. 3. Make a checklist of things you must do before a binge (drink a glass of water, read your paper, make sure all the dishes are clean, do 20 squats, etc.) and do them when you get the urge, checking them off as you go. 4. This is the hardest for me, but most effective (and honestly don't know if it's healthy, but its been working).  Try to recognize the thoughts swirling around in your head and separate them. Stop what you're doing, sit, and listen to yourself.  Each time you hear a ""but it's so good"" ""it won't be that bad"" ""just purge after"" ""this is the last one"" ""everything sucks and this is the only thing that will make you happy"", talk back to it (in your head, or out loud if it helps lol).  Recognize the urge and recognize that you have zero obligation to act on it. 5. If you have roommates/people around, just spit out ""I am going to do x activity"" that will get you out of the house/distract you.  Saying it to someone else makes it feel like more of an obligation, and it takes .5 seconds to force yourself to say this without thinking.  Also, if you haven't, try reading brain over binge.  I think it's the most logical approach to tackling the behavior, and explains why you don't have to fix your entire life to fix your binging.  Remember that it's the one problem you want to solve, and you CAN solve it.  In the book she also talks about how the urges diminish each time, which has been extremely true for me.  I really hope this helps in some way and I wish you all the best!!!!  P.S. not a recommended method of going about this but I did shrooms at the beginning of this no-binge streak and I genuinely felt like I needed for nothing, which translated to this last week/binging. Sometimes just a small shift in perspective, recognizing that emotions can be felt but do not control you, is a game changer",False,False
