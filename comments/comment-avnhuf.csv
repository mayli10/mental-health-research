Very few people start having regular periods straight off. Personally, I got my first one at 11, then didn't get another one until I was 12 (1 1/2 years later), they didn't settle in until I was around 14. Don't worry too much. Also restricting at a young age will affect more than just your period. It will affect how tall you grow, how big your boobs will get, your adult teeth (even if you still have milk teeth), how hairy you will be, etc. Not a good idea.",False,False
