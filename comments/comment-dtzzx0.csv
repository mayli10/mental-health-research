The drink is supposed to be majority cold brew with a splash of the vanilla cream but depending on the barista and how generous they are being with the cream, calories can vary ig. You can tell by the color tho. It‚Äôs usually on the darker side. You can also make it lower by adjusting the amount of sugar pumps added or replacing it with the SF version.",False,False

Our almond milk is 60 calories per cup and we would usually put MAYBE 1/4 to 1/2 a cup in a cold brew depending on how strong you like it, so I estimate the total drink to be ~35 calories for a grande. I‚Äôd recommend getting extra sf vanilla if you prefer it on the sweeter side, it is 0 calories.  For hot drinks, I‚Äôd recommend a London Fog Tea Latte (it‚Äôs earl grey, steamed milk, and vanilla) but sub the milk for almond milk and sub the vanilla for sf vanilla. It‚Äôll contain more milk so the calories will be higher, but it‚Äôs great for when you are heavy restricting/fasting.",False,False

A go-to for me is a gingerbread latte with almond milk (180 cal). Hope this helps!",False,False
