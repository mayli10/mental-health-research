A big problem is that some people seem to think only pre-teen/young teenage girls can develop eating disorders, so almost every other demographic is ignored.  I developed mine as a 20 year old.

He has a whole series of AN recovery videos and additionally many podcasts talking about eating disorder-related subjects on his second channel, Electric Talks. He was one of my biggest inspirations that led me to finally decide to recover after a long time of existing but not truly living, and sacrificing so much in my life to feed something that was slowly consuming me from the inside out.

If you suspect you are struggling with an ED, I highly recommend seeing a therapist that specializes in eating disorders as soon as possible. Even if you do not have a proper eating disorder, you may be struggling with disordered eating behaviors and body dysmorphia, which in time are likely to lead you into a proper disorder if you do not seek help.  &amp;#x200B;  Also you are free to send me a PM if you wish.",False,False

He would eat an entire plate of cookies but run so much he was underweight. I've caught him doing what I would call in hindsight body checks. He got freaky and in this mode where no one could talk to him when he was exercising. He got really really upset and obsessed with his weight. He was a masculine man though so no one batted an eye lash. I don't even think he was aware of it. I think they occur in men at the same rate as women but men either deny it out of even more shame than we have, aren't aware they have a problem, are in denial because they're men etc. I think getting an accurate statistic on any rate of eds is bogus but it doesn't account for all the men who go under the radar cause they're guys. Like how people thought girls didn't have autism. ",False,False

I've had a hard time with dysmorphia/disordered eating in my teens, and it still is a recurring problem whenever I go through a particularly rough patch. I absolutely feel you on the lack of information and awareness of EDs among men, it creates a terrible amount of stigma and additional barriers to getting support, beside it being such a solitary and alienating experience in itself. The stigma generates more feelings of shame and doubt, which leads to even less open communication and representation, it's a wicked circle. I still have trouble being upfront or admitting to it, though places like here can help with that. You can DM me too if you need someone to reach out to sometimes.  Have you been looking for any specific information or resources on EDs among men? Perhaps I can help look if that's helpful. One thing that comes to mind is this [BBC Panorama on Men, Boys and Eating Disorders](https://youtu.be/vXWCPRCuTTg) that I've personally found pretty insightful. ",False,False
