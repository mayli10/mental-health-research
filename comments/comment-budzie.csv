Yes the results are fine, they are benign things that can me just there and monitored often.   I understand the legal part, and I understand why they have the power. But I think impatient treat can make more damage than good for me, I am willing to put the work so they agreed to not opt for that. :)",False,True

That’s scary for everyone and I understand why it made you upset   I’m glad you found local councillor, don’t worry they have to inform you legally that they can have you put into inpatient if they feel it’s best for you, every councillor I have had has said this to me and i try not to take it personally I think it’s a legal thing from there side.   Try to have a little something like soup or fluids even if you don’t feel like eating that’s ok but keep liquids up if you can please   Take everything one day at a time, I’m proud of you for trying your best to help yourself and I wish you all the best",False,False
