It’s almost like your instincts can’t be trusted. Just be careful how you react. Always remember your senses are that little bit heightened.  I think maybe for you and your parents maybe try a little mediation with the therapist. Try and share with another person. Where that person can referee. I understand you want a little bit of privacy and space but at your age that’s not something you’re going to get. Try &amp; work with you parents. As you get older your relationship will hopefully become more give and take.  Try and think long term. Graduation, college &amp; life in general.   Try and catch and hold your thoughts. Sometimes when you let your mind race. You release adrenaline into your stomach and it stops you from snacking or eating. Until it wears off, like you said above “it doesn’t wear down enough for me to eat anything until dinner time or later.”  Maybe discuss these thoughts with the therapist.",False,False

I have very bad paranoia from psychosis and my parents constantly looking over my shoulder so I don’t keep journals because I don’t doubt that they would read them. I’m not supposed to be on reddit at all and don’t have a web browser on my phone but I can access it by clicking links on discord or the news. Also I don’t feel accomplished at all, I starved myself for nearly two weeks straight and couldn’t see any difference plus I don’t have a scale in my house so I don’t have any firm idea what I weigh. I think I could try to make a locked note on my phone, with a long random string for a password to keep them out, as I’m not allowed to have my phone locked with a password they don’t know. Also my therapist had to reschedule my appointment to friday but I should be fine. I just need to be careful not to fuck with my life, my parents are really quick to hospitalize me and pull me out of school, take my phone, watch me all the time, take my money, practically any freedom or happiness I have they’ll snatch the moment I don’t appear happy. They think they’re helping me and they have in some ways by taking my razor blades and keeping me away from sharp implements but the lack of privacy has driven me paranoid even despite being medicated for psychotic symptoms (so maybe it’s not mentally ill paranoia but simply adaptation to the circumstance). Anyways point is, if they find out that I’m starving myself they’ll probably force me to eat which will just result in me purging which afaik is a much worse habit. Then when I become underweight I’ll get put inpatient and pulled out of school and fuck up my junior year of highschool, ruining my chances for college, so yeah we don’t want that",False,True

Do you feel you get some validation from losing weight? Does it feel like your accomplishing something? I know when I was dropping towards my lowest numbers. I felt like I was reaching a goal. A number to peak at. My own personal goal.   Now I look back and see how unstainable it was and how low myself esteem was.   I can only provide advice from the point of view of where I was and where I am now. It’s good you’re working through this in therapy. If I could I would advise you keep a journal. Write out your thoughts and think through ideas you have like “I want to be light and frail and skeletal” and balance these thoughts against other goals like “I want to continue with my martial arts classes and do well in them and in school.” Talk to the therapist about it as honest as you can.  You can take strength from the progress you have made. Most people aren’t as honest as you have been. This is a big win. You’re getting what’s in your head out and not letting it all bottle up.   There will be up’s and down’s. I went through them and still go through them as I wonder through the forest.   Always remind yourself how strong you are. How brave you’ve been talking about it and you’re not trash. Cause you’re not giving up.   This is just one round of many and you’re not ready to retire on the stool. ding ding - times out - lets go - next round.,False,False

I want to continue with my martial arts classes and do well in them and in school and I already know I can’t do that on my optimal 0 calories a day diet but I want that sick empty feeling back",False,True

You’re a person putting yourself under a lot of pressure. That pressure is making your thoughts a little erratic and clustered. You don’t need to become so sick that you are on the brink of death.   Yes – You can find the middle ground. Looking at other people won’t help you find that middle ground. You can find that middle ground but you have to stop and take inventory. See where you are and if you need to speak with a Councillor or explore through group.   You showed how strong you are by reaching out today, build on that strength.  Keep typing, keep writing, keep ranting, keep sharing and be kind to yourself,",False,False
