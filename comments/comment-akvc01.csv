The library I'm at were offering an apprenticeship which offered on the job training, a qualification and then turned into a full time contract at the end of the 2 years.   I would totally recommend seeing if any libraries near you have any practical schemes like that (this library also offers a postgraduate trainee scheme which is super popular). I know the traditional way in, at least in the UK, is a degree and possibly a masters in Information Services, but I would 100% recommend getting as much practical experience as possible.
