I would cry seeing a doe-eyed animal being so scared running away. But then I would see videos of malnourished, dying lions and cry because they look so weak and sad. Just try to turn your head to the cute sloths eating veggies!",False,False

Sorry for my bad thoughts!  I HATE those wildlife videos because death of any type can randomly trigger an existential crisis for me haha. Even road kill.

I normally just deal with it, but like you when I am tired or stressed I just can't deal. I was in bed recently and my boyfriend sat down on the edge with a bag of chips (wtf would you eat chips in my bed and get a damn bowl!). At first I let him be, but then the CRUNCHING. I could even hear his damn SWALLOWS.  Oh and God forbid someone bites a fork.",False,False

Especially bananas and cereal. My dad used to chew with his mouth open a lot, and the sound was just like this tsunami of discomfort and disgust hitting my ears.   I also hate the sound of dishes &amp; cutlery banging into each other, liquids being slurped, and coughing/sneezing (which my brother does after meals bc he's allergic to the world...sorry bro).

Like as a child my brother would chomp on his cereal so loud and it literally would make me cringe. I still have it really bad, sometimes it will just make me irrationally angry or even want to cry (I know sounds crazy) within a split second. But as with anything in life (I'll be 33 in a few days) I've tried to regulate my (in this case weird and impractical) emotional response to something that is going to happen no matter what. Take a few deep breaths, focus on the fact that it is a tic or slight disorder of mine and just that--nothing that is really going to harm me-- and chill out. THAT BEING SAID.. The other day at school I was sitting in a commuter study lounge type area and this boy came in, laid down on a sofa with headphones on and his eyes closed and opened a big bag of chips and went to town on them. Legit chomping, grunting, licking his fingers etc. I literally felt homicidal. And nauseous.",False,False

People eating, chewing loudly, SLURPING MY GOD I HATE SLURPING, the sound of metal silverware on plates (would looooove to have plastic utensils and plastic plates everywhere). I've talked to a therapist and it's not ED related... it's a different condition. I can't stand the sound of running water, either. I think I have a couple other trigger noises but uuuggghhh",False,False

It helps that it's a video that I can choose to click on and turn the volume up/down if I want. But my roommate by far has the worst lip smacking sounds I've ever heard, and I'm from a family full of other people who chew with their mouth open. I stopped working in the common area of our apartment several months ago because they ate at the desk next to mine and I would either have to listen to music constantly to drown it out or feel pissed off all the time. I can't even understand how someone eats so open-mouthed. There's no way it's easier than eating with your mouth closed.  I think it can be a bit of an ED thing, but it's probably mostly a combination of our upbringing and 'biological' (don't know if that's the word) reaction.",False,False

If I'm in a mood for self hate I love watching muckbang videos. But if I'm just going to school or work and casually hearing people eat I really hate it. Especially (and I feel really bad saying this but I hope no one will hate me for it) if I can see that the person is bigger than me. I have no hate towards people who are heavier than me of course and I'm not saying they shouldn't eat just to make me feel better (god no).
