That way you can let her reach her personal goals in good health and hopefully she’ll be inspired to forge her own path and stop monitoring you. Proud of you for keeping it together thus far, by the way! That seems like such a difficult situation; I hope you find a way to help her and help yourself soon.",False,False

When my older sister used to live with me, she had bulimia and lost a lot of weight through restriction and vomiting. Our parents weren't ever around (they were divorced and didn't care about us) so they didn't really notice her, but as her sister I always did. I think when you have siblings (especially older siblings) it can be hard to not see the things they do, and sometimes mimic them, even if we know that it may have a negative result. I know a lot of my ED problems came from my sister, because I saw her losing weight and I wanted to lose weight, so I copied some of the stuff she did. My point is, maybe you should talk to your sister about how what she's doing may not be healthy (I know, it sounds super hypocritical and dumb, but still). I'm not the best source for this, but sisters can really effect each other through what they do, even if it's just something like eating. Whether your sister is 'jealous' as other comments have suggested or not, she's still your sister. Maybe tell her that she's beautiful the way she is and that she doesn't need to diet? Just my two cents.",False,False

I think due to long standing sibling relationship where you were the ""heavier/bigger"" one this is a very confusing issue... likely made more complex due to you both living with parents as adults.  life doesn't have to be a competition even though it feels like it is.  anyway it does sound like she has become more focused on weight and may be struggling with insecurity and less like her former ""effortless"" maintenance of a thin body  I don't mean to totally discount your perspective but I did just want to lend an outside perspective, sorry let me know if any of this opinion rubs you the wrong way",False,False

My mother has been doing the EXACT same things to me since I’ve been home for the holidays- even cancelling her orders at restaurants upon realizing I’m getting “healthier” foods. Its beyond triggering and I hope your sister gets over her “health kick” soon!   I know you mentioned “starving in secret”, I don’t know how much you and your sister are around each other but this has definitely helped me. I just try to make sure SOMEONE in my house is looking when I’m eating so I can use it as my alibi lol. ",False,False

My sister and I don't live together but she's now trying to lose weight. I've lost about 40 pounds and found out yesterday through a friend that my sister thinks I have an unhealthy relationship with food.  Which to give her a little credit, she's not wrong.  But suddenly I'm being told I don't have enough meat on my sandwich (which I was only eating to placate her) and how dare I try to be the thinnest in the room by shoving cookies at everyone on Christmas (I was being a good host and getting cookies my guests asked for!).  If you figure out what to do, please share with the class cuz my next option might be murder.",False,False

I think you should explain how you're feeling w/o mentioning your ed, just taht it really stresses you out and makes you uncomfortable. Tell her that she has to find what works for her because of different heights and metabolism ect ect. I'm not sure if you're trying to lose weigth or if you've just lost because you've stopped binge eating, but you could tell her that you're not dieting, you've just exchanged some unhealthy habits for some healthier ones.",False,False

It sounds like she's jealous of your weight loss and thinks the best way to replicate your results is to replicate your diet. For obvious reasons I think this is a bad situation for both of you, for you because of the self consciousness that her watching you implies and for her copying eating disorder behavior. I think the best way for you to help her is by giving her sincere diet advice. Explain to her she can't just watch how you eat for the rest of her life to have a sustainable weight loss, that she'll gain the weight back as soon as she stops imitating you, and introduce her to r/loseit or a calorie counting app. Show her how to calculate her TDEE and explain to her that because you are shorter than she is you need to eat less than she does to lose the same amount of weight. I feel your frustration, my boyfriend who's already more slender and attractive than I am knows about my weight loss and is attempting to lose 3 pounds because he's jealous of how much I've lost.   Honestly though it feels like this would drive me crazy. Out of spite I'd start telling her things like eat a huge spoonful of peanut butter every day to boost your metabolism. Bitch just can't let you have your moment, I mean come on. ",False,False
