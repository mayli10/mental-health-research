I don't drink them as frequently as I used to though because drinking them on an empty stomach really fucked me up.   My grocery store finally got the keto coffee flavors and I assumed they were 0 cal too but they're not. Which is ok I guess. I had a sip of my boyfriend's before realizing that and they taste awful.   Currently I've been drinking tea because all the carbonated drinks have been bloating me,False,False
