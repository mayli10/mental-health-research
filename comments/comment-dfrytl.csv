A lot of what you've said here really, really hits home for me &amp; i feel like you've given me a lot to think about.  Sorry, on mobile &amp; not sure how to indent quotes,  but the part where you said: ""I was cold, dizzy, paranoid, and miserable. I was also isolating myself and pushing my partner away. He didn't know what was going on; and the worst thing is that he had started blaming himself and thinking I was mad at him, that he was a bad partner."" is literally EXACTLY what is going on with me right now.  And your last sentence hit hard.  Thank you so much for taking the time to share -- it's appreciated. I hope youre having a great day!!!",False,True

I'm in my early 20's, engaged, and in self-initiated recovery for my ED. I'll go ahead and toss out the likelihood (read: self-Dxing here) that I have restrictive anorexia, depression, anxiety, and OCD.  A lot of what you said here sounds very relevant! My fianc√© is a dream I don't ever want to wake up from. I love him to the moon and back- and he's the reason I came out about my ED and have started recovery (I'm about 3 weeks in now?).  What pushed me to come clean about my ED and start recovery? Well, I could see myself spiraling, getting sicker and sicker, and I could also see that I was causing strain in my relationship. I was paranoid about my food habits, constantly leaving the apartment to exercise, trying to schedule and hide my 20-hour fasts so he wouldn't notice, eating small portions of the dinners he cooked (and looking over his shoulder while he cooked, and having silent breakdowns over things he'd cooked in a lot of olive oil), and letting my low-blood sugar make me bitchy and prone to lashing out.  I was cold, dizzy, paranoid, and miserable. I was also isolating myself and pushing my partner away. He didn't know what was going on; and the worst thing is that he had started blaming himself and thinking I was mad at him, that he was a bad partner.  That was my breaking point- I decided that even if I was content hurting myself, even if I was perfectly fine with letting my eating disorder ruin my life and self-esteem.....I draw the line at hurting my partner with it. I was absolutely not going to let anorexia choke me out of the one good thing I have going for me. So I told him, and with his love and support, I've started recovering.  An eating disorder is a bitch. It'll tempt you with happiness just out of reach, a moving goalpost that's always just a little further away, and twisted logic that's too foggy to see through. It'll make you ruin your physical health, shatter your mental health, lie to everyone you know, and still manage to justify it as ""I just need to reach this goal, and then it'll all be better. Then I'll be happy. Then I'll be loveable.""  You, your partner, and your relationship are intertwined- punishing yourself by proxy punishes your relationship and your partner. Taking care of your body and your mental health nurtures your relationship and benefits your partner. If you can't view recovery as something you deserve, view it as something your partner deserves.",False,False
