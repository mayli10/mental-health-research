Theyre guys so ofc I hear locker room talk about hot babes they saw or banged so,False,False

I am a bit more masculine than most girls tho so idk. I don't really think it has anything to do with my ed. ,False,False

I have issues with my Mom and I feel that is the true reason I struggle making friendships with women. But I assume many people with ED's have issues with parents and that's why.,False,False

I developed a lot of traditionally boyish behaviors and interests so it's carried over into adulthood. I don't think it has anything to do with my eating disorder though. It actually helps in some ways tbh. Like, guys just have a way more relaxed attitude about food. If you go out with a group of girls (in my experience) at least one of them will talk about how *baaaaad* it is to be eating a hamburger and a shake, where guys are just like ""fuck yeah meat"" ",False,False
