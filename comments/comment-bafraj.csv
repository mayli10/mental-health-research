People kept asking me “what's your secret?” or “where does all that food go to?”   And it makes me so guilty actually it's what I've been struggling with at the moment... I hate people commenting on my body and I want them to love themselves but then I'll just be a hypocrite.,False,False

She would make a lot of food, and I wouldn't eat any so a lot of leftovers. She would ended up eating all.  I felt and still feel so guilty!",False,False

She projected a lot of that onto me. I'm restricting right now and I feel like I'm a major trigger for her and my siblings. The other night she made a big dinner for my dad and my sister but refused to eat it herself and just had something small, probably because I wasn't eating. I have a complicated relationship with my guilt about that, because I feel strongly that she's responsible for my eating disorder. It's hard. Try not to beat yourself up x",False,False
