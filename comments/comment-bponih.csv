But perhaps tell your mom to warn him not to make those comments? Or tell him to stop if he brings it up again. Does he know that he is triggering you? Some people have no tact and would comment and poke fun without actually realising how much damage they are causing or they even think they are helping you. My family are the same - even tho I am losing weight and going to the gym the comments still remain. A few months back I saw some relatives and the first thing they said was that I had gained weight and I don't think they meant to be rude, so just either talk with your mom or talk with your stepdad and if that doesn't work.. just avoid him.",False,False
