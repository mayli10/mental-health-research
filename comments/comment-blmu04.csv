Thinking of someone with 40 years of BED under their belt really puts things into perspective. I’ll definitely look into therapy and pills, honestly anything that will help me I’m up to try. I found what you wrote about the two categories of BED really interesting, I had never heard of it. Do you have any websites/references I could look into for more information? I tried googling it but couldn’t come up with anything. I would really appreciate it :). Thank you so much for your comment. It means a lot to have others with my condition share their experiences, I never get to hear them.",False,True

I can totally relate to the synapses being engrained in your head part. I actually told my psychiatrist that, but he said it's not too late for me/us to turn it around, and that he has people coming to him that start bingeing at that age but don't seek help for it until they're in their 40's or 50's. Imagine having 40 years of BED under your belt. Yeah, those pathways would be almost fucking concrete.  But even for them, it's not too late, so it's definitely not too late for us.   There's a theory that BED comes in two flavors: a diet-first or binge-first category. The diet-first group has an average age of onset in their mid 20's. They usually respond well to treatment. On the other hand, the binge-first group has an average age of onset between the ages of 11-13. The prognosis for us is not so good. Don't get me wrong, it's possible. But, we're a lot more resistant to therapy. It's split about 60/40, with the binge-first group composing 40% of people with BED.  My subjective, personal advice? Vyvanse helps. Vyvanse helps a lot. I was completely resistant to treatments until I got on meds. I still am resistant, but not as completely as I used to be.",False,False

I honestly didn’t know that intuitive eating might not be the best for me. I’ll definitely make a point to ask that question. I’m sorry that you struggle with your ED. I hope you find healing. Because I was forced to play sports, I do exercise. It’s a part of my life and is separate from my disorder (in my case, I know a lot of people have issues with exercise as well). But maybe walks out in parks might help me calm down/ provide some peace. Your post was helpful and inspiring, hope you’re recovering well from your surgery friend",False,True

Many people here have AN or BN, but BED is also represented here. Hopefully as time goes on, you will get more comments from others with BED.  Until then, know that there is hope. I watch supersize vs superskinny sometimes, and a lot of the ""supersizers "" seem to have BED, but with the right support they change their lifestyle to be healthier.   I would seek a therapist who specializes in eating disorders. If you find one, when you call, ask if they have equal abilities for restrictive disorders as with BED- treatment of the two tend to be different, because intuitive eating is not a good idea for BED- I have some form of bulimia, and intuitive eating doesnt work for me- my hunger cues are fucked up and because I can eat 4000 calories but throw some up, my body will register 4000 calories as, say, 1000, meaning with an actual 1000 calories i can still be mentally incredibly hungry. Not to say it can't work, but it's not something that would work right away.  I'm not a doctor, i dont know how much you weigh or your physical abilities, but perhaps some gentle exercise- a walk, or if you have a house and a yard, try gardening, etc- nothing too strenuous, just think of it as a way to enjoy nature. I would just be cautious with it, so you don't develop exercise purging.  Anyways, as you'll see from my post history I very recently had my wisdom teeth out. I think the hydrocodone is kicking in, so if any of my message doesn't make sense, feel free to DM me. Good luck, I hope you get some support from people who have experienced BED, and not just bulimia like me, because even though they both involve binging, they are very different",False,False
