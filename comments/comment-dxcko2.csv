I also have type two diabetes, no doubt brought on by years of binging and restricting. So the other day, I had to give a presentation in class and I hadnâ€™t eaten all day so I knew my blood sugar was super low, I could feel it coming on and I still couldnâ€™t force myself to eat because I was in the criminal justice building and thereâ€™s constantly students around. I got up to give my presentation, and I started talking and I swear to God I feel like I had an arrhythmia or something but I almost fainted twice ðŸ˜°",False,False

So I just give up on trying to eat.  Also for some reason my past two boyfriends have actually been pretty nervous eaters, like they're uncomfortable eating in front of people. I really want to know what I can do to help make my current boyfriend more comfortable with eating in front of me?",False,False
