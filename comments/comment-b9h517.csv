It especially sucks when it’s 80+ degrees outside and I’m wearing a sweater to work :/ I brought a heater and a blanket but some days it’s not enough. And yes I totally feel you on the regular weight (or overweight in my case) but freezing thanks to fasting. It’s a bummer. If I was skinny it would feel validating. ,False,True

Guess because the excess heat causes sweat buildup, whereas you can usually cover up with a sweater in terms of the opposite end of the temperature spectrum.   God, isn't it just *the worst* when you're constantly cold from continuous restriction and fasting but lacking the validation of being thin enough to warrant it? I'm a normal weight and it totally messes with my head! Also, you could probably bring a heating pad with you to work next time to help warm the especially cold areas, like hands and feet.
