Comorbid MI represent - my bipolar also gets triggered by my ED and vise versa.",False,False

From personal experience my schizophrenia 'flares' up when I am deep into my ed.   Also keep in mind I'm not saying you are schizophrenic at all! I just recommend you look into a therapist if you aren't already seeing one as these sound more so like mental illness by a triggered 'event' (ie restriction)  Stay safe. Please get help if you can.

If its impacting your life and its possible, you should probably try and find a therapist-it definitely sounds like something else is going on.  If you dont mind my asking, what age range are you in? Sometimes symptoms of mental illness won't emerge until late teens/early adulthood, so it could be something along those lines.",False,False

Always safer to make sure it's not that.,False,False
