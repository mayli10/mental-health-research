I'm not saying its okay to hurt yourself or anything like that, but if you feel guilty, let yourself feel it. If you feel sad and angry or everything between, feel it all. You don't have to constantly fight these feelings. Allow yourself to feel the shit out of them.  Why do I say this? Well, one day you will wake up and realize that you are sick and tired of feeling like shit after all the time you've allowed yourself to. You will reach the reflection phase and realize how ridiculous you've been and will feel more willing to make improvements on yourself until you can actually start enjoying life again.  It will be a tough fight, but you will recover from this. It takes time.",False,False
