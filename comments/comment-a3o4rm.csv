I'm literally a pound heavier than my lowest adult weight rn. When I was at that weight, I wouldn't say I was satisfied with my body, exactly, but I think I had a somewhat accurate view of it knew I wasn't fat. But all i could think about today was how fat I felt in my new pants. ",False,False

Had idolised 113 from when I got there before and felt somewhat small finally. Back here again and I’ve never felt bigger. I seriously think my scale is broken, I just have no idea what I look like.   It’s infuriating ",False,False

I'm 7.4lbs from my lw of 7 years ago and yet I feel fatter than ever. Yesterday I saw myself in the mirror and was like ""OK, I'm technically not fat"" but it was fleeting. (BMI is 22.2). I can't even imagine how I'll look when I'm thinner than before. Like my brain cannot conceive it. And when I go on progress pics, I literally feel like I look like people shorter than me with 40+lbs on me. ",False,False
