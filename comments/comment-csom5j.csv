I’m not too worried about anyone making me do anything, because I know that it’s all going to me on my own time and I don’t know if I’m ready to truly start recovery, but I know this first step could be good. I do know a bit about harm reduction, I do take harm reduction steps with the purging, but besides that I have stuff for that, like salt for electrolytes but I’ve never had too much of a bother to really go through with that. Thanks again, I really hope this will be good, and good luck with your recovery, I know it’s hard but it’s so worth it in the end, even if it it’s hard to see that, I’m still working on that thought myself",False,True

They might suggest care but it's on you to do anything with that. If they make you uncomfortable you can get another provider. At the end of the day, they just want to help you. My providers were VERY supportive, said nothing about weight, and simply diagnosed me and helped me find resources for specific care.  If you're open to it, it might be worth looking into harm reduction while you wait for help. I can suggest some things but there's also posts on the sub.  Being diagnosed really helped me and I'm finally seeking treatment. I'm 24 - I'd kill to have some of my years back from this bullshit.",False,False
