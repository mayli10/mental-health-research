It's arty and farty (not my joke, stolen from an amazon review). It's also La and not Le like I had assumed because I am not, Le French.   Basically four bored businessmen decide to eat themselves to death over a weekend. They just eat and eat and eat.  It's an attack on bourgeoisie and the consumerist nature of just inhaling all this junk with no concern to what the end may be. Apparently it's great cinema but it relies too much on fart humour in my opinion but I guess it has its place in it.   If you're into movies that attack the nature of humanity then I'd give it a go, I did genuinely enjoy it but it definitely did its job on turning the gorge fest from something almost pornographic - especially to the mind of someone who may be addicted to food - to an act of genuine grotesqueness.
