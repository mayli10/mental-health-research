Even medically monitored very low calorie diets are usually 800 calories or more, and there’s a lot of oversight and the foods are specifically formulated to provide adequate nutrition.",False,False

Like I can't stop thinking about it now. Some people do 500 calorie diets without having an ED and I am genuinely obese and need to lose weight...so it's like, I'm eating 500 like some normal people do to lose weight? Why is that so bad? Then I panic because it isn't bad and is normal so maybe I'm not doing enough to lose weight?  Lmao sorry I am kind of unloading on you here.",False,True
