I realized I couldn't finish it! My stomach physically hurt.... it was really easy to stick to my limit after that. I think it might have just been a problem with 'eyes bigger than your stomach' or whatever and it just took a while for my mind to catch up.   Anyway.. worked for me if you want to give it a shot!,False,False

After the first week I enter a much more peaceful state, things flow a lot more easily and the anxious urgency and good obsession recedes.   Also when I restrict this low I keep my intake to an OMAD which I find a thousand times more satisfying that nibbling on shit all day.",False,False
