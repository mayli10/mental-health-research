It was so weird. It was like I’d “go” anorexic and then get bored and be able to stop. It’s not like i was trying to be anorexic but i just wanted to be like the pretty girls you know, finally lose some weight bc i’ve never been able to. The frequency has been increasing and it is harder to stop now.",False,True
