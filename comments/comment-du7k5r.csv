My mom is exactly the same way an d whenever I mention that I could help her eat well but a bit more calorie dense she freaks out. She’ll tell me idk what I’m talking about so when I bake, I always give her some sugary cookies and she accepts. I cook a lot because I love it and I use extra oil for her. If there’s ways you can sneak in food, might be good",False,False

You have to say something, sit her down in a quite place where both of you are in a good mood to discuss (not argue) this issue.  Say “hey listen, i need to talk to you about something, i noticed you’ve not been eating lately” (she’ll start denying and being defensive) “look, i know there’s something wrong, your behaviours are disordered, i know that because i’m going through it too, i’m worried you’d wither away or worse, i love you, i don’t want you to suffer”   You can start suggesting you both go through professional treatment instead of McGayvering it, you don’t need to be “sick enough” it’s a mental illness and disorder, you need to fit into a mold to get treatment.   Obviously, you can’t change anyone to become better or taking care of themselves, **they** need to make that decision, they need to have that desire to truly recover, not out of guilt, because guilt can be only so temporary.   What you can do is support and show your feelings to her, love and a caring support system is a real good booster to help people make that decision to recover :) i hope you two make it through.",False,False

I feel like my mom became disordered too as she eats the same amount as a 9 year old!! It’s awful and triggering, and sorry but I don’t know how to prevent your mother from losing any more weight. :(",False,False
