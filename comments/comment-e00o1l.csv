I find that laxatives fuck up your bodies electrolytes way more than any puking could ever do. For me at least... I used to take like 20 - 30 pills of laxatives at a time on near a near empty stomach and I would literally have seizures at the toilet and semi pass out/faint. Laxatives are the devil. I remember the day after taking them I would literally have a 'hangover' ...I would spend the entire day feeling incredibly WEAK. Ever since I stopped taking laxatives my life has been so much better. I would never wish that on anyone.,False,False
