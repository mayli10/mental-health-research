I was in inpatient for a month until I lost my shit and got kicked out for not complying ‚Äî they tried to force a feeding tube and I was like, done. It remains a rly traumatic experience, and I often reflect on how my roommate influenced me ‚Äî she had been to IP twice and taught me all these tricks for having a better eating disorder. It was like she couldn‚Äôt help it. I still fight to shake off all the bad things I learned there. Idk man, I hope that you can find support in your friend group there and stick w the people who are good influences. Looking back, I got sucked into a bad crowd of people who had been back time and time again with no success and it messed me up on a level that I can barely put into words. The end. Find the good ones!!",False,False
