There's nothing like that feeling of guilt when you're supposed to be on top of the world and instead you want to crawl in a hole.  I wish I had some Yoda-like advice for you, but I'll just say that I experienced something similar and YES it sucks.  If people say ""but why u sad you're having an expppppuuuurience eat pray love isn't it great"" just nod and smile -- they don't get it, it's okay.  If you have to cut the trip short or change it, then fuck it all, do it.  The importance of your well-being (physical AND emotional) \*completely\* eclipses anything ANY other human thinks you ""should"" be doing or feeling.    FWIW, I'm 43 with postgrad degrees and children and a semi-career and I swear ~~many~~ most days I wonder if/when I will ever feel/act like an adult.  But on the clearer days I see that there is no such thing.  It is what it is.  I'm alive, *cogito ergo sum* and all that shiz.  So, listen to what you are REALLY feeling and not what you feel you should be feeling.  (Now that was reasonably Yoda, right???)  If that means changing your plans or your companions or your timetable, so be it. Sending you good vibes.",False,False
