I think its also some form of OCD in food since I dont generally starve myself so much and meet my daily caloric needs but my eating patterns arent normal and whenever I eat something that isnt safe or clean it drives me crazy all day and makes me think how can I cancel it out,False,False

I don't think my ED would've developed if it wasn't for being bullied abt my weight, so in that regard, no. However, I've still struggled with ED thoughts and behaviours even when I haven't really been focusing on my weight, so I think they would persist even if the weight loss aspect suddenly went away.",False,False

I definitely do it more for the feeling of “success” via measurable results/numbers too (I had minimal issues with my body when my disordered tendencies first emerged, but I did have terrible self esteem as a whole) but like. The number on the scale and weight loss overall matters a lot to me and was a primary motivating factor for whatever dumb reason. however I don’t have regular access to a scale now and I still struggle with restricting, use obsessive meal planning/reading abt EDs and food and nutrition and weight loss etc as a coping mechanism and all of that, so like...I guess yeah I’d be in a similar position.

I don't like feeling hungry and having to stop and eat all the time. When I restrict I have mental hunger but that's it. I also hate spending money on food that to me is unnecessary. ,False,False

I've thought about it a lot. I don't mind my weight right now, I don't want to lose too much that I'm pretty much dying again, but I hate having to eat so much to maintain it.
