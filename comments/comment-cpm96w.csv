I at the very least always weigh bread on the occasions I eat it because the true weight of slices is usually WAY off from what the package estimates.  I hadn't thought about weighing, say, a protein or chocolate bar. I thought they were uniform enough that they would be the same each time but I guess not? For sanity's sake I want to say I won't do that (I tend to irrationally put my faith in packaging labels LOL) but...",False,False

(I've measured all the cups and bowls so I don't have to obviously measure my food). So I have one (oops) but I don't use it, ever, so I won't feel the need to (from habit) when I CAN'T.

I dont weight my Uncrustables, but I do weigh things even if I'm going to eat the entire package. Amy's soups actually have LESS calories than listed, but things like ""7 chips"" I never trust, it's getting weighed.  That said I eat out and dont weigh things but from weighing I can better estimate how much of something I'm eating visually",False,False
