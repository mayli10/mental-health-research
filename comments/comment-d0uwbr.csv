They may not all be correct; telling someone ""you *do* have anorexia! Ignore BMI!"" isn't the right phrasing, but not everyone has the research/words to say what would be correct, such as ""hey, I know it's frustrating that your doctor didn't classify you as anorexic due to your BMI. It's entirely possible you have atypical anorexia instead of EDNOS or something else. Just because you're not underweight doesn't mean you're not sick. You deserve access to treatment!""  *\[shakes out wrist cramp\]* so yeah, that's most of the info I have on this topic! I hope that helps!",False,False
ezlfigh,t3_d0uwbr,t1_ezkgl3d,TheAllMightiest,1,2019-09-08 15:54:17,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/d0uwbr/tw_what_is_the_mindset/ezlfigh/,"Taken from [here](https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/learn/by-eating-disorder/anorexia):  &gt;To be diagnosed with anorexia nervosa according to the DSM-5, the following criteria must be met:   &gt;   &gt;\- Restriction of energy intake relative to requirements leading to a significantly low body weight in the context of age, sex, developmental trajectory, and physical health.   &gt;   &gt;\- Intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, even though underweight.   &gt;   &gt;\- Disturbance in the way in which one's body weight or shape is experienced, undue influence of body weight or shape on self-evaluation, or denial of the seriousness of the current low body weight.   &gt;   &gt;Even if all the DSM-5 criteria for anorexia are not met, a serious eating disorder can still be present. Atypical anorexia includes those individuals who meet the criteria for anorexia but who are not underweight despite significant weight loss. Research studies have not found a difference in the medical and psychological impacts of anorexia and atypical anorexia.  In my personal speculation (I do not have solid proof to back this up, so take heed that this is all my assumptions and opinions), what probably happens in the medical community is that certain doctors and therapists will only classify their underweight BMI patients as having anorexia, despite the person having what could be classed as atypical anorexia. A lot of anorexia recovery programs have limited space, limited resources, and not a lot of time to deal 1:1 with patients; so I figure there's a fair amount of gatekeeping upfront to ensure that very, very dangerously sick patients get the access they need. Which is great, except it fucks over literally everyone else.  So, if someone with an ED is (incorrectly) told ""hey, you don't have anorexia"" instead of ""you don't have an underweight BMI but you are anorexic, you're just atypical anorexic and not classic anorexic"", that's where you get the people that are upset about their diagnosis. It also does unfortunately push those who may just barely be in a ""normal"" BMI range, like myself, to strive for that underweight BMI just so we know that if we reach out we can actually access help. I also can't speak to health insurance and if/how access is limited but I can only imagine it's harder to get insurance to cover an anorexia recovery program with a normal BMI.",False,False

I often read people getting upset about their diagnosis and others responding like “oh no! Ignore BMI - you totally have AN. Don’t listen to people who say otherwise just because you’re “normal” weight” but that’s just objectively wrong.  If the concern is mainly about difficulty getting help and reaching recovery, then it’s more understandable than those who want to be considered anorexic because it’s “sicker”",False,True

People don’t give them the help and care as much as somebody visibly sick, but it’s all dangerous. Of course, the goal aspect is also sort of twisted. But I do agree that it’s just as bad to have EDNOS, etc, but it’s simply not treated on the same level as AN. I’m AN and met the criteria before treatment myself, so I’m not just saying it because I want to be ‘sicker.’ AN should never be glorified like it is but the diagnostic criteria kind of lends itself to that exactly.",False,False

In many cases, I think it's less about the diagnosis they receive and more about the fact that there's so much gatekeeping in the ED recovery realm that help is only available to the people who are severely underweight and physically in danger of organ failure. That's not to say the diagnosis label isn't important either- I assume not getting officially diagnosed with a ""classic"" eating disorder makes it more difficult to get access to help.",False,False
