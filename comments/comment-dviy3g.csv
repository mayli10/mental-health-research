My mom was quite health focused when I was a child but calories were never really mentioned. I remember thinking Hamburger Helper meals were some crazy junk food and I loved eating dinner at friend’s homes because they had “good stuff”. My moms cooking was objectively great but not having junk food made it more appealing.   Also interestingly my dad loved to eat out and he has always been overweight so there was a constant struggle between healthy eating and junk food, and me and my dad would get treats together when hanging out. I think now I have some trouble with portion control over junk food because when I was younger it was a rarity and you had to enjoy it while you had the chance.   I don’t think my eating disorder is completely based on this but I think part of why I restrict now as a way to avoid feeling bad about eating “bad foods”.

She never officially put me on a diet, but she would always comment about things like how my thighs were the biggest in the class, or when I was sick how good I looked because I lost weight, or when I gained even a kg (probably water weight) she would comment how much fatter I looked.  I remember this one time where I was hungry and going to eat a snack (because that's what normal people do....), and she was like ""you shouldn't eat right now.  Too many calories"".  She would never say these things in front of my dad because he probably would've shut her down, but whenever he wasn't around, these comments would happen.    Cut to May/June-ish when my parents found out about my ED.  She has stopped making comments about me and my eating, but still makes comments about other people and herself to me.  She says things like ""she's skinny"", or ""I had too many calories yesterday so I'm skipping breakfast"", or ""Is that woman fatter or the same as me?"".  These things trigger me so much, but I'm afraid to say anything about it.  Instead, I just end the conversation when she says things like this, but she hasn't gotten the hint.  I doubt she will at this point.  She is also always trying to lose weight, and makes it obvious, which is also super triggering towards me.

And my mom, who had her own weight issues, would bounce wildly between wanting to spoil me rotten (literally) with all kinds of fattening junk foods as comfort/love, so I associated them with comfort, but also shaming me for wanting to eat slightly unhealthy foods or eating higher portions or daring to ask for specific foods instead of just waiting for her to surprise me with them, so I also associated them with being forbidden/something I had to gorge on when I had the opportunity.  It's fucked lol. I have so much anxiety about signing up for any kind of fitness activity now thanks to my dad and it was SO hard to start dieting because my concept of portion sizes were so messed up, and it was (still is) almost impossible to unlearn my association with comfort/stress eating and the almost intoxicating ""I'm getting away with something, I'm in control, nobody gets to take this junk food away from me"" attitudes my mother instilled in me, though at least she had good intentions.
