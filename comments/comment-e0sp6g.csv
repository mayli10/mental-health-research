Sheâ€™s always been pretty fit and did a lot of sports when we grew up, so I donâ€™t think she was ever insecure about her body (or at least only occasionally, the way p much everyone is at one point or another) and doesnâ€™t really get why a comment like that is rude. But youâ€™re right, a lot of whatâ€™s actually bugging me is the fact that she couldnâ€™t even own up to it and just apologize when I was clearly taking it poorly.",False,True

I can't imagine having to bring others down to feel better about yourself AND not having the balls to actually take responsibility for what you said and what you meant.,False,False
