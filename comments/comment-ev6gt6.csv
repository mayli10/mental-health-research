Right now I'm doing ""Intermittent fasting"" (which I am, but really OMAD among many other restrictions) and he gets annoyed with me for not making breakfast with him anymore but I work on Sundays now and on Saturdays I sleep in and then go to a coffee shop to do homework so he doesn't see that I'm not eating. He knows I do a 24 hour fast ""once a week"" as well but I'm also crazy and have gotten Botox at 25 years old and lip fillers so I don't think this phases him.",False,False
