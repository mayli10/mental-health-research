Please take care of yourself. If you're not seeing someone right now, I suggest looking at your employees fmla benefits.

I can relate to this because 3 years ago I rescued a kitten and I worked so hard for months on getting him healthy.  Spent a couple thousand dollars at the vet and then he up and died in the middle of the night.  I completely derailed after that.  Compulsive overeating, depression through the roof, and a whole bunch of negativity.    i ballooned myself up 50 pounds.  It seriously took me like 2 1/2 years to get out of that cycle.  All over a cat that I barely knew, but I loved him.  Please take care of yourself, there‚Äôs probably nothing you could have done for her since she was so young.  It was probably something that there weren‚Äôt any visible signs for.",False,False

In times of pets passing, the only helpful thing I‚Äôve found is to acknowledge the reasons you were a loving home and pet parent and know how lucky you both were to have each other in your lives.... plus a cat brother, in this case. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è sending good juju your way",False,False

What helps me is knowing I gave them the best life possible and made sure the time they were given was enjoyed to the fullest because shit, isn't that what we want for ourselves?
