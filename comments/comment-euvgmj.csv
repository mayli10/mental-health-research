Have you considered breakfast and dinner instead of a warrior diet?",False,False

Iâ€™m going to sleep so if my writing was hard to understand, thatâ€™s why lol. And by the way, donâ€™t be afraid of slightly overeating when you eat fewer meals, Iâ€™ve noticed that I can eat so much more per day without it being an excess (hormones respond differently).",False,False

Iâ€™m also proud of you and happy its been helpful! And I feel the same as far as being satisfied Iâ€™ve been really trying to make sure I donâ€™t penalize myself for feeling adeptly full which for me is a half of a beet sandwich and 16oz coffee. It was so gratifying to even finish that so Iâ€™m slowly getting there but I see steps that Iâ€™m trying to take to help my mind accept that itâ€™s okay not to always feel hunger...,False,True

Trying to do intermittent fasting of any sort while eating normal carbs is a nightmare.",False,False

I recovered by it and I still only eat 1-2 meals per day and itâ€™s perfectly healthy because of my positive mindset. It might be tough, but Iâ€™ve learned that limiting my carb intake helps me feel satisfied all day (everyone is different)  Eating less often is really great. I feel the best when I do that. Anyways, Iâ€™m proud of you!",False,False
