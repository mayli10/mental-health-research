I miss being in a relationship so much. It's been years since I've been able to date or have intimacy with anyone. I'm too afraid and too far gone in my ED to let anyone in. I'm in my mid-20s and some of my friends are in long-term relationships or getting married. I'm afraid of getting to my 30s and being completely alone. I see movie previews or read stories or even see dumb fan art or literally anything having to do with a relationship and I'm like wahhhhhh I want that :'( but I can't have it,False,False

It's normal to want that kind of thing, especially when you feel so far from it. I grew up feeling what you describe. I was so lonely and thought I would die a kissless virgin. Things luckily went differently for me, which happened to coincide with my self esteem getting better.  Idk I'm bad with words. I have read your post and want to send you love. ‚ù§Ô∏è  To close I have an excerpt from a Lorde song:  &gt; I guess I'll go home into the arms of the girl that I love The only love I haven't screwed up She's so hard to please but she's a forest fire I do my best to meet her demands, play at romance We slow dance in the living room, but all that a stranger would see Is one girl swaying alone, stroking her cheek",False,False
