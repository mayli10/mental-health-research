When he returns to civilization, there's a scene where he wanders around the grocery store in awe of all the food and the options. Pretty fucking relatable :/",False,False

Honestly I’m just no longer ashamed of admitting the nasty parts of my eating disorder anymore. It’s kind of an exercise in honesty cause all I got left is to be real with myself and others. It just destroys me that so many people can relate.,False,True

It sucks ): hope you’re fighting,False,True

You could write a memoir and I would read it.   Things like that, it's like some sort of fucked-up cosmic irony, isn't it? It just comes back around. Nothing pretty about ED at all.",False,False
