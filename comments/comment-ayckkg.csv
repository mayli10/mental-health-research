On the Ellen show Taylor mentioned how she would sleep eat. Like she wouldn't remember doing it but her body would get up in the middle of the night and just rummage through the fridge to find things to eat. Ellen commented on how that sounded like a problem and Taylor just said ""yup""",False,False

A lot). But I just keep coming back because a) I live for her music, and b) she's so smart and so, so real. It's amazing how she's been able to maintain humility and a growth mindset even at her level of fame. I relate so much to a lot of these, not just the one about body acceptance. The last one was a punch in the gut because I was the exact same as a child and I think that mindset is what's caused a lot of my eating/self-image issues.  Sidenote it's so fucked up how one of her fans who got a meet and greet complimented her on getting ""thick"" without knowing how she felt about her weight gain. That would have triggered me so much.",False,False
