Intuitive eating doesn’t exist. Biologically we are programmed to adore sugars and fats, after thousands of years of just surviving, where a tiny amount of this is the difference between life and death.",False,False

How can I take that seriously when no one recognizes what a healthy weight is? Almost 3/4 of Americans are overweight or obese, and dieters are often warned ""not to lose too much more weight"" when they aren't even down to a healthy BMI yet. I feel like I don't actually look concerning thin except by contrast to the average, even though there's an objective measure for determining a healthy weight, and I am under it. Real A+ logic, saying everyone else is being subjectively wrong while I am objectively wrong.",False,False

But I do think that many people don’t hold food to the standard that makes it get in the way of their everyday lives, but I think that people do have subtle disordered eating habits",False,False

We’re socialized to be neurotic about food. Many men arebeing impacted too. It’s in the best interests of capitalist institutions to have people hate themselves.,False,False

To me, dieting without severely restricting calories and aiming for a weight that’s in the healthy weight range is normal, though. And I also think just eating to satiety and just occasionally overeating like on holidays or celebrations is normal. A lot of people do maintain their weights that way.",False,False
