It’s gonna be the primary thing I eat because it’s a safe food :( you could try that too if it’ll make you feel safe and less stressed!,False,False

I always get such sus looks from my family when i drink diet soda but its worth it to have something to fill up on. And ill be taking another users advice of bringing a dish of veggies just seasoned with no oil or butter or cheese. So i can have something to pile on my plate and stick out for not eating. No one in my family knows about my ed and thanksgiving really isnt the time to talk to them about it,False,True

My flight leaves tomorrow morning and im pretty sure ill be taking it. Im gonna take your advice to make my own veggie option to bring so i can make the majority of my plate vegetables without family losing it over portions. And im going to take another kind users advice to bring my own diet soda. I really want to see my family i just wish i had no obligation to eat,False,True

My house is stocked with a variety of diet drinks and I had been avoiding everything but water or artificially sweetened tea at events at other people’s houses until my boyfriend suggested I just bring a case of diet soda along. It had never occurred to me to just bring my own soda and it kept me from worrying about what would be available once I got to an event.",False,False

Speaking from the other side of that (well somewhat), it really hurts me in the gut that your ed is asking you to sacrifice so much. You haven't seen your family in so long, it's so unfair that your illness is pushing you to forgo being around them. Is there any way that you can find a compromise, like offering to help with the cooking (added brownie points for helping) and that way you'll know that certain side dishes have x amount of calories, fat, etc. Maybe you could make a veggie option instead of meat so you're in charge of how that's made too, if they haven't seen you in so long it's quite plausible that you've chosen to go down a veggie route. Or excuse yourself from alcohol because 'you're on antibiotics'.  I don't mean any of that to come across like I'm giving tips, I'm just trying to see if there's a way that you can make the day feel more safe for you whilst still getting to see your family because from what you've written it sounds like it'll weigh on you if you don't go. You've already done so much by restricting all with the express promise to yourself that you could have this day. Worst case scenario, you will have bloat/water weight for a few days, but one day, no matter how large, cannot change your weight in the long run. I know logic pretty much goes out the window when your ed brain is against you but if it does feel like it's getting too much come back and post here for some outside perspective.  I hope that makes sense, I know it's a shit time of year ♥️",False,False
