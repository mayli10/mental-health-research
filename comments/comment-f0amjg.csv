I honestly think this is the same idea as when healthy people make ‚Äúhealthy choices‚Äù early in the day and it helps them stay on track the rest of the day. Like the same space of our brain believes this is best for us so it rolls into the other choices we make. Even though this is in fact not healthy and not good for us. But we believe it to our core so it makes us happy and alive and motivates us to make other ‚Äúpositive‚Äù choices like being social, wearing non-house-clothes, leaving the house, getting shit done, taking our makeup off, WEARING makeup at all, etc.   All that to say, this is 100% me and I relate so fucking hard.",False,False
