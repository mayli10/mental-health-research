I do see a regular therapist, although she has been on vacation since Easter and will be for another 2 weeks. but I feel very off the rails,  I can't control this  myself and I feel the need for structure and outer control(hence why I said the inpatient would have been good for me).  It's very hard to control the b/p because it feels so automatic and like I am outside of myself when it happens.",False,True

Get a drink that has them in it and finish it, then find somewhere to lay down and try to stay calm. Your palpitations might be an electrolyte issue, but it also sounds like you might be on the verge of a panic attack.   2) Shower. You don’t have to look. I never do. Pick a spot on the wall and look at that. Play a podcast or your favourite music to distract you and keep your mind engaged with something else. You’ll feel better once you’re clean.   3) Break the cycle. Orders of magnitude easier said than done. But you can’t keep bailing on class to binge and then hating yourself enough to want to die. You’re worth more than that and if your country can’t provide the services you need to help you, then you’re gonna have to help yourself. You’re worth it, and you’re strong enough to do it. ONCE is progress. Beat the binge urge ONCE. Don’t think about it in terms of perpetuity, don’t think of it in the  context of your whole life. Just do it once. You don’t need to worry about the next time yet. Forget about it, it’s not real, it’s entirely hypothetical for now. Just focus on winning one time.   4) Talk to somebody. You say there’s no inpatient options, but does your school have medical resources you could use? Could you get an outpatient ED therapist, or a regular therapist to talk to? A school nurse, trusted adult, teacher, friend? Anybody is better than nobody.",False,False
