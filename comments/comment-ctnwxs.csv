The eye bags, but I feel like that's more a mix of shit sleep(2 kids under 5), anemia, and *casper white* skin. Heavy restrict or not, I shed hair like I'm part fucking husky. Dizzy/fainting upon standing, but I also have other health issues that contribute to that.  Idk. I think it all depends on your body. I'd definitely go with being cold more often though.
