Trust me people who eat only Twinkies at midnight can still die of starvation. I‚Äôve been in this game long enough to understand human metabolism, and the body isn‚Äôt really going to do that. Just think of it as if your body counts that as  tomorrow‚Äôs food instead of that night‚Äòs. Your body works differently than an exact clock, its not going to make one excess sum of food turn into fat. Actually, its going to basically forget all about it unless you continue to overeat. Only then it‚Äôll take the extra calories into account.  That‚Äôs my best understanding and probably closer to the truth than anything you‚Äôll find in the media About how the body reacts to extra calories. I do hope you find joy and consolation üòÅ you deserve it!",False,False

So please, eat normal and your body won‚Äôt b affected by the extra energy. It‚Äôs actually perfectly okay to consume a grand amount ever so often, just look at all the food challenge YouTubers (if that‚Äôs consoling) think of it like you just accomplished a grand feat of epic drinking and resume your norm.  I hope you feel better =]",False,False
