This post was really tough to read knowing that you are experiencing this and how much pain you are in. No one deserves to go though these things, loss is so hard, and I understand the emptiness you feel.   &amp;#x200B;  I can't imagine dealing with something so emotionally severe and then (while it is no comparison) losing this community. I cried over it, we all lost our minds, and I am glad you found this building sub. to turn to!  &amp;#x200B;  When going through loss I binged horribly for 2 weeks. Anything and everything, just like you. I am talking bags of candy. It was all a haze and I needed something to do. I can relate to how you must be feeling and just know that it is okay to allow yourself this while overcoming traumatic events. Food is comfort right now, I had to accept that. The binge period will pass and you will get back to your usual eating plans once you feel ready.   &amp;#x200B;  From the bottom of my heart you I wish I could give you a big hug! You lost so much and never have to be alone when you come here.   &amp;#x200B;  Many of us went to peach as well, idk if you have one already. It was really weird for me at first to use, but it is a nice social media that we can all use to connect. Also feel free to pm me if you need to talk to someone &lt;3",False,False

Please feel free to reach out if you ever want to vent or just need some support &lt;3,False,False

I think you are the person who has been dealing with the fall out of all this and seem to be tentatively successful in making a place for us to regroup. Thank you.   It is too much for anyone to deal with. Its been so much more then I can even articulate. One thing that is relevant to the ed side of my life is my mom had a lot of unresloved body image /weight issues too. A big thing I was reflecting on as I went through old photos was how she thought she was fat the whole time I was growing up. In very few if those photos did I see a women who remotely resembled overweight. It made me so sad. ",False,True

I was never too active and therefore it’s not as bad for me, but shit man, losing things that you really value is bloody crap. I sincerely hope you’re able to rebuild a sense of comfort and community around yourself",False,False
