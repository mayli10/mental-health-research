One of the problems I have here is that she is not even a close friend of mine, I can't just force my best friend to cut ties with her and I refuse to distance myself from my best friend just because T comes along as an add on. I have advised my best friend about how it is better not to be her friend and she assured me that they would not be close, but she also said that she could not cut her out completely(because they are part of a group and she did not want to stop being friends with the other girls because of T). So I am little lost",False,True

I had a situation like that a while ago, and her and I are no longer friends and itâ€™s helped my mental health tremendously imo",False,False
