I try to never purge or c/s and just restrict and work out because i don‚Äôt need any more bad habits but it‚Äôs just so hard because working out is what makes me fine with eating those two meals and now that i don‚Äôt i just feel like i‚Äôm getting bigger every day even though i know i‚Äôm losing weight - slowly, but still losing.   My grandfathers brother has a birthday this weekend aswell so i‚Äôm going home for that because a lot of our extended family will come to the celebration. This means 1) won‚Äôt be able to restrict because i‚Äôll be home with my dad, and 2) the celebration will be at a restaurant and i KNOW i won‚Äôt be able to enjoy to meal and just have a good time with my relatives because i‚Äôll be to caught up in not knowing how many kcals are in the food. I just feel horrible both mentally and physically and there is no one i can talk to about this.",False,False

Like, throughout the day I feel totally light and fine and in control (if slightly delirious, but that's just part of the package deal), but nighttime hunger hits different, y'know? I feel like that meme that's like ""we're going to have sleep for dinner and we're going to like it."" My stomach didn't immediately rebel against me when I finally ate something today though, even though it did the past few days so... half a win, I guess?  I hope everyone has a good one today! I'm excited for tomorrow - we're reading my favorite book in class right now, and I'm having a lot of fun discussing it. (:",False,False
