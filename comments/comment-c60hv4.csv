Once I noticed how well it works I started way over doing it for extended periods of time. I’m kinda all or nothing and I have an addictive personality. But after a while my chest started feeling weird, kind of like a bad anxiety that won’t go away. I just occasionally pop one Bronkaid now if I want relief for a while. But I’ve stopped energy drinks and have less coffee, because too much caffeine makes me feel weird now. It kinda feels like my heart is weaker now overall, I’m not sure if that’s because of the EC stack, the weight loss, the malnutrition, maybe all of them.    If you can be responsible and don’t have heart issues then it may be a decent option. Just be safe.",False,False
