Because omg last summer I went through a tummy obsession where I would take pics of my abs in the mirror. And lmao... they looked good in the mirror but bad in the picture. Omg. It all makes sense now.          You are so sweet, thank you.",False,True

I live in an apartment and this is so random but they have this lock on the lights above my mirror in the bathroom and they have to change the bulbs themselves when they go out. Like lol. What are the odds on this. I’d like to know... but I am wondering if I could just ask them like “hey man your lights suck can I have some different ones plz” lol.          Thank you so much for your kind words! Means so much.,False,True

Pros: sometimes it looks like I have great abs! Cons: sometimes it looks like I have crazy cellulite. Reality: I probably don’t have much of either.  Mirrors can get fucked and body dysmorphia sucks but validation from a s/o is always nice. Wear the heck outta that lingerie I’m sure you and your butt will look AMAZING ✨,False,False

If I look at myself in certain lighting I can see all kinds of flaws and lines and hollows that aren’t visible 99% of the time. I’m sure you’re beautiful but I know it’s hard to see that in ourselves. I also just want to say, your boyfriend seems like a sweetheart. Sounds like you guys have a supportive relationship and he loves your body just as it is is. That counts for something.",False,False
