I just started doing that too and it really helped me a lot. Staying accountable and logging my binges puts it all into perspective and I actually realise I CAN stop if I want to. I just add the calories to other days as well and simply go for runs / be more active to burn them off. I guess it’s a healthier mindset than just going on a 5 day binge spree with no end in sight right? Honestly one of the worst feelings in a binge is being out of control, so this adds a control element that makes me feel a little bit more normal.",False,False
