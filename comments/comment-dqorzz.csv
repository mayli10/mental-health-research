I’ve been off of it for about a month and I feel better. Less urges to eat, less cravings, more energy, actually interested in sex again, and better able to “handle” stressful situations. I don’t know if this all had to do with the ring or not but I’ll take it.",False,False

Did that for 1 year, switched to the arm implant, had that for five months, then was off for about 5 months. I have had no difference in appetite before birth control, during oral, during the implant, and after birth control. I’m getting back on it now and haven’t had an effect either. So I think everyone is different. :)",False,False

I’ve scoured reddit and other forums and read A LOT of experiences where people say the hormones have really messed with their bodies - causing more acne, depression, low libido and all sorts of other negative side effects that I’ve been experiencing for years.  I’ve had an on-again-off-again relationship with hormonal birth control for 21 years so I can’t really speak to whether or not it made me gain weight because honestly I can’t remember but I did reach my lowest weight during one of the times that I was off the pill.  I’m as prepared as possible (support in place) to find out if going off hormones helps with my depression, but also a little nervous that maybe the hormones were keeping me stable?  I guess we’ll find out!  What a fun game.",False,False

So i would just monitor my cycle. But right? I feel like birth control typically increases appetite and weight retention,False,True

Depending on which country you're in, they might have smaller options than the paraguard, which I wouldn't recommend unless you've had kids (it's big, causes more cramping).   I think hormonal birth control made me gain weight by increasing my appetite. But there's no real evidence for it, could just be in my head.",False,False
