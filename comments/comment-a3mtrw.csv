I've always had an old soul and was the caretaker in the family since I was 11. Now I'm 30, never had a real boyfriend, I'm in some small debt of my own making, and live in a crappy little studio apartment. Meanwhile, my friends are married, having kids, living in real homes. I still feel like that sad 11 year old that people wanted her to commit suicide.   I still pass for younger than I am but I feel 10 years older. ",False,False

Especially on the maturity front. I honestly still feel mentally/emotionally stuck at the age I was when my ED developed, like I‚Äôm somehow still stuck there. And my non-disordered peers have actually matured so much. I‚Äôve been working hard on my personal growth, learning and having new experiences in different areas, but my social skills and general demeanour haven‚Äôt changed much and it bothers me sometimes!
