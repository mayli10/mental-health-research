It’s really only helpful for people with epilepsy or insulin resistance and otherwise it’s not better than any other diet. It’s actually kind of unsustainable if you exercise at all. Plus it’s not that healthy if you eat a lot of saturated fat and cured meats,False,False

I switched from Keto awhile back to low carb plant based (I do eat eggs occasionally) My body does not agree with a high carb diet, I just feel blah &amp; get a bunch of issues (yeast infections, etc.) My view point now is that it is not healthy to eat a diet high in animal fats, or animal products for that matter.",False,False

Though I know that respecting what my body is telling me can come with a lot of emotions, so it’s very relatable to feel this way. Possibly worth noting that there are also folks that cycle on to a ketogenic diet for a few months of the year, then back to low-carb for awhile. When I’ve transitioned off keto the water weight feels yucky for a day or so and then equilibrates. I loath the water-weight rebound but reminding myself that it’s about replenishing my body with a different form of energy kinda helps...a little.",False,False
