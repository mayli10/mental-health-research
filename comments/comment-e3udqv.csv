I met lots of nice people and it was really nice to be in an environment where I didn’t have to pretend I was okay.,False,False

I think some places have on-site lodging that you can use if you live too far away). Think of it as just like being in a clinic all day.,False,False

It’s like school but for feelings. You go to a few groups, there might be a few breaks, you eat a couple meals and snacks, you meet with your therapist and dietitian at some point. Then you go home and live your life.",False,False
