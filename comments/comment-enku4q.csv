That way I'm indirectly calling that idea false but I'm not just going ""no ur not"" idk  It might help to reframe the thought as a symptom of a condition, and not an actual assessment on weight",False,False

He was a total pos but I cant take that away from him.",False,False

The issue is logically I know I'm not but I just *feel* like I'm fat. I think just letting her know you're there for her, that it isn't true, and that you care is the best you can offer.",False,False
