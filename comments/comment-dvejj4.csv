If I weigh less faster and she weighs me every other month, which I’ll ask her, I can get to my goal weight without her knowing as soon. So, if she wants to take me off Adderall, she can change it, and I’ll be at my goal weight.",False,True

But that's like if you're dieting and exercising properly  If you manage to do it in like less than 3 months, there is a high chance she will take you off as it can affect your health pretty bad. That or she might help you with dietary plans to get you to gain more weight",False,False

I was thinking about using certain things as weights when she weighs me, but that won’t help when I loose a lot of weight. I just want to get down to 120, that’s still a healthy weight. I literally get weighed every month and I want to ask if we can weigh me every other month. That way, it will be more convent for my weight loss and I will be down to my goal weight without her knowing so soon. With that, she can change my adderall to something else if she wants. (Though, I will slowly get back to eating normal, but if I gain, I’ll keep restricting)",False,True

I’ve been sticking  with this one medication and I’m loosing weight on purpose. If I loose 41 pounds in less than 4 months, is there a chance I might be taken off?
