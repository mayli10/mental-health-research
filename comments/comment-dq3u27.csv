I just had a hysterectomy and even though it was hard I stopped calorie counting the week before and during the first month...yes month (1 week left) of my recovery.   It's fuckin hard, but you only get one chance to heal correctly after something like surgery. You need nutrients and believe it or not, healthy cholesterol to heal open wounds. And any added stress on your heart and organs is super dangerous before anesthesia.  In fact if it is a big surgery, they'll do an EKG and labs a week before. If you show any cause for concern, they will cancel or postpone the surgery.  You need to do your body a huge favor and smash the pause button as best you can. You deserve to heal properly and not worry at this time.  I wish you the best of luck. Lemme know if you have questions.",False,False

I can't for sure say what risks anesthesia will have on your heart if it's weakened due to your ED, but I can tell you that you're probably going to have a hell of a time with [your bowels](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323264.php) as I know from experience that restricting can cause a lot of constipation already.",False,False

The surgeon said my body was too weak and I had to wait. It might be different if it’s urgent, but I don’t think anyone would operate on you will your bloods are of/blood pressure is low; you could have complications really easily.   I know it’s hard because you have to be weighed and then sedentary afterwards but please try and be kind to yourself x",False,False
