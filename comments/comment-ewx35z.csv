Like I still feel we should be allowed to date. There are plenty of people who struggle with mental illness and are still able to find good supportive partner. Or you can do what I'm doing lately and just sleep around with shitty guys lol,False,False

I was dating a guy who wanted to make it official after like 4 dates. He then told EVERYONE in his life about me and I met a bunch of his friends. He was so nice and loving for the first few weeks but then after he started to see the unstable side of he started becoming super emotionally distant and then dumped me in the coldest way ever (on new years day in 2 minutes on the street). Like I gave up 4 months of casual sex for that?! ðŸ¤¡,False,False

I thought she felt bad for me. Then she told me that she liked me and I was shook dude. I thought why would anyone like me and I felt bad cause I thought i was portraying a fake side of me. But I figured that maybe I just donâ€™t see my actual worth and she did.   We did date but broke up like within a month though lol,False,False
