Even through small steps by upping even 30 calories  a day or confronting fear foods please do.",False,False

And that actually did happen to me while in recovery from my restrictive phase in high school. Gained like 8-10 kg in a year. It was quite messed up. However, I am trying to kind of keep things in control by easing into a restrictive phase. I'm going to lower my weekly calorie intake by an amount that will be just enough to lose a kilo or two (since I am short, that amount of weight does make a difference haha), but still be high enough so that I don't feel deprived.   Sustainability is the key, so if you feel this is working for you, that's great. You don't sound like you're about to fall into the BED pit.",False,False
