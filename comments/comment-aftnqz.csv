I can tell this is going to be a total mess.  &gt;¬†I have an ORGANIC grapefruit  Because we all love to pay an up charge for arbitrary and often meaningless status symbol. (Although I often find thr organic bananas taste better for some reason and also the regular garlic has been sad lately. But that is just my local grocery store so not what everyone should expect...I digress)  &gt;And i ALWAYS say NO BUTTER, NO OIL...instead tell them to cook it in a light mist of Pam cooking spray.¬†  1. Pam cooking spray IS oil ya twit.  2. Who are ""they?"" When did you mention eating out for breakfast? I am not going to dictate to the cooks how to make my food. Most places around here don't even have just an eggwhite omlet choice anyway.   &gt;ad for Kashi  I actually like a lot of kashi products. However, she hates the HFC devil (which is fine, and I agree to a point and for various reasons I'm not going to get into) I wonder if she is also worried about stuff like hydrogenated oils in those types of bars. Especially palm oils. Save the orangutans!   The whole topic of lunch is a mess. Just make your own skinless chicken breast at home and bring it in with your veggies, but please never heat up fish in the microwave at work.   &gt;¬†I always order steamed veggies, no butter and no oil. if they can't steam them then tell them you want a touch of oil...stress a touch...otherwise your veggies will be swimming in a pool of oil!!!¬†  These waiters/cooks hate you.  &gt;since the fro yo is all chemicals and your body doesn't digest it properly.  **chemicals are scary!** and most ice creams are not ""real ice cream"" any way...it is actually ""frozen dairy desserts"" or some such verriant.  Ok, I couldn't make it through this. It is definitely not a very healthy way to go about your life. There is a lot of food moralizing thrown in there with a lot of pseudoscience type rhetoric. Also Kashi bars are expensive and for that reason alone I try not to eat more then 1 a day when I buy them. Eating out 2-3x a day is just not realistic for most people. ",False,False
