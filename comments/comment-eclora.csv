So like, another point is BMI gets less and less accurate on upper and lower ends of ""average"" on the height scale. Keep that in mind!   And also, I really want you to stay at a healthy weight you are happy with. I just would fucking LOVE if you could do that without your ED.",False,False

I will admit that I have well over a decade of bulimia on you, and I have no signs of health problems, not even teeth. I'm extremely lucky I guess? I, personally, am probably am worse off at higher weights. But yet, who knows what's coming for me in the future.   I'm so with you in wishing we had legit scientific data on this. It doesn't exist, and so much seems theoretical/hypothetical. I even feel that way about the teeth info now.   However, you said your teeth are shit, your energy levels and quality of life are suffering. So how is that not a problem for you? Your energy levels and quality of life suck.   I'd also like to push back a bit on your conviction that you can't maintain your weight without restriction or purging, and that your ""set point"" is significantly higher.   That does not accord with my experience at all, or actually what I think is typical of bulimics.   Also, you're 19. You have very little experience maintaining your adult weight (if any). I think it's extemeely premature to declare yourself as having any ""set point"".",False,False
