Not the way some people like to use it to mean “omission”    ***  Aww I’m sorry if it felt like a blow :(    It sounds like he was expressing concern for you in an awkward dad way—“protein” of all things srsly. I doubt he would of given that critique if he was totally unconcerned.    I think there’s a chance he was trying to build you up and not try to discourage you if he is under the impression you’re try to embrace a healthier lifestyle. They can look a lot alike to people not savvy about ED behavior.  ***  I relate to your experience a bit. My own father used to screw up and say a lot of things like that w/o knowing it would perturb me. Early on I didn’t know why it perturbed me.  It took me a while to realize and fully understand that it was beyond a sincere compliment in my case. He was actually saying it because it’s something he admired about me. Which may sound odd but he struggled to eat healthy for most of his life as did most of his side of my family .   I also just had to figure out on my own that he was one of those people who often use “healthy” to mean “health conscious” usually in context to being active or having some type of prudent eating pattern; as opposed to it referring to being fit or even having a diet that matched his idea of perfectly balanced diet.(*im convinced it’s opinion at this point lol*) Even though that’s definitely not the proper way to be using  “healthy” — but i didn’t want to police my father’s language like that   ***  I’ve had my ED for so many years, on &amp; off. What’s unfortunate is that I think A LOT of people mis-perceive as being almost *always* attributable to primarily health-conscious motives are;  •regular overly-intensely exercise    •having a longterm- or perma-diet that seems highly premeditated   •occasionally fad “cleanses”, “detoxes”, “purifying” or whatever the kids are calling them these days     •Having a dietary omission that’s of a major food, major ingredient, an entire food group or an entire food subgroups (*non-medically mandated*)   •Having several little but specific dietary restrictions (*non-medically mandated*)     *I left “restrictions” intentionally vague. It doesn’t seem to matter if there based on; food amount, food volume, certain food groups/sub groups, time of day you eat, calorie&amp;nutrient amounts and/or ratio, added sugar, just anything lol. Omitting Food groups/subgroups can have a paradoxical effect sometimes because people are exposed to different education and thus some people believe omitting a subjective “too many” or a particularly one will definitely cause a type of malnutrition*  ***  i can recall some rather humorous conversations I’ve had with my much due on my own omissions / restrictions (non-Ed) but those are stories or another day!  ***  **back to my pops*  Still those kinda comments stung a little even *after* I realized how sincere my dad was being— which I have pin pointed was probably because ***deep down*** I probably wanted him to notice I was having issues. Despite it being unfair to my parent to expect him to read my mind, expect him to expect the worst case scenario and despite me going out of my way to hide my habits I worried would look concerning lolol. What’s ironic is during my AN onset **I** didn’t even realize I had an ED. I was totally convinced I was on “**lOl totes healthy fitness &amp; health improvement JOURNEY guys!*” 😑  My ambivalent ass just used whatever bullshit excuse/info I could find to always justify losing 2 more lbs and convince myself it was healthy “*for me*” face palm.",False,False
