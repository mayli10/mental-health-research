Also they have lots of posts where someone freaks out about going 50 calories over after sticking to 1200 for months.... in what world is that normal? To never have a day above 1200 for months on end? That is not how normal people eat but they act like that is normal dieting. ,False,False

Some of them even said they subscribed to the sub for recipes but hated how we promoted our EDs. 1) maybe it’s a sign you have a problem if you’re taking food advice from a bunch of people with EDs 2) don’t visit a sub for people suffering from EDs if you don’t want to read about the thoughts/issues we have...",False,False

Anyone who spent a minute on the sub would know how supportive and helpful it was. They were probably just mad that we know that what they are doing isnt always the safest. ,False,False

A lot of commenters were just flat lying in what they claimed was posted on proED and insulting us. It’s like going on a depression sub and complaining that people are being negative downers,False,False

Obviously not everyone has the time or resources to exercise (myself included rn), so I get why this is needed for some people to lose weight, but eating more and exercising more is going to make you healthier.  And honestly, I don’t care what people look like or how they eat. Obviously I’m not the picture of health, but I hate seeing all the posters wishing they could be one of those ‘naturally skinny women who still eat junk’ when those women work out all the time. Also people who work out all the time usually don’t have the totally-not-disordered as low as possible goal weights a lot of the people on 1200ip want. They just look skinnier because they actually have muscle tone.  /end rant",False,False
