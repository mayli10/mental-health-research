If you invite some friends over to share the bounty he won't need to eat as much and you can harvest the joy of feeding two people. I used to do that all the time.,False,False

But it's not totally fair to keep him from reaching his goals because of your coping mechanism. Can you donate the food you make somehow? Or perhaps focus on making healthy meals to kill two birds with one stone?,False,False

Just swirling the oil in the pan until it ""looks right"", piling on the cheese. Makes me feel like a fuckin artist yo.  &amp;#x200B;  Cocktails are like that too because while I do like to drink and we have tons of ingredients I have trouble justifying stuff that isn't just straight gin on ice to myself, but for him I can make stuff with different syrups and reductions and shit. So fun and prettyyyyy.",False,True

It’s kinda my way to enjoy cooking without eating or wasting the ingredients, and I like that he likes my food",False,False

To me it almost feels like doing c/s or something. Like part of a binge but not the caloric part.  &amp;#x200B;  I think it gets added to because we're a het couple and he works and I don't, so there's both like the weird 50's dynamic of ""taking care of my man"" thing where of course I cook for him all the time and never eat, and also the reality that he's way bigger than me and legit NEEDS more food.",False,True

It's doing the fun part of cooking and skipping the difficulty of eating. She's always super appreciative too ahhh it really makes me feel productive and better about myself. I also see it as half a binge like you do.  Tbh tho I asked my gf if its weird I enjoy cooking for her more than for myself and she said not at all so idk maybe it's more normal than we think??",False,False
