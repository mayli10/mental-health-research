I know sometimes I use other people eating as ""permission"" to eat, and if the other person declines, I can get really anxious and can't get the food for myself even if they say that it's okay. Maybe she was fixated on getting the food but also couldn't allow herself to get it unless you gave her ""permission"" to by eating and taking some of the food, and it kind of dominated her thinking so much that she wasn't able to think about the awkward position she was putting you in, too.  It still sucks that it happened and it sucks that you had to waste food, bc I hate doing that too when people try and push food on me (but it's either that or binge on it). But maybe she was acting irrationally and not fully in control of herself that night either. Either way I hope she respects your wishes more moving forward. xo",False,False

Most cultures have food pushers. lol.   And while she may have an ED, she may express it differently than you, and maybe she used a tactic that helped her.",False,False

I totally get that maybe she thought what she was offering would be okay/comfortable for me to eat but for me at least I feel the most comfortable eating alone and later in the evening. And it’s just confusing because she has dealt with the same stuff as me but just kept pressuring me :-/   I’m glad it didn’t escalate much more than that though.,False,True

It is also quite cultural as well. Food = social. Food = family.   In many cultures it is actually rude to refuse food. I ran into that when I was in the Polynesian islands. refusing food is an insult to the one who prepared it. (and they prepare tons of food). In the US, it is not uncommon for mothers, or grandmothers to force food as a way of connection and family.   My mother in law always forces food on us to take home... and I almost always chuck it out.   It really sucks that food is *everywhere* in social situations. but you can do it. Hugs.",False,False
