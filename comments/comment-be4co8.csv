People eat lunch. So a can of tuna and some saltines later and I've triggered a binge on crackers and candy. My stomach hurts from the strange mixture of foods and insane amounts of sugar I just ate. Thank God I have to go to work cause otherwise I probably wouldn't stop eating. And I'm meeting up with a friend tonight and we're probably gonna eat some calorie laden dinner and my anxiety is going to be through the roof. Fuck this fucking disorder.   Sorry just needed some space to vent!,False,False

Been gaining weight for a few weeks now. Not much, 4 kg, but I still see it. My family and friends say that they can't see any difference on me, but I can feel it. And I feel so disgusting and fat. Starting to think about food constantly and they lead up to bad thought spirals. I hate my thighs so so much. I hate food. I just somehow need to find the strength and do something about it. Stop eating. That's what I am constantly thinking about.",False,False

I worked my ass off and haven't been getting the best sleep. Took the exam this morning and I honestly feel like I SMASHED it, especially the written portion. When I got home I felt so relieved and content with myself that I decided to say fuck it and eat some fried rice and a vegan donut. And you know what? I don't regret that shit. I deserve it for busting my ass over this test.",False,False

Cool, that won't feel like a corset on my bloated belly at all. Then I have to work on getting orders out and actually function. I'm going to bed at 7:30 pm tonight, I swear.
