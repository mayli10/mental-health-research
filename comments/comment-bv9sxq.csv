When I’m having a bad day I remind myself how amazing it is that I’m c/s free and even on my worst days I haven’t gone back to that old crutch. Never would have thought it possible once upon a time, especially after I’d been doing it 10+ years!",False,False

Recovery is quite the journey, one I don't know ever really ends, but you've got to keep moving forward. Rooting for you, keep it up",False,False

It has been a difficult process—I think I've reset my counter around 48 times now—but after awhile you get into a groove and you'll set personal ""records"" which may inspire you to break them.  It may sound silly, but it's true: now that I'm 137 days free of b/p, there's no way that I want to break that record. First and foremost, set a realistic goal: aim for 2 days without bingeing and purging, then set another goal for 5 days, then 10, etc. It can really help motivate you to prove to yourself that you can do it. I've been using the app ""Sober Time"" to track my progress—I highly recommend it!",False,True
