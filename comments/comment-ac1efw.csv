Usually around 3-4lbs the day before I start or day I start and then it slowly goes down throughout my period. I waited like 10 days after the holidays to weigh bc water and food weight, and I was still 4lbs over Christmas morning! I started my period the same day though so I canâ€™t trust the scale until Iâ€™m off my period in a few days ",False,False

I've had zero energy but have been ravenous, so not going under or over TDEE is a huge win for me. I'm 90% confident it's a PMS thing, given I'm still up 2lb from a few weeks ago. I sure as fuck hope I'm not pregnant ðŸ˜³   Someone mentioned a ""pause"" the other day, and it really stuck with me. I'm just really happy that for once I have been able to pause unhealthy behaviour, despite some big stressors next week. 2019 goals are standing strong (pregnancy scare excepted ðŸ˜¨).",False,False
