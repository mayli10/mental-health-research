Back then, it wasnâ€™t my BMI that indicated anything. Even at my lowest of like 17 (which was due to health problems) I was conscientiously eating super well and met all the nutritional standards my docs checked religiously. Now my BMI is higher but I eat like crap and thus have vitamin deficiencies and an iron deficiency, so I was healthier when everyone was concerned I was starving myself.  And now Iâ€™m actually starving myself! Ah, how the tides have changed.",False,False

Don't let American obesity warp your vision of normal. It's just not healthy""... Of course ignoring how unhealthy a piece of shit I am ðŸ˜‚",False,False

I have a few overweight relatives/acquaintances that constantly tell people who have healthy BMIs theyâ€™re too thin. Theyâ€™re not, itâ€™s just less common to be at a healthy BMI in America. Iâ€™ve gotten these comments too at a normal BMI before any ED behaviors or thoughts were present, and itâ€™s pretty hurtful. It actually led to a brief period of me overeating to gain weight.  I wish no one commented on how people look. Itâ€™s rude to do it to someone overweight so Iâ€™m not sure why itâ€™s acceptable to someone in normal or underweight range. Even barring EDs, there are lots of reasons someone might be underweight and itâ€™s really no one elseâ€™s business.",False,False

I tend to kinda rant about being fat bc I still feel like I did when I was pushing 200 but people tell me I look normal/average. I'm 5'3 and a size 10 for reference. I'm smaller than the American average which is 5'4 and a size 14. ",False,False
