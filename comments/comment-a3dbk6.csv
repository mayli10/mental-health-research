In a couple of weeks time even you could regret having not gone, whereas you probably wonâ€™t regret the food you ate by that time. Not trying to preach, I know itâ€™s not as easy as â€˜just eat and put Ed aside for a bitâ€™, just a thought to consider.   Congrats on your graduation!ðŸ’•",False,False

I wish so many celebrations didnâ€™t center around eating and drinking empty calories. ,False,True
