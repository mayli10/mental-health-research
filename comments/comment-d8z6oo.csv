I don't say ""I've been binging"" because I've never struggled with binging and i dont feel out of control, but recently I've been fasting all day and then eating everything all at night. And in my mind it's been okay, because i stay within my tdee. I was doing okay at first and eating breakfast and packing a lunch, but then i started eating breakfast and dinner in one meal because i didn't want to wake up early (since it's getting darker earlier, I've already been waking up even earlier to get my run in). Then it turned into OMAD because i like to enjoy my food by myself and on my lunch break my friends talk to me and keep me preoccupied and i won't get to finish my lunch unless i wolf it down. But it's just a lot at once and I puke every night from the amount i eat (not purposefully, I've never purged) combined with the volume of water i drink (i can't eat anything dry, for as long as i can remember ive been particular about this). I just feel like it's a problem even though i feel good mentally/""safe"" knowing I'm not technically overeating. Eating until i puke is just like, yeah, i can acknowledge that as disordered of me, but not counting calories, being underweight, and running to burn calories. Idk.",False,False

I have never vomited...until last night. I was waiting for takeout and had a mini binge in a 25 minute period. I was so upset with myself that I went into the bathroom to try and what has never worked in the past actually worked last night.   The ED part of my brain is happy but the logical part is screaming and I'm actually kind of scared that this will now become a thing. I'm currently sitting in my car avoiding the lunchroom at work because I didn't bring anything and I have nothing in me for the comments today. I haven't seen my therapist in 5 weeks and was contemplating switching anyway so I emailed a new one yesterday and am hoping they get back to me soon. This sucks...,False,False
