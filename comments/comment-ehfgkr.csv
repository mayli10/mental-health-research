I have never had a boyfriend though and dont know how anyone gets one. Im so insecure i cant imagine dating aomeone and when i push myself to talk to guys ill ghost or say sorry i cant date anyone right now out of fear. Im not able to be emotionally vulnerable in person. Im seeing a therapist rn to get help for this but its such a process since my self esteems been in thr toilet for over a decade,False,False

I didn’t have a boy friend until I was 20 and I thought I’d never have one, but when I met the right person I felt safe with him. Feeling safe with my partner meant I only had to deal with my own ED stuff (I.e I wasn’t worried about that he’d think because I felt safe and cared for, so I was only worried about how I’d feel about my body). I found that it wasn’t as impossible to work through the stuff on my end as it was when I’d been trying to work through it while feeling uncomfortable about who I was sharing myself with. Does that make sense? Basically the right person didn’t fix things but it was now possible to work on them? Everyone has their own path, some people can jump right in and all the power to them, I needed to go slowly and really trust my partner before I was able to be sexual. 😊",False,False

Almost every time I’d be drunk and the guy too, plus lights off meant no one really saw my boobs.   What I learnt from that is that sex doesn’t equal love, affection, and definitely not connection. If you have those things beforehand it makes the experience ecstasy and the body is just a vessel for pleasure. All kinds of bodies have sex.   But without those things, sex is kinda just a fun activity like sport, except with confusing emotional baggage and lowkey regret sometimes. Also, even in the presence of someone, I feel lonely having sex if it’s meaningless. Idk. That’s just how I feel.    I was super insecure about being a virgin for the longest time, and I know it’s hard to believe everyone saying that the way your body looks doesn’t matter, but it really doesn’t.
