Luckily I love what I study but I can't concentrate for longer than 90 minutes on a task :( you gotta time your food well and eat the good things that help your mind. Like fruit or nuts.,False,False

Luckily I’ve been stable so far but moving out might be a trigger- the cost of classes and genuine love of what I’ll be studying should be enough of a motivating factor to stay afloat though. Also focusing on nutrition rather than calorie counts and trying to hit those daily vitamin/macros while exhausting can at least help ur body not disintegrate too much physically.",False,True
