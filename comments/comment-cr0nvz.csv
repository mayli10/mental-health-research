My bf took pictures of me sitting on the floor and drawing recently, and I looked through them... big mistake. It broke my heart a little. It's especially jarring because I used to be skinny and I still have a ""skinny mindset"", and I kinda still act as though I'm skinny (does that make sense?) but then I look at myself in the mirror and oh fuck. I see myself in pictures and OH FUCK. It's seriously disturbing and I dont actually know wtf I look like.",False,False

But also, here's some food for thought. I HATE how I look, so whenever I look in the mirror I have a nasty expression of disappointment, checking out over and over my problem areas to see the progress or the damage. But people don't see me like that. They see me when I smile at them, when I laugh at a joke, when I hug a sad friend. They never stare at the same fat spot on my thighs. The see me  like I never myself in the mirror.",False,False

And gritty? If you've seen the new Target self-checkout cameras, they're horrible but at least they're definitely inaccurate. I don't think I have BDD but cameras always manage to make me look painfully thin, definitely BMI accurate. Maybe it's the perfect angle or distance idk because I sure don't think I'm THAT narrow in the mirror",False,False

The whole “your voice sounds different bc of skull resonance” thing is extremely overrated. It really is about equipment and the robustness of the bass capacity for the most part.  Similarly, the difference between a professional photographer and an amateur with no special lighting and a distorted camera lens? Night and fucking day.   I hate how I look in pics no matter what but amateur photography in particular i basically refuse to participate in. If you get a chance to be photographed by someone with some training, I highly recommend it.  Also keep in mind the camera really does add weight, due to the perceptual differences between binocular vision and a single lens!",False,False
