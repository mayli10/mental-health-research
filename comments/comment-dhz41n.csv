Throw it out, give it away, etc. If it’s something someone else will notice/want to eat, I’ll sneakily throw handfuls of it away so at the very least, there’s less of it. Or I leave the area the food is in completely. There’s times I won’t go home because I know there’s something there I’ll gorge myself in.   I, personally, am fucking shit terrible at ~mind over matter~. I’m the type that if there’s something I can’t have, that means I *need* it. So my cravings intensify. So I gotta just get rid of the thing.",False,False

I’ve labeled my unhelpful thoughts as being attributable to an entity I call ‘shithead,’ so like when I start to notice that I’m thinking things like “it won’t matter if I binge,” “it will make me feel better,” “I’ll stop when I’m full,” etc, I tell myself that that’s just shithead talking.   - if the urge is too strong to avoid, I reach for foods I can eat a lot of without triggering a legit binge; like konjac noodles, tuna, Halo Top (if I’m careful), etc.   - I don’t keep triggering foods in the house. My bulimia used to be so bad that I’d compulsively binge eat anything, but now I’m at a place where I can have foods that I have no desire to binge on like ever.",False,False
