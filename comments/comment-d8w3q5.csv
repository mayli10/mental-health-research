Which is valid af still too)  People forget it’s a mental disorder which can affect anyone regardless of sex, gender, age, race, sexuality whatever what have you",False,False

I doubt they see it in themselves?  You know where a lot of them are?  The fitness subs, the weightlifting subs, talking about their fucking macros and their deadlift PRs 25 hours a day and getting lean and cut and bulking and dirty food and clean food and vascularity and discussing the various meal prep ideas to jazz up week-old chicken breast and the myriad combinations of workouts one can do in a week.  No less fixated and distressed by deviation from their arbitrary rules and numbers than we are.  Men with more classical eating disorder symptoms are a bit more likely to find their way here, I think.  I’d hope that some kind of progress is made in teaching and identifying more, not just because they deserve to have access to the same community support that we all get, but because if EDs were to stop being seen as a women’s and girls’ issue, and instead be understood for the widespread general mental health issue that it is, we’d likely see renewed interest and funding for ED treatment research.",False,False

Sometimes I see our brethren post here or on the meme sub asking if there are any other guys out there, and the feedback is pretty strong! Which sucks, bc ED. But also nice, bc support.

I'm in the beginning of recovery, so currently working very hard on ditching all the habits you listed above. I'm... honestly pretty sure getting a Fitbit was the entire catalyst behind my relapse, because now that I've come clean about having an ED to my fiance and had him take away my Fitbit (with my encouragement, it was my idea) I'm already doing better now that I'm not obsessed with tracking my calories via the app or trying to hit my step goal.  EDs are much more visible and addressed with women than men. There are a lot of men on this subreddit and the corresponding ED memes subreddit, though! It's just a matter of whether or not your post gets seen.  Funny story, someone recently picked a fight with me on a different subreddit- I called them a coward in jest, they did NOT take it in jest like they should have, dug through my profile and then commented back ""says the anorexic"", got torn to shreds for attacking me, then posted on the ""Am I The Asshole?"" subreddit about it (still thinking they did nothing wrong, I guess) and got torn to shreds again. Looking through the comments of that post, a lot of the people assumed I was a woman, with only the context of ""person with anorexia"". I thought it was pretty interesting that people automatically assume that if someone has an eating disorder they're a woman.",False,False
