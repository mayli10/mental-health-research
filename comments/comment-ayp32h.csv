At this point I have my own designated areas for my food but my family still does it sometimes. Just like last Sunday I found my stupid dad eating out of my jar of sugar free grape jam KNOWING it was mine because he’s done it before and he had the AUDACITY to complain about how bad it tasted,False,False

YOU COULD HAVE ANYTHING, THIS IS ALL I HAVE!!!!!!!!!!! And now it’s the same with safe foods. People with no diet restrictions will really take from your very small selection of viable food and won’t see it as a big deal, ack!! With you on this one 100% ",False,False

Maybe i should look into that again.  I do actually do jobs and earn pocket money and your 100% right when you say it's nice to be able to buy yourself something nice that you've wanted for ages.,False,True

Get a small job or help around the house for extra pocket money. Builds independence, both emotionally and financially.

In general she is just ignorant and annoying (unrelated to this incident) and is really hard to reason with so i don't think there is much use in trying to make an agreement.   It's going to be hard because i have bad anger problems which i tried to resolve in the past but ultimately didn't work much but i think it's the only option.  Also buying my own isn't an option because i'm a minor and still live with my parents :/,False,True

Talk to her, and if it's so important to you, buy your own and write your name on the yoghurt so she remembers. Or, deal with it like an adult: you didn't even buy the food, and a fridge is a shared space. ",False,False
