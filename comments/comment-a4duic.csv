I actually did stop at the gw mostly due to fear that I was going to become TOO anorexic again and not be able to stop. But now I can't eat over 1000 calories because WHAT IF I GAIN WEIGHT. I think at this point I probably have EDNOS and not Anorexia like when I was 15 because I can kinda stop? I guess that first recovery was good for something ðŸ˜…,False,False

Although I relate 100% to what u said, i also do it because i feel like, since i've had bulimia for a long time now, i need something to show for it.
