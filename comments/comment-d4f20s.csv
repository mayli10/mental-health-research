And ask your doctor abt the diagnosis; is it an autoimmune disease that is triggered? If you only got underfunction bc of your past behaviours it might recerse with adequate nutrition in a couple of yrs(not for everyone, but for some). In any case, take care‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False

I‚Äôm on prescription laxatives and my doctor isn‚Äôt sure if I need them because of another disorder I have or if it‚Äôs damage from my ed. However, they let me get on with my life and hopefully, if you end up needing meds, they just let you do the same!  Plus, tons of people have thyroid problems and for a ton of different reasons! Needing medical treatment is NEVER your fault, this is definitely not something you ‚Äúdid to yourself‚Äù, I know how easy it is to tell ourselves things like that. Truth is, you dealt with a really challenging medical issue and worked hard to minimize your risks and seek treatment. That‚Äôs a huge deal and you deserve a personal cheering section for that üíï",False,False
