Like I could rationalise eating multiple meals throughout the day as long as it was the same food.",False,False

I'm surprised the ed-online community doesn't talk about those more than they do. Whether it's  day of just plain potatoes with salt, or eggs with salt, or just watermelon all day, literally end up losing at least 1lb per day and you can pick a nutritious food if you feel off-put by it, but it's like??? literally a lot of us are fasting and purging and starving soooo a whole day of greek yogurt or chicken doesn't sound that messed up (some people will say it's sooo bad to do monos to us as if we are not starving and purging that's why i say that). Sometimes I ""slip"" and add more spices then I should or sugar-free sauces or dips or some light greens along side and it still works. I don't fucking know WHY it works better than water fasting but sure why the fuck not.  If anyone else does please chat with me because not enough people talk about this.",False,False

TDEE, or total daily energy expenditure, is what your body burns from all the activity you do in daily life. BMR is just what youd burn if you were comatose and completely inactive. So I'd say you burn more energy than you think, very few people burn that little calories  a day.   This is far from advise of course. Just take care of yourself OP, you can give yourself a lot more slack than that.",False,False
