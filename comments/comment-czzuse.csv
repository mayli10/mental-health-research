For as long as I can remember. I always had an issue with food. I don‚Äôt approach food like a normal person or react to hunger. I would even go as far as to say ‚ÄúI hate eating.‚Äù   I wonder if my relationship with food is nature or nurture. Did I learn these behaviors from my social group or am I naturally disposed to it.    Growing up as a child. I thought our family life was normal. Erratic behavior, issues with alcohol and other substances. Periods of extreme anger and violence. It felt like we were family but we weren‚Äôt a family.  We cared for each other but lashed out at each other.   Looking back now at my parents‚Äô marriage. I think if society hadn‚Äôt been so conservative they probably would have gotten divorced.   ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.But what I said above could have been true for all my friends &amp; their families and my extended family. Cousins, uncles and aunts. Growing up we lost friends to drugs. Some friends to suicide and emigration   ‚Ä¶.but yet I am the only one I know of, who let their ED take over their life to the point of near death.    I didn‚Äôt drink till I was legally old enough and never really did drugs. I was diagnosed with depression at 14 but managed that better than my ED. Where I grew up crime, violence and destructive behavior was the norm. It was only when I attended colleague. I saw the possibilities open to me. I qualified as engineer and excelled in my carrier. All the time being dangerously underweight and excessively drinking.   I guess what I am trying to say above is. Did my childhood create my ED or was I born with it.   After more than ten years of struggling with my ED. I am in a better place. I am still figuring things out, dates, places &amp; people.  Yes part of my personality (the nature) pushed me towards my ED. As did the memories and how I coped with my past (the nurture.) For definite which came first or which was the biggest influence I can‚Äôt say.   I know this might sound like bull shite but your life really is an arc. Where you are now, though it seems like it has filled your life and left no room for the future. The future does come and you will better able to deal with the changes that come and reconcile the past with your future.   Definitely for me keeping a journal helped. It allowed me to dig deep into me. Sorry I couldn‚Äôt answer your question and I have probably left you more confused.    All I can say is for now don‚Äôt be so hard on yourself. We all have a moment we fall. You posted and are trying to take control of it. Take this as a win and keep putting the wins together. It‚Äôs likely you might have PTSD but you don‚Äôt have to let your past define you. Your future‚Äôs bright because you are talking, learning and growing. Though it doesn‚Äôt seem like it now things will get better because you‚Äôre doing and talking about things for the first time in your life and found a therapist you actually LIKE! Keep growing &amp; keep living for the future.  I just wanted to share. Hope my sharing helped. Sorry for rambling on.",False,False
