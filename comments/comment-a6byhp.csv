I went from lw of 108 to now 126 because once I started not tracking, I realized I fucked my hunger signals and it just snowballed cause I had no fullness cues. Hope this doesnâ€™t happen to you. Itâ€™s so hard to get back on track. ",False,False

At the end I literally gained 1.5 and it wasnâ€™t too hard to get back into my normal schedule. Finals are so stressful so try not to worry too much!!,False,False
