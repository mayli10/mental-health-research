I dated at my highest weight and recently relapsed my ED after a 10 year recovery.   Dating is just stressful. Dinner.... drinks.... I dont want my first impression to be forking out the innards of one taco and drinking the water from the melted ice of one cocktail.  Then you have that dreaded question- so what do you do for fun?   Oh, you know. Normal stuff. Obsess over nutrition, try new sport groups (running, hiking etc), meet with my personal trainer, run with my dog and really into podcasts about CBT/Psychiatry and running. You know - nothing hyperfocused or anything.   I also disguise my relapse as IF in public. ""Sorry, I'm in a fasting state and cant eat after work"". Not cute.   Yet they still see you - overweight..... Either no one believes you or it just makes them uncomfortable. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è   Nope - not dating until closer to GW. My goals are more important than trying to find love and by staying so focused, I should reach that weight in April, when I turn 30.",False,False

That actually was a big motivator for me to get my shit together and start being healthy and striving for long term weight loss instead of the starving I was doing before which only made me binge in the end and jojo.... let it take time and build good habits, and obviously I don‚Äôt know how much you weigh, but find an acceptable weight range and once you hit that, try to date and see. For me it was working out and  a certain bmi that made me ok with my body, like I could accept it. You don‚Äôt have to love your body, you just have to be ok with it. Hope this helps.",False,False

Gained like 60 lbs during my one year of grad school, and the thought of someone seeing me naked made me want to die. Or the thought that I would go on a date and they would think my body was disgusting. I lost 20ish pounds, and then had the balls to sleep with an ex bc i knew it would be a sure thing and thank god he didn‚Äôt say anything about the weight gain. When we dated originally I was at my LW, but he has pretty disordered eating too so maybe that helps. Still can‚Äôt fathom dating someone new until I lose at least 20 more.",False,False
