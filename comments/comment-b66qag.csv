I managed to lose weight while on Prozac, 10 mg, went from 130 lbs to 97 lbs. My Dad then died (sorry to keep bringing it up -- it's a very common theme in my post history; he was my everything), and then after a suicide attempt, I asked my doc to up me to 20 mg to then 40 mg (?). Later, I ended up accidentally withdrawing on the Prozac, and when I saw my doc again, she put me on Lexapro (? mg) and personally I hated it because it made me feel angry, hungry, and tired all of the time. Now I'm back on Prozac, 10 mg.  Please keep in mind that there are so many unique factors that determine how medication will affect you.",False,False

I was on amitriptyline for anxiety for a while and WOW did it take binging to a whole new level. If my binge episodes were at a 5 before, that med took it to a 10.  Sorry I can't comment on other meds. But big hugs to you and I'm proud you're doing what you need to help yourself feel better! There are a lot of meds out there and a good doc will help you find one that will work for you without a side effect you cannot live with. Just remember to give it time.",False,False
