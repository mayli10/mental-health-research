Yesterday I drew up a schedule for the next three months trying to predict days I would be forced to eat something and calculating at what rates I would reach what weight. Other times it's just fantasies about food.   And lonliness is one of the most crippling side effects of an ED. People accuse us of being narcissistic attention seekers, but I have never met an attention seeker who would rather sit in a corner under ten blankets watching Anorexia/obesity youtube videos instead of going out, or to university or to see friends.   An ED is a silent and horrific illness which rips you apart in private and reduces you down to a counting machine which is functioning on autopilot in the real world.  And getting help is so hard, because everything about an ED is stigmatised as being attention seeking. So we end up in places like this so we can at least support each other through shared struggles, until reddit purges this place too. ",False,False
