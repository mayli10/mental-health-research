That used to be me all the time until I got a new mattress. Paradoxically, I canâ€™t sleep on anything soft :/  Biofreeze feels like icyhot, so if you donâ€™t like that you wonâ€™t like Biofreeze :P  I like topical cbd creams but actually cbd oil taken internally works even better for me. Idk if it would work for you but Iâ€™ll just throw that out there too. (I need a hella high dose tho and itâ€™s crazy expensive so I usually go without.)  Oh! Do you have any access to like... PT or OT? They have an ultrasound machine at my physical therapist and it doesnâ€™t feel like anything while itâ€™s happening but afterwards oh my god does it help my pain. Then again mine is in muscles and joints not nerves... I DID have really bad nerve pain around 7 years ago and during that time narcotics were literally all that helped.   I think maybe thereâ€™s a chronic pain sub here? Iâ€™m on the EDS sub which just has some overall good suggestions for pain. Iâ€™m also always up for a DM if you just want to bitch about your pain to someone who understands :P I know it can be exhausting and upsetting for our friends and family sometimes because they just want to fix us.   Sending hella good vibes your way.",False,False

I have lupus and fibro and a slew of other auto immune issues and it is so hard to try to not only explain the pain to people, but to even manage the pain. The depression and anxiety make the symptoms even worse and make things feel hopeless. You are definitely not pathetic or dumb. The pain you are experiencing is real and it is hard as hell to deal with. You are so strong for handling it and making attempts to take care of yourself even when you are feeling sad and lonely. I hope you can hang in there and not let the feelings of hopelessness invalidate you or your struggles.",False,False

I wish I could, because I know it works wonders. What is the other one.... biofreeze or something? I've tried those creams and gels and the intense cold is awful to me personally, so I end up tensing up and feeling miserable. But the other things you mentioned, I have not tried those. I'll have to give them a try though, thank you so much.   I managed a few hours of sleep (barely any at all though) and woke up in more pain than I went to sleep with. Usually after resting my body, it at least has the decency to feel a little but better. Nope.   Thank you so much for the suggestions. I'm sorry you deal with all this too:( you're right, we definitely don't deserve this. It's so shitty. I just wanna enjoy life, man.",False,True

Even if my depression and ED start to get better, my pain might flare up and then I just feel awful in every way possible, and I start feeling hopeless, and then the mental illness flares up again. Or I'm doing ok mentally and the pain and sickness flares up, so I try to eat healthier and take care of my body, and the ED comes busting the door down all like ""HAH no clean eating in moderation for you! You either need to binge all the bad food nonstop, or work out every day and eat 500 calories max!""  I haven't been to the gym in a week because I hurt my foot while running. It turns out it might not have been a sprain or strain, but a symptom of something else going on, according to my dr who picked up on some other red flags.   I'm sorry you have to deal with the pain and ED too :( you're definitely right, having both is a special kind of torture. We are young, we should be enjoying our lives and our bodies aren't supposed to feel like they are breaking down yet.",False,True

Having a chronic illness at your age (I'm almost the same age) is terrible. I have one too and it makes my eating disorder that much worse because the symptoms exacerbate everything. I wish I had something more helpful to say. I just know firsthand that dealing with a physical illness on top of a mental one is a special kind of torture.,False,False

I donâ€™t have much to add, but I understand what you are going through. I have EDS and had bad pain flare ups today too. Couple this with gastroparesis and oof yes I can absolutely see how hard that would be to take.   I donâ€™t know much about other types of pain, but if heat doesnâ€™t work, my PT suggested ice for short periods. CBD oil can be good, tiger balm sometimes helps me, and that icy cream for athletes can interrupt pain signals too. A TENS machine can help in some cases and KT Tape is a last resort for me.   Idk if any of that might help you or be anything you havenâ€™t tried, but I figured I would share! Screw chronic pain on top of an ED, like damn we do NOT deserve this. I hope you can feel some relief soon ðŸ’•",False,False
