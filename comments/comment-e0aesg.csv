I lost a lot of weight in a previous relapse, got better, and then relapsed when I moved and got my new job at the beginning of September.   He didnâ€™t realize what I was doing until I collapsed in front of him and he took care of me, bought me food and just LISTENED. Heâ€™s the only person who has never tried to tell me why I starve myself but who has asked questions and listened with no preconceived notions.   Thank you SO much for saying what you did though - I love SO SO much the way we all look out for one another here - thatâ€™s exactly the kind of thing that could slip by and be normalized ðŸ’•",False,True
