Water weight is short term and your body (as you are at a very low weight) is likely incapable of retaining more than 5lbs of water at any point in time. If it makes you feel better, you can counteract the affects of water retention by increasing you water consumption (sounds counter intuitive, I know, but trust me it really works). Side note: glucose is just a form of energy and all carbs are converted to in in our body during digestion, I think fat is also converted to it while protein is converted to ketones. If you want to reduce the amount of water retention you are likely to experience, you can focus on consuming protein for now as it is less likely to cause your cells to swell. Ps. I am not a doctor or anything so I would recommend speaking to one because they will be able to explain this stuff in a more scientific and accurate way. My intent was not to scare you about increasing, I really hope that I did not cause any harm through these posts. Good luck, I hope that you begin to improve both mentally and physically!!!",False,False

It is impossible to gain any ‘real’ weight if you are not experiencing a caloric surplus and that 1lb of real weight is equivalent to consuming 3500 calories above your tdee.
