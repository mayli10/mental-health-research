I second the stretching that was suggested. Having good range of motion is so valuable for injury prevention. Practice listening to your body. (I’m injury-prone and not good at ‘hearing’ the warnings so I have to take things slower than I think I need to.) Try a variety of things and see what’s fun for you :) And most importantly, find some workout tunes that lift your spirits!",False,False

Pay attention to your breathing...in through the nose, out through the mouth. Stretch. But not too too much. Ease into it.",False,False
