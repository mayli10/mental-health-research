I combined your list of YouTube videos into one shareable highlight reel link:  https://app.hivevideo.io/view/995368   You can play through the whole highlight reel (with timestamps if they were in the links), or select each video.   Reply with the word ignore and I won't reply to your comments.",False,False

To help with the digestive issues you're going to have eat some mints or drink peppermint tea, stay hydrated, and keep yourself comfortable with sweatpants and blankets.   Self-love meditations and affirmations can really change your mindset, even if only for an hour. I'll link some below which I think might help. Journaling and talking yourself through a binge can help also. But, as always, professional help is the best if you have access to it :)  Take care of yourself &lt;3  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFeCUfw657g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFeCUfw657g) Self Love Meditation  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSaCyZOypSE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSaCyZOypSE) Eating Disorder Meditation  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I\_gj-eMefU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I_gj-eMefU) Self Esteem Meditation",False,False
