There was also sacrifices made by the Luperci, which is suggested to be linked to the she-wolf that nursed Remus and Romulus. After the sacrificial ritual was complete, they'd have a sacrificial feast, then they'd skin the sacrificial animals (goats, and a dog) and make thongs out of them. Sources say they'd run around and whack women with the thongs, thus rendering them fertile.    Pope Gelasius I replaced it with Valentines day, after St. Valentine. That or the church. It was appropriated into a Christian holiday somehow, following its outlaw for being ""un-christian"" There's a lot of St. Valentines, but it appears to be pretty widely accepted that St. Valentine was either a guy who went against the word of the emperor and married people in secret so they can avoid being drafted into war (which is another reason why the holiday is associated with love), or a man who befriended the daughter of a jailer and signed off a letter with ""your Valentine"", thus the name!   Candy, chocolate especially, is given on Valentine's day because of the connection between love and chocolate, which can be traced all the way back to Montezuma, who ate cocoa beans because he believed in its aphrodisiac powers. In the Victorian era this connection was pushed further, and advertisers pushed this whole chocolate agenda on people, men especially, by urging them to choose the right box of chocolates to give to the lady they were trying to woo.   Now, the day is associated with chocolates, candy, and other sweets, as many holidays have fallen prone to :/ You can always find someone to regift it to, or maybe use it for baking if you're into that. Get some brownie points with your neighbours or workplace, or maybe find someone down on their luck who could use some kindness. V-day is strongly linked to love, and everyone needs a little bit of that sometimes ðŸ’•",False,False
