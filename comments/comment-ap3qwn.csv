Could just as easily be your area is super busy, but wouldn't hurt to check.  Either way, regardless of how long it takes, you're ill enough to be deserving of help. The waiting times aren't any indicator of how 'bad' you are. Just in case that's where your thoughts were verging.",False,False

Someone's condition could deteriorate so much in that time. Thanks for your advice - I guess I'll try my uni's counselling service in the meantime,False,True

Previously i only had to wait 1 month.  If you are struggling however going to see your local crisis team could help, they might be able to help you get seen much quicker as they can get into contact with many different places or even help with how to manage things better until you get your referral sorted.   I hope you can get everything sorted soon! ",False,False
