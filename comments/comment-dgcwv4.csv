I recently went to my doctor who is treating me for depression, and at the last possible moment, handed him a slip of paper that simply said ""I think I have an eating disorder"".  Now I know I do, but I'm not diagnosed so the last thing I wanted to do was tell a health professional I have something that has never been spoken about before. He simply asked me why I thought that, and due to time constraints, I briefly told him of my behaviours. I'm pretty sure we're gonna go deeper into it next time, so I've composed a timeline of my behaviours around food for the last decade to hell explain my concerns.  A good therapist, or any healthcare professional, will take your concerns seriously and explore the issue with you. Tell her you have issues with food and you think it's likely an ED. Be prepared to answer questions like your behaviours, thoughts and how much it interferes with your daily life.  I really hope that however you go about bringing it up, that it's the first step in the right direction and she supports, rather than doubts you.",False,False
