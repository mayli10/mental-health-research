As others have said, you dodged a bullet. I understand how much it sucks and what a blow it must be to get fired on day one, but honestly it doesn‚Äôt sound like a place you‚Äôd want to work. Better to be gone on day one than to waste weeks/months/years in such a terrible environment. I hope you find something better soon üíï",False,False

Second of all how is that legal?   And third of all...I work in healthcare, in a hospital, in acute care neurology. I also have a dual degree in exercise science and nutrition. I drink those zero calorie monsters often and that is downright healthy compared to what I see my co-workers snarf down. We are talking multiple monsters and red bulls, donuts, or else not eating for an entire shift because we are so busy.   Is this hypocritical when we are instructing patients about nutrition for rehabilitation? Yes. But it's also no one's business what we are eating and putting in our own bodies as long as what we teach and do for our patients promotes their optimal health.   Also, per the 10th tennant of nutrition science, THERE ARE NO GOOD OR BAD FOODS. You can eat or drink anything as long as you do it in moderation.   I find that health gurus or companies that advertise a singular form of treating medical conditions using highly restrictive diet and lifestyle modifications are not sustainable for the patient, nor are they evidence based. So whatever ""treatment"" this company was pedalling doesn't sound lile it is even evidence based, and your choices as an employee to consume a beverage in moderation is none of their business.   Run far away from this place. ",False,False

Maybe they didn't realize you needed those business details and they didn't want anyone looking too closely.   I'm sorry this happened to you, I know it can feel like it's your fault.   But also tbh I worked a job 2 years ago where during my first day/week the lady was like ""how's your last job? Are you going to go running back to them?""
