I’m sorry for the confusion. After rereading I see how that could have been misunderstood.   You are probably right that I should mix up the foods I eat. I just thought it would be easier to lose weight eating the same things because I know what the calories are.   I think you gave me sound advice and I will try it. Thank you very much!,False,True

I am eating 1600 calories. Not a deficit of 1600. I realize after rereading how that must have sounded outrageous.,False,True

A deficit of 500 is usually recommended. wish you all the best,False,False

I try really hard to maintain a caloric deficit of about 1600. (I’ve been trying to lose weight) but even before trying to cut back calories I would binge.   I also eat the same thing for breakfast and lunch every day. Dinner is my only difference besides my hinges of course. I’ve tried Intermittent fasting but it only made my binges worse.,False,True
