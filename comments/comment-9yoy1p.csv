Have you tried bodysuits? I personally dislike my stomach, but feel much more comfortable in a bodysuit that smooths out my bumps. Sending you love!",False,False

I just wanted to pop in and say that I used to work in a lingerie store (fredericks of Hollywood) while I was in full ED misery/recovery when I was 18/19. I have a small frame and I weighed a healthy amount at that time (but still had insane ED thoughts and BD).    It was horrible. I was very, very small but I felt like I was a ‘large’ in everything. The thigh high stockings made my thighs look FAT. the mannequins and models were terribly disproportionate. I was in BD hell.   It’s NOT you. It’s the fucked up sizing and weird cuts of material and unrealistic standards for women (or men!) if you can’t find lingerie that makes you feel sexy it’s the piece, NOT your body. You can always find something to make you feel beautiful!  ❤️ ",False,False

I bought some really nice lingerie I’ve wanted forever because it went on sale, when it came and I tried it on I felt super disgusting and like a susage in it. But, when I am skinnier and feel good about my body I actually get a confidence boost from lingerie.  So yeah, I’m okay because I know it’s for the good days, hope you’ll get to feel that way soon ❤️",False,False

But I'm sure you are absolutely not disgusting! Lingerie can be weird because it is so revealing and tight and can be super uncomfortable. I feel much better about my body when I'm wearing comfortable stretchy or baggy clothes that cover me up. I'm sorry you're feeling this way :( I totally get it and you're not alone. ,False,False
