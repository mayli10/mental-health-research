I think I'll just start downing shots and get drunk enough to the point where I eat. I might self destruct but whatever. I can't deal with this otherwise.,False,True

I'm not hungry right now because I've been too busy crying and freaking out and I've downed enough soda.  I'll end up purging anyway. I can't stand the feeling of being full. It triggers me to purge even if I'm just full on water.,False,True

I can't fucking eat. They're serving food up now and I can't. Fucking. Eat. I'm visiting my BF tomorrow and I can't be bloated and ugly. I need to be fucking thin.,False,True

I've just come out of a huge binge cycle and I'm trying to lose again. Im being weighed on the 7th and they'll see the gain and refuse me treatment. My stomach is finally flat again.  I'm a disgusting tranny freak. This year is my first Christmas out to the family and presenting female. I look awful. I look like a man. I broke down because I could tell nobody wanted me to wear makeup so I didnt. People are calling me she and my new name but I feel  fake  My voice is disgusting. I'm surrounded by cis women who all look amazing and it's socially acceptable for them to wear bras and makeup and look nice. I've dissapointed everyone. I want to neck rope.,False,True
