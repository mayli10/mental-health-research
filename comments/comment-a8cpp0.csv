You aren't going to gain (or not lose) any more weight from a 200 calorie drink than a 200 calorie salad.   The, tbh, hysteria around liquid calories, which is probably why you feel afraid of them, is because liquids don't actually satiate hunger and it can be really easy to over-consume them. If you're tracking consistently you shouldn't have any problems. ",False,False

However, when people say not to drink calories, what they really mean is that they are tremendously less satisfying. If given the choice, most people would rather eat half a pizza than drink a liter of coca-cola (especially when coke zero exists).  As other comments point out, you usually drink on top of eating something (which hopefully isn't pure sugar), but the combination of carbs+fat will make you gain more than just eating carbs.  Your situation seems different. If you count calories, but truly enjoy drinking them *IN PLACE* of eating them... Then not much is going to change. Go for it.",False,False

So unfortunately you do need to count them.  But one 200 cal drink isn‚Äôt going to ruin any progress. :),False,False
