When you feed yourself enough for the first time after starving yourself, you will gain weight in the most vital places (stomach) in order to protect your vital organs.   If you continued to feed yourself enough, over a period of a few months your body would be able to afford the luxuries like your breasts or butt/hips and the weight from your stomach would redistribute to those places giving you a more hourglass shape.  Basically what you’re experiencing is not weight redistribution, it’s the initial stage of weight gain. ",False,False

First time I lost a lot of weight I noticed my legs looked much thinner. Now it's coming off mainly my arms, which were pretty small to begin with. Kinda disappointed but eventually my legs will catch up. ",False,False

One time I lost weight and it was all off my gut.... I wish I could have kept that shit going! Haha. This time around it doesn't seem to want to fall off my arms. Idk. -pokes gut- why r u like this. Lol  There was a hot guy the other day at the gym that had a pocket of fat around his tricep. He was doing tri exercises and I could tell they were HUGE, they just weren't popping because he had a lil bit of fat. The rest of him was chiselled. Felt so bad for the guy. ",False,False

This time, I gained a lot of weight very quickly, but still gained it fairly evenly. When I started losing it though, i did not lose evenly.   I've had a stubborn pooch of fat on my stomach and right under my armpits that doesn't seem to want to leave. Also, my face has thinned out way more than it ever did before. I was told that alot of that is age. I'm a lot older now. But idk. Its still frustrating. ",False,False

I never even thought I gained there. Mostly because my family kept telling me I have a masculine body, but fuck them. I have hips! (I’m cisfemale) ",False,False

Sorry I’m just wondering. I’ve always thought that body shape determine weight distribution like you can be a big or small hourglass but still retain the shape ,False,False
