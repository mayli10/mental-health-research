While I won't push you into recovery by any means, I just wanted to try and give you some hope.  I've dealt with this for most of my life. My mom fed me fattening foods and encouraged me to binge eat with her every since I can remember. At age 16, I had absolutely no control over my eating, and I gained a lot of weight from my binges.  But I did managed to stop at some point, even though sometimes I still binge and feel horrible about it, actually I've spent the last year binging and gaining weight.  But I don't lose my hope.   What helped me the most was designing myself a diet of comforting foods, but modified to be less fattening. For example, I love fried chicken, so I cut down the portion and made a side of a really big, nutritious salad, forced myself to eat most of the salad first, then let myself had a ""reward"" with chicken.  For very stubborn people, I guess sometimes the most helpful thing is to accept you are going to binge on crap, so spacing out that crap throughout the day, and cutting it down, may help.
