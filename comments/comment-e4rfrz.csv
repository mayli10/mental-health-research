I’m a fan of oversized sweaters and jeans/leggings since they tend to cover the areas I hate the most but not in an unflattering way. Lots of holiday sweaters out there, and thankfully long sweaters are still in trend so you can even find themed ones. Pair that with statement shoes/jewelry to distract the eye.   What helps me is also basically promising yourself you’ll leave early. Just go for 15 minutes. Enough to say your hello-how-are-yous and have your presence known and then duck out. If anyone asks, you had a family thing or started to feel ill. Or if you actually feel okay for those 15 minutes, stay 15 minutes longer. And 15 minutes longer after that if you’re still okay. Etc etc.   Otherwise it’s kind of a Gotta get over it kind of deal. Like you’re gonna feel like shit either way. Might as well do the one that might actually end up being a good time if you like your coworkers enough. Plus the more you hermit yourself because of your self-esteem, the lower it gets, in my experience. Basically gives it more power over you.   Just know you can leave whenever. You’re an adult. If they have comments, it’s whatever. You don’t need to give them a reason. You do what you want with your day.",False,False
