I have been in recovery for 7 months now &amp; am working on getting it back. I am aware of all the damage I've caused myself &amp; the lack of period is a glaring reminder of what I've done to myself. I don't want to break a hip in my 30s because of osteopenia. I don't want to have brittle hair, nails, bones, teeth. I don't want to feel less of a woman because my body has ceased to do what a woman's body does.  I'm lucky enough to have had a child. She is almost 4 &amp; since becoming pregnant with her &amp; my subsequent relapse my period has gone. She is a reminder of what a simple period can be. I have denied myself the chance to give my beautiful girl a sibling. Am I infertile at 33? Have I pushed myself into early menopause? Who knows? I will know once I am weight restored &amp; eating well &amp; regularly.   It will be hard. As you say, part of you sees this lack of cycle as a badge of honour. It's a lie. People lose their period for many reasons, not just eating disorders. People at much higher weights can lose it. It's about nutrition not necessarily weight. We have basically malnourished our bodies so badly they do not function as they should. That is not a badge of honour. It's a mental game but currently I will look on the return of a period as a trophy &amp; something to strive for.   If I was strong enough to starve it away I am strong enough to nourish it back, if it is reversible!",False,False
