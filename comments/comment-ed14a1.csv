I feel like when I was binge eating every day, everything tasted so good. Now almost nothing tastes like what I'm hoping for.  Of course, I know this is because when I was binge eating, it didn't matter if something tasted bad, because I could just keep eating until I had something good. And now that I can't/don't do that, I actually remember the meh food, and it feels like a waste.
