I sometimes fantasize about running a bulk/co-op store in the future and if I did I'd want to have something that showed you how much 100cals of that product weighed. Like, if you wanted 100cal servings of dry pasta, you could check and see that it weighs X grams and weigh yourself little baggies of 100cal serves.  Only issue is that I know while it would be immensely helpful for a lot of people it would probably be equally triggering for just as many. Maybe the info would be hidden under a flap or something. I'd want it to be discrete so people wouldn't feel nervous to look if they needed to but not so obvious that it would tempt people to trigger themselves. Hmmmmm  Daydreaming is free I guess...",False,False
