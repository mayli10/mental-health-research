It is scary stepping outside my comfort zone but not as scary as relapse. I fear AN more than anything rn, and the losing my mind that comes with it ",False,True

Technically I’ve been in recovery since my last relapse in 2008, this is a weird one and I’m not even sure if it’s been a relapse tbh (not consciously restricting, no cal counting and I don’t b/p or c/s), but my weight got dangerously low and I have a touch of bdd as I don’t see myself as skinny as others say I am) so I’m treating it as if it is.  I half heartedly tried to gain weight in summer but didn’t put huge effort in, big guns have been out since 2 weeks ago though! Gone from approx 1500 cal/day to over 2500.",False,True

It takes some time for your hunger hormones to kick back up and for your body to ""ask"" for more food, but eventually it will and then you will be able to eat even more and recover more quickly.",False,False

I have to gain about a kg, and I also feel like it sucks having to eat so much:/ sometimes I'm too scared to do it, and other times I just feel too full, and like I just shouldn't but any step in the right direction, is a good one!",False,False
