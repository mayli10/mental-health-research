I quickly shut that down. Cut to a month or so later when I get stuck in a binge-restrict cycle which leads me to gaining 5lbs and gaining/losing another 5lbs every week, and now my parents think I’m perfectly healthy - even if my behaviors/feelings toward food haven’t changed (and has gotten worse I think).

You doing ok?” I dont remember what I said but I just brushed it off • one time I was walking down the hall in a cute lil outfit and I pass by some of the “popular kids” who kinda thought i was cool and one gore, “WOAH, redhotjillypepper, you got TINY” • somehow a rumor went around that my boyfriend was emotionally abusing me and that made me anorexic (couldnt be further from the truth)",False,False

It makes me feel so invalidated when people say that everyone noticed and got worried about them. Even at a BMI of 14.5 nobody noticed me. No one suspected a thing. I was freezing all the time, everything was foggy, I'm sure I wasn't acting quite right, I couldn't fucking *read* at one point, and nobody noticed anything was off.",False,False

He knew I was bulimic but he thought it was something I did occasionally. I was off the charts sick when we were together. I still can't believe he didn't know.

Teachers, friends ect. Although I lost over 100 pounds in less than a year and was sickly underweight so that may have been why but people most certainly knew and commented on it.  I had quite a few people ""worried"" about me. And it definitely got me attention (not that I really wanted it). I think flat out saying that those things don't happen just isn't true. ",False,False

For my friends I believe this was the reason they didn’t say anything because they felt that’s just not something you really comment on. I personally feel though that friends or family should say something if they think you have a problem because who else would. Obviously strangers should mind their own business, but like teachers and extended relatives is kind of a gray area. Either way weight is always a sensitive topic and needs to be approached as such if they were to say anything about it or it probably wouldn’t help at all.",False,False

You have to be quite sick and noticeably sick for anyone to say anything. Even when I was dropping weight fast no one said much besides how great I looked. Hell, no one said anything to me until I was frequently passing out at school and people picked up on me skipping lunch or just having carrots and celery. ",False,False

On the one hand, people could be scared to comment, but on the other, I've heard plenty say that they simply shouldn't. You don't know why they're thinner, and even if your only goal is to compliment them, you say nothing, *but* sometimes posts on the sub suggest someone *should* say something. You want them to worry about you and show they really care. Which is it? - Although not necessarily aimed at you, your comment did lead to it coming to mind. ",False,False

It's made so people without an ED can watch it and feel good about the story line, where everything falls into place at the end and the good little girl gets the help she needs.  I think that's also the reason why actual ED or general mental health experiences are often disregarded or met with a lot of hostility, there's too little ""feel good"" in it. ",False,False

I don't likw opening up about it becuase it will make my EDNOS real and I would like to keep the mindset that I'm just dieting and exercising like a normal person does.  I gave hints to my pysch while high on meds (bc too much of my meds can make me manic) I told him how much calories I take which is 500 then my ""bad eating habits"" and all I got was, ""That's a good thing that you're taking care of you body.""

I mean I don’t know how many times I had to lie about not eating or people have walked into public bathrooms when I was purging and not said anything. It’s just not a problem a lot of people want to deal with really, so they’ll easily eat up your excuses and want to believe them because they don’t want you to have a problem.

I didn’t get help until I asked for it, and my mom didn’t even believe I had a problem. It took months to get diagnosed even after I “came clean” to my mom. She even told me that she had ignored it for so long, any thoughts that I might have a problem, because she believes my life would be better if I were thinner. Thinness trumped everything until I “looked sick.” Only then did anyone care, but it was only the rare few who did. I had a teacher get all up on my case and go to my guidance counselor because she was concerned. But it was only after I appeared blatantly disordered in front of her and was emaciated.  I think part of it is that it’s too awkward to address it, or maybe that people are oblivious to it. Perhaps both. But I definitely agree that the media portrayals are probably not the usual case.  I think a lot of the time, an ED can be an ‘invisible illness.’ Many of us don’t have parents like the mom in Starving in Suburbia. Compounded with how our society functions, I’m not surprised that we are able to go so long with out disorders a secret. ",False,False
