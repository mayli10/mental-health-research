I’ve been suicidal since I was really young (13 years old), and got 2 attempts already, and got hospitalized 3 times now, not long ago I had to go back to the hospital for an emergency because I was desiring to hurt myself really bad and fantasizing about ending my life, but I was like craving it, dreaming about it with my eyes wide open and I absolutely had too look for help... so please, consider it doing it. Remember you are suffering but killing your self won’t end with your suffering but will pass it to your loved ones (I maybe shouldn’t say this but this is the only thing that keeps me going on, maybe it’ll help you too).

It can feel like the world is falling out from under you and that you're not finding the footing or grip you need to hold on, but you have to live through it. You will find a steady ground and you will realize the growth and strength you have. The hardest thing I have had to do is to live through wanting to die. I tried to take my own life multiple times, and the worst feeling is waking up and realizing it didn't work. But I am glad I lived through the attempts, I'm happy to be here. I am sorry that your dad doesn't understand and you don't feel comfortable telling him, it feels isolating. But you have us here on this community and we will help you in the ways we can. I don't know the reasons why you want to die, but I would suggest to try to get a therapist. My therapist has been a tremendous help and helped me overcome my suicidal ideations. If you don't feel like that is an option then please message me. I might be able to help or at least listen. You are worthy of living, you are worthy of having a life, and you have a future you who is so proud that you made it through. You will live to become the future self who overcomes this present moment, you just need to keep moving forward. Move forward through tears, move forward even if it's out of rage, move forward just to spite others, regardless of how you move forward and what it takes you have to keep going. I promise you that what is now is not forever, and the path out is not easy nor fair but you will get through it and find justice for yourself by becoming yourself and making the right choices for you.

In fact, I was even hospitalized for it.   I felt like there wasn’t anything left to live for, so I attempted suicide. The thing is, now, I’m sitting here cuddled up with my pup and a mug of coffee and I’m SO glad my attempt failed.   It’s easy to think that things won’t get better when you’re at your lowest point. However, things  and situations will always change. You won’t be stuck at your current situation forever, even if it does feel like it. I promise. And if your depression is not rooted in your environment and more biological, there are always ways to feel better, like counseling and medication. I had absolutely no motivation to seek help, but I was basically forced to when I was in the hospital, and now I’m so glad I did it. Let me know if you need help finding a therapist. I can help look for ones in your area that take your insurance and if you don’t have that, we can find sliding scale therapists so you can afford to get help.   Today fucking sucks, but tomorrow might not. Only way to know? Be there! ",False,False

I know it feels like you’re stuck and nothing will ever change but I promise you it will. Your life has value and you have the strength to keep going through this. It won’t always feel like you’re strong enough but that’s just your brain lying to you - tell it to fuck off. You are a little badass who is going to accomplish amazing things.
