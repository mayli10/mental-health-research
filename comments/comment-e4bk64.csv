But I finally was so desperate that I had no choice but to keep going. My anxiety went away after I did it the first time. Then it became the best way to relieve anxiety.

For me, it was worth those first times where I was nervous.",False,False

Sorry but thereâ€™s not a delicate way to describe it.,False,False
