I was only trying to illustrate my way of thinking about this by using the numbers that you provided, without mentioning my own specific size and weight.   Not trying to argue that small / short / thin people are oppressed by the clothing industry, just trying to maybe imagine where some of the fatlogic people are coming from when they complain about vanity sizing.",False,False

I had a bmi of 16.5 once. 17.9 recently. I was fine. There were things that were bigger but I still wore 0 and even 2 at MOST stores. I guess if you live somewhere with like 2 stores with fast fashion you're screwed but for the most part there was always something  Hell, half of what i wore then I can still wear now. After a certain point of loss it's more definition and less losing bulk. My general dimensions are the same now as they were at a bmi of 17.9 because i don't have fat bulging out. My thighs are a little bigger but not drastically so. That's what people in fatlogic dont understand.  When you're not fat you're just sort of trimming the edges of your body shape, not drastically altering your overall size and bone structure.",False,True

So every time I fit into a piece of clothing, sure, it's reassuring, but I can't help wondering about the people who are even smaller than me â€” what do they do? Do they get everything tailored? Are they buying actual designer pieces that I could never afford?   It's like, if you wear a size 0 at BMI 21 (which is perfectly fine and plenty small enough), what would you wear at a BMI of say, 18 or under, you know? At least that's where my mind goes.",False,False

I'm pretty thick in the bottom (also a BMI of 21 now ðŸ¤®) and a size zero pair of shorts was pretty good at target. However,  in another Target brand I wore a size 27"" in jeans.

I don't typically shop for clothes there, but I tried once and everything was huge. To be fair, I'm petite and I often have trouble shopping at places like Nordstrom and J. Crew, too, but I also think that lower-end clothing stores do size their merchandise differently than other brands. And people who shop at Wal-Mart aren't likely also shopping at Neiman Marcus for comparison, or vice versa, you know? So I think maybe we're (collectively) all talking about different things when we reference XXS or size 0 or whatever.",False,False
