When you work out, you are breaking your muscles down. I think part of the reason I lost so much muscle on my way to my lowest weight was that I was constantly eating \*nowhere close to enough\* and also constantly exercising... I think, literally breaking my body down faster than it would have atrophied on its own with just fasting alone. Your body oxidizes a lot of the protein that you ingest to begin with, and less and less is leftover for MPS the more of an energy deficit you're in. Lots of studies have shown the body is pretty good at sparing muscle while fasting.  &amp;#x200B;  When you're restricting, nothing in your body wants to exercise. I still remember going to spinning classes and pushing myself super hard and getting literally all pain (and lots of it) and zero endorphins. My body was telling me to stop exercising in every way it possibly could. Eventually I dropped the exercise frequency down, because I just wasn't recovering, it became so painful, and because I had zero energy. I switched to fasting/OMAD which was so much easier because your hunger hormones shut down once you go below a certain calorie threshold anyway, and no matter how much your body tries to metabolically adapt, it can't reduce your TEF, BMR, and NEAT more than a certain amount.  &amp;#x200B;  Of course, I don't actually recommend doing either, what I really recommend is recovering, but I was in no mental state to accept reality for most of my journey. I'm praying for all of you struggling with restricting, really. I don't even really like posting this kind of thing. But please do be safe. Exercising is not going to benefit you if you are in a very significant energy deficit.",False,False
