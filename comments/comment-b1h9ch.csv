There is a system of mechanisms your body uses with prolonged restriction, and temporarily changing hunger cues is one of them. Scientifically it’s called adaptive thermogenesis, but yeah none of the things your body can do will stop you from losing weight when at a true deficit, which is what a lot of people think “starvation mode” does.
