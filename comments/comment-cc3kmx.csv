Feels like weight loss doesn't register in my head unless I feel EXTREME about it, but it really is just dependent on my mood that day.  I hate not being able to be like ""okay, restrict today just to balance out yesterday :)"" and instead I have to be like ""YES SLIP INTO ANOREXIA TO LOSE WEIGHT IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO DO IT YOU MUST BE ILL "" but then I'll fancy some cheesecake and then do that and then it'd fine. I think I'm just lying to myself tbh...   Thanks for virtual hugs! I'm having the worst night and being on here makes me feel less alone :)",False,False

I went through a really restrictive phase in high school/college, but after that I was fine until getting married triggered me again. Now, every week can be different and I feel like I'm just making this shit up. Hugs to you and all the lovely people here!",False,False

In any case, it's also pretty common for people with EDs to see themselves as less sick than they really are.  But restricting and purging are disordered behaviours, and as long as you're struggling mentally, you should absolutely take it seriously and you deserve all the help you can get.   Stay strong!!",False,False

I'll go for like a day without eating and be like ""yes this is the start of your ED"" and I relate to so much stuff on this sub, but then I'll eat a normal meal and think ""oh lol, maybe I'm just fine"".  I feel like I have the mindset but not the will power, then I feel awful thinking this way and trying to encourage an ED when it ruins so many peoples lives. If you get a answer lemme know lol",False,False
