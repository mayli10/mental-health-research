I have so much FEARS that if I restrict TOO much I'll look like a skeleton and lose my boobs and butt and good skin. But if I EAT too much I'll gain fat and convert all that lean muscle I've been gaining into fat and lose my abs. I'm constantly bumping between 800-1300 cals. But now that I'm a  more athletic person I'm afraid I'm losing too much too fast and then it won't stay! Sigh.   Ugh don't get me started on ""since my clothes are different and I ate dinner an hour later last night is THAT why j put on two pounds over night????? What the fuck brain  ",False,False

Thank you !!  And I think the good news is : Being aware of this what-the-fuck is a *huuuuge* in getting some peace and rest from this ridiculous and tiring nonsense. You'll surely get some little bit of head space back, and be able to have thoughts that are your own. Even when the disordered thoughts come back, I am sure they will do so with ever less frequency and amplitude over the long run. Because you are an alert and clever one. And you deserve peace.",False,False
