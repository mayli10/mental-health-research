As the other poster said, it's pretty normal for people to get bloods done as part of their annual check up, so probably a reasonable idea to get them done anyway since it's been 15 months. As well as electrolytes/vitamins which can be out of whack when you eat weird, they generally test for things like thyroid issues and anaemia - both of which I had but only found out after a blood test in a normal check up.   Why are you reluctant to go back to the GP?",False,False

For ppl with EDs it could save a lot of health issues if anything is off like vitamin or mineral deficiencies, remedying will make you feel better! Personally I really would recommend getting it done as part of harm reduction, maybe there's a way you can get it done without going to a GP? Here you can just go to a private lab and order whatever tests you like for yourself :)",False,False
