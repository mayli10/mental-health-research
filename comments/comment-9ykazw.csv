That doesn't mean you're all grand every other day, nor that your issues are to be taken any less seriously the rest of the year! I'm glad I helped making you feel welcome here, and please, know you're welcome every single day. Not just the 19th of November.",False,True

It is certainly true that historically eating disorders have often been viewed as a female issue and this is very harmful. I think it is very helpful for everyone to remember that those of all genders suffer from eating disorders. It does make my heart sink when I see people slip up in posts and assume all members/readers are ""girls""/""ladies"" etc. even when I know a lot of people mean no harm. Thanks for making the post.

I'm going to be manic for a second and in this reply to myself I will offer up a bit of context for anyone interested (in the words of someone else) I found posted on /r/askmen.    [‚Äì]AkakiaDemon 264 points 8 hours ago  I feel like it's important to point out International Men's Day is still sort of new. (Starting in early 90s) And isn't fully viewed as a international holiday as just a professor of Tennessee made it up on his father's birthday. This is the big thing. Technically it's not even a national holiday for the US.  International woman's Day had an organization push for it to be legitly viewed as a national holiday (Woman's day) and it did by 1917 and moved from there. (By 1975 it became viewed as an international holiday.)  Now does that mean people should ignore it? No. But you have to understand the weight of this. If we want Men's Day to be accepted we need to use it what it was originally for and spend less time focusing on a Google doodle. We have to start by making it a national holiday and moving from there. And we have to make it clear that Men's Day is meant not to undermine Women's day but to focus on many toxic masculinity that exist and harms men. (Not showing emotions, being always strong, having to make the most, being the bread winner, etc)  ",False,False
