I don’t even know if I would be able to enjoy being with a guy. But I feel like I really really could. But I know I like girls, but like 90% of the time my like is also a bit of idolization.   I’m sorry you’re going through this though. Know you’re not alone since it seems like this post drew a lot of us confused bi gals out of the woodwork.",False,True

I’m glad to know I’m not alone it’s just weird cause people expect you to be confused about your sexuality in a gay way and not a straight way? So, like when you try and explain to friends they nod but I can tell it’s kinda a wtf moment.   And it’s rough because I have a long term partner who I love with all my heart, but it’s still a lot of emotional turmoil to go through. Maybe it helps and maybe it doesn’t that my partner is fine with the idea of me experimenting? And I don’t even know how to feel about that either.   I also wonder if I would lean more on the straight end of the spectrum if I didn’t have an ED because I generally lean more towards girls.   I just feel a lot of feelings and very unstable about the whole thing and I can’t help but wonder how it would be to sleep with someone and not spend the whole experience doing a comparison. Maybe nice??? Maybe it would be good??? 😪   Thanks again for sharing with me because I just needed someone to commiserate with. I’m glad I’m not the only one who’s been down this road.",False,True

After identifying as gay since like 7th grade (19 now) I just recently came to terms that I like boys too n it’s so weird. I grew up KNOWING that I &lt;3 women but sometimes I can’t help but question the authenticity of it. But I’ve found I compare myself to men too so ED: 2 Me: 0 🤠  however I do believe that sexuality is a spectrum and at the end of the day you will fall for whoever you fall for and with recovery it’ll become easier to navigate your feelings (idk I’m sorry if this didn’t help but just wanted u to know ur not alone bc when I was going thru this I rly thought I was the only one),False,False
