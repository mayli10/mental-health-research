I rationalized that I wasn‚Äôt practicing loony diet restrictions if it was a lifestyle many people all over the world followed. I told myself the new rules meant I could eat as much as I wanted as long as it was vegan and not to feel guilty if it was vegetarian. It eased my anxiety around eating out because it limited my choices and helped me pick what to eat based on what I felt like eating rather than what the least fattening dish was. I also wasn‚Äôt self conscious about turning down food the way I had been and I was more comfortable around other people eating the dishes I could eat. That‚Äôs what I told myself, anyway. A friend called me out, said I was coopting a legit diet people adopt for ethical reasons to disguise my disordered eating and while she supported my recovery she didn‚Äôt think my new way of eating was respectful or helping me fundamentally. Or something to that effect - I don't recall taking her criticism very well. I eventually went back to my unhealthy relationship with food. ",False,False

At the time, I was around a lot of toxic people who genuinely were trying to sabotage me by pushing sugary shit on me. (And I attribute this in part to my eventual development of really unhealthy food-related thinking). It was really hard for me to resist back then. But most of it had dairy. So I pretended to be vegan around them. ",False,False

But mostly to restrict and not be judged for it (or to be judged for holier than thou veganism lol). I eat eggs now, so I guess I'm only vegetarian. ",False,False

Now being vegan for me is not linked to my ed at all. I actually managed to get fat while vegan so I guess when I realised vegan doesn't equal skinny I continued to be vegan just for the ethical reasons. ,False,False
