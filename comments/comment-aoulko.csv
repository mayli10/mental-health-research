You can get it in drops that you put under your tongue or buy a vaporizer with liquid (I prefer that). I think they also have oils you can apply to your skin. It doesn‚Äôt make you feel high but it makes the anxiety and stress melt away, it‚Äôs so relaxing. It‚Äôs helped me so much, I haven‚Äôt even purchased weed yet now that I‚Äôm off probo because I‚Äôm saving for a pen but that‚Äôs saying a lot for how much I used to smoke.  Definitely contact your probation officer and ask if that‚Äôs allowed before using though. You can purchase it at almost any tobacco shop. Things will get better ‚ù§Ô∏è just pay off your fines as soon as financially possible, I got let off much earlier than I excepted and they mostly just want your money. I live in MI and wherever you are might be much more strict.   Another thing, if you visit r/probation, there‚Äôs helpful information but don‚Äôt let it scare you. It‚Äôs really not so bad as long as you pay them and don‚Äôt smoke.",False,False
