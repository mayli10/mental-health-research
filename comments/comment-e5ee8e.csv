I am a physicist and I respect the shit out of social/medical/nutrition research, having a clear conclusion that is binary is impossible, it is always a spectrum with a preferred distribution. I guess in this case it is like that, hard to tell and very individualistic.",False,True

The paper I linked (I admit, I only skimmed it) does indicate that a lot of the responses to hyperpalatable foods are drug-like. I think that saying sugar is like cocaine (I believe there was a study that claimed that) is a bit of a stretch. In general, data tends to be unclear, but people want black and white answers and like to put a spin on things.  I don't think it's exactly comparable to drugs because you can't genuinely live without food... but you could live without high fructose corn syrup.",False,False

I know she can be biased but when she reviewed the research the conclusion bis that there is no clear answer yet. I agree with you and also she pointed out process food (specially sugar) and the mentality of ""bad"" that makes it into binging. that is why my question was regarding the research methods. The results of that paper for example is that it *may* be to some extent, and some others say it is not as drugs. So not really conclusive and clear, which make this people that preach that sugar is worth than meth a little exaggerated and unscientific.  What I wonder is that, is it fair to try to compare food addiction to drugs? As one is needed for survival and part of a biological response and the other not.   I think this is relevant for people who have BED or bulimia, those trigger foods tend to be of the more addictive type.",False,True

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5946262/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5946262/) was the study the person linked.   I think Abby is biased towards intuitive eating and HAES and heavily influenced by her past with restrictive eating; however, I think that for people with restrictive eating disorders, worrying about food addiction is not a priority.",False,False

She only compares drugs to food in the first half because that’s what diet culture pushes to demonize sugar.   Having been nearly completely recovered over last summer, with an emphasis on intuitive eating, I can say she’s absolutely right about restriction being the #1 trigger for binging. Especially with sugar. When I made chocolate 100% available 100% of the time, it eventually stopped being so exciting. Occasionally I’d crave it and eat it and sometimes I wouldn’t. And that was all there was to it.",False,False
