Try your best to actively choose to eat more, however much that may be for you.  And be proud of yourself for it.  If you restrict heavily, it’s not an if, but when you’ll binge.  And binges when you’re body is really really hungry are bad.  And even if the first one isn’t THAT bad, when you restrict to compensate it, the next one will be worse.  And it just gets worse from there.  And losing weight gets harder in the long run because you’re compensating for those primal binges where you eat god knows how much.   So on average you’ll probably lose the same amount of weight with a lot more mental turmoil.  Sorry for the rant currently in the weeds drunk binging on Tex-mex after restricting for a week.",False,False
