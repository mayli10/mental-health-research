I tell myself ""200 calories today + a black coffee"" and it's fairly easily. I like to liquid fast during manic episodes too, as mine rarely last more than a month, so i gotta squeeze in as much self control as possible. The downside is I typically get addicted to caffeine and workout too hard and then when i go back to normal my muscles are strained, I'm exhausted &amp; having to deal with caffeine withdrawals. The flip side is in my down episodes I binge eat. Hard. Like the only thing i drag ny wretched body out of bed for is some fucking Wendys, but I use it as motivation to get myself out if bed, showered, dressed, and at least out if the house for a minute.   My LoseIt weight loss trend graph looks WILD haha.",False,False

Health services diagnosed/attempted to diagnose me with bd when I lived in the UK, but I believe it was a complication of stress, poor sleep, poor diet and use of drugs that led to the symptoms that would confuse it with bd in my case. I really don’t feel well if I don’t sleep though. Sleep is king!",False,False

I have bipolar 1 disorder and there's been times while restricting that felt similar to mild mania, but they never escalated to the point actual episodes did. Lack of sleep is a major trigger, and excessive caffeine intake can also trigger mania as it is a stimulant.",False,False
