One can not have an eating disorder without disordered eating).   Been in recovery off/on for 15 years, I’m good.

That’s the hallmark of an ED.   Lol no. The hallmark of an ED are the thoughts. You can **absolutely** eat ""correctly"" or ""healthily"" with an ED. Ever heard of orthorexia, to name one?  &gt;Overly processed food is absolutely bad for humans, there isn’t really a solid basis to dispel that and millions in research funding that has proved it.

We first have to agree what ""unhealthy eating"" means, which we don't - also, the answer to your question is ""it heavily depends"". It might very well be the right path to full recovery. Actually I do personally believe that discharging the whole bullshit idea of there being a ""correct"" way of eating is crucial to reach full recovery.  &gt;Statistically speaking, your chances of dying from a TBI on a bicycle are stupid low. It’s still advised to wear a helmet.   Uhm, this comparison doesn't hold up. The correct comparison would be: unless you're going over a certain speed and hit the ground with your head from a certain height, you're basically never going to have any injury or negative consequence. In that case, wearing a helmet would be pretty superfluous.  &gt;Eating disorders are complex and grossly misunderstood but the eating/nutrition components are science backed as well as straightforward.  Absolutely not. There is nowhere near any consensus about which nutrition approach is best to adapt, or which is the one that best prevents relapses, etc.etc. - which is why if you go to 10 different treatment centers you're going to have 10 different experiences.

Is there even such a thing as ""eating correctly""? Or even just ""eating healthily""?  Literally no one with an ED eats correctly or healthily. That’s the hallmark of an ED.

Treatment providers fail their patients with alarming frequency.  When the *entire* field agrees on something, that generally means something. There are factors to relapse prevention and the biggest one is catching the disease early. Do we really think that supporting unhealthy eating will not cause a relapse? The field is severely lacking in terms of treatment and resources, I truly believe the whole “feed em and free em” inpatient/PHP/IOP attitude feeds it more than anything else. There is almost no continuity of care after discharge and even if there is, it isn’t long term. Considering food is the issue in an eating disorder, it’s liable to flare from time to time.   &gt;Refeeding syndrome also is way overblown a risk.   Statistically speaking, your chances of dying from a TBI on a bicycle are stupid low. It’s still advised to wear a helmet. Meaning, why take the risk, even if it’s small?

Virgie Tovar; “Take the cake“ is what it's called I think. Basically, it's about how we should take the piece that's offered to us or refuse it, instead of causing the person cutting the cake any more effort (like cutting a smaller piece), saying that whoever publicly asks for a smaller slice was being selfish and just trying to signal that they are “good“.  Garbage video. Body acceptance isn't ""accept what you're given and never try to change"". **That's the non-functional humans in WALL-E.**  So by the same logic, is it supremely selfish to ask for a second piece of cake? That takes effort too.  Any group gets some terrible people involved once you get enough people in the room, whether it's an idealistic movement or a Facebook group.  Take the good bits of body acceptance, but feel free to ignore anybody who's obviously just a self-righteous dong who found an amplifying platform.  I like the idea that our bodies shouldn't be divided into conventional good/bad, and they're our own business when they're not hurting anyone else. It doesn't matter whether we choose it, or not.  Got a piercing? Cool, that's your business. Got an unusual nose? Nbd, we're not cartoon characters, we can't all look identical. Got shamed and told to gain or lose weight for aesthetic reasons? Too bad, there's nothing wrong with prioritizing your body being comfortable to live in.  Got scars? That's okay; bodies are neutral.  Moles? Stretch marks? Asymmetry? Dick size? Tit size?  Same. Not good/bad, just born the way it's gonna be.  Body acceptance gets really urgh when it's ""fat acceptance, and also thin bad, fat good"".
