I realized this after always seeing the tiniest girls eating pizza and snacks at the cafeteria on campus.

Then she says ""yeah, I only see you eat yogurt""  &amp;#x200B;  It's kind of hilarious how apparent it became that no one pays all that much attention to my eating habits, aside from thinking I don't eat much, yet I remember every instance of eating in front of others.
