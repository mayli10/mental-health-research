What are you going to do about it?   I'd start whatever it is asap. You can choose to live your life this way or another, it's up to you. I can tell you the path of ED only leads to misery &amp; pain so I personally urge you to choose the recovery path. It's in your hands.",False,False

Most people at best feel slightly annoyed at a deficit &amp; don't overly obsess or think too much about it otherwise, regardless of how strict they may be. They look forward to going out or treats &amp; enjoy ""cheating on the diet"" or whatever.  If it's affecting your mental space or your quality of life, I'd say that qualifies as an eating disorder.",False,False
