Like they’re toned and they eat and work out and their bodies stay consistent, like I’m underweight but my body doesn’t even look half as good as theirs bc I just starve and lie in bed feeling sorry for myself lmao.",False,False

And I still hate them, so wtf, gimme some of that confidence!   Demi, Kristina and jpj the chicken nugget king are for sure my favourites, I want to protect them",False,False

This is the first time I’ve watched since fully relapsing and being underweight. They used to be such thinspo, suuuper triggering, but now I’m thinner than most of the girls on the show. Feels weird man",False,False
