I start doing the math in my head about how much a treat here and there would add up to in a year.  OP, seriously, though, beyond this hellish math olympics of calorie counting we go through, sometimes small treats prevent huge binges in the future.    Our disease makes moderation difficult.  It sounds like you're going for moderation. That should be rewarded (with M&amp;Ms and a sense of pride!)",False,False

Hell, I treated myself to a small bag of andes mint chocolates on a bad day last week, and it didn't send me over at all. I actually lost a pound the next day!

If you're making healthy choices 80% of the time, that 20% can be a flexible for treats that you don't have to worry about. And then it helps to remember that it takes 3500 calories to make a pound, so as long as you're eating a healthy portion a treat will not negatively impact your weight. Sometimes, we all need a little chocolate :-)",False,False
