He kept saying that she looks cute because shes small and I tried to ignore it as much as I could but I ofcourse began to compare myself to her.  Also each time (literally each time) he tried to pick me up he'd say ""damn you are so heavy I can easily  pick up ""..."" shes so light"" and that fucked me up big time. Even though we arent dating anymore he keeps comparing me to her",False,False

Instead it was my current boyfriend who is super supportive and loving but has the mentality of ""better suffer for a short while and make the weight loss fast than to suffer for years of training and specific eating"" because when he was fat he lost all his weight super fast from disordered eating and exercising and was able to go back to normal eating just fine",False,False
