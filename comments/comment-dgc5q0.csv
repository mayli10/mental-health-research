I recently went through this process although I am older. Are you in the U.S.? Do you know what insurance you have? Google your city, and “eating disorder therapy.” It’ll bring up many options. Some will have insurance listed online and for some you’ll have to call. As long as you have your insurance information (your mom likely has the card with info in her wallet, if you don’t have it), some money for any costs not covered (I’d estimate ~$50) and transportation, she doesn’t need to be a part of it.   Having said that, there are also local support groups and if you’re in school your counselor can help with that.",False,False

Search the doctor or therapists that you would like to help you out, so you have the info ready. For 2 reasons, ""Mom I know what I need and THIS persons can help me"" not try keto or what ever fad diet you think,  you need a professional.  AND because you solve all the situation in one siting, and there will not be a ok I have to push again on this topic because nothing was done and maybe she forgot or changed her mind (this happened to me every time even when I was already in therapy).
