I used to see her a few times a year before that.... She looks pretty scary now to be honest.   She has always been a skeleton. As a kid I just thought she was one of the thin people.

She was so incredibly tiny. I’m sure she was underweight. She’d never eat lunch at school. Maybe an apple sometimes. Always said she just got full easy and was never really hungry. She was also obsessed with being a part of the popular kid group. I knew that eating disorders existed at the time. But I didn’t really get them or understand. I haven’t seen her since, we went to different high schools. But she showed up last year in my recommended friends on FB. Still skinny as ever. Idk if she has one or not but looking back, it would not come as a surprise.",False,False

In my eighth grade science class, my lab partner was very thin and had a little book of how many calories were in different foods. I think she also admitted to purging once while we were talking.
