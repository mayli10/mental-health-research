Almost kinda reminds me of the mall track in Mario Kart. Lyrics that make me thing of ED shit:  ""Cool cherry cream, nice apple tart I feel your taste all the time we're apart Coconut fudge really blows down those blues But you'll have to have them all pulled out After the Savoy truffle You might not feel it now But when the pain cuts through You're going to know and how The sweat is going to fill your head When it becomes too much You'll shout aloud""",False,False

Here's some lyrics:  ""You feed the beast I have within me You wave the red flag, baby you make it run run run Standing on the sidelines, waving and grinning You fondle my trigger, then you blame my gun And when I think of it, my fingers turn to fists I never did anything to you, man But no matter what I try You'll beat me with your bitter lies So call me crazy, hold me down Make me cry; get off now, baby- It won't be long till you'll be Lying limp in your own hand.""  Always reminds me of some of the shitty boyfriends y'all have around these parts.",False,False
