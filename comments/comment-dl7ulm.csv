Honestly it does the same to me, I tell myself not to plan ahead too much because it puts too much pressure on me but if I have the energy to cook something healthy I figure I might as well make enough to last a few days so I don't just eat what's readily available (bread).

Idk if that’s remotely the same thing as what you’re talking about. It’s mainly me being lazy and using my calories and both a ceiling and a goal, so I’m kind of cheating",False,False
