I have a BMI of 28 and im the only one who's allowed to call me disgusting. No one else can. No one else can say shit like at least they're not accepting it like other people and be all high and mighty about being legit thinner than me.

I interperate this to be along the lines of my claim  &gt;Conclusion Overweight and obesity is associated with increased risk of all cause mortality and the nadir of the curve was observed at BMI 23-24 among never smokers, 22-23 among healthy never smokers, and 20-22 with longer durations of follow-up. The increased risk of mortality observed in underweight people could at least partly be caused by residual confounding from prediagnostic disease. Lack of exclusion of ever smokers, people with prevalent and preclinical disease, and early follow-up could bias the results towards a more U shaped association.  I don't know if you're arguing that under 20 is shown to be ""better"" according to this study? I don't think that is the gist.  &gt;However, another potential explanation might be if people gained weight over time, as some underweight people might become normal weight   This right here shows that they don't quite know why their results were the way they were and it could have been skewed because people gained more weight. They even admit more study is needed.   You keep looking to verify your belief is real. You can make a lot of things fit your agenda if you dig through enough studies.

These are all low 20s, not in the teens at all. The tidbit you shared is just an explanation as to why the mortality of underweight and low end healthy weight people is a bit high. It doesn’t reflect the outcome of the study.  I understand where you’re coming from, really. At my lowest adult weight, I was a 15.8 BMI, and was most consistently hovering between 17-18 BMI. I harshly judged anyone heavier than me. I had to be the thinnest in the room or I wouldn’t be in the room. I wouldn’t have friends thinner than me, but was also disgusted with people larger than me, so I just isolated myself. My grades tanked because I wasn’t eating and couldn’t think about anything except for not eating. I thought I looked okay, but still considered myself to be “skinny fat” and “flabby”.  I’ve started the process of recovery and am now at a 22.5 BMI and can finally say that I was ILL. I was mentally and physically ill and not okay. I hated myself once I first got over a BMI of 20. After the initial shock of the additional weight, I feel much more attractive now. My husband can’t keep his hands off me, as opposed to how he used to get quite upset touching me. I get more positive attention (compliments on my hair, makeup, being hit on, asked on dates, etc) out in public as opposed to concern (“are you okay”,”you should eat”, etc). I look better in yay clothes and feel like an adult woman rather than a child for the first time in my life.  Eating disorder brain doesn’t want that. ED brain doesn’t want to get better or accept that you are unhealthy. It will tell you that healthy, attractive people are “too fat”. It wants you to feel this way because ED brain wants to be comfortable.  I can’t really advise you on how to get there, or if you want to get there at all... but just remember that you are disordered and your thoughts are not rational. Most ED thoughts are not rational and will manipulate and isolate you if you give in to them.  I don’t know you but I care about you and wish you the best. ❤️",False,False

It has been shown that weight loss associated with disease before baseline is associated with increased risk of mortality254 and that in people with stable BMI there was a linear increase in risk of mortality with higher BMI, while in those who previously experienced weight loss (likely because of chronic illness) there was a more U shaped association between BMI and mortality.255 Any further large scale cohort studies or pooled analyses should investigate these issues further by incorporating repeated anthropometric assessments during follow-up.""",False,True
