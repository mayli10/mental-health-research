Firstly, she may not want to find this post and realise you have shared this information about her online.   Furthermore, please don't beat yourself up about being a bad boyfriend back then because you didn't know about the best way to support someone with an eating disorder. You never know- if you had silently condoned it, it may have triggered her more and made her restrict more which could lead to serious health consequences, even death.   If you wanted to be the most supportive, you wouldn't just ""overlook"" it. You should encourage harm minimisation, create an open and trusting dialogue about her ED where possible, guide her to professional mental health support, be sensitive of the way you praise their appearance or comment on their food.",False,False
