In general, it’s common for rape victims to make themselves less attractive after they’ve been violated. I ended up gaining weight and shaved my entire head of hair off (wtf) after I reported my rapist. I spent 3 years b/p after it all happened. Now I’m relapsing into restriction because of a new trauma that also triggers my rape trauma... I just can’t eat.  On some level, though, I do like the thought of restricting being the same thing as learning to say “no” and seeing the scale go down as proof that my “no” matters. “No” wasn’t enough for my rapist.",False,False
