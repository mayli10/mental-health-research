Usually itâ€™s over, sometimes by a considerable amount. Itâ€™s annoying because Iâ€™m like...what do I take out?? The chicken? The rice? I guess I could figure it out pretty closely based on calories per cram of protein/carb/fat but thatâ€™s WAYtoo much effort for a 5-minute microwave meal lmao. And some components have absorbed more sauce than others, how does that affect things?? (Iâ€™m v heated about this lol)  But then other times itâ€™s significantly under so I guess it all evens out :P",False,False
