I’m still currently fueled by people telling me I look good and how they don’t recognize me anymore. People now just are worried about be saying I want to lose more. I see no progress, to me my body looks exactly the same as it did back then. It’s a struggle and nobody understands it :/",False,False

I haven't lost enough weight for it to be noticeable yet, but any time I see the number drop I just want to see it drop *more*.  It's a constant cycle that never really ends.",False,False

I definitely think that my idealization of thinness and a fat-free body is something I've really built up in my head, but it would probably be a lot easier to actually want to recover if the ideal wasn't reinforced by everyone so blatantly. And I'm not overweight, I'm actually underweight. People still tell me I'm looking great especially if they haven't been around me in food situations enough to realize something is up. My so has told me with a furrowed brow ""Jesus you look thinner every time I see you"", and then five minutes later run his hands over my ribs and hipbones while telling me he's the most attracted to me he's ever been. LOL. I kind of wish that little heart trouble would come along and just wipe me out already.",False,False

Maybe I want to get to as much weight lost as you so I can get those compliments lol",False,False
