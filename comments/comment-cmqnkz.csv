I do this at night and saran wrap it in the fridge for the morning. It’s like double the size of normal oatmeal and only more water,False,False

This is 150 cal, way better hot (more volume and creamier and sweeter) but also possible cold. You need: 1 teaspoon chia, 1 teaspoon hemp, 2 tablespoons oats, 0.5 cup almond milk, 10 blueberries mashed, 1/3 of a banana mashed, cinnamon and vanilla to taste. Put it in a jar with a 2 tablespoons hot water overnight and in the morning you will have a ton of volume! Or skip the wait and just throw it in a pot to boil (this also makes the banana sweeter). This has great macros and is very filling, I have it for breakfast every day.",False,False

Those are 120 on their own. You could add a teaspoon of chia and unsweetened cashew with a touch of almond and it should be hovering around 150. You can mix it up by getting the variety pack, they have banana, peach, blueberry, or strawberries and cream",False,False
