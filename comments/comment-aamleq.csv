In fact, you're absolutely *right* right now. Your body needs all that food, and believe it or not it needs some fat, too. Tell your mom she's being really unhelpful and if she wants you to get better, she needs to stop. Your recovery and your body's healing is what matters right now, not your weight or fat or even your reactive eating. You need that food. Your body needs that food. When it heals, you won't be eating so much anymore and your weight will stabilize, you'll stop gaining. You're gonna be okay, but right now you need to listen to your body and give it what it needs.   I hope you're doing okay today. Stick with it, it'll get better ðŸ’—",False,False
