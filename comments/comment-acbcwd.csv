If you're not committed, they can't, and you can leave any time you wish. They might tie being able to participate in the program further to you agreeing to things like a tube.  If you leave AMA because you don't want a tube and are dangerously underweight, chances are high they will try to obtain a hold when you actually leave/have left, so authorities might come calling to bring you back with force.  The only 100% secure way to avoid force feeding is to avoid treatment of every form, even your GP, who'll want to weigh you and even if you refuse assess your body weight visually and will act on it.  Risk of avoiding treatment is the possibility of death, of course. ",False,False
