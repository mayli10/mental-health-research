Once your body goes into ""Starving"" mode, you end up becoming a hoover with anything in sight. It's prob a lot smarter to eat healthy and routinely so you can maintain a goal weight rather than just lose 5 pounds in a week and than binge yourself to the point of no return. I'm trying alternate day fasting or OMAD. I wouldn't mind being orthorexic either, tbh.",False,False
