But so great of you to try to recover!! Could you talk about this in therapy? Could you talk about it with your friend? You sound like such a kind and thoughtful friend. But you need to take care of your own health first. Can you tell her that you want to be friends but that you can't deal with ED triggers right now? When I was in a relapse, I lived with my best friend who was recovered and it worked really well bc it was never competitive, she just tried to comfort me/help me get better, and I looked up to her so much. She means the world to me and I would never have wanted to trigger her. But this was just my situation.",False,False
