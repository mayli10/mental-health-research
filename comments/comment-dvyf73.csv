It truly is having to decide forever and forever that makes it so hard!  I know people who have other addictions need to make the choice everyday too, but when you‚Äôre an alcoholic you don‚Äôt have to also drink 1 shot a day on top of recovering which is what the ed stuff is like.",False,True

I like that with all the others one can just straight up not do them. It‚Äôs so hard when you must eat every day though.,False,True

I get very easily addicted to stuff and successfully quit a lot of things but damn... EDs are the most addicting thing by far and I don't know if I'll ever be able to let go.,False,False

My ED is so difficult to let go of because it's this fear that I'll either starve or feast and I don't know how to just eat maintenance and not be obsessed.",False,False

I mean now that I'm saying it, it makes me feel like a fake. But I think it was real enough to put me in danger, I was underweight. I tried recovering a few times and it never caught. I only ""fully"" recovered when I decided to recover for my friends and family, not for myself (because I hate myself so that wasn't enough motivation). I've been eating healthy for a bit now, not like I've been counting the days. I'm still in the habit of eating below maintenance, so I have to remind myself to eat meals. I don't count calories anymore, I don't weight myself. I'm just saying this to you because if you keep telling yourself it's impossible to ignore calories and weight, you're lying to yourself. You CAN do it, you just don't want to yet and that's okay. You just need to find a reason.",False,False

People say ‚Äúit‚Äôs not so hard‚Äù and even if in the moment it feels hard, like damn, in the grand scheme of things, it isn‚Äôt IMPOSSIBLE. What does seem impossible is making that same ALMOST impossible decision consistently forever.",False,False

I told my husband about it once and felt like it perfectly captured the struggle. Also congratulations on not cutting! üíï,False,True

I used to cut myself for like 10 years and quitting cold turkey and one day I decided I just couldn‚Äôt do it anymore and I haven‚Äôt done it since February 2014. I thought about it a lot at first and now it barely crosses my mind  But there‚Äôs nothing I can just stop doing to fix this shit. I can‚Äôt avoid food. I can‚Äôt avoid seeing calorie labels. I can‚Äôt avoid looking at myself in the mirror or avoid feeling my clothes rub against my body. Anything that triggers my ED behaviors and thoughts are IMPOSSIBLE to avoid,False,False
