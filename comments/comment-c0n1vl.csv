And from the outside, it looks like all the other women around me jumping from fad diet to fad diet. But I think the difference is the obsession and how much it controls my life/mind.  I am also struggling to find a balance between being healthy while not diving too far. It is truly so hard with the obsessive thoughts that always tell me I'm not truly ""healthy"" until I've taken it to the extreme.",False,True

I wish doctors would take the mental anguish/life altering affect that like OSFEDs have on people. Just because it isn't necessarily showing outwardly doesn't mean someone isn't suffering and should have access to help.,False,True

I struggle a LOT with body image issues and disordered eating. It’s very easy to get away with ED behavior when you’re overweight and it does feel like you don’t “genuinely” have an ed. My worst behavior was a constant binge/restrict cycle and i’m trying desperately to try and lose weight in a healthier way (1200 cal a day).,False,False

I go through restriction and than binge phases. Like sure I’m not going to die but I am truly tortured by my relationship with food if that makes sense?,False,False
