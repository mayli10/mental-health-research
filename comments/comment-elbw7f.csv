It's hard when I'm feeling sick bc I want to work out every day but it's much less fun when I feel gross :/ hopefully it's just things changing in my routine and I'll feel better in a few days",False,True

The warming rice bags seem like a good idea, just don‚Äôt make them too warm, last time I used an aggressively hot water bottle and it made sweat + ended up feeling even more uncomfortable.

You shouldn't work out if you're feeling sick. You're not a failure.  Trying a new machine works your body in different ways, so I'm sure you got a good workout anyways!   Please try to stay safe and healthy. I know the feeling of a workout never being good enough, but trust me, it is.",False,False

I've been feeling sick the last few days -- maybe it's because I'm trying some new food things or I'm just anxious about school. But I have some of those warming rice bags so those might be good for my stomach too?   It's funny bc I've been complaining that I'm not tired after my workouts and now that I am, I'm still complaining lol. Thank you for the response, you're very sweet and it means a lot to get some reassurance",False,True

Take a well deserved break but if you need someone to rant at I‚Äôm happy to listen! + if you have a sports drink and aren‚Äôt too uncomf with drinking it it should help w the nausea or if your stomach is feeling weird a hot water bottle will help (use water that has steam but isn‚Äôt boiling so it‚Äôs more gentle)",False,False
