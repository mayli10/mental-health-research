I think if I had myself as a friend, I would show concern for them (thankfully nobody did lol).  Its hard to say what you should do. Maybe you can focus on finding something new that makes you happy? Your ED won't go away just by doing this, but it could give you something to focus on and be proud of that isn't related to physical appearance.",False,False

It’s gonna sound cliche, and repeated, but you won’t feel any better about yourself at your gw. You will probably feel worse, physically and mentally. You aren’t a good judge of how you look due to the body dysmorphia and your eating disorder.",False,False
