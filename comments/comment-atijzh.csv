I cant tell if people are telling me the truth or just lying to be polite. ,False,False

I hated myself and everyone else every step of the way. That's the only help I can offer. Telling you that you are not alone. That there so many people just like you - just like me - that had some *pinnacle* moment where they crashed and binged drastically in a short period of time.
