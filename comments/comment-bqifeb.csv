The (maybe only) upside of depression and mental illness for me is I feel grateful for having an insight into other peoples suffering and being able to offer a few words or actions to make them feel less shitty, because that's all that counts most of the time - feeling a tiny bit better.  I like that about myself although it makes me feel some kind of disdain for people who haven't suffered mental illess (even though I don't want them to?) when they don't understand and prioritise really useless things like new cars, having money, etc.  I like me for having compassion for the underdog.  I'm also better than I'll ever admit irl at crafting.  X",False,False

I actually made a veggie pizza the other day that was about 150 cal a slice (which is amazing for cravings) and i've been doing zucchini spaguetti almost every day as a side dish because they like it a lot and its really easy to make.  I like to look for low cal recipes and modify them with food i have. Also i've noticed that when I cook I lose my appetite so thats a plus too i guess lol,False,False
