Me and my boyfriend have been dating for 3 years. I started developing my ED one year ago. The last 6 months it has taken over my whole life.  He was aware of my binges, but he never understood and realized the seriousness of the situation.  I came out to him about it almost 1 month ago.  It honestly made our relationship worse:I feel guilty because now he feels like he's a part of it, and is really concerned and worried about me.  He doesn't know how to deal with it, so he has asked me multiple times to recover.  I just told him that I appreciate it, but I'm not ready at the moment.  Right now I'm restricting and I've lost some weight, which he seems to enjoy, but he always complimented me no matter how ""heavy"" I was.   I would recommend you to have a nice talk with your SO. Tell him/her about how you feel, what's going on on your mind, what should he do, the reasons why you don't want to recover.  Always remember that if he's asking you to recover it means that your SO truly cares about your health.  Good luck. â™¥",False,False
