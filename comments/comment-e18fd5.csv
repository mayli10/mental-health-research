Aroy-D is good. They’re like 25 calories per serving. You can just add water and chicken breast, shrimp, tofu, etc., plus some vegetables (frozen peas, green beans, and broccoli are easy). The instructions all say to use tons of coconut milk, but 1/8-1/4 cup per packet suffices to add flavor and cut the spice. I’m making this sound complicated, but these dinners are super easy and taste restaurant level good.",False,False

I’ll make a wrap or sandwich but somedays I’ll have a salad or cook some chicken with beans. Idk I usually just eat whatever is most convenient, and I’m recovered. Food becomes more of a convenience and pleasure thing once you don’t worry about it as much",False,False
