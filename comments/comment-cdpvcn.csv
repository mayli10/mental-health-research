I know someone who's five feet tall, who eats over 2,000 calories a day, and loses weight despite being significantly underweight already just because she never stops moving. There's a point at which the deficit is just so much that it doesn't matter that your metabolism has slowed down. Your metabolism has probably slowed down, yea, and you'd probably notice that through things like having a hard time dealing with either the heat, cold, or both, or like having a poor immune system. It's hard to say based on weight loss, but your metabolism also controls other things that are going on in your body.   Your brain is unlikely to ever convince itself that you're sick enough. I was inpatient and not allowed to go on fresh air breaks because I was such a fall risk and I was still convinced that I wasn't really sick. It's a distortion from your eating disorder attempting to convince you to continue to engage with it. Absolutely makes sense and I think most people do experience it, and it's not representative of what's really going on in your body.",False,False

Like I said, I have been restricting and losing weight for a really long time at this point but my brain is having a hard time believing my body might be in some sort of “survival mode” and holding on to weight because surely I’m not sick enough/underweight enough for that to happen..? If that makes sense?",False,True

She says that the low metabolism thing only actually applies when you're not providing your body with sufficient energy.,False,False
