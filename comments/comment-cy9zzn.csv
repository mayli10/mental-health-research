But to be fair, your body does work more to digest the food, so I can't condemn myself as a total idiot for thinking this way.",False,False

At my heaviest restriction the only things I was comfortable with were SF jello, tomato soup and coffee. I like the idea of feeling light and not bloated so I regularly replace meals with smoothies when I'm having a rough day mentally but need some cals to survive. It's not necessarily calories that scare me/stress me out but heavy food sitting in my stomach, even if the liquid equivalent has the same amount of cals.  Very backwards, I know, but such is the nature of EDs...",False,False

Like, I love all the frozen drinks that you can imagine, and when I was ""Dieting,"" rather than admitting that I have an eating disorder, I cut out all drinks with calories first, so they've been harder for me to add back into my diet.",False,False
