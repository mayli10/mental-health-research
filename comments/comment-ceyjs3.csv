In my experience, this is relatively common and is not necessarily of concern - but Iâ€™m not a doctor, so if youâ€™re worried, always ask a healthcare professional.   Situations that are very serious are when you have large amounts of blood in your vomit or if your vomit is black/brown and looks like coffee grounds. Both are a sign of active (red) or previously active (black/brown) gastrointestinal bleeding. This is a medical emergency, and has warranted me a trip to the ER before.   Be kind to yourself ðŸ’•",False,False
