People like to say things like ""scars tell a story from the past"" or whatever, but I remember my past without the scars and I'd rather not have to look at them on a daily basis.",False,False

I got a large, prominent tattoo to symbolize a dark and trying period of my life years ago. The tattoo itself was fine. It was done well. I liked it enough at the time.   Fast forward a few years later and I absolutely can’t stand it. I don’t want to be reminded of what I went through every time I see it. So now, I’m spending A LOT of money to get it lasered off. And it sucks. But I want it gone.   That’s just my experience, of course. Everyone is different. Trust your gut. I should have.",False,False

I'm personally not a fan of the symbol in tattoo form and think its overdone.",False,False

I wouldn't worry about having to explain it to people or worry about them ""diagnosing"" you. Most people won't recognize it and I think it's pretty much understood that you don't pry into people's tattoos.   If you're not 100% sure about it, these are the questions I'd ask: 1. Do you want a *NEDA* tattoo, or just something that symbolizes your ED? I really don't know that much about NEDA as an organization. 2. Your ED is definitely a part of your life/identity right now, but what about 20 years from now? I love the idea about growth and support, but maybe you don't want to be reminded of these dark times on a daily basis. Or maybe you will feel like you want to totally free yourself of that past, but now it's been permanently marked on your body (which you should be able to reclaim as a beautiful, wonderful thing).",False,False
