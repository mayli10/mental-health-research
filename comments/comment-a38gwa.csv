I've been in this game for a decade. For six years I couldn't make it stop on my own for longer than a few months at a time (yay seasonal depression!) The only time I successfully recovered was with therapy. I know what it feels like for it to stop and I'm DESPERATELY trying to get back there. I've tasted quiet and it is PHENOMENAL. ,False,False
