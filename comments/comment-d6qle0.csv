Like should I see a new doc or what lol. I mean I only see him like every 2-3 years so it's probably ok, but :thinking: I am fairly certain most women who aren't active would gain on that amount.

It was suggested I'm flushing out my electrolytes and I should replace them, primarily salt.  I was too lazy to pop to the shop and get an electrolyte drink, and I sure as hell was not about to break this fast prematurely on the off chance loss of salt was causing the issue. I decided to settle for a fingertip of marmite dipped in salt.  However, at the same time I went to eat it, one of our dogs went to jump the gate to get to the other who is currently in heat. In my haste, I told him no and inhaled what I was just about to swallow. Cue me sputtering and struggling to breath, whilst trying to make sure he stays put, making it worse.  I grabbed my drink and momentarily was unable to swallow because I was too focused on trying to breath, and I thought my doom was upon me.
