They smell like fish. If you're looking to sub pasta it won't do the trick, but if you like long fishy veggies, you're in luck. They'd pribably be best in a stir fry.",False,False

My preferred method of cooking is letting them soak for like an hour, boiling them, frying the water out of them, then adding a tiny splash of water back in and proceeding to add sauces. Also they can get expensive so go to Chinese supermarkets and get their types that are usually way cheaper. ",False,False

I also boil them quickly after rinsing, then dry them out. I like to have an entire package with a creamy type sauce, like cauliflower (dairy free) Alfredo or blended avocado. I don’t really like them with tomato based sauces because I feel like the texture just doesn’t go. With cream-like sauces, they ‘fit in’ more I guess? ",False,False

I made them with a spicy tomato and herb sauce, and a really sad version of cacio e pepe.  Personally I'll be sticking to zucchini noodles but if you feel like eating something pasta-like certainly give shirataki a try.",False,False

Keep rinsing til you think you can’t possibly rinse anymore, and keep rinsing. Dry em real good and toss in seasoning. I use garlic salt, paprika, and red pepper flakes with a lil lemon juice in a pan. Throw in some broccoli or veggie of choice ",False,False

They’re similar to tofu in that they have no real flavor on their own and absorb what you’re cooking them with. I drain them, rinse them, dry them with a paper towel, then put them in a dry pan and spread them out to further steam out any water they’re holding, then add sauce.  I usually make my own sauce for them with 1 tbsp PB2, 2 tbsp teriyaki sauce, and 1 tbsp water! They’re really yummy imo, I eat them almost every day :) ",False,False

I live in Japan, and shirataki (also called konnyaku, and it comes in a variety of shapes like a brick or ball shaped) is everywhere, including school lunch. The noodles are pretty good stir fried with vegetables or in hot pot or other similar soups. I would never eat them in any ""western"" type of prep, the texture is just too bouncy and rubbery. :/",False,False

When I do cook with them I like to wring them out a bit to get as much liquid as I can out because the gelatinous texture they have normally makes me want to vomit. I always stir fry them with veg and a sauce with lots of potato starch to dry everything out as much as I can. I think they're nasty with pasta sauce. ,False,False
