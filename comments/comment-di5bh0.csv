I literally just wrote this metaphor in my journal the other day... lol crazyyyy   And also...I feel you deeply on this (obviously since I used the same metaphor). I am still really struggling with trying to leave the comfort of the cage, though I know it is holding me back. It seems like all I have. Sending strength your way.",False,False

I guess if I continued with the analogy, depression helped me into the cage. I've had depression in some capacity for so long that I don't know who I would be without it and the idea of losing my entire identity (even if I don't like myself much) is terrifying. Because what if me without depression is bad? Or worse, what if I'm just the same?",False,True
