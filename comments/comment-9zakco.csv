Sorry if it's kinda vague but it was a year ago I went to the doctors so I don't remember in detail. ,False,False

When I tilt my pelvis back to where it should be my gut disappears.   I looked up some floor exercises to help counteract the tilt. Have you done any and if so have they worked?,False,True

It's also something that's kinda easy to self diagnose or realize you have yourself and then see a doctor about because it's fairly visible and causes a lot of pain in day to day life. ,False,False
