My exercise interferes with me completing assignments when I'm at uni, but when I'm on holidays all I do is exercise as I've got no other hobbies to fill my time with, so exercise it is. At this point I'm not even sure whether my exercise is due to my eating disorder or boredom and procrastination.",False,False

I’ve done the following:  * wrote my college application essays while walking (all 10k words of them) * read multiple novels while writing notes in the margins * wrote code for a programming competition (python on the iPad is surprisingly okay) * edited a friend’s essay, scanned it, and sent email feedback * setup a new media server on my cluster because my dad asked while I was exercising. Typing terminal command on a tiny ass keyboard while going as fast as possible is a journey but I managed to deploy everything in like half an hour   But also the having energy is such a huge thing. I finish up for the day at like seven sometimes and I’m just so drained I can’t focus well enough to do anything.",False,True

Like your comment about listening to readings just gave me a major flashback to me last year listening to my notes on 2x speed while on the treadmill the day before a final because of course exercising was way more important smh.   Also imagine having energy to be productive because you're not exhausted from working out. That would be wild,False,False
