I just usually feel like it about my hips.  Lets be honest you can't change your bone structure hahaha   I think it's crazy, the thoughts get warped by the voice, and then it's hard to drown them out again.

Like, it's either supernova bright so you see every dimple and bit of cellulite or it's dark and casts unflattering shadows.  I did find a few things, thanks for asking!
