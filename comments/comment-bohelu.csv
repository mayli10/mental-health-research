I just want to share a bit of advice I learned on the old proED sub. I used this advice for self harming and with my eating disorder. We all have bad days and if we slip up we shouldn't start at day zero, just take one day of our streak. Say I go 10 days binge free, but then I slip up and binge on the 11th day I should just take one day off my streak at I would be 9 days binge free. We are too quick to dismiss our success in recovery and all to ready to focus on a bad day. It really has helped me to have mostly good days with hiccups here and there.                   Feel free to ignore but thought this might be helpful to someone as it was for me.",False,False
