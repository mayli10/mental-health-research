I weigh it all out/ portion it the night before if its possible, put it all into MFP, and do IF. I start eating around 2pm the next day, and stop eating at 8. I plan 3-4 small ""meals"" or sometimes just small pre portioned snacks that  I eat every 2 hours. Setting timers helps too so when you wanna just binge eat after you allow yourself to eat that snack you can look at the timer and be like- nope. still have an hour and 50 minutes to go. walk away.   Hardest part of this for me (bc the fasting till 2 part is easy) is stopping eating past 8. I get so so irrationally hungry just bc the binge urge is there and I just wanna fill my body up till I burst.   Best ways I've found to avoid a binge is to draw what Ive already eaten that day, or journal (even if its incoherent rambling), play a video game that takes up all my mental capacity, watch a movie, or just continually PUT OFF the binging. 15 minutes. ok. 15 minutes more. ok, 15 more minutes... last thing I try is to sleep. you can't eat when you're sleeping.   Hopefully some of this helps &lt;3",False,False
