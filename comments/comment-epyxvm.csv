As soon as you restrict you're almost condemned to binge the next days.  Because you not only deprive your body from essential nutrients which it tries to get in as quick and as much as possible after some time, but you're also setting your brain into the thinking mode of ""I cannot have this"" - but as we all know, what we can't have we always want. What is ""forbidden"" is _exciting_. So you end up in a binge because once you start you simply think ""Fuck it!"" and somehow cannot stop because in the back of your mind you think ""Well, I'm going to restrict tomorrow again anyways, so why not feasting today. Tomorrow is a new day"" (and all this bullshit)  And then the cycle begins anew.  Long story short: as much as you'll probably hate what I'm saying but: don't restrict yourself! It's the beginning of all evil.",False,False
