Could do a low carb thing for a week before I can only think of bread. This time I did low cal with vitamin high stuff, and I don't really get those cravings this time. It sucks at first, but once you're stomaches shrinks you'll feel pretty full on it. I do crave sugar some times, but it's not bad. I know people swear by intermittent fasting, but I'm not sure about it. Good luck.",False,False

I feel absolutely horrible and guilty when I let myself eat on my days off work. Like, I know I’ll be alone and no one will know if I don’t eat. Why don’t I jusf fast??  I tend to get over my guilt, though, by telling myself that people I love would want me to eat and they would be hurt if they knew I didn’t. Also, if I don’t eat, I’ll likely have to lie to a loved one that I did eat and I’m strictly against letting myself lie. (Lie anymore that is, my ED used to make me a bad bad person and I’m trying to be better and stick to my morals)",False,False
