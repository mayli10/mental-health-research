Consider that you probably burn between 1500-2000 calories in a day and that 1 lb is made up of 3500 calories. For two lbs you would need to burn 7000 calories. You might burn up to 6000 from normal behaviour though. It may seem like a small difference, but relative to the time frame it's huge.  Also, congrats on having a PhD and a mortgage by 23. üôÇ I'm 22 myself and it's going to take me at least another two years to get just a diploma. üôÉ And there's no way I would be buying a house right out of college. Of course, I prefer apartments anyway so I would need to be mega rich to afford a mortgage on a highrise condo, but my preferences don't change the fact that I and most other people around our ages can't even come close to manager all of that.   Like, you must have student loans, phone bills, Internet bills, electricity, and maybe even car payments and insurance to pay for, but then on top of all of that you even have a mortgage and home insurance. Plus, you have pets which costs even more. You said you have 10 bills and I was only able to come up with 8, so you seem to be spending a lot. You're either making lots of money or you're spending all of your income instead of saving. I get the sense that it isn't the latter though. My first impression of you is that you seem like the kind of person who would have a savings account.   You have accomplished a lot for your age. It's pretty amazing that you managed to do this despite your eating disorder complicating things for you. You have no reason to beat yourself up over this. If it was something you could control it wouldn't be a disorder. I get that you want to be just like your neurotypical peers who can do simple things like eating without the struggle, but unfortunately life doesn't often let us have it all. I mean, personally if I hadn't been help back by both my mental and physical health I would have gotten my degree by 20 and I would have been well into my career by now. I had it all planned out even. I know how to live a comfortable life on just $35,000 per year and I would be making minimum $65,000 as my starting salary, so I could have had my student loans paid off by now and more than enough in savings to do all of the things I've been waiting for since I was a teen. Gosh, I guess it's been about 7 or 8 years by now that some of my goals have been on hold for me. But hey, life happens. Sometimes you can do everything right and still fail because of something out of your control. And not everyone gets a good start. We just have to accept that.   As I said before though, you're already doing far better than most 23 year olds and this in despite struggling to even feed yourself enough to get through the day. I think that's enough to prove that you're a pretty amazing person. You have a lot to feel good about yourself for. Not to suggest you ignore your ED and stagnate, but focusing too much on the negatives in your life and not enough on the positives will stress you out and make you sick which will just create more problems. So keep your chin up :) you're still young and have plenty of time to improve. For now you ought to be happy with the progress you have already made in your life. Just stay focused on your goals and never stop working to achieve them. You'll get there eventually.",False,False
