To me, trying it on means you haven't integrated recovery into who you are or at least aren't fully set on the whole recovery thing. So I am no crystal ball, but I would wager relapse risk is not low in this case.   I do think it's perfectly fine to analyze your relationship with food and see if the gain is related to symptom switching, which would definitely require delving into new areas of recovery. For example, when I recovered from anorexia, I symptom switched to bulimia. When I recovered from bulimia, I dropped the purging, but kept the binging, which led to significant weight gain. So for me, treating the new binging disorder *was* part of my recovery, and weight loss organically happened from that.   Otherwise, if you are set on making changes, I would try to not fall into the trap of weighing and measuring. See if you can find obvious lifestyle issues that you can change without needing to get into the micromanagement that your ED requires. I'm fully recovered yet successfully losing weight I need to lose slowly, because I am addressing things that don't require me overanalyzing things, i.e. paying attention to my fullness cues more, or focusing on emotional eating versus eating for hunger or fuel, and trying to eat more balanced menus.  Does that make sense? If you are new in recovery, I would be very leery, but if you have time under your belt, I would go with small changes and no measuring things, including yourself.",False,False

This is my worst relapse (but not my first as previously thought) and it has been the only time I've been able to sustain anything more than 15lbs.  Stress and bottled emotions trigger me, so its been a while coming since losing my husband in 2015 and losing my 3rd pregnancy in October. All it took was a doctor telling me my obesity was a factor in my miscarriages for me to fully spiral though. I think if I had better mental health and any kind of support system things would have been different. I can honestly tell you I don't think there's any ability for anyone with an ED to lose weight without relapsing.",False,False
