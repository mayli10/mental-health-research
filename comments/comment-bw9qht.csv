By bar the most prominent out of anything else. I also have hip bones and okayish collar bones, and my spine as just started poking out, but it's almost invisible to me. That being said, I have a wide rib cage and an inverted triangle body type..so basically, even though my butt is so small that it hurts to sit on because of bones, my upper, particularly my arms and upper back, carry enough fat probably be able to be classified as medically overweight. I'm getting a boob reduction later this month as well.  I wish I could stop losing fat from my lower body and just lose it from my upper body for once. It's the whole reason I'm so insecure in the first place. I envy pear-shaped women so badly; at least you guys look like actual females. I have the body of a mini, effeminate man.",False,False
