I told my parents that so many times.  If I feel Iâ€™m losing control over a situation? Starve myself. If Iâ€™m sad and upset? Skip a meal, you dont deserve food. Someone is angry with you? Starve yourself, youâ€™re not hungry anyway.  Pretty much make a mistake or even exist = starve yourself",False,False
