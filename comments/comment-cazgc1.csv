And also, when you put it down, calibrate it by stepping on it and off immediately so the scale weighs itself. It should then say 0.0 pounds/kg. Th√©n you can step on it and weigh yourself.   My weight was fluctuating a lot before, one of the reasons was that my scale wasn't calibrated.",False,False

If it has removable batteries, you can try resetting it by taking them out, waiting ten seconds, and then putting them back in. You can also try putting a heavy weight on the scale to see if it registered correctly (if you have 10 or 20 pound weight in your house. alternatively, a big unopened bag of flour or sugar will usually say its weight on the front, you can use that too). if it feels like its stuck at a weight, try stepping on the scale holding something heavy, then waiting until it times out and stepping on normally again.  digital scales are very finnicky and be uncalibrated by moving them at all, but if you know its flat and the battieres arent dying, then some of the above should help calibrate it and have it working accurately",False,False

I totally understand.  Sometimes around 2 weeks when I‚Äôm about to get my period, my weight fluctuates so high (around 1kg) and I‚Äôm like what?! But then after it goes back to normal :)",False,False
