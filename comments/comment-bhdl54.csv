But like, I'm below 5 foot. And I have always been kinda softer looking even at my lowest weight. I struggled trying to dress myself in boxy blazers and edgier silhouettes and fucking hated myself when it never looked right on me, I look like a kid playing dress up even when things are fitted properly. Because some of those shapes, textures, and silhouettes were too dramatic for my body type, and that's why it looks so off! I can totally achieve the look I'm going for when I dress for my body type. And this is so much more specific then ""apple or pear shaped"".   But it really helped me understand and visualize how people have different builds, different body fat compositions, skeletons, and face shapes. And the guide never states one is better than the other, the purpose is only to understand your own body and face and to present yourself in the most flattering ways possible. I fucking love it. Aly Art has some good YouTube videos on the subject if you're interested!",False,False
