Tbh though if I didn’t know I would have freaked! I do have an alarm on my phone for picture day every week and that is the best before and after I could have ever asked for! Very motivating even if at the time I feel like a dumpster fire-the next week I can look back and feel like a bad bitch.,False,False

Now I watch my weight by my collarbones.  I know I’m losing when they become more obvious, gaining when I can’t see them.  Not sure how much I weigh but I think my collarbone visibility is “healthy”  And that’s my method",False,False

And honestly I’ve been thinking about buying a scale a lot but the first three weeks my mom and sister was here so it’s not an option, than I had to move and all... now that im finally settling in (my contract for this room is 6 months) I think I might buy it... idk",False,True

As for moving around a lot, buying your own scale might not even be an option at all. It also could be a very healthy thing to not weigh yourself so often. If you do go somewhere to weigh yourself maybe just try wearing really light clothing (t-shirt, leggings, take off shoes) and the numbers on the scale will still be accurate. Also if you have the opportunity to weigh your clothes somehow you could weigh yourself somewhere else and subtract the weight of the clothing.  Not having a scale when you’re so used to weighing yourself can be scary but I believe that you will figure it out &lt;3  2 months without weighing yourself is actually a huge feat and it just shows how resilient you are!",False,False

There's one very close to where I live called Miniso (I believe it's international, but I'm not sure) that sells everything extremely cheap. I bought a scale there for around 25USD and so far it's been very accurate and works perfectly fine.",False,False
