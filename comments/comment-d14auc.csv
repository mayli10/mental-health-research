In the past I'd always wake up and my stomach would be flat/as flat as it could be, but now I think I fucked myself up too much with the binge/fast cycle and it doesn't work like this anymore lol.",False,True

I will say, if you do it, lay on your right side for a little right after, and keep close to the bathroom. Seriously lol. And it's definitely not something to be done super frequently (salt). I do prefer it to lax though when I need it. Hope you find some relief ðŸ’œ.",False,False

I'm gonna look saltwater flush up and see if maybe it can help me. Thank you very much for the replies! &lt;3,False,True

I do a digestive massage every day or so, drink a fuck ton of water and always walk 15-20 min after eating. If it goes longer than 5 days I'll do a saltwater flush (Dr recommended, because I'm not a fan of lax). I do eat dairy, but not much tbh.",False,False

Do you have a routine or something to alleviate it? Do anything different? I'm fasting today but I know tomorrow I'm gonna cave lol. Also do you eat dairy? I'm beggining to think that I might be a little lactose intolerant (if that's a thing) and maybe that also fucks me up. Ugh I'm so annoyed of feeling this huge all the time, I just need it to stop.",False,True
