If so, get a new therapist immediately.  If not, you could ask him to not give you food-related advice or that you don't want to talk about food with him, but also know that your ED probably ties into a lot of your life and you're going to find yourself omitting a lot of your struggles to avoid talking about food with him.  Overall tip: look for a new therapist. Don't feel guilty- he probably didn't need to rearrange more than one or two people who I'm sure already had pretty open schedules, and therapists do that often. They also have a lot of client turnover in general, as far as the therapy business goes. Don't hurt yourself to keep him happy- that's not how therapy works!",False,False
