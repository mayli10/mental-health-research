The one I had wasn't comfortable by any means but it was fine unless it was hot out. I'm glad you didn't use yours again!,False,True

Fortunately I never used it again, those fajas do not work, they are noticeable and they are uncomfortable. I only used it because i was at my HW. But yes my mom has got me the faja, a real corset with metal, redotex,etc. (Years ago)",False,False

Though it's really not surprising given how prevalent fajas can be in the community. I also didn't ask my mom for one. She's had body issues since childhood, and she's always projected those issues onto me and my sisters, though I'm happy that my sister's didn't have fajas given to them. I guess I was ""fat"" one, or something. But it was always stressful to make sure no one saw it during gym class, and once this girl poked me and asked me if I was wearing a faja, which was super embarrassing. Sometimes I wonder how different things would be if I hadn't had that. Would I have learned to like myself more or would things have ended up the same regardless? I'll never really know.",False,True

My mom and I are Latina and I remember she always wore one when working around the house or in the garden.   The summer that I was 15, I became very obsessed with cardio and restricting my carbs. My mom gave me her spare faja that was too small for her. I'm not even sure why I started wearing it, I don't think I asked for one but I  wore it when I exercised and when I went to sleep. By pure coincidence (maybe??) this coincided with the beginning of my spiral into AN. I no longer wear one and probably never will again.",False,False
