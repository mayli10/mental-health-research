I also find when it's cold I want to go to the gym more to warm up. It's been so hot here I've been struggling to work out because getting to the gym is such an effort in the heat lol ",False,False

But that's not so much ED related as it is that I don't function well without exercise regardless. People are amazed/annoyed that I'll get up to run in -35 Celsius... but I won't fucking sleep if I don't.   Can't commute by bike, though, and less commuting by walking. So restriction is harder, because there's fewer calories overall to eat back, so I spend way more money on things like shirataki noodles, slightly questionable stimulants, etc. In the summer I can lose weight fast on 2500 calories a day or more. Winter is more like 2000. 1500 if it's a taper week. It sucks. ",False,False

Winter makes me so goddamn depressed lol. I did finally hit 85lb so at least I have a new lw. Basically I am falling apart.",False,False

I much prefer shorter days and milder temperatures. In summer I feel too much pressure to be thin and it stresses me out a lot. Generally I don’t mind summer  *too much* if I’m at a LW but that’s not the case at the moment,False,False
