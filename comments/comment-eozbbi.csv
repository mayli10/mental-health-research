Ephedrine is actually banned in supplements in the US due to dangerous side effects (nbd just high blood pressure and heart attacks), but you can get it over the counter in asthma medication like bronkaid.  Combined with caffeine it absolutely murders your appetite and gives you endless energy.  (And trembling, heart palpitations, digestive issues).  A lot of bodybuilders swear by it.  Some people also include aspirin which apparently slows the negative effects on your BP, but I don’t take it because my liver and digestive system are already fucked 🤷🏻‍♀️",False,True
