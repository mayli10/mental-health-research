I want to tone up and have a more fit body for summer but, I just don’t exercise as frequently as before because I just feel low energy from fasting and school. I don’t want to increase my caloric intake just to build muscle, it sounds so scary but so many people do it, I just can’t seem to get around this mental hurdle. I’d rather be small because it’s what I wanted for so long and I finally have it. Just know I sympathize with you ❤️",False,False

Im struggling to convince myself to eat at a slight surplus because more calories = heavier me. I worked so hard to be reasonably happy with my appearance that I just can’t fathom intentionally gaining weight. Like why?   It’s further cemented by the fact that I want to be a faster runner which more weight would just slow me down. But I know if I eat more I probably won’t be as fatigued during or after I run. And I could probably run further faster because I’ll have more energy. But it’s scary.    Every time I think I’ve conquered my disordered eating I’m confronted with something that says Nope! You’re still kinda fucked up.   hugs friend. ❤️❤️❤️❤️,False,False

Oftentimes I’ll browse fitness subs and forums for women that are like “OH HECK YEA BIGGER THIGHS! I ripped my old ones! ❤️❤️” like it’s a big accomplishment, and I get it, I just can’t. It always demotivates me seeing the threads about their shoulders getting too big to fit into their blouses and going from size 2 to 6 even though they are more muscular / fit. Idk. I always felt messed up for feeling this way because it is good, and they’re happy. I just don’t want it for myself ",False,False
