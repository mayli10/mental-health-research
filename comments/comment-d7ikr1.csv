It’s sad, but true. No matter what body type is “desirable,” there will be women who have it naturally. In the early 2000s, I remember girls being made fun of for having similar bodies to what’s popular now! I hope that when I have kids, we will have made even more progress as women. I can’t stand the thought of the world being as cruel to a little kid as I remember it being.  I’m going to do some googling to try and find the book you mentioned :)",False,False

I’m sure a few people out there are just Like That genetically and put in the effort required to maintain it, but the reality is that for the vast majority of people that’s just not a possibility. Even the celebrities who are the poster children of that body type have (for the most part) undergone procedures to look like that.  It kind of makes me miss the 90s where the “heroin chic” look was in. The goal was to be super skinny but at least you could be whatever kind of skinny your body actually does, as opposed to this weird mishmash of “only be skinny in THESE places but have lots of fat in these other ones!”  ETA: wish I could remember what book I read this in, but the author was saying that there’s an inverse relationship between social freedoms that women have and how stringent/unattainable beauty standards are for them. I think that makes a lot of sense for the situation we’re in now- feminism is becoming a mainstream social justice fight and we have very unattainable beauty standards.",False,False
