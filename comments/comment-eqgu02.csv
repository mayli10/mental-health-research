I was defending another user on EDAnonymous, who was bizarrely being attacked for saying she fit into size 0 Levis — the person in question was basically throwing a tantrum over the fact that even though she was the “same measurement” as me and OP, she wasn’t a size zero. . . and therefore, we must’ve been terrible liars???   She sent me a nasty DM saying that my jeans must’ve been a “grotesquely tight squeeze” because a size zero was blah blah so small blah. Big yikes.   I’m sorry you’ve dealt with this too. My guess is that a lot of people are terribly insecure, and think it’s justified to take out their own self-hatred onto random internet strangers. Anything they say that seems too personal, is likely a some form of projection from their own issues.",False,False
