It's a CDB infused hydrating oral spray that, among other things, claims to help with severe halitosis.    The information in the review is based on marketing materials available at the time, so it is what it is.  I can tell you that since writing that review I've learned that the product was formulated and is being manufactured by the same lab that developed and sells Plaque HD, which is a pretty solid name in the dental industry, so there is some legitimacy to it.    Anyway, the review can be found [here](https://sinplicity.net/2020/02/21/lyfee-a-cbd-infused-ultra-hydrating-oral-spray-rinse/).  I hope to do a more thorough review once more info is available and the actual product starts shipping.",False,False
