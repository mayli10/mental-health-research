I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not alone in this :) that is to say Obvs I wish no one felt like this but I‚Äôm happy it‚Äôs somewhat common and I‚Äôm not super fucked up lol ,False,True

It feels really shameful and embarrassing, albeit validating at the same time. I‚Äôm sorry. :( üíú  I really don‚Äôt know what to say except that I can relate, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel bad for having these thoughts. A lot of us have these particular thoughts. And Fucked Up Thoughts are generally a part of the whole thing, no matter what form your ED is taking. üíõüíõ",False,False

Even though it probably wouldn't, it feels as if it'd be a lot easier to tell people i'm anorexic rather than bulimic (when ppl ask why i'm gone from school). I can feel the disgusted looks theyd give me if i told them.   ",False,False

Like I hate to say it but I also wanted to be diagnosed as anorexic. Less because of the title but more because of what it means. People who have anorexia (or at least how I see it) are more successful at restricting than bulimics (because we binge eat) and end up losing weight a lot easier while bulimics usually stay the same weight or even gain.   I was hoping getting that ‚Äútitle‚Äù would push me to feel like I need to ‚Äúearn‚Äù it and kickstart a successful restrict cycle, but instead I have to face the fact that I do in fact binge eat just as often as I restrict. And like I even binged on purpose because ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a bulimic and that‚Äôs what I do‚Äù   Agh I hate this stupid headspace. ",False,True

We follow a different system in norway so it didn't matter that i was underweight, i was still diagnosed as bulimic. The big thing that motivated me (it's kinda fucked up) was wanting to be diagnosed as anorexic, well, i guess it was all for granted.",False,False
