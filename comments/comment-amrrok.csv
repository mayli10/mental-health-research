I found that switching hands every couple of times I purged gave my other hand a chance to heal up a bit and helped to make the red marks/bruises/cuts a little less obvious.  Not a perfect solution but thats what I did.  If you wanna help get rid of marks that are already there, make sure to moisturize your knuckles with lots of aquaphor/lotion.  Maybe some concealing powder to cover 'em up?  I'm sorry you're feeling crummy after your relapse :(.  We all trip up sometimes!  You'll be back on your streak before you know it, I believe in you! &lt;3",False,False
