So celebrities can't be human now because they're trigerring you? How is that their fault? When did the world start revolving around you? And just because someone is successful and rich and beautiful, they're immune from human struggle? You'd think someone who understands the struggles of having an eating disorder would have the empathy for another.",False,False

Eating disorders and mental illness don’t care who you are. It can happen to anyone. I understand the frustration with people glamorizing it, but as far as I’ve seen Taylor didn’t do that at all, so I don’t understand where you’re coming from here.  It’s really fucked up to claim someone isn’t “suffering” like you just because they’re famous.",False,False
