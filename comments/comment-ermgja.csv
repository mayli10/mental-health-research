It happens to me too. If i may share, I read a quote on this site once that helped me deal with social anxiety and it may help you too : “you are not obligated to be the person you were in the past or the person you perceive yourself to be”. Of course this needs to used with judgment, but ive taken this quote to mean that “just because I’ve been quiet or awkward in the past does not mean that I’m stuck to be this person in the future, and does not mean that they hate me” (not saying that your quietness was bad; but if you want to be a little bit more outgoing, thats ok too!) i know people with ED’s tend to be a bit more perfectionist or all-or-nothing type people but you can maybe try to talk with someone a little more than you normally do or speak up with a joke. Ive made plenty of friends who were a little awkward around me in the past but we are now good friends. You may find some of them dont really hate you though you think they do (and if theyre gonna be petty to the groom’s BFF, because they’re shy, forget them, they dont sound like good friends!!) of course its undrstandable too if your anxiety is really hard to manage now and in that case I hope you do your best getting through this event!  The suit thing would piss me off too though. Maybe you can keep some safety pins around when the day comes to fix anything too big?",False,False
