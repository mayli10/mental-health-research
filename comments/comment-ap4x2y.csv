Because most weight loss attempts happen without addressing the underlying issues that caused the weight problem in the first place (calorie-dense diet, comfort eating, lack of enjoyable exercise, etc), the weight comes back when artificial restriction is removed.  Only those who add more healthy exercise into their lifestyle, cut emotional ties with food, reduce overall caloric density in their diet and become more mindful of what they're eating tend to keep the weight off permanently without restriction. All of these are very difficult to do in the modern world, which is why the obesity epidemic exists. ",False,False

Its yo-yo dieting instead of changing their habits to stay healthier and just increase their calorie intake to maintainance.  Disclaimer: Im not a dietician but fron what ive seen/read.... most women diet by eating 1200-1400cals a day, doing exercise 3-5x a week ..making sure their calories stay within that range so if they exercise a lot and are under their calorie goal they eat extra that day to eat up to their goal.",False,False
