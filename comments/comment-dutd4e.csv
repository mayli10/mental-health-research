If i decide im about to ""binge"" (this usually just means eat a normalish sized meal and some snacks later in the day) i wont eat until ive taken lax. It sort of gives me an allowance, telling me that- yes im about to fill myself up, but soon after i will be immediately emptied. And like others have said, i know its not permanent weight, but seeing the scale go back down is relieving.",False,False

I make a cup around 10pm and my BM happens after a morning coffee - but if I don‚Äôt drink the tea the night before and low restrict the day before I don‚Äôt have a BM until afternoon and that usually sets me up for a binge. Also flat stomach and way less bloating!  Senna tea can be dangerous however, I nearly ended up in ER once because I left the teabag in for 30mins - next day was literally hell...  And Sennokot (UK equivalent of Dulcolax?) is good for emptying out, but I find that it makes me retain water and somehow increases my appetite?
