I'm doing cardio, I was also a mid distance runner in HS and college, it was more my thing than wrestling. I was def cutting unhealthy amounts, but I'm getting back into running and I feel great. Slowly trying to get down to 165 with muscle, I'd be happy with that. It's just tough. My love handles feel like they belong to someone else, and when I feel them tough the insides of my shirt, I hyperventilate and have a burst of sadness.  I'm on the path too though, as it seems you are. Stay strong üí™ PM me any time if you wanna talk about the experience, sounds like we are going through something similar",False,True

Didn‚Äôt finally lose crazy weight till out of HS. 6 pack, clavicles, veins popped on my hands. Still couldn‚Äôt go under 180~ either big boned or just didn‚Äôt get as thin as you. (Were more or less the same height)   Now I‚Äôm Fat AF, my previous relationship has destroyed my self esteem, and restricting is my new best friend. Honestly it‚Äôs not gonna be a quick thing. The body takes a lot of time to adjust. 2lbs a week is the norm for weight loss, so I‚Äôm setting real goals with the hopes I crush them sooner then later.   You could also take up soccer, nothing like running for an hour back and forth to burn crazy calories.",False,False

I was a ‚Äúfat lightweight‚Äù (sitting around 127-129), so the week leading up to races, my coach would make me and one of the boys (who was also a ‚Äúfat lightweight‚Äù) practice in garbage bags to sweat more, weigh in in front of him every day, and scream cute things on the bus on our way to races like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt let Sp00py eat the bread from her sandwich! She needs to make weight!‚Äù",False,False
