It leaked in to my work too. Now that im starting further study I've already had 5 days absent because of this and it's not even the 4th week.    It sucks. It is seriously one of those things where online they say ""does it interfere with work or relationships etc"" and if you say yes it's an issue.  Something I'm working on is honestly just trying to have two or three outfits for these days.   I'm telling you now I've lost friends, fallen behind in studies and probably earned an unreliable rep at my old work place due to avoidance.   On fat days spend extra time on hair and ensure you smell lovely. If makeup is your thing put some extra time in and get dressed last.   Don't let this impact your professional goals and try remember friends aren't just your pals bc ur skinny. They wanna see you no matter what.   Perhaps invite one out for some shopping for said outfits so you can get back on the grind hun xx ",False,False

I've been getting all my shifts covered this week partially because I went on a 3 day party bender of alcohol/cocaine/no sleep which got me sick but most importantly made me gain 10 pounds and my face and body is all puffy and I don't want to leave the house until this goes away. Makes me not want to go out at all because this is gonna take me like a week or two to get back down to where I was. ,False,False
