Seriously, like you said, I can remember half of it. Except the part when I came out and all the boys told me I looked like a girl. Although Iâ€™d kill to be that skinny again.",False,False

P R O M I S E.   And I also promise that you are more critical of yourself than anyone else looking at those pics. I know that sounds cliched, but it is so true.   I went to my 10 year reunion with NIGHTMARE memories of my prom pics (in my head, I looked great in the posed pics, but of course the candid pics are the ones that ended up in the yearbook and on social ðŸ™ˆ) , and literally no one remembered, even though some of those pics were forever embedded in my brain because of the yearbook. Right now it is painful because it is new and fresh, but I SWEAR these feelings wonâ€™t last forever. ðŸ’•ðŸ’•",False,False

It absolutely ruined my self esteem but I just cropped some of the really bad photos so it doesnâ€™t look as bad. And I promise you that they arenâ€™t as bad as you think. Iâ€™m sure you were absolutely stunning.",False,False
