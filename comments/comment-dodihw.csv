When I'm restricting I eat the same thing every day because I know how it fits into my calorie limit and again know that it's quick to make.  I think some of it is because I have major kitchen fear? No idea why but my anxiety has really focused in on cooking and it's just hella stressful for me. Plus I live with housemates who always hang around the kitchen so I get even more stressed out because I feel like they're watching and judging me, especially one housemate who is a great cook. Because of this I've never learned to cook properly so I just make the same things that are 20mins max because I cannot deal with the kitchen.   I've basically been living off stir fry for the past month.",False,False
