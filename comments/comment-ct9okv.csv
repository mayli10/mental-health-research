I could hear people laughing at me trying to push a cart full of cases of water. Little did they know that was me burning calories and why I got the cases of water and soda first. There was no self check out at this particular store. The clerk was just silent and kept looking at the girl bagging me things. I sparked up conversation because i hate awkward. But I knew that they knew what I knew. Or maybe they didn't and I'm just paranoid.",False,False

People buy tons of Whippets all the time (used to get high) and I don‚Äôt blink an eye cause I don‚Äôt even connect it in my brain until later on.

The other thing to remember is that even if the people see it and know, you‚Äôre just one customer and they‚Äôll immediately forget about it. I‚Äôve worked a lot of retail jobs and one was at a vegan juice bar. As someone who always looks out for signs of EDs in other people because #solidarity, I don‚Äôt remember one person there who I suspected of an ED while I was working.

That's what's really helped me be more comfortable in my skin when I'm around other people. We're ALL messed up- no one has everything in check all the time and if they do... that's creepy. There is something beautiful about pain, about being weird, about doing something you don't see everyday. Allow yourself to have this problem and learn you can recover. Who cares if people know you have an ED? Most people don't even notice what the signs are unless they also have gone through it.",False,False
