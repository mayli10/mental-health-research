I only prepare small portions of food so if I want to binge I'd have to go through so many steps to get the food into my face that I have time to think about the consequences and how guilty and ashamed I'd feel after bingeing. would recommend the level of restriction I'm doing most days but other than that I think I'm doing ok !!!,False,True
