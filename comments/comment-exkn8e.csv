I had 8 meatballs cooked in a slow cooker in a sauce made from grape jelly and bbq sauce. I based it off the weights I could find from the meatball bag (they were frozen and cooked so I think that once reheated they wouldn‚Äôt lose too much weight) and then added half a serving of both jelly and sauce to my logger even if they were on the top just to account for the fact that they were in it. Hope my logic makes sense  Had a pudding cup and 3 slices of provolone with it and I sorta feel like I‚Äôm eating like a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù person by my family‚Äôs standards but I miss fruit and vegetables I want my fiber, I‚Äôve been mainly eating Trix cereal because there haven‚Äôt been any other better options while I‚Äôm conserving my safer foods and I‚Äôm up a wall. Most people would probably make a sandwich though but white bread is useless to me and scary as a result.  I‚Äôm not trying to lose anymore weight I say but I have went down a little over half a pound it seems but there‚Äôs also a birthday party of a close family member coming up so I‚Äôm still trying to high restrict and part of me really hopes I‚Äôm being accurate because sauces can be scary and cooked meat is to me too.

I desperately wanted to lose weight, and my ex was tired of me promising and not delivering. After I was so sick and tired of trying to lose weight and not having the will power to restrict that I made the active, conscious decision to throw up after high calorie meals. Then came the uncontrollable binging, and the compensatory purging. Then I was purging even if I only ate 100 kcals of seaweed if I felt like I shouldn't have eaten anything at all in the morning.  And maybe it wasn't obvious to my ex that I was spiralling into an eating disorder. We were long distance, so he only gets small snapshots into my life when we visit each other. Every visit, we'd walk until our feet were sore while eating lunch and a salad for dinner. I'd have a purse full of snacks for him, but I wouldn't dare eat them unprompted scared that he would fat shame me. As I lost the weight, he called me pretty but it felt hollow to me even if it was a sincere complement.  Before we broke up, he took me on three international trips. I spent every flight purging every meal I ate. I couldn't bring myself to feel happy or excited about the travel because in the back of my mind, I was worried about my future - I spent forever running away from the real world and buried myself in education, didn't pick up any work experience, didn't do any internships, and I was 27. I wasn't skinny enough, financially solvent enough, or anything enough to let myself enjoy anything.  And I thought I'd feel better after breaking up. It was a scary decision after a decade of dating. There were so many hurt feelings involved, hurt feelings I didn't even realize I was holding onto. My bulimia dissipated almost overnight, although I still binge and I've gained weight and I absolutely hate my body. I scaled back from throwing up every other meal to maybe once every two weeks. I'm dating someone who cherishes me and loves my body as-is, doesn't shame me for being behind career-wise, and yet I am still not happy. For all of the shit that my ex put me through, I miss our relationship sometimes. Having someone who knows all of my bullshit. The financial fallback. Just all of the history, and feeling like all of the problems I had with the relationship were fixable and I walked away from all of it after he suffered my decade-long depression and self-sabotaging.   I don't know. I feel like at the end of the day, I am my own problem. It's me and my mentally sick mind.",False,False

I'm totally fine with eating other foods I just... don't feel like it?
