It has the opposite effect by raising the metabolism temporarily.  This will lower body fat if paired with a healthy eating plan (if not, can lead to loss of both muscle and fat).",False,False

I've always felt that any small amount of exercise can really make me feel bulky.  I combat this by doing lots of stretch routines alongside my works outs. This way it makes me feel long and lean and limber.   HIIT is the most effective way to build fitness quickly and unless you're eating more than you are burning you won't get bulky.",False,False

You would have to do some serious exertion and high protein intake to pack on the muscle to a visible degree, especially that soon. Stretches may not visible ""lengthen"" the muscle, however getting more flexibility means you can more evenly use your muscles, and also lends to more core strength. More core strength = more of your core doing the work and not relying solely on smaller muscle groups.",False,False
