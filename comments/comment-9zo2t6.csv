Let that happen naturally instead of setting that as the activity while together.    And I'm doing well, how are you on this wonderful Friday?",False,False

See I Am afraid if I don’t mention it’s being a DATE and holding hands they may think I’m looking for friends also in the past when I ask men out they sometimes text me saying they only want sex so I figured I should be clear. You are right though how are you doing?",False,True

Maybe offer up just an activity like, hey would you like to hang out, take a walk and get to know each other? Rather than the deeper no casual sex comment and the hold hands - which some may seem as weird.    Unless you met him on a hookup app, like tinder or the bar at closing time, most guys aren't thinking casual sex first.    Just my advice, as a guy, for future reference, hopefully you don't think I'm being rude.   Good luck on your date!",False,False
