The first time we had sex he was visibly impressed by my body, but seems to like it more now ( slowly getting a butt) as well as my increased confidence and sex drive returning in recovery..... take from that what you want.",False,False

My current bf liked me a few years ago when I was ""recovered"" but we weren't dating at the time. I never wouldve shown my body at all but now we are dating and in pretty UW (currently trying to gain a little though) but when I sometimes send him photos he calls me such sweet things (he doesn't know about the ED stuff) so Im afraid to gain even a little bit because it's so validating :/ just today he was touching my stomach a little and internationally I was freaking out because that's one of my biggest insecurity areas but he didn't pinch or poke or anything, just kinda kept gently moving his thumb over my stomach and I had mixed feelings about it :/ I just want to be perfect for him but at the same time I want to live up to my own expectations:/",False,False

My body was going through hell, but he and everyone around me told me how pretty I looked for having lost the weight.

He is so awesome and the light of my life, but I noticed that when I am a lower bmi, he touches me more and holds onto my hip bones when we have sex. Now that I weigh a bit more ( I told him about my ED and he's trying to help me eat more) he doesn't seem to touch me as much, doesn't have sex with me, and when he does he prefers to be high.   Just last night we were going at it and he had to get high first. I then had to get on top and while I was, he laughed. He explained later he wasn't laughing at me, and i believe him, but why would you laugh at anything while I was on top of you? He also didn't finish, so now I'm heavy restrict mode until he starts to touch me again.  I had a rough night last night üôÉ",False,False

I know for a fact that, in an objective way, I'm looking better than I ever have.

I mean, the other day my little cousin, who is a perfectly normal and healthy weight, was worried she might be fat because some fuckboy she liked told her he would be into her if she lost weight. There are a lot of guys out there who are gross like that, but most of them try to hide it and just lowkey encourage their girlfriend's to lose weight. Like, a bigger girl might be less self-confident and more willing to date an undeserving man so then once he has you locked in he can mess with your head to make you feel even worse while seeking out his approval. As soon as you're in that spot and realize he would like you better if you were thin that's when it becomes an ever-present nagging thought in the back of your head until you lose a bunch of weight. A good man would care more about your health than your looks, but, well, I don't know how many times I have seen posts on r/advice from guys saying they have found ""the perfect girlfriend"" except that she's fat and they don't know what to do because physically they're only attracted to thin girls and of course that's what matters most.",False,False
