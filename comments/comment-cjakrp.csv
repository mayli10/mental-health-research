Maybe then we'll at least have some answers and a better way to know how to work with this crap, because it makes no sense, you expect the brain to be on your side, not to work against you, i dont see much of a logical reason for it, like with many other disorders and such, there isn't any good that comes out of it, from what im seeing.",False,True

There's absolutely no logic behind EDs.. and it's hard to explain to people who haven't experienced it that the way you view yourself has nothing to do with how you view others. I'm not grossed out by other people who may have some extra weight. I am only this critical toward myself.   It's also hard when people tell me I shouldn't feel this way.. like yeah, I'm aware.. thanks. It's not something I have any control over. One friend kinda pissed me off the other day.. he said, ""the only real disorder you have is overthinking."" Like.. no? Overthinking isn't a disorder, first of all. Second, don't tell me what's real or what isn't. I know he was well-meaning.. he wasn't trying to invalidate me.
