However if he says dumb shit over and over again he's an asshole, especially if he makes it seem like you're reactions are over the top. That's gaslighting.

I mean, what if he sent you a dick pic and you said ""it wasn't as big as I thought"", he'd be upset and it would probably make him self conscious and feel rejected or angry and defensive. Either way his response wouldn't be to just blow it off. Regardless of your ED, why would he say that to any woman who sent him a bikini picture? Why would his response be anything but complimentary?  Does he know about your ED? If so his ""anorexic-y"" comment is even worse and if not it's still really not ok. ",False,False

I understand you have a connection with this guy, but I think he should have given more thought to what he said, or didn't say it at all. And then to say *you* scared him off when actually triggered you so badly? He may not understand, but he should understand how much it hurt you. That's such an upsetting thing to hear.

""you don't look as thin as I thought"" is something you shouldn't say to any woman, regardless of ED. He seems insensitive. Boarderline rude.  I remember in college, I had a friend dating a guy that was üî•üî•üî• and one day she goes ""yeah his abs aren't as great as I used to think"" Ummmmm excuse me what the fuck. Appreciate yo man. Don't say mean things like ""oh your abs arent THAT impressive.""   I feel like the same thought process applies here. What kind of dick says anything other than ""damn bb u schmokin in that kini, send n00dz plz""   The other thing is, he was rude and insensitive, you said it upset you, and now he's essentially emotionally blackmailing you into never sharing those feelings again for fear you'll ""scare him off."" That's some BS. IDGAF how upset you were when  you shared your feelings. You shouldn't be afraid to share things with your partner. Your boyfriend is supposed to be a support system, not someone who says mean shit then makes you feel bad about being upset about it.   I know a lot of times it's hard to differentiate when you're being too sensitive - or at least it is for me. But in this instance, I really hope you stand your ground. He said some objectively unkind, thoughtless things. ",False,False

Sometimes its easier for someone to just say something and assume its the correct response. In this case I think he had no clue how to address it and said the worst thing possible. It means that there is time for a honest conversation about the impact of his words and how something so small to him can be life changing for you. It shouldn't scare him away but our self perceptions control our identity so much that its hard to deal with any criticism.  Im sorry it triggered you. Im sorry he said those things. Hang in there. ,False,False
