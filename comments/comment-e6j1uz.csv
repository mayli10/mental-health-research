Unsaturated fats (like in avocados for example) are perfectly fine to eat and provide your body with nutrients it needs to prevent hair falling out/skin looking bad without causing weight gain. HOWEVER, if you’re only eating 300 calories a day even saturated fat won’t slow down/stop weight loss. I speak from experience— I’m an active person so I usually eat around 900 a day and sometimes my OMAD is just a box of Atkins Endulge candy bars (which for a whole box have 250% of your daily recommended saturated fat intake) and I’ll still wake up the next day lighter on the scale. Fat isn’t even like everyone says it is, it’s okay to eat!",False,False
