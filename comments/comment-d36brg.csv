I want to read this story when you're done! :)     1. So, the amount of TAs... Even if there aren't that many clients, I think there are always 5 TAs around at all times. I think this is to prevent anything going awry when one of the TAs needs to go off and do something, like use the restroom or two of the TAs have to take a group on an outing. At the place I was in, the amount of therapists never actually changed! They weren't there all day every day and adjunct therapists pop up from time to time but the amount of clients doesn't affect the amount of therapists/other staff members unless there's a TON of clients. There ARE less staff members on the weekends (no therapists but they are on call, no extra staff members, only one nurse during the day and one at night, and no extra curricular staff members). 2. There is a separate area for billing but you will rarely, if ever, come in contact with the people who work there unless you're older than 18 and are paying for yourself or using your own insurance. I don't think I ever spoke or saw anyone from the billing department in the 4 months I was there. 3. Transitioning and orientation... This is for an adolescent inpatient care so it could be different for adults but this was my experience:    1. I went in with both of my parents at about 8am. I was buzzed in the front door, signed in at the front desk (the whole place looked like a fancy spa), and was led to a conference room.     2. I did have to sign a ton of paperwork, as did my parents, and basically was given a very simple rundown.    3. While my parents were given their own information about the program and what was expected of me and themselves and payment and whatnot, I was taken to the nurses station to get my weight, vitals, an EKG, bloodwork, all that fun stuff. I was then taken back to my parents, filled out some more paperwork, and then we picked up my stuff and took it to the adolescent ward.    4. I had to drop off all of my stuff at the nurses station so it could be thoroughly searched for contraband and while it was being searched, my parents and I were given a tour of the place. I was being stared at the WHOLE time and it was very awkward and embarrassing.     5. After the tour, I was able to unpack my stuff and say goodbye to my parents and then I was taken to the dining room and was forced to eat lunch while being watched because by the time all of this stuff was done, lunch had finished and, of course, I couldn't skip a meal anymore. I cried. I was scared, nervous, embarrassed.    6. As soon as I finished eating, I was tossed right into groups. I wasn't forced to share or anything but I did have to sit through everything and had the option to ask questions and stuff. I didn't because I'm incredibly shy (even worse now). I didn't get my therapist for a couple of days and it took me a while to get comfortable with the other girls but things worked out eventually.    7. I think I added everything regarding my first day but please ask more questions if you have them! I didn't realize how foggy the first day was for me! 4. The duties of the TAs are pretty simple, at least to an outsider. They monitor meals (therapists are never at meals unless that's where they're eating their food or just passing through), they monitor bathroom habits, they run the meal breakdown (where we discuss our thoughts and feelings about our meals. There's a different name for it but I can't remember now and it's frustrating me lol). They sit in on groups to make sure everyone remains chill. They help clients who are struggling with meals or really anything. They run the outings. They ARE the ones who control the phones and all other electronics lol. They also write down client behaviors and basically everything they do/say and pass it on to their personal therapists! 5. All of the clients eat together in the same dining room. The only exception is during family day when the clients eat with their friends/families but everyone is still in the same general area. As I said, therapists are almost NEVER at meals but that's what the TAs are for. The TAs do eat with the clients but they have to eat pretty much exactly like us, they can't over/under eat. And yes, they do eat at the same tables as the clients! There's typically one TA per table, if not more. Nurses come through to bring specific meds at meals, typically breakfast and evening snack. I don't think I ever saw the kitchen staff eat with us but I wish they did, I loved the chef, she was AMAZING.  I hope this has helped as well, love! &lt;3",False,False

So if there are 5-10 clients (my story has about 7 at any given time), maybe 3 TAs on staff at all times? 3 Therapists. Two kitchen staff plus a head nutritionist. 4 nurses plus a head nurse.   Are there also separate administrators who do stuff like billing?  Also, how do you transition in on the first day? I've dropped off my friend at a couple Res places, but all I saw was the filling out of many forms.  Do you have a little time to move your stuff in and then go straight into groups and stuff? How is one oriented -- like, just shown around and explained rules and procedures and introduced to staff and clients?  Also, anything at all you can share about the duties of TAs would be great! I know them as ""the people I ask to unlock the bathroom for me"" and who generally have keys to things (including personal items like phones).  Also also, who has meals together? I know there is often a therapist present during meals, do TAs and kitchen staff also have meals at the same table as clients?  Thank you thank you a million!",False,True

For 5-10 clients, I believe the staff would be cut in half. Each therapist has 2-3 clients at a time, sometimes clients have outside therapists or adjunct therapists come in (I don't know why this happens, it just does) so let's see... The kitchen staff would remain the same since it's already small (I think 2 members). There are about 3-5 nurses on rotation and a head nurse but I believe they would remain the same. There are typically 5-6 TAs at a time (if I remember correctly) so. I'm awful at math 😂  As for the hours, the therapists are in like a normal 8-5 job, 4-5 days a week, depending on whether or not that therapist has an outside office. Nurses' shifts are generally longer, 6-5 but there is always a nurse or two in the building. Night nurses are only there for emergencies or severe cases. I think you're right about TAs but their shifts could be longer or shorter. I know the night shift ends at 6 and that's when the morning shift comes in but the morning shift can last until the next night shift begins. Kitchen staff comes in at 5 and leaves right after dinner. However, if I remember correctly, there are a couple of days where the kitchen staff is gone which is when we learn to make our own meals based on our meal plans. As for the activity runners, they're only around a couple hours on the days they run their activities. Except for the teacher, she's there every day during the week for about 3-4 hours.  So yes, there are superior positions but I might mess up the actual terms. There is a head nurse (Carrie was the one at Veritas, I believe). There is a head nutritionist (I also forgot that there's a nutritionist because I'm a ding bat). I'm not entirely sure if there's a ""head therapist"" as they all kinda run their own show but I was always under the impression that there was one therapist that was above the others. And then there's the owners of the whole place (Stacey and Chase) who come in every once in a while to talk and meet everyone but in the four months I was there, I met Stacey twice and I think I MAYBE saw Chase one time.   There is a dedicated nurses office! There's the nurses station at the front and then there's a door behind it where you go in to get blood drawn and your blood pressure done and other things like EKGs and whatnot. I believe we all got weighed in the hallway next to the nurses station. And it's much smaller than a doctor's office. It looks like the little room you get a check up in or a nurses office at a school but with more technology.  There's also a separate room where people are held if they're a danger to themselves and others but I never saw the inside of that room lol.  The outings were most weekends! Sometimes they were shopping (never clothes, only things like books or makeup or craft supplies. No food, gum, or candy), sometimes they were shopping and a meal, sometimes it was just a meal. You could only go on these outings once you reached a certain level which you typically reach after about a month or so but there were always special cases where you could go earlier or much later. It took me about a month and a half. You can also get day passes to go out with family or friends but you couldn't go out for meals with them unless it was a special occasion and approved or you were a super high level. And right before you went on PHP (partial hospitalization program), you would have a night pass where you spend the night with your family and then a weekend pass to spend the weekend with your family, to see if you're ready.  I hope these answers helped!!  Any other questions?? :) I love answering questions. It's making me nostalgic for treatment lol  Oh! I'd like to add that when you first get there, and for a while, you're not allowed to use the restroom without the door being open and having a TA check the contents. I didn't get off that level for TWO AND A HALF MONTHS.",False,False

Is there someone in a position of top seniority, like a lead therapist or clinical director?     For the nurses, do they have a dedicated nurse office?

In the residential place I was in (Veritas Collaborative in Durham, NC), there were several different staff members:   *therapists* --you were given your individual therapist and you interacted with them at least once a week but definitely more for the first week or two you were there. You also interacted with other therapists because they would run groups or have chats with everyone every now and then. If you needed to, you could request to see your therapist more than once a week after the initial week and if you didn't think you and your therapist were a good fit, you were able to request a different therapist.  *Therapeutic Assistant (TAs)*--these were the people you interacted with the most. They are basically ""glorified babysitters"" (they are psych/social work grad students) and are the people that are with you during groups, meals, free time, outings, etc. There are morning, afternoon/evening, and night TAs. You never see the night TAs unless you're up using the bathroom. They're typically wonderful but there's always a few bad ones in the mix. They don't last long.  *Nurses*--ahhh I loved the nurses. They're very sweet. You interact with them multiple times a day as well. You see them in the morning for weigh-ins/vitals. If you're new, you get your vitals checked multiple times a day. You'll see them for meds and if you need a place to calm down or talk. They'll come draw your blood randomly (that's always fun). They're typically really fun :)  *Group Staff*-- depending on the day, you'll have different groups and each group has a different staff member (unless it's being run by a therapist) so you'll only see these people once a week. There's DBT, CBT, interpersonal (my least favorite),Art Therapy, Dance Therapy, etc.   *School Teacher*-- this isn't in every residential place but there was one in mine. She just watched over us as we did our school work and would send in/receive our schoolwork from our respective schools. She would help us if necessary but she didn't do too much, honestly.  *Kitchen staff*--they make your meals so you see them quite often! You even get to do a few cooking classes with them which is a LOT of fun :)   2. So, as I said, there's a lot of groups and things but here's a typical schedule:    -you wake up around 7am (I believe). You get your vitals and weigh-ins done then you go shower and get ready for the day (aka, get a shower, brush your teeth, put your sweat pants back on, and grab your blanket cuz it's cold)  -you have breakfast at 8 (you also receive your morning meds) then you come together after the meal and discuss how you feel about the meal and about your internal feelings   -if it's the weekend, you just chill until morning snack/lunch. If it's a week day, you typically have a group or two, and then lunch or morning snack (you only have morning snack for the first couple of weeks, most people opt out cuz it's really hard to eat THAT much in such a short period of time)  -you have lunch around 12 and get your afternoon meds and do the same thing you did at breakfast: talk about your feelings.  -you have more groups between lunch and afternoon snack (likely school and DBT) and then between afternoon snack and dinner, you have something like Interpersonal/Dance/Art therapy.   -You also have something called ""sleep hygiene"" RIGHT after lunch. It's basically nap time but you can use that time to journal or just chill. You can't leave your room, though.  -throughout the day, you might meet your individual therapist and there's also some moments of free time, especially when groups are cancelled.   -dinner has the same routine as breakfast and lunch.  -after dinner, you finally get your phones!!! You have an hour or two to mess around on your phones, call family and friends, flip through social media, etc. You can't have your phone any other time so phone time is the BEST.   -after phone time, you have dessert/night time meds and then you go to sleep just to wake up and do it all over again :)  -on the weekends, if you're on a certain level, you're able to go on outings which is fun! You go to craft stores (cuz we're all whores for craft supplies, especially yarn and knitting needles), Target, Walmart, bookstores, things like that. They'll even take you out for a fancy meal (think Cheesecake Factory) if you're a high enough level. It's fun but I'm a homebody so I didn't exactly enjoy the outings.    So I sort of described the groups up there. Interpersonal was my least favorite because our residential group was very cliquey (we were all adolescents, I'm 23 now and was there at 16/17). One group always picked a fight with the other group and it was VERY awkward. I also hate confrontation so I typically ended up in the nurses station with a couple of Ativan in my system lol   I hope this helped!♥️  Oh and I was there from January 2013-April 2013, I had my 17th birthday 4 days after I got there :)",False,False
