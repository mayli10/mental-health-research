The motto they used to repeat all the time in EDA was ""get open, get honest"" about your ED.   EDs can be really isolating, so telling someone about it is taking a direct step against that, which is awesome.  I'd recommend doing it in whatever medium feels most comfortable... It's totally fine if it's over text. When I first started talking about my ED, I would usually say something like ""hey, I wanted to talk to you about something kind of personal and serious for me. I don't tell a lot of people this but I trust you and I think it's important for me to be honest when I can. I struggle a lot with my body image and since (whatever age) I have (insert ED behavior). It really affects my life in a negative way, but right now it feels like the only way to cope. I'm trying to open up more. Thank you for listening.""  And then if they asked how they could help, I'd usually ask them not to talk to others about it and give them a couple ideas - I've found it's way more helpful to have someone to talk to about feelings rather than ED behaviors. The ED behaviors are just the result, the root is the feelings.   Good luck to you x",False,False
