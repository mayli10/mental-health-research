I feel like he would rather see me with a lower body fat..like a concerning weight. Or maybe it’s cause he doesnt want me to turn out like my mom, who is overweight. Either way, it’s fucking shitty",False,True

Your weight should be of no concern to him. It's not like you weigh so much it's potentially a problem. You're at a healthy weight and being at a healthy weight means it's normal to have a bit of fat. If you had no fat at all that would be more concerning. That would mean you're either underweight or close to it.,False,False

Anyway they are morons a lot of the time, so pay no mind to yours. They always think they’re being supportive when really they have zero tact.",False,False

He doesn’t know about my ED so I see how he wouldn’t think anything of those comments. Your response actually made me feel a lot better, so thank you for that! No apology needed for the long message .  I’m so sorry you have to deal with your fathers favouritism.. it’s definitely not an easy thing to live with :(",False,True

I visited my home country a couple of years ago and I was very thin and underweight at the time. My mom mentioned being worried about me but didn’t push it (they both knew I struggled with disordered eating but at the time they didn’t know the severity of the problem). A couple of weeks after I got home I was FaceTiming them and my dad goes, “you look like you’ve gained a bit of weight, have you?” all excited and like trying to be supportive or something. I had NOT gained weight but you can bet your ass I lost a lot more after that comment.",False,False

I would feel that way too, especially if my own father was pinching my extra fat or skin and pointing it out! That's uncomfortable and you might want to figure out where your boundaries are with comments and gestures like that.  I do want to believe your dad is a good guy. He is probably commenting on your gym habits thinking he's being supportive. Maybe you've expressed how important this habit is to you, and showed disappointment when you didn't go to the gym or something, so he picked up on it and thought, ""I know! It'll help my daughter if I encourage her!""   I think it's misguided but probably innocent. It might be worth bringing it up, even a little bit, so he lays off. I'm sensitive to those types of comments too... it's crazy the amount of stress you can get from them, especially from close family.  Last note... sorry for typing so much... recently my father has been showing favoritism to my thinner, more accomplished sister. It's hard to deal with. If it's a repeating pattern, you need to remind yourself that you are good regardless of his approval and what he thinks. I'm working on it but it helps to detach.",False,False
