I also ride stationary and outdoor bicycles.   I joined an outdoor bicycle club and track the rides (stationary  and outdoors) on Strava.   None of my business, but are you Miss beansandbeans420?  If so, you can't gain that much mass lifting weights unless you go to the same pharmacy as the East German women's swim team.  You can gain definition, though.   My health insurance had me work with a ""health coach"".  She said that lifting weights was the best way to a healthy body weight.    In my case, I had to bring my blood glucose level down.  Lifting weights will use up body fat, which brings down my blood glucose.   The show ""My 600 Pound Life"" isn't for everyone.   But one of its episodes was interesting.   One of the patients had lost too much weight.  Her BMI was too low.     Dr Now didn't say ""You need to gain weight"" . He told her, ""You need to add muscle.""  You could check with /r/Fitness or /r/xxfitness.  Lots of good diet and exercise information.",False,False

My favorite sport (well, more like a hobby.  I am not good enough to compete at it) was easier and more fun when I was at a healthy weight.",False,False
