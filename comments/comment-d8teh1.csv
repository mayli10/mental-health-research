She used to suffer from anorexia, and is still slim after recovering.  I completely relate to your post and understand how important it is not to feel doomed to obesity if you let go of your ED. But you *will* have to let go of some of that fear. You will have to decide to shift your priorities from thinness to health. And you will experience reactive eating and extreme hunger, and you will gain some weight, and it will scare the fuck out of you. But you will do it anyway because you have to to get out from under the yoke of anorexia. Your life will improve so much that all of that bullshit will be worth it.  That doesn't mean (at all!) that you will become overweight after recovering. That wasn't my experience (my BMI capped at 23, now down to 22 and working to get it to 21 very, very slowly and gently). But finding that middle ground will require some reexamination of your fears and anxieties about your body weight.  Hope this was helpful. All the best to you!",False,False

Seeing how the participants behaved around food after the diet was one of the main parts of the research. I've done tons of research. I'm not fear mongering at all, and I haven't misquoted a single source. It's a simple fact that people who were previously obese, esp during childhood have a far harder time maintaining a healthy weight.  ""Diets have a low success rate because people begin to eat in a caloric excess again"". No shit sherlock, nothing I said conflicted with that.",False,False

The investigation was designed to determine the physiological and psychological effects of severe and prolonged dietary restriction and the effectiveness of dietary rehabilitation strategies.  The motivation of the study was twofold: first, to produce a definitive treatise on the subject of human starvation based on a laboratory simulation of severe famine and, second, to use the scientific results produced to guide the Allied relief assistance to famine victims in Europe and Asia at the end of World War II. It was recognized early in 1944 that millions of people were in grave danger of mass famine as a result of the conflict, and information was needed regarding the effects of semi-starvation—and the impact of various rehabilitation strategies—if postwar relief efforts were to be effective.  The study was developed in coordination with the Civilian Public Service (CPS) and the Selective Service System and used 36 men selected from a pool of over 200 CPS volunteers.The study was divided into three phases: A twelve-week control phase, where physiological and psychological observations were collected to establish a baseline for each subject; a 24-week starvation phase, during which the caloric intake of each subject was drastically reduced—causing each participant to lose an average of 25% of their pre-starvation body weight; and finally a recovery phase, in which various rehabilitative diets were tried to re-nourish the volunteers.  ***  ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",False,False

Set point is bullshit. Of course in the Minnesota starvation experiment the subjects returned to their original weights quickly after being starved - after the experiment the researchers put them through a recovery phase to return them to proper health [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Starvation_Experiment] and besides, anyone who’s engaged in long-term restrictive behaviours knows that the starving, “my body is screaming for help” post-restriction/recovery binge is real. It’s called metabolic response.   Quit the crap and do some research. As much damage as one could do by restricting, our bodies are much more adaptable than your fear-mongering misinformation is making it out to be.

I didn’t gain as much weight as I feared. One day I realized that the disorder was slowly withering away my soul and I became a dull lifeless person. I focused on building healthy muscle while recovering so I can feel good in my body. Most of all I decided that my value isn’t in the outdated definitions of beauty. It’s very hard to do but I remind myself every day that there’s more to life that having an ED. You don’t have to starve your body to be beautiful. You don’t have to worry whether there’s a small amount of fat in your body. That’s normal. The media has messed up our perception of how bodies are supposed to look like but even actress photos are doctored. You are beautiful and have a good soul. I feel like I spent my life chasing this dream. When I could see every bone in my body sticking out, I was never happy. It was never enough. I alienated myself from family and friends. It was just empty. I am in a much better place now and the disorder is slowly releasing its hands from my life. The Ed voice never goes away. It will always be there and you just have to remind yourself that you’re much stronger than it. I threw away the scale and I said fuck it. I was a figure skater and I used to think that I needed to look like Natalie Portman in black swan to fit the ideal. I decided to say fuck it and just be myself. I know it’s hard and if you need support, I will be here. I love you all.   I was a fat kid by extreme standards and now I am a healthy weight. I didn’t gain more weight I simply have a body everyone considers to be healthy for a young girl. There’s this fear that recovering means becoming fat but that’s not it. Recovering makes you healthy. It’s okay to accept your body.  I love you and want you to get better. I have been through all the ups and downs of having an ED so I know how hard it is. In the end, I think it was worth it.",False,False

If you were overweight before the eating disorder it will always be more difficult to stay a healthy weight. It's been observed that people generally reset to their ""set point""  following a period of restricted eating. Look up the minnesota starvation experiment, this also applies to overweight people as well hence why diets have such a low success rate. I remember reading a study that examined the behaviour of previously obese people who managed to maintain a healthy weight for over a year after dieting. Almost all of them exhibited traits that would be considered ""disordered"" in people of a lower weight.   I feel so doomed sometimes as a former fat person, this is why I'm so afraid to stop restricting, if I let myself eat normally I'll get fat and I'd prefer to be underweight than fat even though I'm definitely more unhealthy now.   It's not impossible though. You may always have to be controlled with food but I hope that it can be done in a way that doesn't take over your life. Sorry I got a bit sidetracked lol, but if you weren't overweight before the ED you will most likely be able to eat intuitively without issues.",False,False
