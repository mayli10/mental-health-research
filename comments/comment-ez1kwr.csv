THIS. Is the kind of shit my brain comes up with.,False,False

They do that stuff short term for a couple of days and then eat normally. They‚Äôre completely different from us.,False,False

And salt because electrolytes are really important. But there's really no point and I would not advise anyone else to water fast. Actually it's way smarter to have some soda or electrolyte water. I'm just stupid.,False,False

People really do jump on any new piece of information and take it as gospel, no matter how accurate it is. I think the people I encountered not wanting to drink diet soda were more concerned about the temptation to drink actual sugary things or whatever, which is fair, but like...the way they said it definitely made it seem like it was something nobody should do ever",False,True

Ultimately I think it‚Äôs a personal call depending on the reasons for fasting and how near-zero-kcal beverages happen to affect an individual. Personally idgaf about the posited insulin spike (and perhaps I‚Äôm unduly cynical, but I‚Äôm convinced most people are parroting something they heard/read with no comprehension beyond ‚Äúfear the insulin spike‚Äù. )",False,False
