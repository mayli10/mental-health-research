When I started losing and finally reached my first goal weight I kept telling myself I’d be happy at that weight. Then I kept losing and now I’m at my lowest and scared at how low I’ll end up at. I thought I was supposed to be in control of this but this ED is completely taking over my life. You’re not alone, these behaviours are flippin addictive",False,False

I heard other people talk about how they would reach there goal weight and want to be lower but I was always able to brush it off until it happened to me. It is scary. It feels kinda hopeless and I’m sorry that you are trapped in this illness. If you can, reach out to someone, anyone, who you can vent to. You don’t have to decide to recover yet. But maybe just talking about it will help. Take it one step at a time. Your life is worth living and I’m here for you.",False,False
