Whatever that might look like! There‚Äôs no instruction manual for these kind of things so just do what feels right!

I want to be at peace with all outcomes, not attached to any one in particular. I want to stop the automatic reaction of wanting to die when anything I perceive to be negative happens. I'm so tired of giving up, only to try again. I love you, stranger. I love your heart. Thank you for your compassion and empathy. Thank you for clarity.",False,True

Please take time to be gentle with yourself - there's no shame or badness in that, you *need* love and kindness right now, particularly from yourself. You are a worthy person and a good human being.
