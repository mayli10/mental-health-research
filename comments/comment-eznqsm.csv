I also think non-ED people are really confused by the pairing of not-eating and intense-preoccupation-with-food. My parents were flabbergasted by my endless hours of Food Network viewing. Lexically though appetite and hunger are technically different. Hunger is the desire for food and the body's signals that it needs food, whereas appetite is the desire to satisfy that need. So it's possible to have hunger without appetite.  Though 'lack of appetite' still doesn't really capture my experience? That seems to imply I just have a reduced desire to meet my needs but for me it's often an active desire to NOT meet the need, and that feels subtly different somehow. Ah language. I love it deeply, but it so often falls short.",False,False
