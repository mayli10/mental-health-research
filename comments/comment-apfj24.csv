I will say it felt slightly relieving to hear that I fight have an eating disorder.  But then frustrated because I feel like I just can’t stop.  Hopefully whatever it is, I can either through it, because I’m sooo uncomfortable right now. ",False,True

I'm not saying she was right to say you don't have BED. but I think that's possibly a reason why she said that. I'm sorry, it maybe feels really invalidating. maybe your next session you can discuss this a little more deeply and get on the same page.",False,False

I am continuing seeing her because she seems like a good fit with my other issues.   I just seriously think I have to get a handle on this on my own for now, because I literally couldn’t breathe last night.  I was finally able to sleep an hour and feel ok now.  Stomach still feels bloated and high up, but I’m going to try to keep myself busy and go to bed early so I can’t just binge eat again.  I looked up distended stomach and the real risks of it.  Hopefully that’s enough to scare me away from doing it again (no this isn’t my first time bingeing, I just never realized it was a thing if you didn’t throw up after).",False,True

If this was your first session then she probably doesn't want to over-diagnose. If you think you have BED, then I suggest continuing to see her. The more she gets to know you the better she can diagnose you. If you feel like she's not taking your concerns into consideration after several sessions, then consider changing therapists. They have to explore all possible reasons before they jump to the worst conclusion. Just have an open mind.",False,False
