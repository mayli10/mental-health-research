On my birthday I ate what I wanted I just ate small portions and did not finish anything unless I thought it was really worth it. Whatever amount you eat, you are not going to gain any weight, it is natural to feel more full afterwards especially when you’ve been restricting but it will not affect you long-term. It is okay to have good memories and enjoy party time, you deserve it. Sending good thoughts your way.",False,False
