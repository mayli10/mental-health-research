Then like the week that my junior year started, I broke down and I emailed my therapist at like 2 am and it was something like, I can't do this anymore I'm having issues with my eating, please help me. That was all it took to open communication about it, and although it was scary, it was one of the best decisions I have made in the last year, and with her help, my life has gotten SO much better.   You could email her beforehand, and let them know what's going on, and I would include pretty much the same information you put in this post. That could be the best thing to do because you can be sure to include all the information (plus you don't have to have the scary face to face interaction of actually saying it), and then when you go into your appointment your doctor can be adequately prepared to help you. If you can't email them, I'd recommend writing down what you want to say on a piece of paper and bringing it with you, and then you can either just read what you wrote or if you end up not being able to bring it up you can give them the paper. From that point, your doctor will likely ask you questions and determine what kind of help you need, and help you with that.  Being anxious is a normal reaction for this situation, eating disorders are like a safety blanket that your mind clings onto, but there is absolutely nothing bad that can come out of telling your doctor. Good luck, and I hope that you get the help you need :)",False,False
