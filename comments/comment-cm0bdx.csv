I recently ordered some outerwear corsets from this website and they're only designed for maximum 2"" waist reduction, but you can wear them without any compression too. I would assume that they would prevent bloating from being noticeable. I haven't tried them on because they're not supposed to arrive for a couple more days, but I would imagine corsets would be great for that since that's what they're made for. The ones I bought are the perfect level of fanciness where you can pair them with a really pretty shirt to look sophisticated or you can also wear them with casual wear like jeans and stuff. They're not made for wearing under clothes, but there are definitely corsets which are. Those kind can be combined with anything really since you don't see them. Maybe not crop tops I guess, but anything that covers your belly. I'm excited. I've wanted corsets for a long time just for style, but they're expensive. I stumbled upon a really good deal though. If you're interested I can let you know if they meet expectations when I get them.",False,False
