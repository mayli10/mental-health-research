I set it down next to me for a while before touching it, but then I didn't want it to get cold so I finally took a bite and after that I just couldn't stop eating. I felt disgusting really. I wasn't just shovelling food into my mouth like I was feral, but it felt as if I was. I think in my case that's just a side effect of my ADHD medication. Not that I never felt that way before, just that I was at peak effectiveness in that moment which is probably why I felt nauseous instead of hungry.",False,False
