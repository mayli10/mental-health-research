It’s so frustrating dealing with people who refuse to listen to science and facts on a topic that they don’t even know anything about.,False,True

No matter how it goes, you’ll feel better once you do it because you’ll have faced a fear and stood up for yourself. That’s admirable!",False,False

It feels like second nature to avoid stuff haha.,False,True

You need to advocate for yourself when your boundaries are being stepped on, you can’t always rely on anonymous redditors to get the message across for him. Just calmly tell him that he needs to work on his bluntness because you find it upsetting, and that most people would also feel that way. It’s better for him to know that, it’s better for you, and it’s better for the friendship in the long run. Tough conversations are the most rewarding.",False,False

I just don’t know how to ask him to not get so nosy. He says he wants me to get better, but it really doesn’t help.   Recently he did read on reddit, assuming posted by another person with an ED that it gets annoying when other people tell them to eat. He asked me if it annoys me and he did seem legitimately concerned. It was difficult to explain, especially on the spot, but I did have the courage to agree with the random redditor and say it was bothersome and annoying, just possibly not in the way he thought it was. He stopped trying to get me to eat after that.",False,True

I would call him out, that’s the only way people like that learn. “Wow, you must be so embarrassed to have just asked that out of nowhere, that was really inappropriate.”   Or just tell him to stop being such a dick lol.",False,False

He doesn’t present any of the typical symptoms or signs of someone on the spectrum, not even considered “high-functioning.” I cant remember the term that people with autism prefer so apologies. I’m afraid to say what I think it is in case it’s insulting. Apparently “high functioning” is insulting as well... but I don’t know. Couldn’t think of how to best explain. Either way, he is not on the spectrum. Nothing he does would lead me to even suspect except for maybe the fact that he’s really good logical/critical thinking games and math.",False,True
