I went a month or so over the summer sober with the help of that sub and I fell off the wagon right onto my face. I don’t think I ever actually wanted to be sober so that’s something.    And I should be honest with myself about the fact that the guy I’m seeing definitely has a drinking problem and it fuels mine. But I’ll say it once here and keep ignoring it.    I feel like I see exactly what’s happening but I’m not even trying to stop it. I’m scared. I’ll come back to your comment when I feel extra low.   Thank you again.,False,True

I was lost in the land of drinking for a decade. At first it was glorious because it made my freaking brain stfu. Eventually it felt like the only thing duct-taping my shattered self together, so when I wanted to stop I genuinely couldn't seem do it.  I ended up in the hospital partly b/c of of the drinking and they got me into a IOP substance-abuse treatment program, which really helped with the drinking (though I still needed/need help dealing with all the stuff the drinking was masking). Also I used to find a lot of friendly support on the stopdrinking sub.  I know it can feel like there's no way out, but there is help and hope out there. In the meantime, I hope you're able to stay safe &lt;3",False,False
