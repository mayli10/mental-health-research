If ops reasoning is they they think roast is more caloric then a cup of noodles? Should we not discuss this?  I realize the point of the thread is that the parent is overfeeding their child and being somewhat forceful, however   I would hate someone to read ops post and believe roast is such a calorie bomb.  The fact is, I had to check this out, even though I *know* a serving (3oz) beef is not 800+ calories. It freaked me out that maybe I was wrong.   OP listed calories in their post, so it is realivent to the point. Maybe their moms recipe is a lot different then ones that I use, maybe they are counting it with potatoes/ carrots? I don't know, that's why I asked.    I think it is realivent because ops mom is probably suggesting all these other things because nutritionally roast will have more then noodles. They are concerned about their child. That is what parents do, even when they are off base.   People who restrict need to be aware that they can become nutrient deficient and protein deficiency is one that will really effect people.",False,False

Others don't know what immense amounts of options and future paths ED suffers play through in their minds before deciding to eat something. It's chess with yourself, where you have to think through your own possible move, and then the consequences, and then the next ones.     Tons of criteria -- sometimes explainable to others, sometimes not -- calories, safeness, time-of-eating, colour, craving, speed, texture, bloating, recovery-thoughts, financial cost, have to be accounted for. And every ED voice is different. And worse, sometimes these criteria change from situation to situation. So queen-doesn't-always-take-pawn. The rules of your own game just change sometimes.     It's pretty impossible, even to another ED sufferer, to show how much mental and emotional energy that any particular ED-chess-game costs. Even if you happen to be a Grand Master yourself.      Of course, when someone else sits over your shoulder and looks at the chess board and starts spitballing possible moves so much that you can't think about or stick to your own, this is infuriating.   &amp;#x200B;  Even worse when this person is someone that for the beginning years of your life, when you were shitting yourself and and couldn't walk or make a sentence, essentially a superhero genius. I mean, of course they're not. We know this. They're just a human being, who is also probably by now less tapped-in-to the other human beings in this world than you are. So you're more evolved. You're more exposed to other people playing their own mind-chess-games against themselves, and against others. Sometimes dumb school or work politics, sometimes an ED chess game, sometimes anxiety. You can understand and respect others mental-chess-game-moves more easily because you're more connected to the world. We know this.     But, no matter that *we know this*, somewhere in our baby mind, we think parents should know better than us. And maybe even know *us* better than us. Because that's the first thing in life you learn. Our very first memories are of them knowing *everything*, especially about our needs, with some magic psychic connection. They know, all without us being able to speak or know ourselves when we need to have your diaper changed, when we need to burp, when we need a nap, when we need to put on a little baby sweater, when we need a cuddle. And I am sure it's super frustrating that now that you *can* speak for yourself, *after* you have come to a conclusion about the best ED-chess-move to make, this once-omnipotent person is spitballing things that don't make sense. Frustrating that they do it in the first place, frustrating that they seem to think they know best about us, frustrating that they don't listen because ""Ma, I can actually speak what I need now !""  &amp;#x200B;  But as well as talk now, you can also choose. Not only your food-moves. This is a different topic. In this case, you have to choose to be gentle with her. Or it's just going to get confusing and frustrating for you that someone is telling you how to play your chess-game.  &amp;#x200B;  I'm not sure if she knows about your ED. If not, you can't expect her to understand choosing noodles is *your choice* and wasn't necessarily an easy one. Even if she does know about your ED, however, this is going to make her even more overwhelmed and confused and panicky because she surely wants to care for you, but can't follow the rules of your current chess game. It's probably hard for you to even know what the best move is. How can she ?     So, I think the best way to give yourself and her some peace is make her stop. Gently. *Soooooo* *gently*. By acknowledgement of what she is thinking.     ""Mom, you're offering me a lot of food options ! Hug ! You want to take care of me. I see that. You want to help me think through many choices. You want to show me ones I might not have known were there. You want me to be satisfied and happy. Thank you. Don't worry : I am happy and satisfied because I choose noodles. I know I can count on you to give me more food options if I need. Thank you.""      Voilà. She feels heard and acknowledged. And she remembers that you have a voice too and she doesn't have to read your screaming baby mind to find out what the fuck is wrong (sick ? hungry ? poop? hospital? cold? warm? doesn't like beards?). And you can play your chess game in -- relative -- peace.  &amp;#x200B;  There's this one quite from DFW that I really like that reminds me of situations like these...   ""How odd I can have all this inside me and to you it’s just words.""     I wish you much strength and peace and courage.",False,False
