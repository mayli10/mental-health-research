I appear to be a normal weight and have had people interested in me but I just can’t bring myself to be physical with anyone or date. I tell myself once I reach my goal weight I will start dating/having sex again. I feel too much disgust at myself currently to fathom anyone else seeing me as attractive.,False,False

I actually felt pretty bad bc I was talking with a cute guy who was obviously into me, but I couldn't allow myself to get close to him bc of that promise. He was asking me what was wrong, if he did anything wrong, etc, and he was m e l t i n g my heart but at the same time.. I just couldn't.   Now that I've lost the weight, I don't have a problem with dating, bc the thought of others touching my body doesn't bother me anymore. Now it's like yas pls hug me f e e l me cuz i've been touch starved for such a long time lmao that i forgot how good it felt :)",False,False

I can flirt but the thought of someone touching me .... whoo boy   What I can tell you for sure is that your date doesn’t think of you the way you think of yourself. They won’t think “wow she’s fat” because, unlike you, they don’t have an eating disorder and a cloud of self hate impacting their self perception.",False,False
