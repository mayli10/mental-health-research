If I lose weight, I’m going to be pissed at myself and worried about what treatment will say. If I gain weight, I’m going to be pissed at treatment and worried about my motivation. If I stay the same weight, there’s no way in hell I’ll be able to eat my full meal plan because I’ll be too afraid of gaining weight. Ugh. But also I can’t not know my weight.",False,False

I looked at myself 2 days ago and thought that I had gained weight, but I lost 3 pounds. A few months before that I thought I had lost weight but had actually been maintaining for the entire month. I mean !!!?????",False,False
