Probably doesn't work if you have body dysmorphia.  That other people eat whatever and don't gain weight is usually not true, otherwise there wouldn't be something like 60-70% overweight and obese people in western countries.   Maybe if someone suffers from hyperthyroidism, has absorption issues etc. or is extremely active they really eat a lot, but most people have to watch what they eat.  Some people have a small/normal appetite and eat what they want, but they don't want a lot and their body regulates their food intake/hunger so that they stay thin or normal.   If you see them eat their one large meal a day you might think they eat a lot, but they don't.  I wish it worked like that for me too, but it doesn't.",False,False

I don't know anyone that can eat whatever they want. Or, if they do (which is LITERALLY like 2 people that I know), it's because they have a normal relationship with food so sometimes they want mac and cheese and sometimes they want a pile of rabbit food. Really... my brother is one of those ""eats whatever he wants"" and he seems to balance 'richer' foods as followed by cravings for vegetables. It's rather fascinating to watch people with a normal relationship with food that are at a healthy weight etc etc. Enviable (in some ways I guess)",False,False
