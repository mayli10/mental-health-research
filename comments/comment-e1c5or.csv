I did not find it useful but I think residential would have been--I was always IP for a few weeks and then sent home back into the same environment and would relapse immediately. The place I was IP (Walden) takes both adults and adolescents of all genders and diagnoses so I never felt like I didn't fit in. IP is more for stabilization than anything else; you generally aren't there long enough for any significant therapeutic effect. If you go into it knowing that and just try to get as much out of it as you can it can still be useful.,False,False

Almost all of the girls were in their early to mid teens and very very unhealthy (and they never missed a chance to say triggering things, yelling about the food etc). It really depends on the patients though. Speaking from my experience, I really needed it so even though I felt like the fattest patient at BMI 13, it really improved my health.",False,False
