She would glamorize my ED behaviors a lot and enabled my disorder (not intentionally). It always was hard being around her. Even after we stopped being friends, for a while I still would compare myself to her. I stopped associating with her for multiple reasons, but the ED aspect played a huge part.   It's okay to put your mental (and physical) health above relations with others. I would distance myself from her if I was you. If you guys are close then maybe try to communicqte how it makes you uncomfortable and effects your sanity. ",False,False
