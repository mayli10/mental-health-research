She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She‚Äôll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self.   To those who are concerned about the legal implications of my actions, I did do a bit of research beforehand, and because the food was behind a locked bedroom door, labeled not to be eaten, AND I have proof of previous conversations where I‚Äôve asked her to not eat my food I‚Äôm pretty much in the clear. Also, my SIL has no financial ability to acquire a lawyer to sue me without my brother‚Äôs support. My brother would absolutely not support her in any attempt to seek legal action.   I had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  ‚Äúdon‚Äôt tell me if I‚Äôm right, because I don‚Äôt want to know, but I just want you to know I‚Äôm on your side here and I‚Äôm not mad‚Äù). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she‚Äôs been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can‚Äôt keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She‚Äôs also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes.   My brother has decided that he‚Äôs going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he‚Äôs going to seek a separation until she does. She‚Äôs deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can‚Äôt comprehend the that she‚Äôs now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she‚Äôs a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in.   I hope she‚Äôll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she‚Äôs too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently.  ",False,True
