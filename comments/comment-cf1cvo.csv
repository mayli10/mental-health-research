If you're in a place or social scene where anorexia/bulimia are more...how do I put this, culturally embedded?...it's a good bet people might have it at the back of their minds. I'm in SoCal and I'm sure people talk behind my back. That said, Manhattan remains the only place in my adult life where someone has straight up asked me if I have an ED.  In places with less ED awareness, like in my cousins' small city in the Midwest, lots of people just don't seem to think about it AT ALL. They're more likely to assume meth or other drug problems, if someone's body/eating habits ping them at all.",False,False

Honestly, it depends where you live. I live in Asia, and people here are generally not knowledgeable on eating disorders, so people don’t really suspect that, since everyone is on a “diet”. But honestly, a lot of students have disordered eating habits that I’ve noticed in some of my friends too, and they don’t realize it. They forget to eat until like 5 pm and I get so shocked because I think about food all the time, what I eat, what time, how to eat it. So to answer your question, a lot of students don’t really have time to think about another person’s eating habits unless they have an eating disorder themselves. That’s the only way they’ll notice.  Goodluck, hope you do well. Take care!",False,False

One other person commented on my weight gain when I was trying to recover, but I think it came from a place of kindness.   I tried pretty hard to hide it though (I didn't weigh anything out in public, planned my meals so that I would eat in front of my friends), so most everyone didn't think much of me.",False,False

It is an adjustment, but it can be really enjoyable. I highly suggest trying to get out and join clubs, it makes the experience a lot better, and helps you meet new people. [ I know my campus had a weekly ED support group if you're interested in something along those lines - no one has to know where you're going if you don't want them to - you can say you've got class or are meeting a friend from HS if discretion and a clean slate is important to you]  As far as others noticing your habits, it depends. A roommate whose experienced an eating disorder will probably notice disordered behaviors, but will also most likely be more understanding and discreet about what they observe. Most roommates will be too busy with things to notice, and you can always leave often too and hang out on campus somewhere nice if they are the type to always be in the room and be more likely to notice your eating habits.   Like the commenter before said, unless you're talking about diets, weighing food, openly tracking calories, or talking about body weight, most people will not notice due to their schedules and activities.",False,False

The most I've gotten has been comments from past roommates along the lines of ""you eat super clean"" or ""wow you're super active!"". I think the only dead giveaway would be if they saw you weighing food or if you mention calories constantly. Other than that, you should be fine",False,False
