A lot of ""newbie gains"" for strength training are not even about building additional muscle, just about getting the muscle you have used to doing work and stretching out your tendons. You can make a lot of progress on it strength without building much noticeable muscle mass, especially if you focus on calisthenics.",False,False

From what I know it takes quite a bit of effort to build obvious muscle, so you can probably continue eating the amount you are now or even a little bit extra and you won’t bulk up. :)",False,True

I think you can either be really strong or muscular and have the strength to hold your weight or you can just be smaller and then your already existing muscles have less to hold up.   To build physically obvious amounts of muscle you need to eat above your maintenance. If you just do yoga I doubt you’d get bulky. :),False,True

I’m also sorry that you are going through it though!   We are on the exact same boat!! I love running. I do two huge runs a week and my other exercise is cardio too. I felt so pressured to do weightlifting for the past year but I’ve finally evicted it from my routine and I’m so much happier. I’m happy for people that can do it but it’s just not my thing. The comments on recomping are the most irritating thing ever. I don’t mind just being skinny thanks everyone! I know you all prefer shapely feline thighs and butts but you’ll have to look elsewhere!

I get this all the time because I'm a runner and only do strength training to the extent that it helps me run, and I'm actively trying to lose weight cause I have an ED.  And everyone's like ""you don't need to lose weight, you just need to recomp! Maintain the same number but change it to more muscle!"" And I'm like yeah you're right, I don't *need* to lose weight. I'm at a perfectly normal, healthy weight. I'm also at a perfectly normal, healthy bf%. I don't *need* to recomp either. But I'm not losing weight to become totally shredded, an aesthetically pleasing health and fitness god; I'm losing weight to become a sickly sleleton, a bag of bones barely held together by pallid, undernourished skin. My goals aren't muscle. My goals aren't health. My goals aren't your goals.  Or people will be like ""if you did less cardio and more strength training you'd be so ripped! You exercise all the time, why do you waste it on running?"" Cause I don't want to be ripped! I don't want to be muscular! I want to run cause I *like* running, I want to run cause it burns hella calories, and I want to run *because* it's not going to make me build muscle. Because I don't want to be muscular!
