Basically, don’t go on dating websites or try to put yourself into a relationship with someone, just for the sake of being in a relationship. But if you see a cutie somewhere, who you get along with well, don’t be afraid to put a move on him.",False,False

First of all, anyone you are dating should be a shoulder to lean on, no matter what the problem is. Whether you used to be a drug addict, you’re a binge eater, or you self harm, you should be able to feel comfortable exposing your “vulnerable” side.   Also, my advice is not to necessarily go out LOOKING for someone, but if you find them? Don’t pass up the opportunity. Going through date after date can really break your self esteem. But if they happen to come to you? Don’t let it go.",False,False
