I've been realizing the last few months that it's more out of control than it ever has been before.   My hubby and therapist have both been trying to get me there, it just seems so hopeless right now. I was at the point of weighing myself 5 or 6 times a day when my therapist and husband decided it'd be best to hide the scale. Overall, minus the holidays, that has made restriction so much worse. They just don't seem to get it. :(",False,True

Restricted all day so that I could go to this ridiculously high-cal dessert place in the evening with my SO. Knew exactly what I could order and be under my cal limit. Sit down, look at the menu... and freeze. I'm trying to choose between two things that are hundreds of calories each for HALF and I can feel my face going numb. Borderline anxiety attack. Only stopped because I decided to get a single chocolate instead. Thankfully SO was okay with it - idk what would've happened if he'd been set on sharing something.  It's tough and it's scary to realise that it has such a grip on you. I didn't like how out-of-control I felt so I started little exercises in intentionally eating over my cals just to see if I ""still could"". Maybe if stepping out and getting one higher-cal meal in one go is too much, you could start by trying for 500 cals in a day, then 600, etc.?",False,False

I had a breakdown in Noodles and Company today because they gave me a large order instead of a small. They just left the large with me and changed my bill.
