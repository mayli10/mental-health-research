My boyfriend is very tall and muscular, with a very fast metabolism and an active lifestyle and job. Just to MAINTAIN his weight he needs about 3,500 cals a day, maybe more. And he loves to eat and cook. Our apartment always smells like food that he’s made and it’s small so it’s so so triggering for me to hear him talk about it (he doesn’t as much since my ED has gotten worse). But still. Sometimes I wish we didn’t live together so I can restrict in peace.",False,False
