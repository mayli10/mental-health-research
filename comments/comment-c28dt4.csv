I always report all those posts that do that for violating rule #6. I hate it when people use their mental illness to justify shitty behavior toward other people,False,False

People making rude comments about others’ bodies, as if that’s excusable because they have an ED. People here should understand even more than others how hurtful these comments can be. Those comments honestly aren’t supportive and don’t belong here, it is fat people hate and it’s harmful for those trying to deal with recovery, accepting themselves at their current weight, or just not obsessing abt weight and size in general. People here should be more sensitive tbh.",False,False

ANYWAY.  That's part of what makes it even more frustrating, honestly. I briefly talked about it in my post, but saying a bunch of gross, triggering stuff followed by ""it's my ed talking""/""i know it's fucked up""/""i feel like a bad person for thinking this"" doesn't suddenly make the gross, triggering stuff that was said okay.  Like... If someone recognizes their thoughts are fucked up, that should be a first step and not a stopping point. You know your thinking is flawed, now what are you going to do to change it? Someone can say ""I think x about y and I know it's bad but I still think it, does that make me a  person?"" And the answer is no, IF they examine their thoughts and take steps to change that. If they don't, then yeah. The terrible person thing is... kind of true!  Tbh I have very little sympathy for ""it's my mental illness talking!!!!!!"" stuff. In my experience, whenever that line used it's almost always because the person saying it wants to avoid being held accountable for whatever they've said or done.  On top of ED, I also have BPD and this stuff is something I see all the damn time in BPD spaces. People will talk about how they've insulted, belittled, and hurled emotional abuse at others (or done worse) and then say ""I know it's wrong and I feel bad about it, but I have BPD and I can't help it"" as if it absolves them of any and all responsibility. I'm tired of it and have no patience for it because MENTAL ILLNESS IS NOT A GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CARD! There are plenty of people who struggle with all sorts of mental illnesses who don't treat people like garbage and if they do, they check themselves and try to correct the behaviour.  And to bring it back to ED and fatphobia specifically, I'm not completely innocent in this, either! While I haven't posted anything like it on here, IRL I'll sometimes see people who are bigger than me and feel twinges of disgust. I'll feel bad about it and realize it's wrong and a huge part of it is my ED, but instead of shrugging and stopping there I remind myself that I need to stop projecting my internalized bullshit on other people and that I could (and should) focus on myself instead.  Someone else's body is none of my goddamn business, and ED or not, it's not my place to judge someone's worth based on the size of their body because size has nothing to do with someone's value as a person to begin with!",False,True

This sub (and ProED before it) was p much the only space where I'm able to really talk about my ED. If I try to bring it up to people irl it's either dismissed because I'm ""too big to have an eating disorder"" or I'm not allowed to express myself freely because any talk about ED that isn't 100% focused on recovery no matter what is framed as encouraging ED which... Lol, no. One thing I always liked about this place is that it supports recovery, but recognizes that not everyone is in a headspace where they're ready to recover and that that's okay.  Plus there are still some really great posts to be found here, but they're vastly outnumbered by the amount of posts and comments that send me spiraling.  So it's unfortunately a kind of ""damned if I do damned if I don't"" situation, y'know? Of course that could also be my own ED brain finding excuses to stay on here and trigger myself because blah blah blah my body is disgusting and I deserve to feel horrible about it and need to lose as much weight as possible and get skinny in order to be worthy of love and respect blah blah blah rofl",False,True

This sub isn’t perfect that’s for sure. For some, at least myself, I find it soothing to hear from people struggling with the same toxic thoughts And feelings as me. It makes me feel less alone. I don’t use this sub to fuel the fire of my ED, I use it because nowhere else feels safe to discuss it so candidly.   With that being said, no one should feel obligated to stay subbed to something that is not healthy for them and it seems like this may be a detriment to you and your recovery (if that’s on the horizon for you).  Thanks for sharing ❤️",False,False
