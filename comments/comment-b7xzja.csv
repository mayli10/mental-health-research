Iâ€™ll try to keep that mindset instead of feeling like I should continue to be self-destructive after relapsing.  And congrats on being 3 weeks clean!! That is amazing!",False,True

Thatâ€™s still a major accomplishment, props to you. Relapsing doesnâ€™t negate that work. And this doesnâ€™t have to derail youâ€” just think of it as data. Like ok you hadnâ€™t been purging and you tried it again and it made you feel shitty and didnâ€™t even give you the postpurge euphoria, so you should be even more solid now in not needing to purge (obviously itâ€™s way more complicated but talking to myself like that helps me a lot although ymmv. I relapsed with purging and self harm 3 weeks ago now and have been clean again since!!) ",False,False
