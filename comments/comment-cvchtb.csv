And yeah I loved it! If I had to know what my weight was and see it fluctuating and stuff I would've gone insane, like there's no way I can been trusted with that information. I'm sorry your old program did that to you. :^(",False,False

This is super informative!   That‚Äôs good that your program strayed away from BMI, I really think it‚Äôs not the best tool as everybody is so different and there are too many factors! I hope my new program is less BMI focused than the old one!  My old program weighed us once a week but they made us look for ‚Äúexposure‚Äù, even though it sent me spiralling all the time every weigh in day.",False,True

Gradually you ate more and gained in a paced and controlled manner. They blind weighed you twice a week and made sure everything was progressing exactly as they liked it.    As far as I can tell the BMI goal may have varied from person to person. I think (this is just a guess) they may have used other factors like bloodwork and vitals to tell when you were healthy. I didn't see anyone gain a surprising amount of weight.    They used Boost and Ensure to supplement, you could also choose to eat a Cliff bar instead. They did not use feeding tubes (I think if you needed one they'd have to send you to inpatient) and did not prescribe supplements unless you did not complete a meal or snack. If you didn't finish your supplement they'd put you on 24 hour obs and couch rest.    The only other thing I can think of is that some girls had to have Gatorade with their snacks because their electrolytes were low.",False,False
