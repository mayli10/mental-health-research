It was so relieving and I felt so much better reading everyoneâ€™s stories about it.   Any restriction is really hard on the mind, and I think in the end we are all suffering pretty equally physically too. Maybe some quicker than others.",False,True

You just need to eat less than you burn -- or if you want to maintain, as long as your total needs are more than 1600 calories, you won't gain on 1600. If you want to \*get\* to underweight, it might take longer, but you're not going to have all of those crazy weight swings and yo yos because you're stressing your body out. And you won't binge as much because you're not doing low restriction.  Plus, the other perk of high restricting is that when someone asks you what you eat, you can be honest, and then they don't get as twitchy. Because people are so used to thinking of low restriction with eating disorders, and they really don't know how to handle it when you say you eat 1500 or so. (Unless you're my therapist and my PCP -- they've started asking me what my exercise/activity calories are like...)",False,False
