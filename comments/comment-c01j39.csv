I really recommend you call one, even if you call and hang up straight away then at least you tried.    I hope you are feeling at least marginally better than you were yesterday, is there something special and nice you can do for yourself? Self-care is important even when we don't think we deserve it or feel up to it. &lt;3",False,False

Glad you got back to us  You can literally just vent and spill your guts about how you’re feeling suicidal, what’s been going on, and why you feel the way you feel. It’s completely up to you what you want to say- you don’t have to give all the fine details if you’re not ready, but if you are, it’s great because the person on the other end really listens to you.   You mentioned in your post that you edited what you were gonna say a lot to fix the wording, but you don’t have to worry abt that with the hotlines. When I called, I prob made zero sense initially and kept repeating myself and stumbling over words, but they’re trained and understand it all.  Also they can help guide the conversation (if you feel like you might feel awkward or your rant has dried up). It’s really nice to get it off your chest and know someone cares and they can give you tips too.",False,False

The quote that I often think of is something like : Two things are certain in life : death and change. Sometimes you just have to Waite for change.  How you feel right now is temporary. The physical and emotional pain will fade with time. You can do this. Trust me there is a reason I'm called Oracle,False,False

You could text or live chat someone, and they’re usually easy peasy, 24/7 and anonymous. Not sure what country you’re in so here’s a [list of hotlines by country](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines).  I don’t know what your story is and can’t imagine how tough life has been to you, but I do know we’re all in this ED hellhole together. It’s tricky because of timezones but I’ll message you tomorrow to check up on you okay? Hang in there.  Feel free to vent to me by pm whenever, I’m down to just listen, chill online or send you some wholesome memes haha. (This is an open invitation to anyone in this sub btw).  Sending you peace and love and calm.",False,False

Do you have a support system you can contact? Can you wait it out until the urge subsides? I know that overwhelming feeling very well, but it will pass. Can you call any helplines in your country to talk to someone anonymously before you do anything you cannot take back?   There are so many good things in life waiting for you to find them, but I know it's hard to see that sometimes when you're in that suicidal fog.",False,False
