I don’t really have foods around that could do a lot of damage, so I’ll binge on berries, healthy cereal, merengue cookies, halo top, popcorn. It’s more about the psychological state than the food I eat. I’ll eat really delicious food at restaurants that’s probably 900+ calories sometimes and not want to purge, but I can binge on 400 calories of popcorn and halo tops and feel like total fatso garbage.",False,False

When all I can think about is foodfoodfood nownownow, and I’m standing over the sink or bin eating leftovers with my hands or tearing into packages of whatever food, that’s a binge. Even if by the end of it I really only had a bite of a cereal bar, three almonds, and half a serving of rice, it was completely out of my control and therefore it was a binge.  On the other hand, if I’m in a particularly good mood and it’s a special occasions or I’m at a restaurant I love or have discovered some new delicious food, I can eat quite a lot, but because I’m in control of myself while I’m eating, it’s not a binge (even if it ends up being more than I’d normally eat in an entire day).",False,False

Binge eating is described by the DSM-5 as  “Eating, in a discrete period of time (e.g. within any 2-hour period), an amount of food that is definitely larger than most people would eat during a similar period of time and under similar circumstances.  A sense of lack of control over eating during the episode (e.g. a feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating).”  I don’t do that. However, I just had two snacks I didn’t initially plan to eat, one of which was a candy bar I’ve been hoarding in my purse for a week, and I feel like I “binged” in my head because I ate food I didn’t plan on having, and now I’m upset and considering eating more food.",False,False

Like losing control and eating an entire loaf of bread when you only meant to grab a slice.  But the disordered part of my brain says any number of calories over my designated daily limit is a binge and therefore needs a purge.,False,False
