Summer is always heavy restriction. I lose hella weight and Almost Die^TM and decide to Recover. So I eat more, do treatment, gain some weight, by winter I feel like a fat fuck but then I'm stuck in recovery and I have to pretend I'm not relapsing. So it's secret restriction, waterloading at weigh-ins, driving myself insane trying to hide my disorder. Slowly losing weight so by the end of winter I'm kind of skinny again. Worm my way out if treatment, more freedom to restrict, everything goes downhill and I'm starving myself by summer. Rinse and repeat.  I hate it so fucking much but I hope this year will be different. I'm finally moving out of my parents' house so hopefully I'll just die of starvation when they're not there to stop me.",False,False

I restrict higher from August-February and Iâ€™m eating/purging like spring to early summer. I feel happier and more prone to ReCovEry mode when the weathers good lol. Also I tend to wanna lose weight before holidays or school breaks. Fourth of July, Halloween, New Years and spring break are the MOST triggering",False,False

So like half the year ðŸ™ƒ but I do associate those times with some negative life events so it kinda makes sense,False,False
