I was mid relapse and self harming and I really liked him, but knew that he deserved to know what he was getting into. He was super understanding and supportive, did a lot of research on EDs and asked questions, and now he’s like an integral part of my recovery attempts. I’m all for telling your SO, I think it’s super healthy to communicate openly with your partner. ",False,False

He may have known before then tbh. I think I told him how bad it was about two years in and honestly he’s seen me at my highest and lowest weight. All throughout he tells me he loves me and doesn’t pressure me often about food🙏🏼 ,False,False

To which I replied, ""No, I do *now*"". And we just held each other while I cried and he sniffled in the middle of our fucking college cafeteria. We had never even hugged each other before that day.  I later found out I was the first person he ever told. He was recovered for a little while by that point (fully recovered now).  Needless to say, we got closer a lot more quickly after that.  He helped me get through most of my BN, but I'm still stuck with BED (bloody 8 years now) rip",False,False
