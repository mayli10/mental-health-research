What motivations did you have at the beginning of treatment? And what things have you gained in your life through weight restoration?  Like Ik lots of people said the brain fog went away, they could actually participate in social situations and were more of their actual selves again.   Gaining weight is super scary and I don't think many people realise how hard recovery is.   If you want some inspiration check out MegsyRecovery on YouTube cos she has loads of videos on relapsing, dealing with weight gain, recovery, etc.  She's also talks about how she had to keep writing lists of reasons to recover vs reasons why losing weight is shit, so even though you feel shit day to day, there's actually a greater good, and that recovery is all about starting to lead the life you ultimately want to lead, because there's never a point that you'll be ""ready"" to recover.   Hope things get better for you ðŸ’•",False,False
