I weigh everything out, never go over 1000 cals a day, and I’ve STILL only lost a little over 2 pounds this year so far. That’s ridiculous. I am not underweight enough for it to be THIS hard for my body to let go of some more weight unless my BMR is just unnaturally low. Sorry for ranting, I just relate to this right now.",False,False

I'm eating the same amount that I used to (1200) but have increased my exercise to around 3 hours of cardio a week but nada no change at all and I'm kind of annoyed. Maybe I need to increase my exercise but I have no extra time and exhausted. Why body why. ,False,False

Your body holds onto fat and/or water if it thinks there will be prolonged restriction as a means to combat losing the weight it wants to keep for survival. If you eat more, you're telling your body you have access to food and it can release that weight now ",False,False
