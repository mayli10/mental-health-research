Glad to hear things are looking brighter ♥️",False,False

I see how it can be helpful to have a structured environment to start off.   I'm just trying to navigate it all right now. I know myself enough to know that too many new things and concepts at once would be too overwhelming.  It took me months to get comfortable in therapy.   I got a chance to voice my concerns with my actual therapist today and she seemed to be open to giving me a voice and being more transparent with the decision process if we proceed.   I'm not sure what will follow, but I feel like the situation is more than just black and white now.",False,True

Totally not an expert here though, just raising it as a possibility.",False,False

Way back when I first engaged with services I was offered outpatient, basically a less intensive version of treatment to give myself the chance to prove myself rather than going straight into full on treatment. I took it and absolutely ended up not engaging at all, I just used it as an excuse to pull away and needed up worse.  I think you might be right that a softer approach will work, everyone is different and you know yourself best. However I do also think that it's gonna hurt like hell no matter what you do and if you're serious about this you may need to pull the band aid off and be really vunerable for a while. It's scary I know. I'm not making a judgement, just seeing both sides here, you truly know what you need and it's shit that treatment options are so limited when you've already took such a huge step to reach out in the first place.",False,False
