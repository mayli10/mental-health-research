Heat naturally dilates your blood vessels (which lowers your blood pressure, and makes you feel dizzy), so when you combine that with low sodium levels, it can really fuck you over. I usually try and go for baths if I want to use hot water, just so I can avoid seriously injuring my head.  Source: I have a disorder where my body doesn't retain sodium properly and I always faint in the summer/in hot showers :(",False,False

Passed out in shower and then went into cardiac arrest. She was 28 and had an untreated eating disorder.

It could've ended so awfully. I knew a girl that slipped getting out of the bath and she needed stitches. Scary stuff.  Stay safe‚Äìespecially because you've passed out before!,False,True
