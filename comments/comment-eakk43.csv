I was at 17 and felt already like I was dying everyday and as a bonus I looked like a skeleton. I know it won't change your mind but 15 is extreme and you will be absolutely unhappy at that weight. You can stay at the lower side of a healthy bmi but please don't go under. It's really not worth it.,False,False

Started at the same weight as you, but since I’m still not near my goal weight (which would put me at a bmi of 15) it doesn’t bother me much. I guess it will be more visible when I get underweight, so I’m currently lifting weights to see if it helps a little",False,False
