No one seems to care when you gain weight from binging but drop a bit and suddenly it’s so serious and they’re so concerned.,False,False

Even telling them that commenting on my weight or my food choices is triggering me and not to do it, they still do it. I don't care if it's positive or negative, I just don't wanna hear it. Ever.  Normal weight + bulimia = apparently no change in weight equals being healthy, nobody ever questioned my binges   Obese + binge eating = ""Oh my, you're living your best life, food-wise at least, right? You'd be prettier if you lost some weight!""   Obese + intermittent fasting, slowly losing weight = ""That's a lot of food you eat once a day. You'd lose faster if...""   Overweight, still losing weight = ""Why are you so restrictive with your diet? 5 meals per day are healthy and you need to eat everything in moderation, otherwise you'd risk getting an ED!""    Normal weight, trying to avoid binges &amp; restrictive phases: ""You know avocados have a lot of calories, right? Why are you using them in your smoothies? Why do you not want a second piece of cake? DO YOU HAVE AN ED?""  Society is toxic where food &amp; body image is concerned.",False,False

I guess they only start worrying again once your mental struggles start manifesting in weight loss because that's the only thing they can perceive, it's not like they can read your mind.  Imo, asking randomly if someone is doing okay/if they're still struggling (""for no reason""; and by that I mean without seeing any physical change in weight after recovery) is worse than not saying anything because that could be potentially triggering to someone who's still recovering/has recovered. They may even have already considered asking you about it before you started losing weight but decided against it for the exact reason I mentioned above.  Also, people tend to think being overweight is less of an issue than being underweight (which I agree with to an extent because being underweight via unhealthy methods can kill you a lot quicker than if you're overweight, although that isn't necessarily good either. I mean just look at Amberlynn Reid.)  But I definitely feel for you and I wish EDs were taken more seriously (in general, but especially for people who are OW and have one). And I hate how BED or Orthorexia aren't talked about nearly as much as Ana/Mia and that a lot of people don't even know that they exist.  Hope this was helpful❤️",False,False
