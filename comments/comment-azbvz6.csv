I’ve been having meltdown the past couple weeks so that’s cool. I thought we were going to get engaged soon but instead this. I’ve been told I can keep our shared living space if I can pay rent on my own but i don’t think I can even though it’s cheaper than any other place without roommates. I’m miserable. I want him to come back. ,False,False
