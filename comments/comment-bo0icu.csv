But from what I know local anesthesia is basically just numbing the area that theyâ€™re gonna work on, so your weight shouldnâ€™t be an issue at all. If theyâ€™re sedating you then they will have to weigh you to make sure they give you the right dosage, but there shouldnâ€™t be any problem even if youâ€™re underweight. You should talk to your doctor about the risks though, and if youâ€™re not comfortable being upfront about your ED (although it would be better if you just told them, they are the medical professional) you should at least mention that you donâ€™t tend to eat a lot and ask if not eating before surgery is going to affect anything. Hope it goes well ðŸ’•",False,False
