I think I will be taking a step away from the friendship because I think it has pulled out the worst in me in some ways too. It‚Äôs making me stressed out above all.   My friendship with this girl is similar in that she is only one of 3 friends that live close by. And it‚Äôs hard because of the other 2 friends 1 is not very close/got in a relationship and I havent seen her in months and the other is great but she lives 45 minutes away which limits out hangouts to maybe 1-2 times a month just because of our schedules.,False,True

She kind of replaced me with this new girl that‚Äôs obviously really cool in Lisa‚Äôs eyes and she emulates her style and music a lot now. I tried to be respectful and not jealous but she kind of makes a point on social about her other friend being her preferred friend of all her friends and just with everything combined I think I feel myself distancing from this friendship for now. It‚Äôs hard because I don‚Äôt really have any friends and struggle to make them. Thanks for your support though!,False,True

I think that‚Äôs so important because being judged never makes me feel like I want to rush to ‚Äúimprove‚Äù it just stresses me out and puts me off from going sometimes. Like I felt so stressed about the squat thing I added weight to my squats and now I dread leg day because it‚Äôs too intense. I think after reading your comment I‚Äôm going to tone things back to where I was comfortable because you are right and I want my goals to be respected.,False,True

I even told her that her comments are making me uncomfortable (she knew about my Ed past and I suspect she had her fair share of body image issues and problems with eating). I met her when I was my highest weight (still within normal but not borderline underweight or severely underweight which is my ""normal""). Once I lost enough weight we were at the same weight she blew off and this became a competition for her. It was so bad and triggering I had to walk away. If Lisa's comments make you feel the same way, I suggest you put at least a pause on thi friendship if not severing this tie entirely.",False,False

It sucks that someone you‚Äôve seen as a friend for so long could turn out like that though. I hope it works out,False,False
