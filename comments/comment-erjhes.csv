I care about how healthy I feel, not how healthy I look. For sure I'll check out my visage dysfunctionally, to make sure I'm not getting dry and sucked out. &gt;!Having a BMI of 45, I definitely did not feel as healthy as I do now at a BMI of 28-30 (my weight loss was completely accidental! I went on my diet for mood swings and just embraced the wt loss), and I definitely wasn't as calm as I am now, but I also didn't have as much, eh, can I call it dementia like symptoms?, as I have now. Overall even though my wrists look to me like those of a really skinny person I feel a lot better the way I am now. I feel just as strong as I used to, and I'm not actively homicidal anymore.!&lt; [TW numbers]",False,False

At my highest weight i hated myself so much all the way until i reached my GW and then i was skinny and loved it but couldnt stop with the disorder despite liking my body and as i continued to drop weight I started to get more dysphoric and unable to recognize how thin i was and would feel wrecked that i knew my bmi was underweight but i still looked fat to myself and therefore was fat to everyone else. It was weird how the dysmorphia just sorta kicked in the worse and worse its gotten,False,False
