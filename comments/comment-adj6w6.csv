I’m not an expert, so I don’t know how strong men are expected to be–but men have so much more testosterone in their bodies, that average for a man is still very strong compared to a woman. so it’s like just by being male, the guy in the video is already placed into a “strong person” role (both by biology and by societal expectations) without having to be placed into a “strong for a man” role.  The fact that we can’t change our heights is pretty disheartening. But I really hope this makes you feel better: I’m short and I’d like to be taller for reasons that are linked to my ED as well... Like, people say it’s easier to look thinner when you’re taller, and a lot of the time I feel like it doesn’t “count” as being truly small if you’re also short.",False,False

The fantasy of the tiny girl and strong guy feels so embedded in culture at times, it's hard to knock off its influence. I'm of average height, so it actually just makes me feel worse, because I obviously can't change my height. Knowing I can't ever fit that dynamic just makes me spiral more in my bad moments.",False,True

It’s almost definitely a video of a man that’s significantly stronger than others. How about look at it this way: i wouldn’t be surprised if a video showing a father with his six-year-old daughter in a similar pose got famous, and then people would clearly perceive that as “aww such a strong and caring dad” rather than “such a tiny girl”! Holding another person on your arm just sounds extremely difficult!  But, I can also sort of empathize with how this makes you feel. Since a lot of the time, people talk about couples being so cute when they’re made up of a strong guy and a tiny girl. And the “petite women are sooo sexy and cute and omg” thing bothers me sometimes—partially because I’m short and I feel like it’s validating and triggering my eating disorder—but I’m not sure if you relate to that specifically.",False,False
