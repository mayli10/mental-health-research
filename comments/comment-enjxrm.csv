Like are you able to float on the surface (dead man's float or just on your back)? The first thing they teach for that is to hold as much air as you can since your lungs are a big balloon. It's also, fun fact, why divers absolutely should not hold their breath as they descend since your lungs can..uh..pop.",False,False

I also just emptied my lungs completely and chilled at the bottom of the pool staring up at the surface. Scared the hell out of some people a few times but it's just so *pretty*.,False,False
