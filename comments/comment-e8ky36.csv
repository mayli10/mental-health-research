I know when mine found out, my life became a mess and my ED went from bad to worse. Since you‚Äôre open to the idea, it sounds like they would be supportive. Maybe write it down every aspect of it so they can get the whole picture without forming an opinion from the sentence ‚ÄúI have an ED.‚Äù",False,False

I kinda ended up in a bit of a bind (you tell them, or I will) and I spent the whole day crying about it, but I just said screw it, and sat down with my dad and explained everything. He seemed to appreciate hearing it from me, instead of a third party. Being able to have that deep, personal connection with your parents can make it a lot easier for both of you, instead of getting a phone call from your school. Just something to think about, let me know how it goes :))",False,False

I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre in a position where it‚Äôs now forced though, rather than you completely making the decision yourself :( Communication is going to be an important though possibly difficult thing during recovery, but you are needing to take care of yourself first and foremost here. If things get really tough, you guys could always consider a little family therapy too, I know that‚Äôs not uncommon in recovery. And the fact that you‚Äôre almost an adult is a positive as you have the final control over things now. Best of luck üíï",False,False

I hate that. I‚Äôm being forced to tell them or else the lady will tell them for me. :/ I really hope that they will be understanding during recovery I‚Äôm not sure they can handle it well at all.
