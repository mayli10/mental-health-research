It's why nobody loves you, and why you're not as popular as you were last year (even though in reality, I don't pass by my grade as much in break because they're not by the water fountain anymore, and the vice principal doesn't want me to get involved in drama with them), when you were lighter (by like, 3 pounds smh).  It's also why the boy who liked you in 8th grade never asked you to be his girlfriend (it's not like 13 year old boys have difficulty expressing their feelings, like, no, what the heck, right?).""  And now, I'm not as interested as I was in middle school in getting a relationship, not because I'm in high school and should focus on my studies, but because I'm fat and nobody would ever love a fatty like me.    Hate ED logic.  It makes no sense, yet can make you cry on the couch for 2 hours.",False,False

Which obviously makes no sense and I feel like they'll only want me when I look in shape and perfect.  Uuurgh very frustrating, I find it hard to send out resumes because of this :( it's nice to feel less alone in that. ",False,False
