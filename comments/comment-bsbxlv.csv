Out of the blue, and wondering if it would be weird if I messaged you lol.  But I am so proud of you for taking control of this and so SO happy it's worked out for the better!!! Honestly, you are amazing and you have so much strength in you! I might have given you some kind words, but you put in the work and made the hard decisions.   You are goals ‚ù§",False,False

I ended up leaving within a week of posting this, and leaving to focus on my mental health was the best decision I ever made. a month or so after I left, I went to an inpatient facility and my life has been absolutely changed. reading this back it doesn‚Äôt even seem like that was my post. thank you for validating my feelings and also pointing me in the right direction ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,True

So here are a few of my ""go to""s:  \-Adult ""Lunchables"": crackers, cheese, deli meat, fruit +yogurt or veggies + dip  \-Oatmeal (this would only work if you have an electric kettle, which I really recommend getting - they're quite cheap, usually only $20-$30): tons of add ins for this - yogurt, peanut butter, fruit (bananas are great in yogurt), honey  \-Cereal + yogurt/milk, you can stir in natural PB or other kinds of nut butters for some fats + fruit  \-Sandwiches/wraps/pitas (lots of options for fillings: hummus, veggies, cheese, avocado, deli meat) + cheese strings or milk + fruit   If you can get an electric kettle, you can also make things like instant noodles (I add in vegetables and cheese sometimes to make it more than just carbs), rice (to make a meal out of this, you can just add some deli meat or rotisserie chicken, and BBQ sauce/other kinds of sauces/dressing that you like), and other grains. For other ideas, just google things like ""meals you can make with an electric kettle"".  I hope that helps :)",False,False

Can you set aside some time on a day off so that you can do a bit of grocery shopping?

No job is worth losing your health and progress over.   But in reality I know it's not that simple.  You are just feeling crushed right now, and that's totaly valid! Is this location the dream job you would have after graduation? Or would you be somewhere else, just with this experience under your belt?  Take the weekend to think on it. Do a pro and con list if you have to. Think of the worst thing possible that can happen if you leave tomorrow and then decide if you can deal with that or not. And visa versa.   Just don't make a decision based on emotion alone. That way you can look back one day and be confident with whatever you choose.   Much love ‚ù§",False,False
