But then he opened up to me one day and I realized, for slim guys, especially taller ones.. the pressure to be shaped like Captain America is just as hard as the pressure we feel to be as slim as we can.  He feels just as horrible about his (imho *gorgeous*) slim body as we do about ours. It's heartbreaking.  I happily cook for both of us now, giving him my share of the calories, happily blending his protein shakes and cooking all the meat he can eat, because I know that feeling. At the same time, I bake sure he knows I adore him just the way he is, and that he only needs to change his body is he wants to, if it will make ***him*** feel good about himself.  I definitely still get envious that he not only can but honestly *should* eat more calories than I do, but I don't hold that on him, I just look at it as being at opposite ends of the same struggle, and try to take strength in that, and use it as an excuse to love him even more, and help him with all of my ability.    That said- yeah. It's never not at least a little frustrating that he can eat literally anything and doesn't gain a pound. It helps to remember that, for him, it's just as frustrating that I barely have to look at food and can gain both weight and muscle. The struggle has bright us closer together, maybe you can try to see if that will happen with you and your partner? :)",False,False

My fiance sits between 112-120. He likes to joke that ""if we just switched weights, we'd both be happy"" and I'm like ""yeah, 120 would be getting really close to- I mean yes, 120 is a healthy goal.

On the one hand, I'm glad nobody is trying to butt into my business the way people do when you're thin with ED, trying to force your hand, or tell you you're too thin.  People just think I'm eating less, they don't know I'm eating nothing some days, a metric ton on others and just yeeting away the regret before it has a chance to become fully realized. So they're happy for me, proud of me, all that shit, which just makes me want to try harder.  On the other hand, there's the ""am I even sick?"" feelings.  I usually get away with thinking I'm ""safe"" from ED related health problems because I'm too fat to get cold all the time (though, as I lose, I noticed the world is generally much colder than I used to think), I have enough calories stored up that I don't get fainting spells, I don't have to worry about bruising etc.  Then I have doubts that I'm disordered ""enough"", maybe I'm just doing what it takes? I eat healthy food, and some days I restrict and don't feel hungry at all-  so maybe the days I eat too much and throw up are just me being a fat ass and catching my mistake in time? Maybe it's not a disorder, maybe I'm just lazy and puking is my pathetic attempt to avoid losing weight the hard way?  I get jealous of thin EDs, even their problems. I'd kill to be able to (reality: to HAVE to) wear big cute bulky clothes over a tiny beautiful body and not get overheated. I want people to tell me to eat. I want to be told I'm too thin. I want people to wonder when I last ate a sandwich- instead of assuming I never stop eating cake.  I fantasize about how it'll be when I'm finally thin, it honestly feels like fantasising about what life will be like when I'm finally *a real person* (I've been fat since childhood and it honestly feels like being a subspecies humanoid, rather than just being a bigger human)... I'll be able to sit on anything I want, jump into people's arms, jump at all anywhere actually, dance, run, etc without jiggling. Fall- God fucking damn, to be able to just ***fall*** and feel like people might be concerned rather than laughing at me would be wonderful.  I'm five feet tall- if I were my goal weight, I could ride malamutes like a horse, be carried on my fiance's shoulders like it's nothing, wear adorable, Disney themed!, clothes from the kids section, generally just be the cutest thing in all of existence.  Instead I feel like Jabba the Hutt holding Princess Leia captive every time I'm intimate with my fiance.  But... I'm getting there. 206 on the scale this morning, I was 260+ this time last year, but I've gotten better at restricting and purging, so I'm FINALLY almost in the Under 200 Club, for the first time since I was a child. I'm not seeking treatment anytime soon.   If society gets such a large amount of input on my games, then I might as well let them guide me all the way. I'll wait until someone tells me I'm too skinny before I bother considering if I might be.",False,False
