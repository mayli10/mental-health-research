He’s the same, which I think is most guys preference. Big boobs, perky butt. Long hair, skinny waist, blah blah blah. Boring, stereotypical ~perfect sexii gurl~.   Basically, he put it into perspective. Sure I don’t have all those aspects, but the ones I *do* have he likes because they’re *mine* and what he gets to touch and enjoy. Like I am not blessed in the boob department- but he likes them because that means they won’t sag as much when I get older! Sure I’ve got cellulite, but it makes me “real” and honestly isn’t as much as I think (he’s lying, but very sweet of him to lie). He likes *me*. Maybe he’ll check out other girls, but it’s similar to when I check out other girls/guys. I’m appreciating it, but at the end of the day, I’ll go home to what I actually have and adore.   Also, he knows what drama I come with and how to deal with it. Lol. He doesn’t even want to breach what sort of drama other girls would have.   P.S. the fact your boyfriend cheated on you at one time is a red flag. It’s definitely something that’ll effect your self-esteem for a long time, *especially* with him. I’m sure you’d hate to hear it- but do consider seeking out a better relationship for your mental health. Or do the couples therapy thing.",False,False
