You're right, I do search reddit for times that Cronometer is mentioned and then comment. I didn't see it was in a subreddit (truthfully I didn't know what ED meant) for people with eating disorders. We would never push people when they are vulnerable, quite the opposite actually, we want to empower people's health decisions. Thanks for pointing out where I wrote this, and for further educating me to sensitivities.     Positive thoughts,  Eliisa",False,False

It never occurred to me that a weight loss app might try marketing to those with eating disorders, but now that I'm thinking about it it does make sense from a financial point of view.
