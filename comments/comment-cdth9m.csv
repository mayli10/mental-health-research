So she’ll be like “you look chubbier in photos than you actually are” and everyone else thinks I look exactly the same. I just need everyone to not comment on my appearance right now and I feel like that’s all people seem to care about. When I was losing weight my in laws would ask about my progress and say I looked great. My face usually is the first place my weight shows and honest to god my cheeks look chubby and they hasn’t seem me in months so it must have come as a shock to see a picture of me being thin AF and then see me in person and my face was puffier. They have no idea I struggle with eating disorders and I don’t want them to know, so it’s hard to ask them not to comment on the food I eat or how I’m looking.",False,True

Logically he’s super happy I’m in recovery because he was scared I was going to die when I was losing scary amounts of weight but before he knew about my issues he used to tell me how much he liked how small and thin I was. And then recently when he was comforting me he said “you looked really good before but you were so unhappy and sick, I’m glad you’re healthy now.” And now brain just stuck on it. He really means well but he tends to have a hard time not saying exactly what’s on his mind. Like he straight told him mom that I told him once I didn’t think she liked me and we all just awkwardly stood there while I tried to explain it was a while ago.  I know part of it is on me, I’m way to fucking sensitive. I wish I would just accept that some people are not going to be used to how I look at a more healthy weight and might say things they don’t realize trigger me.",False,True

And in any case, lots of people have pretty screwed up beauty standards :/  Your physical and mental health is more important than their comments, though. If people are being unsupportive or downright rude about your recovery, it just means that they have their own issues relating to body image that they've got to unpack. Stay strong, friend. All the best in recovery.",False,False
