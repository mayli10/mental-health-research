It is also why it’s so easy to regain right away cause the cells are like “biiiiiiiiiiiiiiitch y u do that? Don’t you know I needed that?”  So the we replace fat cells at like 8% a year or some other stupid small number but the ones that come back if you’re at a normal/lower weight are smaller I guess. The ones that we deflate ‘may’ shrink but there’s no guarantee so the “best”(according to my dr) thing to do is try to build muscle to push the skin up/tighten it in place of the fat cells,False,False

I have an answer for this one and you’re probably gonna like it.   To start, you kinda always have the same amount of fat cells that you had from puberty on. When you’re overweight or carrying extra weight for a long time the fat cells get packed full like a balloon full of sand so they’re firm.   Now, as you lose weight the fat inside the cells begins  to empty so it’s like emptying the balloon. Your skin starts to feels like it’s softening up/getting squishy.   For most people it feels like a proverbial kick to the self confidence nut. Ya did all this work and now you’re smaller but feel flabbier? It sucks it works this way but it’s life in the human body. The cells themselves may eventually shrink the longer you stay at a consistent weight and you’ll start to feel firmer again.   But yeah, squishy fat good and hard fat bad.",False,False
