I don't usually get many side-effects from medicine in general, and that was the first one that actually somewhat worked for my depression (go figure), so that sucked.   My sense of taste went back to normal very quickly after I quit taking it, so that wasn't a problem :)",False,False

I couldn't sleep and had a lot of other side effects, like nausea and dry skin and mouth. I felt really anxious and unable to focus for hours after taking it. I didn't notice any appetite suppressing effects, tbh it was the opposite for me bc I tend to binge out of anxiety. Vortioxetine (trintellix) which I'm currently on has worked well for me, though",False,False

It helped my impulsivity, depression, energy (likely due to depression), focus/attention, and liveliness. It sometimes gave me anxiety, which was frustrating but the only side effect. It made me tired when it peaked (which is really abnormal; most doctors didn’t believe me at first since it’s known very much so as a stimulating medication.   It also helped my sex life/orgasms! Especially when my depression was bad, orgasms were hard.  Wellbutrin helped a good deal- especially compared to basically all other meds :p",False,False

Honestly, it has helped immensely with my BPD and ADHD. In the past, I had tried different SSRI’s and always had bad psychological reactions to them. Wellbutrin was a lifesaver, literally! I do notice mild appetite suppression when I increase dosages, but it’s mostly due to nausea and goes away after about a day at the new dose.   Honestly, I didn’t realize how much it helped until I decided to taper myself off of it (very very slowly) my first year of college. I was fine for a few weeks, but then my anxiety and mood swings got so bad that I needed to be hospitalized. ",False,False

It initially really did suppress my appetite but over time that lessened and today I don’t think it has that strong of an effect (I think my appetite overall is related to my ED moreso now).   It made me more peppy, like it did give me a boost of energy and helped lift me out of a very dark and deep depression  I’ve had a really good experience on the med. I tried a few other antidepressants first before landing on this one",False,False

Didn't notice a significant appetite suppressant, but I was also used to going through a bunch of other antidepressants that made me always about to puke myself. So, it may have just been relative.  2. Didn't notice any more energy.  3. I tried a bunch of other shit that did nothing. Wellbutrin plus another antidepressant (Lexapro I think) helped me enough to not constantly think about killing myself",False,False

SSRIs never seemed seem to work and I always had sexual side effects from them.   The good: improved mood, more energy, better concentration. No increase in anxiety (for me - it is a problem for some).   The bad: appetite was definitely suppressed in the first few months which triggered my ED relapse, whoops. Also it is dangerous to purge while taking Wellbutrin because it increases seizure risk. Doesn’t stop me because I’m a dumbass with no self control, but thought I’d throw that out there.   TL;DR worked well for mood for me but be careful. I hope you have good results with it!",False,False

I take it in combination with lexapro.  &gt;how much of an appetite suppressant was it?  None at all for me  &gt;did it seem to give you more energy/pop? Any trouble with insomnia, or conversely, sedation?  It gave me energy when I first started taking it. I feel like it doesn't anymore, but idk if thats just me getting used to those elevated energy levels or what. Never gave me any insomnia.  &gt;did you find it helpful? Had you previously tried a bunch of other shit and had this work?  I had tried other SSRIs before lexapro. Lexapro was my life saver, but I still lacked energy and motivation. That's what I was prescribed wellbutrin for, and it worked. I still get depressive episodes for a couple weeks, but not the constant depression and suicidal ideation from before.",False,False

On one hand it gave me a lot of energy and I had an easier time focusing, which was great. I was actually able to function a bit more like a normal person. On the other hand, it completely killed my apetite (which, at the time I didn't care about) and changed how things tasted as well. Everything was disgusting, even coffee. I also had constant ringing in my ears, which is why I eventually quit taking it - was worried it would become permanent (It didn't).   ",False,False

The risperdal was just to take me down from zoloft-induced hypomania. based on your med history, it sounds like you might have a cyclical mood disorder? i was worried about wellbutrin causing mania but it hasn't yet. basically, wellbutrin has been great for my functioning but not effective for my mood.  hope this helps.",False,False
