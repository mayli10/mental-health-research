Having an eating disorder doesn't make you cheat out of nowhere. I'm glad you know that it's not an excuse. Maybe she felt that sleeping with someone else would improve her self-esteem? That's all I could come up with.",False,False

She cheated. Your mental illness is not an excuse for shitty behavior to people. It can be the reason, but it doesn’t justify it.",False,False

I would break it off. There’s a point where being there for her is infringing on your own mental health. It’s up to you to decide where that point is. Best wishes.,False,False

I'm sure EVERYONE here with a shred of dignity would agree with me that we would NEVER use our eating disorder as an excuse to justify something as horrible as cheating.,False,False
