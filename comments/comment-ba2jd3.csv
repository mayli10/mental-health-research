My mom is one of those crazy anti-gluten anti-sugar whole30 whackos and has been consistently underweight since she stopped having kids. My grandfather has anxiety about money and having enough to eat, and refuses to eat in public, makes judgey comments about the body size of people in the supermarket or the gym, etc.",False,False

I honestly don't know much about my brother but based on his room I'm pretty sure he has BED by his piles of donut boxes and ice cream cartons and chip bags on the floor.",False,False

She's went on so many crash diets that she had to get her gallbladder removed and constantly talks negatively about herself for eating things she considers to be bad. She often tries to eat almost nothing during the day but eats +1500 calories in one sitting in the evening, after which she complains about being lazy and lacking self control.   Are we long lost sisters? My mom had bulimia in the 80s, kicked it when she married my dad, had a brief relapse after I was born, and then told me about it when I was 11 (after I had already developed my own ED). We used to do diets together when I was a kid. She still has her gallbladder, but had to replace a bunch of teeth. My teeth are fine, but my gallbladder ruptured. My grandmother (her mother, who lives with my parents) also has an eating disorder. If it isn't genetic, there must be some kind of mirroring/learned behavior aspect. ",False,False

My sister, shockingly, has a pretty healthy and positive relationship with food and with her body, but then again my sister is just an amazing and resilient person all-around.  My great-aunt also had an exercise addiction and probable ED, but Iâ€™m not around her enough anymore to know where sheâ€™s at these days.",False,False

My mom, her 3 sisters, and my grandmother are all overweight or obese and have awful body image issues that they constantly project onto one another so I wouldn't be surprised at all if they have some sort of eating disorder or disordered eating habits. My grandma has told me that she used to have to weigh one of my moms sisters (she won't tell me which one) weekly and would leave pamphlets about anorexia around the house to make sure that they were informed (grandma was a nurse)  If they don't have full blown eating disorders, they definitely have disordered eating habits and body image issues that they are very open about and I believe that they think it's normal. Being raised with all of the negative body talk and crash diets around  me definitely contributed to my ED in hopes to never be ""like them""",False,False

I'm not related to my dad, but his biological sister, who I have met maybe twice in my life, also had an ED. My mom has disordered behavior, but, to my knowledge, no one that I'm related to has an ED.

On my mum's side, out of 5 siblings, only one *doesn't*  My mum had severe anorexia throughout her teens and whittled down to 6 stone at her worst. At one point she had half an apple a day to stop herself from fainting. When she fell pregnant with me it eased up a bit but to this day she still can't eat when upset or angry. Her heaviest weight to this day is 9 stone and that was when she was pregnant with my brother.  My aunt and uncle show all the signs and symptoms of BED - they're both insanely emotional eaters and they have had these problems since childhood. They're obese and eat in insane quantities behind closed doors. I've found wrappers and even bags from bread loaf stuffed in between couch cushions and behind radiators.  My last uncle has bulimia and was unfortunately caught in the act of purging and I think would have nothing bar alcohol some days.  All these siblings had a traumatic childhood and the only one who doesn't *officially* have an eating disorder (the signs and symptoms aren't on the outside) could very well have just not been caught yet.  I'm like a pendulum. I swing between BED and orthorexia, usually my orthorexia occurs the second I try to control my BED. All or nothing.",False,False

A lot of the women in my momâ€™s side of the family have a history of problematic eating patterns (on and off diets, restricting and binging, large weight fluctuations). Yet Iâ€™m the only one who has ever had a severe/diagnosed eating disorder. It sort of drives me nuts being identified as the sick one when I just took the bullshit I learned one step further.

ED are defined in the DSM-5 and therefore are mental illnesses. There was a lot of debate in the psychological and scientific community in the past but they know genetics do play a part in our predisposition to mental illnesses, just like high blood pressure or any other medical illness. Most psychologists will say that both nature and nurture make you into the person you are. I think also, seeing your mum exhibiting ED traits or even just talking about it sticks in your mind way more (because it's someone we instinctually trust and we often put our parents on a pedestal, forgetting they are human too ) so I think there is link for sure! Do you go to uni or college? You can probably find some papers? If not, you can google some articles that will be open access or PM me with the title and I can sneakily send the PDF to you ðŸ™Š but yes, definitely. I think as the science and psych community grows (and more willingly shares their information), we'll see more and more connections between our genes and our minds! ",False,False

I was bulimic for a short time, anorexic for a LONG time, and I'm pretty sure I'm on a stupid binge/restrict cycle now. ED's are definitely is considered ""contagious"", as well as hereditary due to the mental illness part of it. There was an article in some popular teen magazine awhile ago about being able to ""catch"" an eating disorder from a friend after watching their habits change and weight/appearance change. It was worth a read, I'll try to find it. ",False,False
