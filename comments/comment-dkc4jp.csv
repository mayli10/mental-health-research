This sounds really like my situation at the moment. I seem to have managed to get the restricting under control (well done to you for not restricting as well), but I am still bingeing and no longer fit most of my clothes. I'm also under financial strain because of the food costs.  Feeling rubbish about the weight I've put on but trying to stay on the positive side and view it as steps in recovery. I'm not restricting, so that is progress, my next step is to try and get a handle on the bingeing.  Hang in there and don't beat yourself up about it.",False,False
