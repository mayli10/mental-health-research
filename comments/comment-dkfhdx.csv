I’ve been “recovered,” a binge eater, and a restricter and it sucks no matter what.",False,True

Like instead of putting it beside the menu item on the menu, it should all be on its own page at the back of the menu or something. Even people who are trying to lose weight healthily or watch their intake like to treat themselves sometimes, I think making calories so central to a dining experience is harmful to everyone, not just those of us with eating disorder. I’m really sorry you had such a demoralising experience, it’s happened to me at Starbucks before and it sucks.",False,False
