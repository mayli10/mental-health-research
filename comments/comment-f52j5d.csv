You're definitely correct - this is not a problem that's been caused only by TikTok â€” there are heaps of factors that contribute.  The reason that I wrote about this is because TikTok is a new, extremely popular platform that is putting potentially harmful content in front of new people, and people who are vulnerable. Also, since TikTok is making money off every user, experts argue they have a responsibility to make sure they're not harming people in the process.  I'm not blaming anyone for making the content at all! I just think the platform has a responsibility to keep its users safe. Hope that helps clarify!",False,True

I think it's important ot look at the young people and underlying problems behind tiktok as well. Sleepdepribved so this might not make sense",False,False
