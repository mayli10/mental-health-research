I can't run because of medical issues, but I swim and do other stuff, so I'm looking for something that uses GPS when I go for a normal walk, and where I can choose a sport and how long I did this sport and it calculates how much I've burnt. And I would prefer one app which also needs weight and height for calculating this, cause online there are so many calculators that don't require height and weight and it's not specific enough for me since I'm really short.       I'll definitely look into these apps and soon as I have more time! Thank you",False,True

Any new task app will take some getting used to, but it's pretty close to Astrid, if you ever used Astrid back in the day before the developer pulled it and stopped supporting it (ugh, I loved that app). You can organize your tasks by list and add due dates, and then sort by due date or name, and it has an inbox where everything will show up together with the list as a header. Where it's worth it to me though is you can download the Windows/Mac desktop app and it syncs.  Health apps: Fitbit and Nike Plus both have the ability to sync to Lose It! if tracking calories burned is your thing. For Fitbit you do actually have to have a device; I picked the Flex because it was relatively inexpensive and waterproof. I had it for 3 years and never had issues with it, it seemed to be pretty indestructible (unlike my Apple Watch, which I actually have to be careful with, lol). Nike Plus uses your phone's GPS to track your run, so all you have to do is take it with you and it'll tell you distance and calories burned. Clue is pretty standalone, but what period app isn't?",False,False

Maybe because credit cards aren't necessary where I live. I don't even have one, most people I know don't have credit cards, so I might not need this app :D  &amp;#x200B;  I have to look into Asana and LoseIt... It sounds nice.   &amp;#x200B;  I was looking for a to do widget for my laptop... It's so hard to find one for my needs. I want to make at least 3 lists. One daily-to-do-list and one weekly-to-do-list and one with different things. And I want to be able to tick off the tasks and I want the ticks to be deleted the next day, so I can start new with the same tasks the next day, you know what I mean? And it would be cool if you could change the time when the ticks get removed (f.e. daily and weekly or something like that)... But i haven't found something like that yet.",False,True

Are you happy with it? How does it work?  &amp;#x200B;  And your health apps. Are they combined with other items, like fitness watches or just normal apps I can also use without any equipment?",False,True

My pre-iPhone ecosystem:  * tasks: Wunderlist (app and Mac app) * events: Google Calendar (app and browser) * mail: Outlook (Office for Mac/browser Gmail + app) * notes: Google Keep (app and browser) * finances: Mint (app and browser) * period: Clue (app only) * ""health"" (ED): Nike Plus, Fitbit Flex + app, Lose It!  Like I said, I have an iPhone now, but the basic setup is the same, though I switched out Google Keep for Notes (I still use Gmail, Maps, and Google Calendar though). I got an Apple Watch and I love the activity tracking. Things 3 is iPhone-only, but it's superior to Wunderlist for some things, like school projects.",False,False

You link it with your bank accounts and credit cards, can set financial goals, and it will also give you little reports on where most of your money goes (here's looking at you, Starbucks).   **Asana**\- for personal, work and school goal/task organizing and to-do lists. You can make a ""topic"" and then put little individual assignments or to-do items for each topic. You can set them to alert you when your due dates are coming up, so if I know a month from now that I need to get something done, then I'll put it in there asap and it'll give me reminders along the way. I often use this as a day planner.   **Dave**\- you CAN use this for little mini-loans between paychecks, but I just use it because it keeps track of dates for outgoing payments you make every month, and will give you an alert if it thinks you might have an overdraft or another issue. Also this reminds me if my debit cards are about to expire.     These are the only four that I use consistently that are goal oriented/keep me organized.",False,False
