I go to a lot of raves and shows where a lot of girls dress up, which tend to consist of really tight and/or revealing clothes (and sometimes hardly any clothes at all lol) and I see girls who are larger than me having the time of their lives in these cute outfits and they look good, and theyâ€™re not worrying about being self conscious yet here I am in baggy pants and a loose T-shirt because Iâ€™m too self conscious to wear anything else.
