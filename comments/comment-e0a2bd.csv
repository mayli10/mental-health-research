This is not helpful in the slightest and would count as a tip, which goes against the first rule of this sub. I don't know why you think telling someone who has an unhealthy obsession with being underweight how to better lose weight is a good thing. Please leave, you just triggered me into a bad evening.",False,True

I'd never recommend IF to someone who has/had an ED.  I just want to point out that intermittent fasting is when you eat the same amount of calories per day that you've usually been consuming, but you consume them in a smaller window.  So in your case, you'd maintain your 500 kcal deficit but you would only eat them within an 8-hour window.  It works for me but doesn't work for some others.  Your mileage may vary.",False,False

Insulin is the hormone that determines if you gain weight or lose weight. Insulin is what tells the body to burn fat or store fat. Carbohydrates increases insulin production dramatically, protein increase insulin production about 1/2 as much as carbohydrates. You're on low carb, so the protein you're eating is what is causing your insulin level to rise, the next step for you is to implement intermittent fasting so that your body produces less insulin. Your body produces 0 insulin when you are not eating, then you can eat what you need to eat in one or two meals per day.",False,False

But I get you, I attempted implementing my dieticians advice to my diet and despite still maintaining a deficit I kept fucking gaining. I think the dietary change messed with the water balance of my body? I'm muscular and when I start eating more carbs, my glycogen storage shoots up like crazy. It might not be fat, it may just be from the recomp of your body and it reacts differently to what you're feeding your body.   Also- yes the hard UW line seems to be way too emphasized. The actual line for UW changes from person to person. Low body fat and still restricting should be AN",False,False

I lost 10 lbs in a month earlier this year and have been stuck at 108 ever since. My weight hasn't changed at all even though I'm incapable of eating at maintenance without making myself sick. I don't know how that's possible. On average I eat 200-300 calories under my BMR.,False,False
