It definitely did last time I went out.  It's just shit that it's not something that can change things now, I guess I'm just fucking tired of rolling around this hellhole.",False,True

It's the way you carry yourself and hold your head up high with confidence! Now that's fucking sexy. I've found that self care helps with this. Pampering if you will. Sorry if this is all #thanksimcured bc it's not meant to be. But it should def help at the very least! Idk about you but when I get all ready and have my hair done and makeup on and some damn shapewear.. I feel like a queen! Even if it's just for one day, the mental break from this torturous hell is much needed.",False,False
