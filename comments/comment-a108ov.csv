Should I be honest or discourage others from following my lead?   I‚Äôm a drug addict. I‚Äôve loved drugs since I was 15 and learned I could be normal when I took them. I could feel happy and people liked me. I was beautiful.   I was never one for party drugs. Uppers make me crazy. I need something to slow my thoughts and dull the pain in all the places I hurt. I feel actual desire when I hear ‚Äúopiates‚Äù.   This is good for a long time until one day you realize you take your pills every single day. And you could totally stop, right? But then you‚Äôd have nothing to look forward to. Nothing to do. You‚Äôd be sad. So you keep on and tell yourself that tomorrow you‚Äôll take a day off.   When I‚Äôm high I don‚Äôt think about food. I don‚Äôt look at myself in the mirror and wish my neck was narrower. I don‚Äôt chew slowly and awkwardly like everyone in the world is staring at me. I want to engage and be social and be part of everything.   Unfortunately it‚Äôs not sustainable. I take Kratom now and it‚Äôs saved my life. I used it to taper off the hard stuff after many failed attempts. I use it responsibly, a low dose, and I take days off. People say it‚Äôs an appetite suppressant‚Äîand maybe it is at first, but it helps me eat. It helps me feel okay about being full. Weed helps too.   Then of course, there‚Äôs another kind of escape that truly allows me to eat like a normal human. I trip once a year...during which I usually have a revelation like ‚Äúholy shit, this fruit comes from the earth and powers my body. This is beautiful, this grape is so powerful and necessary and I appreciate it so much.‚Äù I generally try really hard to recover after a trip. Maybe there‚Äôs something there, who knows.

It's a love hate relationship but as the person said above, it's all about remaining functional. Yeah it's not the best coping mechanism, but it works and there's no calories lol I don't have an appetite if I don't smoke weed but this is more when I take a break. But if I restrict all day and come home and smoke, I will probably binge haha. I take LSD quite a bit but I am a really reflective person so I tend to just sit there and work out all my problems on acid, it's quite therapeutic for me especially because I take it at home and not really in a social setting. I tend to eat less on LSD but that's just because I'm too focussed on my mind and other shit lol. I've literally done my DBT workbook on acid and even my psych was like wtf why?? . MDMA is a waste of money if you are on any anti depressant but I loved it when I wasn't, great for energy and dancing all night (don't need to worry about the calories required to get drunk). I am a very tentative person so do your research (r/drugs is good) and remember you're doing the drugs, not the drugs doing you. If that makes sense. Be safe! ",False,False

Zoloft is a daily pill and I keep the Valium in my bag so I can pop half a pill if I think it‚Äôs shaping up to be a High Anxiety Day.    I‚Äôm also prescribed Tramadol and Flexeril as-needed for intermittent flare ups of pain due to a neck injury, but I would almost rather die than take that shit.    I‚Äôve had a lot of bad things and adversity happen to me the past several months, and I caught myself drinking more and more, and drinking nightly to self medicate my sleep. So I stopped having any alcohol in the house.    My boyfriend got me a marijuana vape and keeps me in ‚Äúweed juice,‚Äù as he calls it, to help me sleep and deal with my anxiety. I don‚Äôt particularly want to be high, but it works wonders to put me to sleep and keep the worst nightmares at bay.    I have PTSD. My life is basically a balancing act in a 3 ring circus. Don‚Äôt be a druggie / be functional. I‚Äôm constantly reevaluating and scrutinizing and figuring out what I can accept and what I must not accept and... It‚Äôs exhausting. My bf says he‚Äôs proud of me and that he respects and admires me and that he trusts me. I hope someday to love and trust myself. ",False,False

I guess I got into the drug scene as a temporary relief from my issues with food and my body, when I was going through a hard time in University. They gave me a sense of confidence that I had never felt before. I got hooked on the energy boost they gave me, and used them to go out dancing all night and just to feel more glamorous and exciting I guess? Different than how shitty I felt when I was sober, it brought me an escape from reality. I kind of associated the life of models and rockstars with drugs, the skinny junkie look, ‚Äúheroin chic‚Äùand I fell hard. Nowadays, I have toned down my use substantially, but still use drugs - cocaine, MDMA or sometimes LSD on weekends, and I‚Äôm addicted mostly to the appetite suppressing effect and the fact that I can dance for a long time (burning calories) without feeling tired. I feel so thin and lightweight after a party weekend, and I fear that if I stop using drugs, I will give in to weekend food binges and blow up, because whenever I stop my appetite seems to hit me with insane force :( But on the other hand, I can‚Äôt keep this up forever, because these drugs, especially in combination with restriction, are terrible for the heart, body, and mind. I‚Äôm kind of stuck right now. I know I need to quit but, much like the ED, I just feel like I‚Äôm tied to it for comfort and can‚Äôt quite seem to break free at the moment. ",False,False
