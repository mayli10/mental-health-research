I wouldn't take any specific vitamins or minerals unless your doctor discovers you have a deficiency. Some vitamins won't even absorb without proper amounts of dietary fat. I think its a good idea to stay hydrated and incorporate electrolyte-rich foods or drinks (NOT supplements, electrolyte imbalances can kill you). When you feel ready, I recommend trying to have breakfast, even a small one, so that your brain has glucose to help function efficiently (glucose is the primary fuel source for your brain). In the past, I enjoyed having oatmeal or a parfait in the morning. You mentioned you're in college, so I figured its worth letting you know that you might be able to see a university dietitian to help you out.",False,False

I hope you can recover, that'd be the terminal advice for pretty much everyone struggling here. But I know you won't get out of bed and submit yourself to impatient. So I'd suggest eating something just before bed and waking up, you don't have to change the cals you eat per day, just make sure you eat something like a clementine at those hours.",False,False
