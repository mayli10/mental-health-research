First of all, I think it’s far more healthy to be blissfully unaware than constantly fixating on your flaws and worrying about what other people see. And second, obviously you’re already gifted with a very sharp and introspective mind, you’re not going to just lose that. In fact, I think you will gain a lot of perspective when you manage to see things in a more positive light. I used to be really judgemental and resentful towards people and now I’m realizing in my case that it was jealousy, misery loves company. I was insecure and my coping mechanism was convincing myself everyone else was flawed far worse than myself. Everyone has coping mechanisms and I think you’ll realize that one is far more common than you’d think- that’s why some people are so irrationally cruel and critical, they’re most likely deeply insecure and their behaviour is just self-preservation.",False,False

Like, we all know folks who sail through the world completely oblivious as to how they appear to others, the space they take up, the impressions they make, the volume of their noisy chewing or annoying laugh... if I try to convince myself I'm thin enough, or pretty enough, do I risk blinding myself to flaws that could really change how I'm perceived by others?   I hate to admit this, but sometimes I feel a sense of irrational resentment towards certain people who seem too damn comfortable in their skin, ""fat and happy"" (so to speak) and just totally clueless as to how they look to the rest of the world. I don't mean I actually dislike them, it's just a knee-jerk emotional response that I try to correct, but it happens (maybe it's fueled by jealousy? like, ""how dare they be so pleased with themselves when I'm over here critiquing my every flaw,"" idk). I would be mortified to think someone feels the same kind of irritation towards me, and it seems like keeping the inner critic around definitively precludes that from happening. Not sure how much sense this makes outside my own brain, but if anyone can relate, I guess it would be this sub...",False,False

It might sound pretty cringy, but you need to sit down and make a list of things you like about yourself, or things other people have said they like about you, things you're proud of. Make a habit of reminding yourself about these things. Hipsters call these 'affirmations'- and it might sound like bogus, but it really works. Actually, there's science behind it. Specifically it has to do with the hebbian law if you want to look that up, rewiring and making new connections in your brain. It sounds really hard, but you're worth the effort, believe me. Make it a habit to tell yourself good things every day, especially when catch yourself having self depreciating thoughts. Remember, things will only get better if you try. Once you get used to *really* trying, you'll be surprised how much power you have. ",False,False
