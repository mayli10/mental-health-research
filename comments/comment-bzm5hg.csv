The way I put my mind at rest was by telling myself that even if the number was *slightly* wrong, if i only ever weighed on one scale, and it shows I lost a lb or whatever, then I did lose a lb, you feel me? i know itâ€™s frustrating and natural when you have an ED to want to know the exact number but for at home scales, you can just never know.   hope this helps in any wayðŸ’•",False,False
