Not just that but other digestive issues too. It sucks and it can be uncomfortable but keep up with the water and try not to force it. Do not get into laxatives (unless doctor recommends), very very much sucks and gets very addictive VERY quickly (at least it does for me). Took me forever to stop and even now I think about it when it gets bad. When you try to poop don't push too hard or long because that might cause haemorrhoids. Just try to be patient and if it doesn't get better, go see your doctor. Adding some oil or fat might help.",False,False
