I always describe her as coltish, naturally slim with long lanky limbs, even before all the exercise required chiselled a bit of weight off her. Her instructors used to be on her all the time about her weight and she never said a thing about it to me until I seen them in person at a competition. She told me she wanted to work her way to looking like the instructor's daughter  (who, to be honest, was very clearly underweight).  This terrified me because the same shit happened between myself and my showjumping coach when I was roughly her age. Thank the stars she lost interest because I couldn't handle seeing her be like me",False,False
