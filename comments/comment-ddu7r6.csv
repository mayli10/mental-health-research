To just maintain you current weight you need to be eating about 400-500 calories more per day. (I did some tdee estimates),False,False

I’m reluctant to give up exercising though because ED shit aside it does make me feel really good :/",False,True

Eating healthy can help you keep from nutrient deficiencies, but it's both... I'd say you're unlikely to start having periods again if you keep on the 1500 cal a day. Keep us updated.",False,False

If you get sick you have nothing to fall back on and can go downhill really quickly.   How much do you exercise? If you are exercising now you may want to stop to protect your heart. When the body doesn't have enough nutrients or calories (and this can happen if you aren't underweight and just badly malnourished) your body starts to eat your organs for fuel including your heart. This is the big one. You are actually at risk for a heart attack. This is how many underweight people die.  If you can't poop, really look at your diet and make sure you are getting enough fiber as in fresh produce.   Not getting a period means your body is shutting down non urgent systems in order to not die. It means you aren't healthy enough to be pregnant and that the stress of a pregnancy would be detrimental to your health. HOWEVER, I strongly urge you to use birth control because it's still possible for you to ovulate and not know it. I feel like a pregnancy would probably put you in the hospital whether or not you miscarry.   I know you probably know this already but I urge you to seek medical treatment with a doctor to get a physical and see a dietitian that specializes in eating disorders. They are going to want you to gain weight.",False,False
