I keep hearing the book being praised and strongly recommended but it‚Äôs so hard to get myself to read when I‚Äôm not on a ‚Äúgood‚Äù streak. Audiobooks are tough for me to focus on/not drift off in thought but podcast form would be amazing!,False,False

HIGHLY recommend the brain over binge podcast. I 100% credit this with giving me the tools to stop binging. for reference I‚Äôm almost 2 months no binges and I can count how many times I‚Äôve binged in the last 6 months on 2 hands, and I get urges less and less + they‚Äôre no where near as compelling",False,False
