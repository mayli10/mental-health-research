A close friendship is an underrated relationship, even when it isn't complicated. Love is love. Platonic, romantic, whatever.   I'm glad you said you're agnostic, because I guess I am too at this point, but I avoided mentioning it in case you were atheistic. Life could all be in a cosmic computer simulation beyond our ability to comprehend it, for all we know: who's to say death is final just because its data is in a private class we can't access?  Hope you and her meet again someday in another bright, beautiful, and gentler world.  I don't know if this helps at all, but when a friend suddenly died, I kept sending him texts for a while. How much I missed him. How bizarre it felt that he wasn't going to be able to follow the dreams he'd been working on. It was nice to feel like he was still there on the other end, just afk, and that he'd be back later to read the messages.  If you still have her friended on any social media, maybe that could give you at least a tiny bit of closure.",False,False

We did things but I dont want to assume anything and now shes gone I just. I dont know. I felt so much and I cant say anything. Its a gony. I just want to find wherever she is and cry because I know shed understand.  I so hope she's safe now. She battled too much. The only relief is knowing shes free know. I'm agnostic  and dont expect anyone to agree but its the only comfort. I'd do anything. I really would. Id give anything with no thought. I loved her and I never got to say it. Now even thinking it feels selfish. I just want her okay.,False,True

It doesn't overshadow the high points just because it followed them.   Hold onto those. You're the keeper of those memories now.  She will never be in pain or afraid again. She can rest now. I'm so sorry.,False,False

For some reason hearing that helps. She truly was amazing. I don't know if she was in ed communities (I guess she past before we changed. Weird.) But for some reason postining here and on IG helps. I know she cant see it but I really do feel she supported it. I cant explain her. Thank you for recognising her.,False,True

We didnt formally date and I dont want to push that on her. We did other things and were very close. She was everything from a sister to a friend to a girlfriend. Her family cant know.  I dont know what to respectfully call her so I go for ex/best friend. She was an amazing friend until the end. I loved her even if she didnt feel the same way.,False,True
