I get what you mean, I often struggle with feeling invalid with my eating disorder because I'm not underweight and so it is such an invisible struggle, nobody will look at me and think that I have a problem with eating. Whereas if someone sees my self harm scars, they instantly know that I struggle with depression and/or some form of mental illness. It makes you feel valid in a way the eating disorder doesn't.   Scars are public, our disordered thoughts around food aren't.",False,False
