Zoloft won’t make you eat the whole pack of Oreos! That’s totally a choice :) the biggest difference I noticed is I don’t hate myself anymore. Like, I don’t love myself but I don’t hate me either! It feels.. nice!",False,False

It’s helped SO much! I can’t believe I didn’t do it sooner. My doc said 9 months then she is gonna lower the dose until I’m off of it. I have social anxiety so I saw an online doctor in my bedroom which really helped! I know everyone is different but sometimes your mind needs a break from the sadness to get yourself together! My life has changed sooo much! I exercise more instead of eating less so basically still losing but doing it healthy(er).. I’m back in school, and quit smoking pot and laying around all day! I snap less at my husband and play with my kids a ton more! Idk. Maybe look into medication to get you over the hump! All the best ♥️",False,False

Having an eating disorder is a lonely and miserable existence. I used to completely isolate myself from all my friends and just hid in my room obsessing over calories, weight and exercise.   You're not alone. I'm here, this whole community is here for you. My heart is seriously aching for you because I can imagine the pain you're going through right now. Fuck eating disorders!",False,False

I know how you're feeling, just a few months ago I was in the depths of my eating disorder. Words cannot describe the pain eating disorders and depression cause. Your post really touched me because it's something I could've written.   I've been in the hospital for three months now and I'm recovering. It's so fucking difficult, but so worth it. It angers me that you don't have access to free health care, but I'm glad you live in LA - I'm sure you can find help there. I used to attend a support group and it helped me a lot and made me feel less alone.   You will get better and you will get your aspirations and hobbies and goals back. Life will be worth living. It's probably close to impossible to imagine right now, but I promise you. I'm here for you and you can always send me a PM if you want to.",False,False
