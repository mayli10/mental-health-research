Its intended use is for measuring/predicting mortality risk across populations, yeah, but as a general rule, it's not an unreasonable proxy for estimating health and body fat. An interesting fact I didn't know until arguing this point with an RD is that Asian populations apparently have some leeway and can get away with the healthy label as low as BMI 18 — something to do with bone density? Again, that's at the population level, but still.  BMI is a very crude tool that doesn't tell you anything about individual health, nutrition, or body composition, we all know that. But the ""healthy range"" is *a range* that accommodates a fairly wide variety of weights at any given height. If you're significantly underweight, it's reasonable to assume that you are at increased risk for health issues. I think there is also an assumption that it's pretty difficult for the human body to naturally settle at an extremely low weight without something bad going on; aka famine, illness, disordered eating. Therefore, very low BMI is usually a warning sign, it's not normal.  Even ignoring the fact that it's riskier to starve oneself than to carry a little extra weight, consider the opposite end of the spectrum. Would you assume that someone mildly overweight is on the brink of a heart attack? Probably not. As they get heavier, though... no one denies that risk increases. It's the same with being underweight.",False,False
