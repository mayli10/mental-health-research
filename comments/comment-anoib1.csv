I wasn't trying to be overly critical or anything, I was just worried about you getting in trouble. But I understand how you feel, it is really a hard career for people with eating disorders, not only due to the constant exposure to food but the long hours shitty hours and stress can wreck havoc on anyone's mental health. There's certainly a reason so many in the industry abuse drugs/alcohol and are known for harsher attitudes and a considerably more toxic work environment than most jobs.   And I know people seem to be disapproving of you throwing food away in the responses but in my opinion many people with eating disorders have done this in some form, honestly it could even be argued that b/p is throwing food away because it ends the same. Everyone copes differently and EDs are an awful mental illness to live with, especially in our career. Do what makes you feel better and what makes you able to live your life.",False,False

I am already critical of my work place for being wasteful and appreciate the concern for me and them.The things I make for myself in mind are lower cost and harder to track or easy to write off as shrinkage or waste. I do half to quarter portions when it is for me because the food is more decadent and also to feel less bad about throwing things out. I would never throw out a higher cost item.  As for my report and authority in the kitchen I am a lead closing cook and on the line to be a sous chef at this place within 6 months time but I may move elsewhere or change careers entirely by then because it is stressful and it ad well paying as I could do in other jobs.  Thank you again for the response. ,False,True

There's something oddly satisfying about cooking for customers without eating anything yourself, satisfies the urge I guess.   But the business side of this post kind of hurt to read too. I understand EDs aren't always rational and I don't know what the situation is in your kitchen or what your authority in the restaurant may be but if the owner/managers find out you're making a lot of money worth in food to throw away you could get in a lot of trouble or even be  fired in my kitchen so please be careful :(. I understand the urge and I like to try to channel it into making the best food possible for customers/coworkers or the best low cal shift meal for myself. Most restaurants record stock regularly  and I'm not sure if you're allowed unlimited free food but if not they will investigate if lots of stock is going missing unaccounted for. Stay safe ",False,False
