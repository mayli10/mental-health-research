I started talking to this guy as well and I keep putting off meeting him because he keeps suggesting going out to eat and I just cannot fathom the thought plus I’m terrified he’s gonna think I’m massive and no longer want to see me once we meet in person :/,False,False

Eating has always been a social tradition in every culture, tradition, and even in literature (breaking bread with Jesus, Kramer taking food from Jerry, friendsgiving on Friends, that symbolic scene in Raisin in the Sun where he argues over his wife’s eggs and throws them.) The thing about food in literature has been mentioned in like 5 different books in my life, “if you want to symbolize characters getting along.”",False,False

Keep it casual and simple, and say you have issues with food. I think he would be really considerate and avoid dates with food as the main focus in the future.  Or you could just say that you have a weak ass stomach and can only eat whole foods, or else you get dizzy and sick as an excuse. Works for me. All the best!! ❤",False,False

It sucks to be put on the spot like it sounds you were, i hope the donut tasted good at least.  Its really hard though. I spent more money and calories than im comfortable with this week on social events. IF you guys continue to see another (he sounds sweet! good luck!) then maybe take initiative to suggest more activities that don't involve food - like paintball, or hiking, or taking a one off art class, or just hanging out a cool park.",False,False

I don’t think dating, which tends to happen around meal time, involves food or alcohol or some combination of the two. But you can suggest places you’re comfortable at... like a lot of Thai and Vietnamese places have good salads and soups, or sushi (you can get just sashimi), or snow cones (there are sugar free syrups) or Taiwanese snow ice (small without topping is 160 calories). Any bar just get hard liquor. Coffee shop get unsweetened tea or black coffee. I have a gluten Allergy that helps me get my way with food choices, but having some control really helps. Especially if I know I’m splurging calories, I wasn’t give reallyfucking delicious, not enchiladas and mediocre ice cream",False,False
