He is just so skinny that it really triggers my ED because I don't even want to be within a few kg of him or I feel really bad about myself considering I'm over 30cm shorter than him. He can eat anything he wants and he just doesn't gain weight. But, I have to remember that the grass is always greener. I know he himself is very insecure about his weight and wants to gain more. I'm just really envious of him being so lanky.",False,False

So his BF% is realistically two-thirds of mine. He gets comments like ""you look like a noodle,"" or ""do you play basketball?"" He has the most healthy food and body image of anyone I've ever seen, and generally eats whatever the hell he wants. I definitely do not want comments on my body, but at the same time I'm jealous of the attention he gets. I'm like, HELLO TECHNICALLY I AM SKINNER THAN HIM PLZ CALL ME NOODLE",False,False
