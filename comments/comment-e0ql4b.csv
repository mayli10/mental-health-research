The author really doesn't shy away from the bad parts of an ed though, the way Cassie died is mentioned, and it's very disturbing. I remember having to stop reading for a week because the thought upset me so much. But it stopped me from ever purging, so.....it's effective! It's very pseudo-supernatural, like the MC thinks she sees Cassie's ghost and you honestly never know if she's real or just Lias way to cope. Idk I'd give it 100 pages and see if you still hate it.",False,False

At first it was out of pure desperation of trying to undo binging. But then it grew to where I’d just drink a bunch of water to purge so I wouldn’t have to chance it on possibly absorbing calories after a binge. I stoped honestly because I read something someone said about how all they had to do was put their finger in their mouth. Not even down their throat and they would vomit. I realized I probably couldn’t give good blowjobs if my gag reflex was that strong...",False,False

I think I’d rather die than get food poisoning.   I used to use laxatives to purge but they don’t really work and you have to time it right. Plus they messed up my digestive system.   I’m still bulimic at heart but I just restrict and over exercise as my way of “purging” now,False,False

I had a stomach bug once when I was a kid, and I sat in my dad’s armchair all night, clutching a plastic bucket and throwing up in it. 15 years later I still remember the unpleasant acidic taste in my mouth and it makes me recoil. So my method has always been to restrict.",False,False

I'm so afraid of puking that if I'm actually sick for like with the flu I can talk myself out of puking like think my way out of it. I started doing that as a child bc I've always been scared to vomit.   I wish I was one of those that could do it on command it would be (although yes harmful) quite helpful and also make me feel valid,False,False
