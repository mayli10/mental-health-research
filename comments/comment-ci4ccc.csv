Thank you for your input.,False,True

I made the decision after learning how badly the animals are exploited and the environmental impacts raising and consuming animals has.  If going back to an omnivorous diet upsets you because it goes against your morals, then you aren't doing it primarily for disordered reasons. If it upsets you because it means more options and it would make masking your restriction harder, then it's for disordered reasons.  You can have both as a motivation, but which ever is strongest I would say is the reason behind your decision.",False,False

The standard by which almond milk fails to be vegan is a pretty insane one.  If you're really worried you can try and find some almond milk produced somewhere with more native bees or find something like almond milk.  There are various other milk like products in a similar vein to almond milk that you may like.  At the end of the day dietary choices play second fiddle to reality.  We can't cause zero animal suffering, that's just not possible.  The goal for many vegans is to minimize it subject to the constraints of our lives.  Mental health is one of those contraints and if giving up a safe food is significantly detrimental to your mental health then you should not do it.  You're not *almost* vegan because you face difficulties other vegans don't.  I'm not a vegan so take all this for what you will but I hope it helps.",False,False
