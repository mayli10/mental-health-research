Depending on the macros, your TDEE may today go up by a bit, because there's more energy available so your body can use more energy.  Yes you'll store a fair bit of it. Eating that much, you're bound to store some of it.  Most of the weight gain will be water and undigested food weight, however. If you show as putting on 3 kilos after taking a good bowel movement, as little as 200 grams of that could be the energy from the food you just ate, as glycogen as well as as fat.",False,False

A pound of pure fat (olive oil, tallow, lard) is into the 4200s assuming 9.4kcal/gram. Once you're at starvation levels of fatness (as someone who has anorexia might be) the maths changes entirely. Now you're mainly losing muscle and organ weight, and lean meat doesn't have all that many calories, and now your body is also slowing metabolism down overall (more so than at higher fatness levels) because it doesn't really want to lose organ and muscle weight.",False,False
