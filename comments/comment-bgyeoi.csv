Maybe I’ll call it my grandma feature from now on. &gt;.&lt;  I had a long response about blood pressure and all the things it could be... but I realized it was pointless as it’s not like we could do any of what an in person physician could, nor were we qualified.",False,False

I have POTS and when I had AN, they felt virtually the same to me. With eating disorders so many things can effect your blood pressure ranging from your sodium levels to your blood sugar. Yes it could be something like an ocular migraine or a migraine with aura but that’s highly unlikely given the fact that you just said you’ve been heavily restricting and you aren’t familiar with this feeling.. If you are prone to migraines starvation and restriction can be a trigger for them to so make sure that if it happens again you consult a doctor to make sure that everything is OK. Have you tried taking naproxen or Tylenol? They’re good for headaches - and if you think it’s blood sugar lay down flT on the ground to rest!",False,False

He had a lot of tests done on his eyes just to make sure, but they concluded that it was a problem in the optic nerve in the brain, not in the eyes themselves. It went away on its own.  He's a healthy weight and never restricts calories, so if you have the same thing it might not be related to ED. He does have depression though. Anyways, that's all the experience I have to share. Maybe worth following up with your doc, especially if it happens again.",False,False

Its happened to me a few times. I haven't been to a doctor specifically for it, but for me when it happens, I just drink some water, take some ibuprofen or excedrin migraine and lay in a dark quiet  room.",False,False

I am still not sure about that but I took some supplements right when ""the episode"" was still happening , my vision was still weird but getting better, and it went away. k only had this happen again once after like 2 years.   I dont know if we experienced the same thing - I felt like there were  empty spots in my field vision, like i would hold my hand in front of my eyes but I could only see half of it and half of it was non-existent, nit actually blurry. It was very weird and scary and after thag I remember having a terrible headache too.   I was restricting but not that heavily at that time.",False,False
