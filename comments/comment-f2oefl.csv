You can totally do it, just don't put too much pressure on yourself. I struggled to get past 6 days and in the end I managed to get to 22! Then I fucked up, but my point is that it is possible, and every time you get up and try again it gets easier.   Try downloading the I am Sober app, it motivates you to take one day at a time and it gives you small and achievable goals. You got this !",False,False

Also give yourself some credit man, 5 days without binging is pretty good, definitely better than 0 days without binging",False,False
