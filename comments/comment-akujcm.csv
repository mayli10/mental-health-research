One of them always said ""YoU bUrNeD 400 CaLoRiEs!""   Yeah right. You fucking liar. I don't burn 400 calories in 30 mins of running, let alone doing some pitiful planks and crunches. It should be illegal. There are people who will eat according to this, and we all know 400 calories can mean A LOT.",False,False

I don't believe for a second that spices and seasonings don't have calories (especially if they're bigger pieces like Minced Onion). I just count it as 5 I hateeee when I'm not given nutrition info.

I account for a 20%-40% margin of error for a lot of things or if I REALLY don‚Äôt trust it I‚Äôll as much as double the calories for it. I have an obsession with being precise or as close as possible and have dissected menus and ingredients and scoured the internet many times to see if the calories listed on products and meals are accurate or not. ,False,False

I also know people who do the exact opposite. You just have to trust that if you have the nutritional information, the calorie count will not be off by much because they are very standardized.

I had an ice cream from ikea for lunch and don‚Äôt eat breakfast so I thought I should be way hungrier around dinner. I just had dinner and it was suspiciously light and filling (about 200 cal).

When I log calories, I grossly overestimate to the point where it's just funny. Prepackaged stuff is one thing, but I'm even worse with stuff that doesn't come in a package.
