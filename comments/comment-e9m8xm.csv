Heâ€™s already said (since we have a week off work) that weâ€™ll be cooking all this good food, eating edibles, and drinking... Iâ€™m worrying about calories already (ðŸ™„ðŸ˜¬) because the drunk munchies arenâ€™t bad enough letâ€™s get high and eat even more. Thanks babe. Really Iâ€™m looking forward to it, but my stupid brain is panicking",False,False

Do you have anyone you could ask to spend the holiday with you maybe? Maybe look into helping out on Christmas eve, there are homeless shelters and hospitals that do all sorts of charity events and I think that could be a very nice way to spend the day.  For me the issue is that I'll be there for 2 weeks and almost everyday is filled with food and drinks usually because I'm seeing different friends and relatives each day who all want to do some celebration together. I know I should be happy but I'm worried about how I'll ""make up for it"". I'll try to put in as much exercise as I can and bring safe foods with me but you know how this mindset works.   Thanks for the reply!",False,True

Christmas Day Iâ€™ll be at the gym by myself   but sorry youâ€™re anxious, remember that youâ€™re there for family and friends, and yes food is apart of celebrations but itâ€™s only one or a couple of days and you wonâ€™t gain weight from a day or two. I know itâ€™s hard but try and focus on catching up with your family.   Maybe bring a safe dish to share with everyone so youâ€™re eating and being apart of the day but also not freaking out? Idk. I havenâ€™t had to deal with this in a long time but I wish it was one of my problems :(",False,False
