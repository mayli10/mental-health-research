I know this sucks right now because you’re going to have to let go of some ideas you didn’t even realize you were hoping for, and maybe some you did.   BUT love is a spectrum and so fluid.  What attracted you to him is still a part of him and maybe that means the two of you could be incredibly good friends. For years. That’s what happened to me anyway. I am hoping it’s the same for you because it’s a really unique kind of love and friendship.   Hang in there. It won’t always hurt this much.",False,False
