(Saphris. Ugh. That was the first med where when the doctor suggested I keep trying it I put my foot down. Akathisia sucks.) Latuda was the best experience for me but my current insurance won’t cover it. The requirement to take with 350 kcal kinda sucks...but better than olanzapine’s functional demand that I eat the whole house.   I tried ECT (after TMS and a parade of meds and therapy seemed ineffective). I understand why I chose it, but I kinda wish I hadn’t, primarily because it trashed my memory. But then, I’ve met people who were really helped by it, so it’s just a freakin hard call. I did heccin love being put under. Like, yesssss plz this is the instant oblivion I have lonnnnged for. (The fact that treatment days were totally shot and I had to wear adult diapers to the appointments because the ECT made me pee my pants was annoying but nbd. My life was a hot mess at that juncture anyhow.)   Anywhooo, end of storytime, lol. I really hope you’ll find something that works well and with minimal side effects!",False,False
