Thanks :) Yes I often blamed me not eating on my older chronic health problems many of times.  I‚Äôm just filled with so much self hatred.. I‚Äôm so miserable and hate myself so much. I hope that gets better because I can‚Äôt take it anymore.  I hate when people make comments like ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt want to order anything?‚Äù And things like that. It‚Äôs SO hard. It also makes me afraid to recover because of what people may say and my brain is more fragile and triggered easily than ever.,False,True

He is the only person who is aware. I was suffering with my Crohn's for a long time before I admitted the ED on top of it so used that as an excuse for my withering body. &amp; when I began to weight restore I simply told in-laws &amp; other family it was due to my getting better from Crohn's but it made me uncomfortable to talk about my body changing.   It worked well &amp; they left it at that so your situation is slightly different.

Greatly appreciated üñ§ I feel so alone sometimes.. especially now :( yeah that‚Äôs great advice.. I still have people saying things like that. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm afraid of..

I'm generally about throughout the day so should always be checking my messages every so often just in case.  Yeah as I'm sure you're aware sometimes people are fairly ignorant on EDs (especially SO's if you have perhaps lied to them in the past or not told the whole story) &amp; the treatment for them so just ignore any unhelpful comments made to you.   I'd also tell everyone around you &amp; anyone you may see on a regular basis that you are starting recovery &amp; ask them not to comment on your eating habits or your body. I do find a lot of people say things they mean to be kind &amp; helpful but end up triggering (example ""Oh you look so healthy!""

That would be so greatly appreciated :) if you ever need support or anything do not hesitate to message me &lt;3   Yeah I‚Äôve also noticed on EDanon how SO‚Äôs can trigger relapses or things like that.. so if your brain is really fragile (like mine right now) maybe it wouldn‚Äôt be helpful.,False,True

We've certainly been through our rough patches in the 14 years we've been together so don't always assume relationships will be smooth sailing. They definitely take a lot of compromise &amp; patience.

I think I‚Äôve finally reached my breaking point. I think I want to really recover now. It seems so scary but it has to be better than my empty and miserable life right now. Even though I still feel not enough despite my brother saying I look anorexic I think I‚Äôve had enough. I really want to recover :) hah I ate what I wanted today.. still exercising as I write this.. but small steps I guess. I‚Äôll try to eat tomorrow even though I want to fast. My brain had just deteriorated into nothing. My parents had to sit with me to keep watch.   They want to take extra measures I think now. I feel like I need extra help with this :-/   That‚Äôs so true... I‚Äôm glad you went out anyways! I‚Äôm sure that helped.

I used to stay in because I was ashamed of my body too. Do you know what helped me? Going out anyway! Regardless of how I felt.  Now that I have my little girl &amp; she goes to nursery every morning, I have no choice. So at the beginning of my weight restoration, when I felt bloated, uncomfortable, afraid....I still *had to* leave my house. I can't drive &amp; she walks very slowly on her little legs so I felt I was being paraded through the streets in a fun-house mirror type body &amp; everyone would judge me. The more I did it the more I realised that not only was no one looking at or even noticing me at all, most people wouldn't have given a crap if they had.  They don't know my story or my life, I'd have been at most a very passing thought to them if they saw me at all. That thought wouldn't have been about my body either, more like ""Oh look, a lady with a little girl"" or possibly ""That's a nice colour top"" or similar. Most people don't look what we consider to be perfect. &amp; I don't care what other people look like, it's always been about how I view myself. People are too wrapped up with their own stuff in their own lives to pay much attention to how other people look. Because as long as you're a good person how you look is unimportant. Like they say - you can't polish a turd. What you'd get is some shiny, golden, pretty from afar thing that in the end is still a piece of shit.  It really is all about how you make peace with yourself. It's helpful to eat regularly &amp; enough, it frees up so much mental space so you can find other things of interest without food constantly on your mind. That may be food related eventually, for example I love to bake &amp; cook, but I also enjoy crochet, knitting, colouring books (it's like I'm actually 5 years old haha) &amp; reading.

I really shouldn‚Äôt be concerned about calories under 1,000 because your body pretty much burns it off doing nothing.   Hahaha yes or stomach expanding! I love your illustration! Genius :) As I do know our stomach expands and it feels uncomfortable I believe that after I eat my entire body becomes fat... like people will view me differently like I become a huge 200 pound woman. I feel bad and dirty if I eat in public.. like I can‚Äôt be around people or walk around after I eat because then people‚Äôs perception of me will change.

Considering all the repairs your body needs to accomplish I'd actually estimate from my experience that once you start eating properly that could raise up to between 2-3000 for a period of time!   When you eat more, you burn more, your body has to expend energy to just digest the food. Especially in recovery it is working extremely hard &amp; requires a lot of fuel to fix itself. It sounds utterly insane but believe it. It happened to me &amp; the majority of other people I have read experiences of. It's not uncommon.  As for feeling fat immediately after or even during eating - I can tell you why that is. &amp; it's so simple it's almost funny. There is your stomach, it's waiting for some food, some food enters your stomach &amp; takes up space. No matter the amount, your stomach then expands. That food takes time to digest &amp; get used by the body. So, yes indeed, the organ that is the stomach expands to accept the food. This is completely normal &amp; happens to everyone on the planet. But here's the funny part - once your stomach has done it's job, removed the energy from the food &amp; passed it along your digestive tract - bam! Your stomach *goes back to normal again*. So sure you may feel larger for a short while, everyone does after they eat, however much that may be. It happens after you drink even just water. It has to be in your body for a certain amount of time before it gets used. So yep, there's a feeling of fullness, this is fine, it's normal &amp; *temporary*.  What your ED sees as ""OMG I ate a cookie &amp; look I got fat immediately"" is a totally incorrect thought based on a temporary body change. We fluctuate so much throughout the day &amp; this happens multiple times if we eat multiple times, but it passes. The stomach is designed to do this, it's almost elastic, it can stretch, that's the point of it. It's like a holding pen for nutrition :) kind of like you put a bunch of sheep in a holding pen at a farm or whatever, then you let the sheep out one by one into the field, eventually that pen is ready for more animals, it doesn't really change but does look different &amp; fuller for a little while.

There will never be a thin enough until you're dead. That's how the disease works.   As for the sympathy/caring part...There is a difference between caring for &amp; pitying someone. When you're unwell, people pity you. Sure they have sympathy &amp; show you attention &amp; feel bad for you...but that's exactly the problem. They feel bad for you, it's not good attention or happy attention as if you'd achieved something or did a good thing. It's pity &amp; that is sad.   When people care for you they care regardless of weight or sickness. They genuinely care &amp; always will &amp; no amount of sickness or health or circumstance &amp; situation changes it. Those are the people you want in your life &amp; they are exactly the people you don't need to *prove* anything to. Which is a great thing.  I was also treated poorly when I was a chubby pre teen. But the funny thing is, at that stage of life you are undeveloped as are all your peers. So their attitudes &amp; reactions to bodies &amp; weights are the reactions of unlearned, inexperienced, children. Once you grow &amp; learn you find people couldn't give less of a shit about your body, they're too busy with their own lives &amp; problems. They literally don't care about your weight. So living into adulthood being bothered by the prior reactions &amp; comments of *children*, who likely have their own problems now anyway, seems a little silly doesn't it?   Your body &amp; your life isn't about them anyway, it's about you. Why feel you have to impress or change for some kids from the past?",False,False

I know it‚Äôs BDD but still.   I‚Äôm so happy you have a beautiful child! And yes you have tons of time to make better memories!! &lt;3   I‚Äôm debating weather or not to eat today.. ugh I just want to fast again.

I was very obviously unwell &amp; honestly still didn't see it. Looking back at photos I'm horrified at how bad I looked.

I guess that‚Äôs true. So no one ever feels ‚Äúsick‚Äù I guess meaning anorexic looking or thin enough to recover? That‚Äôs so odd... I don‚Äôt understand.

One big thing that stood out to me there is you don't feel sick enough...here's something to think on:  Normal people, people who either get sick or aren't sick, don't want to be. They don't feel they should get the flu or tonsilitis or something *worse* to justify getting treatment for it. The very fact you don't feel sick enough shows how sick you really are. Just some ""food"" (haha) for thought.   Good you're at least seeing someone for advice even if you don't feel it's particularly helpful yet. It gives you a great ""in"" into help when you're ready. &amp; be warned, with an eating disorder you will *never* feel either ready or sick enough. If it's affecting you in any way - you are sick enough. At any weight, body shape, BMI, you are sick enough. The best time to start is always now :)",False,False

I‚Äôve been going to a nutritionist/therapist and she‚Äôs OK- haven‚Äôt implemented a meal plan yet but I just can‚Äôt do it yet :(.  I don‚Äôt feel sick enough...

The nutritionist seems to be rushing me a little now since I‚Äôve been going to her for over 4 months and she still wants to weigh me, etc but I can‚Äôt deal with that yet. I felt SO upset when I left last time.   You‚Äôre right... ughh I‚Äôm so sorry about that. Been dealing with it pretty bad for almost 2 years now.

I used to do exactly what you do - fast then eat all at once alone...it really messed up my ability to accept food at other intervals so I'd definitely start trying to change that up a bit.  As for the damage caused, well, there is a ton you can &amp; can't see. For example, not only are your hair &amp; nails probably brittle &amp; thinning...that's also happening to your bones! If you don't get a menstrual cycle your body has decided to give up on the idea of reproduction as there is no food to support a growing child so that will (I assume) take a lot to heal up - I still don't have a period (&amp; haven't for 3 years). As well as muscle wastage in arms &amp; legs etc, your heart is also a muscle...when that starts to shrink &amp; waste away you're in trouble. Muscle atrophy can affect stomach muscles too so digestion &amp; transit time can really go to shit, pardon the pun! Either too fast or slow, &amp; gastroparesis is a thing &amp; naaaasty.   I don't know how long you've been struggling but I suffered for 20 years. Believe me, get out of it if you can asap! I wasted my youth &amp; over half my life &amp; for what? I hit my goal, surpassed my goal &amp; still felt like utter crap. At least feeling a bit crap in a healthier body means I don't die! I can now do so much more, I have energy &amp; I can live. Learn from my mistakes, please! If you can't do it alone there is absolutely zero shame asking for help.",False,False

Thank you so very much for your tremendous help. Actually yes I do know my intolerances and I *try* to follow it but in those moments I‚Äôm really hungry so I kind of ignore them. Not good lol. Also I eat all at once- I‚Äôm SUPER bad at spreading it out. I used to but bc my ED has only gotten worse I eat at night away from anyone. Not matter how little I eat (could be just a couple of raw veggies in salsa) or a bowl of cereal I still eat when no one is around AKA 11:00 at night. I hate eating during the day bc if my stomach does decide to hurt then I have to deal with it the whole day.  And I‚Äôm so sorry you suffer from Crohn‚Äôs disease :( I know how hard auto immune diseases are to deal with.   Hmmm that must be it! So you think it‚Äôs caused by your metabolism working extra hard to digest everything or working on internal damage? And if it‚Äôs damage what would that be for example? Thank you so much again you‚Äôre giving me some hope :) I really need to try and recover. Ugh.,False,True

It could be related to *what* rather than *how much* you're eating. Or both. Do you have any intolerances you're aware of? Also when you do eat are you eating all your food at once or spreading it out? In my non expert opinion, you are putting significant stress on your body by prolonged fasting then eating, it would possibly benefit you to eat daily &amp; spread your food out with a little bit every few hours so your body gets used to accepting food again.   Example for me is when I began recovery my body was not used to a regular supply of food &amp; as such didn't know what to do with it. I bloated immensely, got cramps, digestive problems (which to be fair I have anyway as I suffer from Crohn's disease but this was definitely exacerbated by my restriction) while my body relearned how to respond to regular intake again. It took a few weeks but now I'm pretty much back on track (7 months into recovery) &amp; can eat without any pain.  I also experienced night sweats. I've found this could be related to the metabolism ramping up to heal internal damage &amp; thus your body burns more because it's using that food for the energy to work harder healing your body. When you work hard, you sweat. Your body is always working whether you feel that or not &amp; sometimes it's working harder than other times.  I hope that helped in any way. Again, not a professional, just going off my own experience. Wishing you luck!",False,False
