For example, when I’m restricting heavily at a healthy weight, I feel absolutely awful, but when I’m restricting heavily while a low weight, I feel OK (not good, but not like I’m about to drop dead).   I think it’s because being at a higher weight comes with higher energy demands. Your heart rate is generally higher, it takes more energy to keep your body alive, if you’re eating more you’re probably more active etc., so if you’re not QUITE eating enough, it has more of a significant impact on your everyday functioning. When you have a very low weight, your BMR will be lower and so I guess you wouldn’t feel the impact of restricting so much because your body doesn’t require as many calories.   That’s just a theory, though! I also think as you become more mentally healthy (idk if you are in recovery), you notice feeling ill more because you actually want to do more with your day. When you’re feeling mentally terrible, it kinda feels fine to lie in bed tired all day because you don’t want to do much else. In recovery, you might be motivated to take up hobbies and be a bit more active and I guess you can then feel the symptoms of what you’ve been doing a bit more and they start getting in the way.  Just because you’re a healthy weight (or closer to) doesn’t mean that you have a healthy body. Restriction does a lot of damage, it takes a lot of time to reverse.",False,False
