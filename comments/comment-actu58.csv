That’s awesome.    But everything else.... is such a mood. I felt the same way when I was in PHP and that resulted in me immediately falling back into old habits when I entered IOP and getting prematurely discharged for not getting better. Part of me likes being brain fogged and focusing solely on my ed but another part of me hates it because it’s so time consuming, I don’t have much energy for work, to socialize, or even accomplish my other goals. When I try to do it all, something usually suffers which fuels my ed even further.    You know this already but EDs are nasty lying bitches that make you believe that when you were in the thick of it, you were the best you ever were. But trust me, it’s not true. ~~now only if I could believe that LOL~~",False,False
