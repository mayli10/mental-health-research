Then I took my preworkout and hit the gym, drinking a protein shake throughout my workout. After I got to work and finished my morning coffee, I took another Bronkaid and another Hydroxycut. I'd eat lunch about two hours later. Then I'd take my last Bronkaid and Hydroxycut before I left work. I was usually fast asleep by 8pm on 1080 mg of caffeine per day.  I've slowed down from this due to health concerns.",False,False

Like other people said, that advice is for bodybuilder types in mind. Don't worry about any ""plans"" out there, just find what works for you. Personally I am very cautious with EC stack. Every other day, I take one half dose (100mg caffeine, 12.5mg ephedrine which is half a bronkaid pill). Rarely, if I need a lot of energy, I'll take two half doses (200mg caffeine, 25mg ephedrine total). I also try to never do EC stack two days in a row. I find that the half dose wears off for me in around 8 hours. I'd say, start with very small doses, give your body time to flush it out, figure out how your body processes everything, and only then gradually increase dose and frequency as necessary.   People don't mention this a lot but on the bronkaid package it says that you are not supposed to consume bronkaid with caffeine. Safe as people say it is, EC stacking is not medically thoroughly tested and might have health risks. I've read that it can strain your heart (which is why some people speak of ECA stack, basically also taking aspirin to prevent this). So please, be careful. For me, EC stack is the best way for me to cope with my eating disorder without restricting so much I damage my health / purging, but if I didn't have to do it I wouldn't. Wish you the best!
