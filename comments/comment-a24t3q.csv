You are LOVELY and WORTHY enough to have happiness, peace, and love in your life, regardless of whether he, or anyone else, thinks you’re “thin enough” or that there’s enough “chemistry” to use you as an object for his sexual gratification. You did the right thing for YOU, believe me. I know it doesn’t feel like you did something great because he made it all about him and tried to make you feel shitty for rejecting him, but that feeling will come in time. The self love you practiced yesterday by walking away from a toxic situation will show itself in the future. Still so fcking proud of you bb&lt;3 you’re a bad ass, inspiring mf n i luv u💛",False,False

He responded with ""I agree. I dont feel any chemistry with you."" 😂😂😂 brb getting offended because I'm apparently not thin enough for fuckbois to be attracted to anymore ",False,True

Knowing how strong you are makes me feel like I can be strong too. Sending you hugs and lots of love&lt;333",False,False

I read your comment and then texted this guy I've been seeing casually (two weeks ago during a hookup he started making comments about my ~tummy~ and my weight) and told him I didnt want to hook up with him anymore. This feels like a huge step. I hope I can get to where you are in time.",False,True

And I know it’s so much easier said than done. Trust me, I am KWEEN of self-hate fueled hook ups haha. And just in general, letting fuck bois make me feel worthless and putting up with abusive behaviors. I have to work on loving myself everyday, and I still make a lot of mistakes.  But at some point, you’ll get sick of the same shit from the same shitty people and put your foot down. And I think when we are both able to truly love ourselves and therefore unconditionally love other people, we will attract the same kind of people who will treat us with the kindness and respect that we put out into the world and deserve back. Anyways, don’t give up. I know it sucks butt especially when you’re at your lowest, but you’re stronger than you think and you WILL get there one day♥️",False,False

Really proud of you for taking that leap! It's so, so hard to love yourself when it feels like no one else does, even if it's just a cheap imitation love from a stranger. I think I'm getting closer to prioritizing myself.",False,True

It feels rewarding to feel thin and know that someone feels attractive, and simultaneously triggering and destructive AF. Which is like the perfect combo to relapse into oblivion- but only as long as the dude is willing to put up with my bs hahah. Hence why I’ve cut out all casual sex, dating, and even flirting when I decided to commit to prioritizing my health and recovering. I hope you will eventually be able to do the same because you deserve REAL love and compassion, not just from a significant other, but from yourself. I’m always here if you need someone to talk to bb&lt;3 Sending you love and positive vibes💛",False,False
