I want men to want me. But I always feel like noone could ever want me. Men aren't looking at me or approaching me. When I'm somewhere with a female friend, men are always flirting with them, but never with me. And I know that I am not the prettiest but it bothers the hell out of me that no matter what I do, men won't ever admire me.",False,True

Also any men in my family who comments on my body, I HATE it. Does someone else feel like this too?",False,False

Honestly having a perceivable physical presence disturbs me.   Unless the comments are about things I can control like ""Hey nice eyeliner/eyeshadow"" or ""I like your shirt."" I would just prefer to blend into the background most of the time.",False,False
