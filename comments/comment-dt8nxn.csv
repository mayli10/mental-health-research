If it doesnâ€™t, see a dr for sure - continuing to exercise on what could be a fracture will only cause further damage.  People with EDs, esp. women, are at a higher risk of fractures, generally speaking, so be careful and take care of yourself as much as you can!",False,False

Does it feel like a burning/tingling pain?  It could be a number of things, and a visit to your doctor is your best bet - if youâ€™re feeling it in your foot or shin, stress fractures are a possibility. If itâ€™s more of a burning down from your hip, it could be nerve pain.  Too many variables to diagnose over the Internet, definitely visit your GP or a PT if you have easier access.",False,False
