It is defatted and powdered peanuts. Not like pb2 really since that has lots of sugar that adds to calories. Peanut flour is just defatted and powdered peanuts. Add it to smoothies, yogurt (good alone or paired with apples) stir fry sauce, homemade granola bars, almost anything you would add peanut butter to, except instead of 190 cal for 2tbsp, it is 55 calories for 2 tbsp.     Pro tip, if you get caramel apple flavored light and fit yogurt cup (80 cal) and add 1 tbsp of peanut flour (28 cal) it deadass tastes like a snickers blizzard.",False,False
