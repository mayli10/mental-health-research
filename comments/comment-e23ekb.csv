Since I have a degree in nutrition and I'm studying for the national exam to become a dietitian, I thought I'd chime in here.   I don't mean to invalidate anyone's legitimate health concerns coming from their eating disorder. Yes, it is absolutely possible to suffer the effects of malnutrition at any weight. Vitamin and mineral deficiencies (including electrolyte imbalances) can occur in anyone regardless of BMI or body fat percentage. Yes, those with eating disorders at any size may suffer severe mental and emotional torment.  However, the severity scale for anorexia had and still has valid reasoning in terms of necessary level of treatment. Extremely low BMIs generally indicate *both* a dramatic loss of body fat and muscle tissue.    These people are far more likely to be at risk for:  -low bone density and osteoporosis -major organ failure including possibly permanent infertility; a slowed heart rate and possible death from a weakened heart (loss of muscle can include cardiac muscle), more likely to suffer GI damage since the stomach is made up of muscle as well -brain damage  Medical professionals pay special attention to eating disorder sufferers with very low body weight  because the focus is on getting the patient medically stabilized before beginning treatment. Regarding brain damage- as cognition becomes more impaired, the more difficult it is for the patient to engage in therapy, regulate emotions, and have the ability  to work out the root causes of the disorder. Black and white ""all or nothing"" thinking tends to get worse, too.   You DO NOT want to reach this point. The rate of successfully reaching a full recovery is unfortunately lower than those who begin treatment at a healthy weight range, overweight, or obese.",False,False

I know that term is legit used in medical literature but any medical with half a brain knows being underweight at any point is dangerous, never mind the plethora of physical and mental symptoms that affect before at ANY FUCKING WEIGHT.
