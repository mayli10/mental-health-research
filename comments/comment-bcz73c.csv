I also have an undiagnosed GI issue which is probably the same one my mother has, I'm allergic to dust and grass, my shoulders are fucked and idk what's wrong with them, I had a soft spot on the back of my head until I was 19, I have a hole in one of my eardrums and scarring on the other which causes really bad tinnitus (*both a result of a surgery I needed as a baby*), and I had to have both my tonsils and my adenoids removed at a young age so I could eat without choking which now causes issues with food getting stuck in uncomfortable places and major coughing when I breathe in even the tiniest bit of anything. I also get migraines all the time which is either because of my ED, because my wisdom teeth are all impacted, or because of something else I don't even know about.
