I really hope I'm not hurting anyone. If y'all think like stuff like that may be triggering I'll probably take those posts down. I don't wanna hurt anyone. I just kinda use TikTok to vent. I don't try and trigger people and stuff.. idk I'm sorry if I've hurt anyone with my content. Maybe I should take it down.,False,False

At first it was nice to see others out there but, it’s almost become trendy again.   Last week I found a ‘weight loss’ account which featured a girl eating 40% of her bmr. She wanted to start weight loss group chats and stuff of the like.   Plus I hate the normalization of comments of people videos talking about how they’re going to stop eating to look like other people, I mean for some younger people that might just make them think that’s the reality into what goes into a desirable body.",False,False
