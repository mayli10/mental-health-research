Although I don't necessarily agree with 100% of what she tells me, overall I'm very happy with her. She's an ED specialist and she has good intuition for how to get through to my anorexic mind. My therapist found her; she's very knowledgeable about EDs herself, and she pre-screened some RDs before referring me, which I think made a big difference.  Possibly the most helpful aspect of having an RD, for me, is that she's a strong leader and bridge between my physical and psychological treatment. She's a lot more knowledgeable about my disorder than most doctors and she's able and willing to advocate for me in ways that would be overwhelming for me to try to do myself. I'm getting much better medical care than I would without her, and she diligently keeps my therapist in the loop with all that stuff as well.",False,False

I was more forward with IOP RD since he has a lot of experiences working with athletes and actually listened to me when I said I truly love running and I don't exercise to burn off calories (most of the time I have no idea how much I burn). &amp; I was very upfront with him that running pushed me into recovery because I was scared of osteoporosis and stress fracture. The school RD, on the other hand, straight up told me I'm exercise bulimic in our first consultation because I spent 2 hours at the gym 3 days a week -\_ - and tried to get me to stop exercise (never gonna because what's the fucking point if I can't run).  &amp;#x200B;  Each gave me a meal plan to follow. My school RD is a bit weird because she pushed me to stop eating desserts. I feel like most ED patients in early stage of recovery shouldn't forbid themselves from a certain food group but whatever, I eat what I want. My IOP RD asked for my running goal and training plan and came up with a meal plan that would cover everything I need to maintain and get my period back. I still haven't got the said meal plan so I don't know how much I can follow. He truly tries to work with me where I am and pushes me to do something out of comfort zone, which is good but sometimes I get rebellious and back at square one -\_-.   Honestly, I feel like meal plan in general is super disordered. On the day that I truly want to feel normal, I don't even look at it and just eat whatever I want and stop when I feel full. That might not work if your hunger cues and signals are messed up. Meal plan can help you establish that, I think.",False,False

After being in recovery several years I was starting to slip into old patterns so I looked this lady up and thought I‚Äôd give her a try. She basically put ideas into my head that I was anorexic, my body was starving and that‚Äôs why I was depressed (I am not underweight, not intentionally restricting, and at the time was not binging or purging). She gave me a ginormous meal plan intended to increase my weight then treated me like shit when I couldn‚Äôt follow it. I couldn‚Äôt figure out the exchange system and the book she gave me was legit from 1985 with super outdated nutrition information and talking about food/restaurant brands that don‚Äôt exist anymore.

I saw my first dietitian as an outpatient. There were so many red flags, but I didn't know any better. She treated me like an idiot or a child, she refused to consider any input I offered regardless of what it was, and she was entirely too controlling in regards to what I ate, even for a dietitian. The meal plan she gave me was very, very specific. This is not normal. Most decent dietitians will construct meal plans with some sort of exchange-based system so you retain at least \*some\* freedom to choose. She did not. I was allowed to eat from a list of very specific foods only.  Later, I relapsed (no thanks to her ineffective treatment) and was admitted to an inpatient treatment facility. The dietitian I was assigned there was excellent. She listened to all my input and when she disagreed, offered her insight in a very respectful, professional way. I worked my ass off to prove I could be trusted, and she trusted me enthusiastically in turn. I made a lot of progress with her.  Unfortunately, that dietitian was reassigned to a different treatment center and I got a new one who was frustratingly similar to the one I'd seen outpatient over a year before. She was utterly incapable of considering me as anything other than a sick, pathetic little child. I was no longer trusted and my insights were dismissed as disordered, regardless of all my hard work. I did go backwards during this time.  Now, I've been discharged to outpatient. I've only been seeing my current dietitian for a couple weeks, so it's too early to tell, but experience has taught me the warning signs. I hope this was helpful, sorry it got so long!

I need to work more mentally on recovery but I have some tools and a general meal plan - I just haven‚Äôt followed it because I‚Äôve been in a mental black hole and binge eating.   I also found going to an ED specialist RD helpful because she really used sensitive language and was very considerate and kind and would ask permission to weigh me etc and really make me feel comfortable with that, and gave me the option of whether I wanted a blind weigh or not.

I'm argumentative, don't like authority, and think I know everything about eating disorders and nutrition.  I also think that dietitians are often disordered and that dietitians that focus on eating disorders feed you way too much (more along the fat acceptance, who cares if you become overweight, sort of mindset).
