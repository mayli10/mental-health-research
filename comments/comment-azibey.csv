I wasn't trying to imply that she didn't actually have BED, but Trisha does play a certain troll type character in a lot of her videos that makes me hesitant to believe her when she makes drastic claims about her food intake or diets. It's clear she's struggling, but I wasn't sure OP was aware that Trisha isn't always serious. Sorry for the confusion! ",False,False

I still don‚Äôt get how she exposed David, she just expressed he‚Äôs kind of insane, which is obvious to most. She exposed Brandon like a mother fucker. I also feel if she had a problem with him dating an underage girl, there are ways to submit a complaint to authorities. Not make a video and post it online. That does not actually resolve the issue. And talking shit about Jason‚Äôs ex was not necessary. They have to split custody, and with Trisha‚Äôs reputation online, I can see his ex having major reservations about her. She has to think about her young, impressionable children. I personally think Trisha can do whatever she wants online, but life‚Äôs different when you have kids.    But he literally was so shitty about ‚Äúbeing healthy‚Äù, and I absolutely pray he doesn‚Äôt say shit like that to his daughter. I think that‚Äôs what really got me. Trisha is a strong woman, but his daughter looks up to him. Even seeing him talk to Trisha like that could have an impact on his daughter. I‚Äôm probably reading to far into it, but hearing my dad talk about what women ate and weights has definitely had an impact on me. ",False,False

He shames her and then eats uncontrollably when the cameras are put away. I‚Äôm happy she calls his ass out for bullshitting the camera. Don‚Äôt blame her for your lack of control!

I feel bad for her, I wish she would stick to a healthy diet and exercise plan - but that's so pot calling the kettle black because I don't follow that advice at all lol.  it's fascinating watching her life but sometimes i do worry that she's bitten off more than she can chew, she makes clickbaity videos and then loses views so she needs to do something bigger and better and crazier. that can't be good for anyone, even if it's an act. if she keeps it up she won't be able to tell who real Trisha is from her character.
