After maintaining for a long time at a ""safe"" weight (which actually became me obsession as opposed to losing), I lost a few pounds.  I was disappointed I'd not stuck to my maintenance weight, but also liked it in the sick way you do.  I actually upped calories for a couple of weeks to gain those pounds that I'd lost.  That would've been unthinkable at one point.  I was all over the place emotionally and it messed up my usual routine.  &amp;#x200B;  TW numbers...  &amp;#x200B;  I prefer to be bang on either xstone or xstone 7lbs.  If I go under that it's a trigger to get to the lower weight because losing 7lbs was a celebration thing when I hit that weight in the first few years.  I'd be fine to be xstone 7lbs right now, that's an extra 7lbs than I am.  Maybe work on it, idk.",False,False
