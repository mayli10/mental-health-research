I can't sit on the couch without 2 blankets or I'm PAINFULLY numb. The only time I feel normal is when I'm at the gym (which they keep at a constant 80 degrees) and when I'm taking a really hot shower. It's fucking awful. It was very warm and sunny today and I was still wearing a thermal undershirt, sweater and leggings under my jeans today while everyone else was out in tank tops and shorts, and I was still. freezing. I'm at a normal weight, and am still freezing all the time. When I was obese I was always sweating but this is so so so much worse.",False,False
