On the other hand when I lay low on the bread I have fewer BM... but at least they don‚Äôt smell.  It seems to be a pick your poison kind of situation for me. ,False,False

Poopourri. Get some. Put toilet paper in the toilet BEFORE¬† for sound purposes (and bc¬†no one like Poseiden's kiss ;) Now. Since it seems you get to be a tad choosy about it..

I'm dying to do a 14 day fast after Christmas because I've never been this fat before and I can't cope. But CTs of my abdomen were done and even though I was pooping every day I'm so severely constipated that I'm packed with poo literally from rectum to colon - partially thanks to going keto.  GP says I've probably got almost 10 lbs of crap backed up. So now I'm on movicol for a month and I hate it. I just want to starve myself and drop weight, but my dietician told me to drink 3 frigging litres of water a day, and I'm not supposed to fast because that will stop peristalsis.   I've never felt so bloated and disgusting and it's not moving much at all.",False,False

As for other ‚Äúissues‚Äù, I‚Äôve been borderline shitting myself for the past two days even after drinking like half a bottle of pepto.
