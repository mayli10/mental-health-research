But that‚Äôs the stupidest thing I‚Äôve ever heard. If you don‚Äôt want children, then just stick with continuous birth control. You don‚Äôt realize how much hormones affect the body, not just the reproductive system. If your periods are painful, then talk to your gynecologist about changing the type of birth control. I cant take estrogen because of my endometriosis, so I get the injection (getting the implant next year).   Neglecting your body to make yourself infertile is like cutting off your foot because you keep stubbing your toe. Totally unnecessary. When you lose your period, it can cause a lot of other effects. The hormones affected can cause increased cholesterol, osteoporosis, hair loss, and brain problems. It‚Äôs not a simple thing.  I‚Äôm stressing this because like the other person said, I have endometriosis which already has a risk of making me infertile. I don‚Äôt want kids for years, maybe even ever.
