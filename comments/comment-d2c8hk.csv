The last time I was refeeding while underweight was many years ago, so my memory is pretty fuzzy!

After that is over... a fair share of weight restored anorexics who had severe BMIs, DO  in fact have lower metabolisms than age/sex/weight matched controls. But that was found to be due to most of the weight anorexics put back on during refeeding is fat despite losing both fat and muscle after they kept losing weight once they became underweight.  Since a pound of muscle contributes more calories to BMR than a pound of fat does, metabolism is lower. If anorexics being weight restored in hospitals got normal amounts of exercise this likely wouldn‚Äôt be the result of the studies ‚Äîbut that would slow down the weight gain process.   either way, follow ups have shown that for adults this restoration in muscle mass and regular BMR corrects itself (iirc) in months/a year? I‚Äôm sure it depends on nutrition/exercise.",False,False

Water weight, food weight, and the way your body reacts to suddenly having more food is exactly what this sounds like.   I‚Äôve been through the same thing and panicked, it‚Äôs totally understandable to get upset about. You absolutely are not gaining real weight. This is simply your body fluctuating. Similarly, when you begin to exercise, your body will store water weight because of the mechanics of muscle growth (or something to that effect, I‚Äôm sorry I can‚Äôt remember the exact terms). Short point is, bodies do all kinds of processes and fluctuations and changes in weight while still eating at a deficit are not indicative of real weight gain. üíï",False,False

I'm pretty sure the exact opposite happens, actually. Anorexics tend to need more calories while refeeding than expected, and often have a hypermetabolic period after where they have to eat more than one would expect just to maintain.   &gt; If this continues, I will be weight restored within a couple weeks!  Personally, I found gaining weight really hard, especially in outpatient. It's just not that fun to eat 3000-4000 calories a day.
