After a binge day, or just weight gain in general, I don't wanna show face at all whatsoever. It's so embarrassing and it isn't like anyone else is gonna notice that I had all 10 crab rangoons alone yesterday, but it's irrational of course.",False,False

I had a horrible b/p relapse the weekend before which led to me binging and purging for the beginning of last week and let me tell you, my face was a disaster. I had like 5 huge pimples around my mouth and a giant one on my jaw and my whole face just was a mess. I bought myself some bigger pants for work and guess who could barely fit them. Ughhhh but I just powered through it, I avoided looking at mirrors and just tried to focus on getting control again. I still probably look a mess but I have a little more control and im gonna keep avoiding mirrors for the time being lol. I’m sorry you’re going through this too. It will get better!! Just give it some time.",False,False
