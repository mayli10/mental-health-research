Started with diet/ keto to lose weight but starting sinking into obsession. I’m glad you’re getting help and I understand the shame and guilt that comes with EDs. Your boss sounds like a genuinely good person and I’m glad you’re working for someone as understanding and empathetic as he is. I hope you continue to receive help and get better, even if it’s only a little. I wish you the best of luck OP ",False,False

It sounds like you're close in age to his daughter- his concern definitely seems practiced and caring in a, not exactly paternal, but a father-who-cares-about-a-younger-person way. As though his daughter's experiences have given him more insight, especially towards people who remind him of her.  I really hope your psychologist/psychiatrist experience goes well! I don't know how long you've been dealing with ED stuff, but it's been a long time for me. Most of my life, and we're very close to the same age/height/weight, so I can't help but root for you extra hard. You can beat this OP, it'll take a lot of work but you have support. This community is with you, your boss is with you, and most importantly **you** are with you. ",False,False

Dont stress about your age - I just turned 34 and my ed is pretty much the only focus of my life. Ed's do not discriminate whether you're 13 or 60. As you mentioned, it is a life long battle and I truly believe that once you've developed an unhealthy relationship with food it never truly goes away. We just learn to manage it better.

I realize now that he's been looking out for my best interests under the radar.   Tbh, I thought I would get mean comments telling me to call HR or something. That a boss can't tell a female superior to stop losing weight.  That's why I was so stunned by the whole interaction. He immediately redeemed all of his credibility when he very gently said he's concerned and wants me to be OK. It was uplifting and I felt very validated",False,True

I'm glad he reached out to you, kind of like an awkward guardian angel lol. The good part is, if you need time off to recover or go to appointments, he should be more than understanding in helping you with that. :) Instead of being disappointed, try thinking of it as a sign that it's time to get help and the universe is rooting for you.",False,False

I agree that I felt really supported by him when I realized he wasn't being judgmental, just concerned. It's very different because I kept telling myself I'm not sick. It's hard to feel sick when everyone is giving you compliments!   Obviously, being 30, living on my own for the first time, and trying to ""have it all together"" really got in my head and prevented me from understanding that I'm headed down a slippery slope.

If you're not ready to confront all of your dr.'s yet it's ok! Keep working up to it, you'll get there.   Your boss seems genuinely interested in your well-being and supporting your journey to get help. That's so nice! You are lucky. I'm sure knowing that alleviates some of the pressure that you thought before of him being more judge-y.  BTW I am also 30 and although it sucks that we're both in this situation, its a little comforting to see someone in this group who is the same age as me, having the same struggles. Good luck!!

We can get so wrapped up in our self hate that the idea of someone truly having concern for us just...does not compute. Someone caring about us feels like the idea of 2+2=7.   But look on the bright side; this person has experience in this issue and cares. And what's more, they're your boss. It can be hard to reveal mental health issues to your boss for fear of back lash. When I first started trying to get hell, my first boss went off the deep and and likely broke a few laws with the things she said and the threats she made. But I left that job and found a loving workplace that supported me and was there for me in my mental health journey.   Don't be too hard on yourself about it. Just try and accept that someone near you cares for you, and doesn't want to see you in pain. Good luck :)",False,False
