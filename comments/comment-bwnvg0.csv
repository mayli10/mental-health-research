I mean we were young so it's not implausible that she could just make herself do it even if she was severely underweight and not eating. Because you go pro quite young (17/18) and she quit somewhere before or after 20...,False,False

Our recital happened right before I went IP, so I was underweight. I remember wondering if anyone would notice (spoiler: literally everyone knew something was wrong with me lol).   I’m sad for this girl too. Thank you for sharing",False,False

I started dance at age 3 and quit at 19 for my health. It's so deeply ingrained in the lifestyle to be very very thin, hell I had instructors who weren't shy at all about telling people to stop eating.

There was a girl I knew from dance who was obscenely talented, but her eating disorder was so obvious and bad. I had problems with eating, as did many of my peers, but I would see this girl eating a slice of watermelon before dinner and doing full body workouts before shows. She went pro for a while and got thinner and thinner and eventually quit really early in her career.  It really sucks. Especially when your disorder is actively encouraged by your career.",False,False
