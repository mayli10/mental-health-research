The only thing I can say is when it hits hard, I feel I have more to lose and feel more hopeless. However, honestly I am never satisfied so I would probably feel the same even if I wasn't recovered. Right now I weigh 110 and it sucks to look at last year when I was 103 and trying to lose.   Buuuut I think I actually enjoyed some of my life last year.QA",False,False

So even if I'm not 100%, it's better here than there.",False,False

In both scenarios I had completely changed my life and therefore was removed from reminders and rituals associated with my ED. ED thoughts mostly went away both times.  One ended because of a shit head boyfriend and another ended because I ended up coming back home. I think it’s possible but would just require a complete reformulation of life without the ability to “go back” and removing a lot of triggers. I think there’s no way to remove the muscle memory of disordered eating but there’s ways to make it...less powerful? Like you never forget how to ride a bike but if you never go near bikes you’ll never have to think about it if that makes sense, you’ll never forget disordered habits but if you get rid of triggers you won’t have to remember them",False,False

It's worth it. The thoughts might never really go away, but they can dull and get further in between. Like feeling the loss of a loved one. Sometimes it comes back full force, but those times of recovery are worth it.",False,False

I feel like it will always be part of my brain and I don't know anyone who has stayed fully recovered except one guy.  I went to an inpatient treatment center, PHP, and a full year of therapy back in 2016 for anorexia but then I later relapsed into anorexia, then into bulimia, and then now back again. Lol. I think part of that is because it was not my choice to recover the first time.",False,False
