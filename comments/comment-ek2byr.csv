If anyone's going to notice dramatic weight loss or disordered food habits you'd think it would be an SO.,False,False

Still loved at home with parent the first time round and teenage me was rather creative in coming up with ways to make it look like I'd eaten.  Now that I live with SO I can't tell if I'm hiding it well due to 'experience' or people are just oblivious as fuck.  EDIT: lived,False,False

It's nice that you found a system that works for you! I usually do something similar, where our dinner together after work is basically OMAD for me. But the problem is that I work a physical job where I take care of kids and am on my feet quite frequently, so I've been finding it kind of hard to not eat earlier in the day. I just get so tired and nauseous and it's really unfair to the toddlers that I'm taking care of. Ugh. If I lived alone, I'd probably eat all my calories early in the day as to have enough energy to work and then eat a tiny dinner when I come home and then nothing, but because of him I kind of have to eat dinner anyways. Worst (or maybe not) is that he knows about my ED so whenever I skip meals the vibe gets kind of awkward between us and it feels like he gets sad so it makes me very uncomfortable ***not*** to eat with him. I feel like I'm trapped and idk what to do in order to relieve this stress :( But thanks for your reply!",False,True

Thankfully, he has a job where he has one day off during the week and Sunday off. I however work M-F, and am off weekends. So...all day during the week..I don’t have to eat, I pretend to pack a lunch, when he is around and tell him I’ve eaten during the day if he asks, etc. and then at night, we have dinner together and he knows I’ve never been one to eat a lot of food, so doesn’t question when I only have a small portion of whatever was made. Sunday’s however are a different story. Sunday’s are the worst days for my disorder. I have to eat at every meal. Breakfast, lunch, dinner. My partner is 6”4, and he eats alllll the time. Is always hungry. So..he will sometimes get irritated if I say I don’t want lunch or something on Sunday’s. It’s hard..but doable. And if they understand, they won’t force you to eat or anything if you’re not up for it at that moment. It means I’m at least getting one meal everyday. So that is good. Good luck to you both! ❤️",False,False
