I still have no idea what I'll, I'm still only flirting with the idea of recovery.

My ED started before I went vegan so it's a tricky subject with my team, as I've definitely used it as an excuse to restrict. We've negotiated some things into my diet previously, like eggs from my own chickens.  I think the best advice was given to me by my dietitian- you can't help anyone else until you've taken care of yourself first. I used that to tell myself it was okay if I needed to eat non vegan products- my recovery has to come first and it was always agreed that I could go back to veganism when I was well enough.",False,False
