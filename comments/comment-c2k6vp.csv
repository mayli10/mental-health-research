My dentist is my dadâ€™s sister (aunt) and she doesnâ€™t have kids so she claims me and my sister as her kids so we get free dental care. My sister regularly goes to appointments, have had few cavities in her whole life time and all around my aunt just gets along with her better. On the other hand I rarely schedule check ups and usually she calls me and forces me too. Iâ€™m so scared to go since I was purging for most of this year but at the same time I want to get them fixed so bad. Hang in there ðŸ’“ someday both of us will have decent smiles",False,False
