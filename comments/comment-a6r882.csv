I'd pass the time by playing board games and cards with everyone! And reading. And playing with my cats.  3.

I think I'd probably hang some maps and floral tapestries on the walls. I'm a sucker for all things floral, and I love looking at the world.

It makes me feel like a witch, even though I'm not wiccan or anyone else who practices witchcraft. Having a hand-bound zombie apocalypse survival journal? God, I want one.   3. Oh goodness, I drink literally every tea known to humankind. Always plain, no sugar, piping hot. Despite sweetened ice tea being popular where I live (US South), I'm not a big fan of it. I keep dozens of them organized in my cabinet. For the plantain, I find it everywhere in the US, the closer to the Mexican border than I am. Further north, it's more of a struggle to locate it. Here, it's pretty much found in Latino, West African, and Caribbean communities. A West African street food involves cutting it into cubes and frying it. It's salty sweet carby goodness. I usually cut it into slices or strips and grill it. Just as tasty, just not drenched in oil bc forget that noise. ",False,False

(this year i sliced my hand open bad enough i should have went and got stitches but instead i glued it shut and everything went fine!) i also used to know how to make a rabbit snare, and some other traps. i think i could figure that out again.  of course all these skills are only useful if the zombie thing happens while im in my home area. if im down at school im fucked like im noping out of being alive real fast then. 3. dried foods!!! rice, lentils, teas, trail mixes, jerky. vitamin c gummies because idk what we have for natural providers of that. id stock up on seeds for a garden once i found a place to hunker down. protien powder. vodka (for wound cleaning and getting drunk!)",False,False

It would be located somewhere underground so it's hidden away from the zombies and everyone else. Would probably have me and a couple close friends in there with me, any more people and it would be crowded. In terms of decorating i would probably just put maybe a rug down and hang a few things on the wall. Not really fussed about how it looks tbh.  2. Currently unemployed so nothing in my career would help me survive but i love to play video games so maybe that would give me an advantage at problem solving/decision making. As i just said, i love to play video games so most of the time i would probably just do that. Maybe some card games.  3. I only eat like 12-13 foods anyway so this is an easy one.

Idek if they’re doomsday preppers or what but it sure seems like it. I never really bother with decorations. As long as I have a comfy bed with tons of blankets and pillows I’m good.  2. I’m a nursing student so if anyone gets sick or injured my knowledge and skills will definitely come in handy. On my downtime, I’d be knitting everyone socks and hats lol  3. The top 10 foods I’d want to have during the apocalypse are: Soylent, beans, indomie ramen (my all time fav instant noodles), tea, chocolate vita-soy milk, chocolate almond fudge clif bars, rice, oatmeal, powdered peanut butter, and vitamins (not food but I’d say it’s a must have).

Ok, as for a bunker, I live in the city, but like 5 minutes for the middle of fucking nowhere. So I'd find one of the places thats sure to be vacated thats pretty far out in the sticks. I'd definitly need to knock a few walls down and build some skate ramps so I never have to go outside. Definitly needs an area my sister can work on her crafting in and we all do archery, so we need an indoor range to practice (cause kill zombies)   As far as skills to practice, I work on cars a lot, so maybe a seperate secure location thats halfway between town and my bunker I can work on passing through folks cars in.

Also, I like to draw but am not very good at it so I could use the time to improve my skills. Maybe learn another language and probably exercise and practice self defense just in case I need to fight. I am a CNA, studying to become a nurse so I could definitely help in the health aspect.  3) 10 staple foods is a hard choice. I love fruits and veggies so I'd have to at least have a couple of those.

The inner sanctum would be decorated to be very cozy with white furniture and colourful decorations to make it feel like home. Probably mostly pink stuff. Lots of soft things. 2. I'm a game programmer so I would probably just work on creative outlets or apply my skills to something more practical like designing new security systems or creating an AI that can control the facility for me in order to reduce the amount of work I would need to put into maintenance. 3.

It would be decorated in a traditional log cabin style, very r/cosyplaces with fairy lights, cosy places to sit and I could have a fireplace as I'd be in the perfect place. There would be windows facing out to sea as I doubt Zombies can swim.  I'd have my mum with me, my best friend Charlie and his mum, and also my friends Sara and Rachel.   2) I'm *made* for the bunker life. I read, write, crochet, knit, cook (obviously), sew, embroider, draw and paint. I used to be a police officer so I'd be pretty confident in going out to chop firewood.   3) 10 foods - apples Oats Soya milk  Broccoli Bananas Carrots Tinned mixed pulses Tinned tomatoes Marmite (fight me) Mixed nuts  Boom I could make all sorts of amazing safe foods and not end up malnourished.

Plus, there's an underground tunnel that escapes to other buildings. I live in the south,  I would just hope to mooch off all the preppers! But my office has a ton of books so that's cool.   2) Maybe I would actually finish my dissertation :(  3) Soooo much skinny pop. 1) Skinny pop 2) String cheese 3) kodiak cake muffins 4) peanut butter protein bars 5) peanut butter 6) halos 7) MOTAHFUCKIN GOLDFISH 8) Bananas 9) Toast 10) Oatmeal   &amp;#x200B;  Writing this out made me realize I already eat like I'm living off staple apocalypse foods.

So we have a family farm in upstate NH in the woods with no one around (old school family, hella guns even cannons etc and hundreds of acres of land) so we've already decided that the location of our hideout. My immediate family and closest friends would come. Very lucky to know so many veterans/cops/military people so I'm safe from the zombies lmaoooo.  2. I'd probably go insane with boredom and would spend the times learning to knit with my grandparents. I was pre med so I'd probably be the medic? Can there still be internet in the apocalypse pls? 3. \-vegetarian refried beans -couscous -potatoes -soylent (idk long shelf life lots of nutrition) -pasta -broccoli -tomatoes -cucumbers -spinach -raspberries",False,False

I brought vegan hot chocolate and a couple of big fuzzy blankets, and I have plenty of both to share, if anyone is interested! ((((:  In answer to the questions:  1. My spouse and my family/friends would be the first protected. My spouse is a survivalist fan so i would seek him out on that alone. His current favorite idea for a hideout is in a salt cave with plenty of ventilation, since you have the salt, the dryness, the safety and the durability.   2. I would pass the time with telling stories, reading books, and caring for our group. I love to cook and clean, so I’d make for a decent den mother I hope 😊😊  3. ten staple foods: a variety of dried fruits, veggies and legumes/nuts. ",False,False

Hmm I would hunker down in a shopping mall. It has everything you need from a food court to a wide variety of bathrooms (😉). I would lock and block the main doors to the mall and clean out the undead. I would have my family with me. They have experience in firearms... 2. Oh I’d love it. I would walk through the food court and various other food store and have the binge of my dreams... I’d have my pick of multiple bathrooms to purge in. I am a nurse so I would be able to provide first aid and medical expertise in case of an emergency.  3. Oh wow 10 staple foods... hmm I’d say egg whites, spinach, quest bars, almond milk, meat lovers pizza, tortellini pasta with marinara, garlic bread, French fries, cookies and ice cream.

I'd definitely want lots of locks/walls/barriers to enter my bunker, bring my family + close friends with me. Not 100% on how it would look, honestly. I'm pretty indecisive when it comes to decorating. Maybe a cozy aesthetic so I could pretend there weren't dangerous zombies lurking outside 2. Probably pass the time on the internet (social interaction?)/watching movies/reading books/playing games and hanging with the people in the bunker. Not sure I have too many marketable skills in a zombie apocalypse- I'm a bit squeamish. But I am a runner so if a zombie got into the bunker I might be able to evade it. 3. Foods- this is tricky!    1.  Fage greek yogurt for protein    2. air popped popcorn &lt;3 my love    3. almond butter, healthy fats and tastes like a dessert    4. baby carrots (preferably hummus too, but if I get canned chickpeas I could probably DIY it somehow)    5. spring mix/salad mix if there was a way to keep it fresh (preferably a mix with romaine and carrots)    6. canned soups    7. canned beans    8. almond milk (they make it shelf stable so yay)    9. multivitamins- not really food, but if there's not a lot of variety in my diet I don't want vitamin deficiencies    10. salsa or something to 'dress' my greens with. maybe hummus bc that would go with my carrots AND greens",False,False

Mind if I join?  &amp;#x200B;  1. Ironically, the safest place in a zombie apocalypse is my treatment center. There are literally hundreds of layers of locks those zombies would have to get through in order to even get close to us. But realistically I'd stay the FUCK away from that place. I'd rather just take my car and live in that as I drive from city to city building a badass apocalypse crew or whatever. 2. I'm fucking awesome at hide-and-seek, so maybe that could be helpful in evading zombies. I dunno. 3. FOODS! I already have this planned out. Beans for protein. Potatoes, rice, and oats for carbs. Nuts (almonds &lt;3) for fat. Broccoli, kale, and tomatoes bc I love veggies. Oranges so I don't get scurvy. Shelf-stable soy milk bc it lasts ages and I don't want osteoporosis.  But to be completely realistic, the zombie apocalypse would be my golden opportunity to restrict and exercise myself into the ground. I'd happily starve to death and be a badass zombie fighter while doing it. These were fun questions, thanks OP :)",False,False
