She's her mother, she cares for her child, so it's not up to anyone else really to decide what goes into the house. She can still buy it out of the house.

It makes sense if I look at the situation as a non-ed perspective... probably im just too sensitive",False,False

That is how my mom helped me to have an eating disorder. Because since I was a kid she was so strict with what I ate.,False,False
