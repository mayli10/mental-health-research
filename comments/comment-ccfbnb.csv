I thought there was a scary preservative or something that could cause gastrointestinal distress or something. I used to eat them sparingly bc my mom said she had a bad experience and blamed it on the preservative. They do smell fishy. Rubber shoelaces is the best word for them. Tbh not eating was better imo ü§£,False,False
