My therapist has pretty much said the same thing, she gave me a goal for the next to weeks that if I don't try, she's going to tell at me because she believes I'm not trying good enough. I don't know anyone else with an eating disorder, but I have a pretty good friend who I find that I'm able to talk to...to an extent.  It's really hard to think about anything other than weight, calories and food...so I have no idea how I'll ever remove myself from this mindset, but I also don't really want to leave this mindset because I'm scared that my weight would just spiral out of control (extreme weight gain etc).   You can dm if you ever want someone to talk to, but I wouldn't want to trigger you or anything. I'm always afraid that by talking about my ""eating disorder"", I'll trigger someone.",False,False
