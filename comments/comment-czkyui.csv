We would be at the grocery store and he would change the items I was putting in the cart as I put them in. I know it was coming from a loving place where he just wants me to live a long time with him, but I had to tell him REAL quick that he can verbally tell me what he thinks but I am the only one who gets final say of what goes in my body, and if I dont want him to comment that day he doesnt get to.  Since then (3 years ago?) He has been totally respectful, he doesnt say anything specific and keeps it to things like ""make healthy choices today"" which I find encouraging. He definitely has a better picture of what my life looked like before I met him / uncovering the relapse I hid while we've been together, so he gained a lot of perspective on why the things he says with good intentions are harmful.

I too grew up lower middle class- my mom was the only one with an actual job, my father ""bought/fixed/sold cars"" (AKA he spent my mother's money and hoarded cars and car parts, as well as auction purchases)  I've been slowly learning to detach myself from physical objects and the inherent need to hold onto things. It's hard! The main mental hurdle is realizing that strong emotions about items you own aren't necessarily attached to the physical object itself, but either the memories you have associated with that item or the fear of who you are without the item. It's also much harder to get past the ""sunk-cost fallacy"" when you come from a background like we did, so it's taken me longer to be able to get rid of things like clothes that no longer fit (oh hello, ED).
