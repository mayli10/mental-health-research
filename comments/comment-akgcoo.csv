Basically it's a stimulant of the part your nervous system that among other things increases your heart rate. Palpitations are another side effect so ephedrine could be the cause of your irregular heart beat as well as the faster heart rate. Either way arrhythmias and ephedrine can be a dangerous combination so I really wouldn't advise you taking it. ,False,False

In summer 2016, when I was underweight I would use it as an appetite suppressant and for energy.    I would say my heart rate was always over 100 when I was on my feet, and 80+ish when I was sitting down. It was rough going. I was only on it for 3 months and I lost a ton of weight even though I was already underweight.   When I worked out, I would get close to 180 during cardio. If you have arrhythmia, I would not recommend it. It can cause heart attacks.",False,False
