The lady is a speech therapist and is studying her own dog!     THE DOG FUCKING TALKS!    I am NOT joking. The dog has a board she can press with her paws to communicate. She makes two or three word phrases, presses ‚Äúno‚Äù and ‚Äúhelp‚Äù buttons when something is wrong with her device, can tell her mom what she wants to do first (I.e. make a sequence- *plan the future!*) and communicates the same idea in different words sometimes.    This really cool work you can see in action tells me a lot about dogs. Also, they can smell mood change, can read your facial expressions, and will want to eat and do the same things you do, even if the food/activity sucks.     I think your dog knows something is wrong, and wanted you to play both for him and so you would feel better!",False,False
