I feel so bad to have wasted something that he put so much care into.   These are the times my ‚Äúbad habit‚Äù scares me a bit.

Anyway, today my ED and anxiety made my life miserable while grocery shopping. Finally I found something that was safe. I have had dinner and am in bed. But the whole grocery trip was ""I hate these days when I feel incompetent at feeding myself."" This comment is more directed at my (lack of) cooking skill than calories (though that too). Basically my cooking success of the week was making hard boiled eggs instead of buying them. I go back and forth on this - $1.98 for six hard boiled eggs is 33 cents an egg, and by the time I buy them, cook them, and make the ice I'm not sure I'm saving any money. So I made some to prove to myself that I could. Anyone else have zero cooking knowledge?
