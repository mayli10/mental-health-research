It’s not worth it for the emotional and mental aftermath &lt;3 Anyway, when I’m in this situation, I usually take all of my calories for the week, add together, and divide by 7. That number is what I ate per day on average. Compare that to my TDEE and I can determine if I’ll lose, gain, or maintain based on the average vs my tdee. I can decide based on that if I’ll still be on track if I eat more on a certain day rather than restricting. A binge day doesn’t have to be a terrible thing weight-wise if you’re already restricting, aside from some temporary water retention from the increased salt intake.",False,False
