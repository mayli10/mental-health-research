I’ve gone through years of no real progress from restrict/binge cycles. I feel like I can gain and lose the same 15 pounds more times in a year than most people can in a decade. When I’ve slowed my roll, I definitely made more progress because I didn’t fluctuate so drastically.  But that quick weight loss really is an enticing trap. I’m definitely still restricting more than I probably should, but not as much as I want to. So I’m trying to take that as a win right now.  Of course weight loss is the goal, but maintaining weight should count as progress too. It isn’t as easy as it sounds. And keeping the weight loss slow and steady does give the best chance of sticking with it. You’ve got this!!",False,False

Ive been through a couple months of no progress because ive taken it slow. i am so tempted to just fuck it and stop eating but im gonna keep doing 100-200 cal deficit now.,False,False

I run a mile every day and then follow it with walking a mile, and that (combined with my generally busy life) consistently has me hitting my “move goal” on my Apple Watch of 350 active calories. Usually, my watch spits out ~1600 as my total calories, and that’s pretty consistent with my weight loss. ",False,True

I was losing at a rate of 2 pounds a week but to continue that I have to get to 700 calories a day and when I was doing that to get to this point I felt and looked and acted like trash. And sometimes ate from the trash.   Its encouraging me to hear that 1200 is a good number to shoot for. I have goals to recomp and I cant do that working out on my cjrrent restriction/purge lifestyle.  This comment is a mess. Thank you for this post,False,False

Sometimes my day will start out well but I'll have a big binge-like dinner (as in I keep eating until I'm full, not actual binge). From what I know about the numbers I can easily bring a 400-500 calorie count to anywhere between 1,000 and my maintenance. If I actually track the dinner calories I'll usually just get so depressed and feel like such a failure that I'll regard the day as wasted and do a REAL binge (as in ice cream, chocolate etc).  If I don't put the numbers into MFP however I can just feel satiated and not loathe myself so much which is an immense help for binge prevention.  Just my two pence. ",False,False
