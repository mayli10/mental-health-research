I went to an organization event not too long ago and they pictures/videos from that day on a slideshow.   I remember that entire day I was sooo self conscious. I didn’t even enjoy myself because I was too preoccupied with how fat I felt.   And then there was a video of a couple of people doing cartwheels and some of the shirts went up.   I remember thinking the person in the front was practically thinspo.   I felt so triggered and ashamed I didn’t look like that, until I realized the picture *was* me. My head wasn’t in the shot for most of it, but after piecing it all together I definitely felt like an idiot. But now I really understand body dysmorphia.",False,False

My weight, my BMI, my clothes size, all the numbers say I’m underweight  so that’s how I know I have dysmorphia bc I don’t think I look underweight (not even close!)  There are some other clues, catching myself on CCTV when I didn’t realise it was me, or occasionally I get a brief glimpse of reality (like when a Snapchat filter falls off for a second!) or when I can feel bones through my skin, or when people comment.  Mostly the numbers though",False,False

Also, there are some moments when the BD isn’t as bad and I can see my “true” self, but if I keep on looking I actually see myself morph into something different—it’s a very strange experience.   Re imposter syndrome: I really struggle with this as I’ve always been in highly rigorous academic programs. Again, numbers really help. If I’m receiving good marks on my exams and getting positive feedback from my professors and peers, it is easier to recognize that what I feel is probably not true.",False,False

I see size 0 jeans and SWEAR they won’t make it past my calves, but then they fit just fine. I see a size large shirt and thing it looks too small for me, then I try it on and it’s really big. I don’t understand what my body really looks like, and I’m scared it’s even more hideous than I imagine. I don’t see it the way it is according to measurements. And my boyfriend is sweet and describes it to me in the most beautiful and loving way, but of course he’d say those things because he loves me so of course he loves my body. I see everything in my body as fat, but worse than fat, I see my body as hideous without a way to fix it. I wanna throw the whole thing away and start over.",False,False
