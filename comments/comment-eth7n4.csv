And my clinicians told me that it wasn’t conducive to recovery to go to the gym.  I go on walks around my neighborhood and do outdoorsy things, and I have to repress the urge to run 5k as hard as I can. Because I had a slice of pizza and chocolate.",False,True

I was only going to go 3x a week for 30 minutes. I thought I was genuinely in control.   It took less than a week to be triggered back into compulsive exercise. I’m going every single day. I can’t stop. I’m fighting myself so I don’t start going twice a day. Returning was such a bad idea given my history.",False,False
