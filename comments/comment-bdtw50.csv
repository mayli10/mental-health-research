This was a big part of recovery for me, just being plain honest with everyone especially if it's something that makes both of us feel awkward! My treatment center was in a rented office building, me and another girl were on the elevator when a woman who worked across the hallway asked what all of us girls were doing here everyday. I straight up said ""we all have eating disorders"" with a big smile and she stopped asking questions. It was on the door and in the directory so it wasn't a secret, but I got a big ""holy fuck way to go"" from my group!!!",False,False

""Give me your tips!"" and I had this one girl who just wouldn't leave me alone about my weight loss and I wasn't really answering her questions. I had had enough and the next time she asked me how I did it, I looked at her and made direct eye contact and said ""I starved myself."" She stopped asking after that lol.
