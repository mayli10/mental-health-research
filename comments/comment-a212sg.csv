Maybe that's why I'm not a fan of this sub-- something feels wrong? Like on proed, there would always be a interesting and popular thread that I could enjoy, even out of a ed aspect. While I realize there's less people here now, it just feels like a very fake ""community"" and more a bunch of... lost people trying to cling to one another for dear life. Which again, makes sense. But I feel like on proed, it was okay to be alone. Here, it's chaotic if you stand alone/differ in mindset/etc. (I agree with censorship. I don't believe I've said anything wrong and am receiving, albeit small, down votes for saying how I feel lol. Veerry... supportive.)",False,True

I'm not dying or anything but the tone has def changed from the old subreddit to this one. Can't put my finger on it but it's different. Censored I guess?!,False,False

(: I do remember creating a post that was supported and taken very well, and I did like that! is there any way you can access it perhaps through a mirror?/: I imagine it would be awful to have that support and answers taken away!!",False,True

I was just asking if anyone felt similar to me, though. I would like to think a support group is doing what it needs to do, and helping. ^_^ just not my cup of tea, I guess. ",False,True

The people who were hugely affected by proED being banned were most likely people who felt they found a place where they knew they belonged and were able to be themselves for once.  I think it mostly depends on how active you are within a community. For example, let's say you're really into this video game, you play it for hours everyday for the past decade. Then one night, you open the program to find out the game no longer exists. Everything you've done within in the game is gone.  So for many people, it's like they woke up one day and what little sense of community and support they had within proED was completely removed. This place is an okay replacement but it seems much more censored which can make a lot of people feel like they can't be themselves.",False,False

I think for some people (me included) this is the only place I can talk about how I feel without seeming weird. ,False,False
