I am protective of my caffeine as well, because my schedule for work is unpredictable and I often have to pull doubles. Someone at a job site was nicking my monsters (I only ever had 1 or 2 in the breakroom at a time) and that drove me crazy. I am working in the middle of the night? The Cafe and cafeteria are not open! I do not have the option of leaving the lab either, cuz there is nothing open around me after midnight!  I don't understand why people feel entitled to food or drinks that they did not purchase. At least ask or something. ",False,True

I normally don't mind sharing, but caffeine is kind of a big deal for me because of my sleep problems and sleepy me just never has the energy to make tea or coffee, so a can of Coke in the morning is really sort of necessary for me to function properly. Admittedly I do sometimes not throw away my cans after I'm done, but I know when I was the one who drank a can because I'm very forgetful so for years I've been in the habit of crushing my cans when they were empty so I wouldn't keep trying to drink from them over and over. I also usually drink them in my bedroom while on my laptop or in the kitchen while having breakfast, so when I see like 3 or 4 uncrushed cans in the living room I know that somebody else took some. I don't really get angry these days since I got my BPD under control and I'm just the kind of person who can put up with a lot, but it definitely is a disappointment to know that I'm going to have to go back to the grocery store and carry a heavy case all the way home with me because somebody else drank a bunch of the last case I bought. Fortunately it isn't too often that it happens.",False,False
