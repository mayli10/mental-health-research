Even though the much more prominent illogical part of my brain that believes I’m a fat ass is screaming *what the fuck who even says that are you desperate.*  I am, in fact, desperate.",False,False

I used to try and trick my family so they wouldn’t be worried about me and make food and not eat it and stuff. Now I just don’t bother, if I don’t eat for a couple of days they’re just gonna have to deal with it",False,False

I don't like having an eating disorder and would like to kick it out of my head permanently.",False,False

But people simply couldn’t interpret the oblique poetry of despair I wrote with my body and with offhand comments, so I never got what I was looking for. For me, I wanted someone to save me, to care and worry, to pick me up in their arms like a small child and whisper comforting words and carry me out of the dark. Sadly, that was never gonna happen because that’s not how help and effective support works. Help is aid, assistance, a guiding hand, a shoulder to lean on. But I still have to be invested - I have to do the walking.   (I was so angry that that’s how things work. So angry. And also deeply sad, and afraid. Partly because I had no energy left...many days just breathing in and out felt like an overwhelming task. It took me a long time to accept that I was going to have to find a different way to live. And that’s ok - time takes time. But I still also wish I hadn’t stayed lost in the pain for so long.)",False,False

My friends all figured it out because I’ll say small comments here and there, but my family’s got no clue. I have a therapist, though and I’d recommend it",False,False
