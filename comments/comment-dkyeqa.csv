I honestly dont think I'll feel attractive until I've lost this weight so I can finally achieve that tall, skinny girl aesthetic. Girls who are a normal height or shorter than me always seem to be effortlessly feminine and pretty, regardless of their weight. I always feel like a giant hulking over them.",False,False

Meanwhile standard portion sizes our appetite is trained to is pretty much the same for everyone so that‚Äôs why so many tall women are skinny.  The extremely large majority of women I‚Äôve known who self identity as ‚Äúnaturally skinny‚Äù (effortlessly skinny) are on the taller side. I‚Äôm rather jealous myself, I doubt that I personally have nearly as many issues maintaining my BMI if I several inches taller.   Also it‚Äôs that there‚Äôs more surface area for body fat to be distributed over ‚Äústretched out?‚Äù So that will cause a leaner look and less obvious fat deposits than if the same person was shorter. Probably part of the reason the fashion industry loves tall people.  Being tall makes someone more likely to be lean &amp; narrower. Hence the common insults; ‚Äúbean pole‚Äù for tall people and ‚Äúdumpy‚Äù for short people. This doesn‚Äôt mean you suck or should feel inclined to put yourself down for it. Everyone has their own individual struggles.",False,False
