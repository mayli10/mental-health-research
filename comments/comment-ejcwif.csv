I was a friendless zitty geek with divorced parents and a crazy alcoholic mother. Started seriously trying to get thing when I was about 15.  I got there when I about 16. 5'4"" and 96 lbs. It looked good on me though. Wasn't skin n bones, I just have a tiny frame. Of course exercise and food (constant hunger) were all I thought about. In some ways it made me better. The hunger makes you mentally sharp and focused. The discipline carries over into other areas. I could wear size 0 jeans and look great in them. Never stopped menstruating, so not unhealthy, just obsessive. But in the end I couldn't keep it up. I had no free time, no friends or hobbies to speak of outside exercise. Eventually I mentally broke down from the constant internal pressure. Ending up gaining over 30 lbs and spending years battling binge/purge ED before simmering down to a manageable \~120-125 on average. I don't hate how I look but I don't love it. I miss that feeling of being so lean and in control. Don't think I have the time or mental resources to achieve it again at this point in life.   In nearly every other metric, life is actually way better now. Married to a gorgeous awesome dude, have a nice house, friends, hobbies, a dumb dog, yadda yadda. My point is, as someone who's been on both sides, being thin won't make everything great. Being not overweight will definitely result in major life improvements tho.",False,False
