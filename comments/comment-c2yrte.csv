You are NOT seven pounds heavy. There is no biological way that your body could transform calories into physical fat that quickly. You'd need to have the metabolism of Clark Kent. It's impossible. The seven pounds is all water and food weight. Trust me on this!,False,False

I haven't been this weight for ages, and I'm flipping out. Why the fuck did I turn myself back into THIS???? Logically, I know a lot of it is water and food, but I don't know how I'm going to get through the day. My brain keeps saying punish, punish... I hate myself. FML this sucks so much. What kind of life is this...",False,True

It will look incredibly drastic! One bad binge is not going to be enough to make you actually gain that much weight, so please don't obsess over it. Just go carefully today (don't starve but try to eat fibrous foods that are easy on your digestive system). Wear comfy clothes to stop the bloating distracting you too much.  You're going to be okay!",False,False

It's like I'm stuffing  everything I haven't had in forever into my big, stupid mouth. My  stomach is so bloated, and it hurts so much, but I can't stop. I really, really fucking hate myself. I was scared about my weight, but I don't want to be fat, and now I've gone and done just that. I hate myself. I don't know what to do. I don't know how I'll stay off the scale, and I know I won't be able to deal with the gain. i can't do this.",False,True

You 100% deserve to live and this moment isn't representative of who you are or who you can become. For now, focus on getting plenty of water and resting because it will probably be a bit of shock to your body. And, for the love of God, don't weigh yourself tomorrow! Sending all my love!",False,False
