I‚Äôve come across a lot of great products and replacements for calorie dense favorites of mine from browsing them:   r/1200isplenty   r/vegan1200isplenty  r/1200isplentyketo  r/ketofood  r/veganketo  r/OMAD  r/1500isplenty   I don‚Äôt do OMAD, keto, 1,500 calories a day, or veganism but it‚Äôs good to have a variety of places to draw inspiration from. It‚Äôs also a good reminder that restricting and fasting isn‚Äôt my only option, and that there are several different ways out there to lose weight. There is no right or wrong way, as long as it is healthy, sustainable, and works for you.",False,True

I gained the weight back time and time again, it never worked long term. I‚Äôm tired of feeling overweight and I‚Äôm tired of the physical ailments this disorder has given me. I used to idolize my ability to restrict a lot, it made me feel proud and in control. Following subs like this and listening to others struggling to cope with their ED or talking about how it affects their lives makes me realize how irrational the ED thought processes are because I ran relate to almost all of them. There is nothing glamorous about restricting or what becomes of it.   I started to be mindful of the ED thoughts when they would come up and then I‚Äôd stop and analyze them from almost a third person perspective. I also started to view the ED thoughts as separate to me, they no longer define me, and realized I can exercise control over them and tell them no. I basically respond to my ED thoughts as if they were someone I dislike hating on me for no reason.   Example:   ED thought:   ‚ÄúYou should starve today, you look fat and it‚Äôs the only way you‚Äôll lose weight fast enough to where you aren‚Äôt embarrassing yourself in public‚Äù   Why is this thought occurring right now, what proceeded it?   In that instance I had just weighed myself and only lost a pound and a half that week, which is not bad. But when you‚Äôre used to restricting to the point where weight was unhealthily falling off your body, it felt a little bittersweet. I was putting in a lot of effort everyday, meal prepping and grocery shopping and calorie counting. I knew logically that the results were reasonable, but I wished there was a way to make the pounds come off faster. That led me down the rabbit hole of impatience which is where the restriction urges start.   After I logically look at the situation I just say No to my ED brain and remind myself that I am losing weight sustainably, the process may be slow but it has been working for the last few months, and my ED brain is just being a hater because I did it by myself this time without it‚Äôs help.   Everytime the thought to restrict comes up I go through the mental gymnastics until I get to a point where I can confidentially tell myself ‚ÄúNo, I will not restrict, and that doesn‚Äôt mean I will end up binging, I am in control and I choose to make the healthy choice.‚Äù   This all was harder in the beginning but as I stuck through with it, it‚Äôs gotten easier now because staying the course has been working and I have progress I can point to as motivation to keep going.  Also not making too many changes too quickly. Don‚Äôt over whelm yourself. Make the changes that you can at a pace that is comfortable and sustainable for you. I told myself I didn‚Äôt wanna go to the gym again until I lost 30 pounds first which is getting close. While the idea of going to the gym terrified me a few months ago, I‚Äôm excited to incorporate that into my routines soon because I know it‚Äôll supplement the hard work I‚Äôm putting in outside the gym.   In regards to binging, I‚Äôve learned to use the same self control I have that allows me to restrict and fast towards the binging urges. I‚Äôve developed a habit of putting everything I eat into MFP before I eat it. This usually turns me off to most foods after I see how they will wreck my weekly averages and how little left I‚Äôll be able to eat for the rest of the day. Or I portion it into my day as a moderate serving. Or take those restaurant or fast food items and make a healthier version at home, cooking is a great way to get out of your head, and I‚Äôve come to like my versions of these foods better than the originals because my version doesn‚Äôt make me hate my life after I‚Äôm done eating.   If none of that is an option I just tell myself no, as many times as it takes, no matter how hard it is, sometimes to the verge of tears, until I just don‚Äôt want it anymore. Your mind gets over it and the craving and urge passes. You just have to ride the waves until the storm is over.",False,True
