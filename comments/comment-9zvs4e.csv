My lunches would be 235cal because my friends were watching me, I'd have coffee (sometimes fancy coffees, the latte's didn't bother me), then alcohol dinners. I never felt hungry, never worried about my calories. Literally the only thing that made me want to eat was the guy I was seeing.   I lost like 15 pounds.",False,False

That's how all my struggles began, honestly. I was going through some serious shit at the time though and i think i basically just lost the will to live, and along with it went my appetite. I just didnt eat anything at all anymore, I would have a can of soda once in a while but i decided if i wasn't hungry i didn't need to eat. I would wait until i was really dizzy and shaky before I had a bowl of cereal or something small. One time i ate not a single thing but water for 14 days; the 15th day was Thanksgiving and I ate a salad and a dinner bun. Ever since that age, I've really struggled to form normal eating habits.

I eat a lot healthier this way though. Often gets starving by 3pm but when dinner rolls around I’m no longer able to stomach much!,False,False

Like I’ll go a couple weeks or months of restricting and it feels like the most difficult thing in the world and then suddenly it’s easy and I’ll have to force myself to eat anything. It’s nice while it lasts, but my appetite always comes back eventually.   Are you on any new medications? Those can fuck with your appetite in all sorts of ways.",False,False
