Every one can get sick. Try not to make a big deal out of it, I know it's hard because all you see is your ed and purging but trust me, people who don't deal with ed on the regular are oblivious most of the time. Take a deep breath and if you're really feeling too bad, tell him you're feeling under the weather so you can get some space to calm down. It's going to be alright.   Now you probably know this but there is no such thing as ""enough weight lost to recover"". It will never be enough sadly, so don't wait for this to take care of yourself and try recovery if you can.",False,False
