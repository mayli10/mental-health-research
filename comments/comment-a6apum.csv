If they complain or try to tell you it’s not stressful just explain that it all adds up and you’re already at your limit.,False,False

I didn't know my dad until 2 years ago and we've connected like best friends. He didn't know I existed, none of them did because my mom ran away from her problems. But I kind of just ""fit in"" to an extent. I'm just socially retarded. I'm going to plan out our time on Christmas eve and have the morning to make her Christmas breakfast and open presents",False,True

Who are these people if you’re only known them for 2 years?  Holidays suck for those of us who need control.  Can you arrange a special time with your daughter? ,False,False

I actually just started crying knowing somebody read my dramatic ass. It's not possible because its not exactly ""my house"" I moved in with my biological dad 2 years ago. And I know that he will help that nothing will be ""expected"" of me.. But we all know that's not true. We all know that if I sit back and hide in my anxiety filled bubble that nothing will get done and everything will go to shit. I'm sure the morning will be ours if we wake up early enough. I need a xanax and a soda. It's all very doable my stupid brain just keeps crying because I'm fat and food and my personal space will be invaded for the first time in 2 years ",False,True
