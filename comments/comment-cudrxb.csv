It's not fun being a sad gremlin halfway through the day bc i chose to eat 3 bowls of cereal. I find i actually crave fruits, veggies, lean meats, and dairy products and genuinely feel happy to have them (when in the past i would eat stuff like poptarts in favor of any of these any day).  I remember phases in my life where i was more addicted to sugar than i am now. During middle school i drank a lot of soda because my dad did and would constantly buy it, but occasionally we'd be without it for a couple of days or my dad would decide to try (and fail) to kick the soda habit, and i would get mad cravings, which is insane to me now that i had ever been at that point. It caused me genuine distress not to have my ""fix"", i guess. I failed to see it as a problem at the time, but in retrospect it's yikes. Or just in general as a kid i'd open the fridge every 30 minutes wanting junk, and if we didn't have any, i wouldn't eat even if we had other stuff. But as a kid you don't understand all of this and you don't have the incentive to be healthy. I could eat like shit as a kid and not feel the consequences, but now i feel the effects of the food i eat.   I understand intuitive eating is different with binge eating disorder and i get it. A lot of people want to criticize saying to just eat the right foods and you'll stop binging, but imo that's akin to telling an anorexic to just eat more. It's ignoring all the mental wiring, which while different in some ways for each respective disorder, are also similar",False,False

I always thought this was the stupidest thing ever. Those girls needed to be re-fed slowly, like no more than 1200-1400 calories a day in the beginning, and clean, unprocessed, nutritious food, not the most fatteningest peanut buttery sugar shit available, and those girls needed to have at least 1 hour of gym per day where they learn a fitness routine that involves weight lifting and building lean muscle. Female athletes can be healthy at like 10-14% bodyfat thanks to their muscles, everyone in the medical community ignores this and its so absolutely fucking stupid.  And guess what? The moment those girls were released from the treatment centers, they either immediately began restricting and lost the weight again or they became depressed and suicidal. We had one girl who was a cutter who kept posting pics of the gashes she made on her arms and stomach. These doctors and nurses do not understand how freaking traumatizing it is for an eating disordered person to be force fed in a way that is guaranteed to make them fat and out of shape. I think had their system been fitness based instead, they would have had hundreds if not thousands of success stories, but force feeding helpless girls is easy, teaching them how to go to the gym takes too much effort I guess.
