Because that really shouldn't be happening. I'm sorry, I'm about to sound like loseit, but...are you measuring calories accurately? Like with a food scale and everything? Accounting for all bites/tastes/licks? And is your TDEE estimate truly accurate? Bc they aren't all made equal, and my true TDEE is definitely under what most sites estimate for me.   But if there's really, REALLY no possible way you haven't been eating at a deficit, and you also haven't gained a bunch of muscle weight or something, and you aren't taking a medication like Ambien (which can cause people to eat at night w/out being aware of it)....that's a legit medical issue and your doctor shouldn't be brushing you off. I'm sorry, I wish I had a better answer.",False,False
