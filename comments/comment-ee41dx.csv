I like my face for the most part although I wish my eyes werenâ€™t so close together. Cognitively i know my body is fine and other people find it attractive, but I like it way better when Iâ€™m underweight because I think it makes my hips look more in proportion with my short legs. When Iâ€™m at my lowest weight I actually really like how I look. Iâ€™m extroverted but socially anxious and I try to dress well, and I donâ€™t think I particularly ever blend in with other groups of people.",False,False

I guess attraction is very subjective so it's really hard to say...? I've been always told I look girlish, younger than my age, cute, small etc. So I'm some people's type but not everyone's? I'm also brunette with brown/green eyes, some people prefer brunettes and some blondes :D. I'm definitely more cute than attractive, and I'm totally fine with that :D.",False,False

I have dark circles and acne so it looks ew without makeup and decent with makeup, it really makes a huge difference. Still havenâ€™t worn it in months cause Iâ€™m lazy.  Body is alright, nothing special. Iâ€™m pretty short and have small boobs (but everything else is small too so itâ€™s not that bad).   So bare face: 3.5-4; face with makeup: 5-5.5 Body: I donâ€™t like being that short so 4  Iâ€™m pretty introvert, not shy or anything. Just canâ€™t be bothered to deal with people lol",False,False

My face is below a 0 ðŸ™ƒ  My body when fully clothed...based on comments from other people, when Iâ€™m about 5-10 pounds heavier than I am right now Iâ€™m an 8. My current weight I think probably freaks most people out so idk.  My body without clothes on is probably a 4-5.

Not to say that Iâ€™m exceptionally pretty or anything, either, but my face and my body definitely are on two very different levels. I get compliments sometimes, Iâ€™m cute or pretty or whatever, but I honest to god donâ€™t see it. I always thought I looked very plain and average at best.  When I lose, I definitely feel prettier. My cheekbones and jawline stand out more, my lips and my eyes look bigger, it all just looks better. My stomach doesnâ€™t poke out when I restrict and my shoulders look daintier too. But Iâ€™m always in big hoodies and jackets and things that cover my body. My face is better so Iâ€™d rather that show than my body. Plus I donâ€™t like being the center of attention and if I try to hide myself under big clothes I kinda feel like thatâ€™ll help me to blend in a little better.  I am very introverted though, so some of these things (like not really wanting to be seen/talked to) might just be qualities of an introvert and not from my ED.",False,False

What interests me is *why does that hurt so much*?? Iâ€™m not trying to attract a mate. I have an array of attributes that stand me in good stead as far as being an attractive person in the broader sense of that adjective. I have friends who value me in a more wholistic sense than just â€˜you prettyâ€™, which is what Iâ€™d desire at any attractiveness level. But part of me is carrying the hurt and the fear that being *less pretty* makes me *lesser* in every sense.   That said, the ED for me has never really been about trying to increase my physical attractiveness. Though I guess it does contain aspects of of punishment/atonement/â€˜well, I did what I couldâ€™.",False,False

My current body (not counting my boobs, my boobs suck but oh well) id honestly rate an 7.5. If I exercised more and built some muscle my body could easily be an 8.5. If I gained to a healthy weight Iâ€™d put my body at 3 (seriously). My body just doesnâ€™t look good with weight on it. My chest is basically flat though and kinda weirdly shaped and my biggest insecurity.

Also I definitely hide in my clothes, but I also have zero ability to tell if clothes fit? I literally just don't get it, I wish clothes just lit up green or something to tell me that they were the right fit, because I am hopeless. When I've been severely underweight it seemed easier, but at the moment, I dunno, I think most of my clothes are too big... maybe?  Also definitely more on the introverted end of the spectrum.
