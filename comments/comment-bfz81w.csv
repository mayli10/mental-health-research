I’m somewhat dubious about the notion that it’s necessary/healthy to continue weight restoration until one is clinically overweight, but suppose for a moment that it’s a fact. The body knows best and it should be whatever it naturally is, sooo... In that case the same logic should apply if one falls just short of the clinical “healthy weight” range, right?  Set point is bullshit, dont suppose otherwise for even a moment, and you definitely don't need to get fat to recover. That is fat logic, not ed logic, and it's the kind of thing that sends people running screaming from recovery.",False,False
