My digital is weighing heavier than than the digital at my parent’s place and the mechanical at the gym. The two of those are really close to each other, but mine is like 2lbs heavier and I don’t know what to trust. ",False,False

Sometimes the needle gets stuck or goes back past 0 when you step off. I have 3 scales (2 digital, 1 mechanic) and they are all slightly different weights (varies around 2-3 lbs). Personally I prefer my older digital scales, my new scales confirm the weight too soon so you have to immediately stand up straight and make sure you're standing on them properly because you can't shift once you're on them. It a little annoying.",False,False
