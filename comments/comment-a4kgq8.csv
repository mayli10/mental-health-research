I have no problems ignoring real, physical hunger. But when it comes to the mental urges to eat, I can't help but give in. ",False,True

I genuinely can ignore real hunger it's the lows and boredom I feel when restricting -_- ,False,False

A and B ate together a lot usually, whether they made meals at home or went out to eat. A generally ate less food than B if they cooked at home. B nearly always had a seconds. Going out, A chose lower calorie meals than B. Finally, if A ate more calories than B (which clearly is unusual), it was made up for eating less the next day because she just wasn't as hungry and had not trouble eat less.  I think this really comes down to hunger cues and how you eat. I'm an emotional eater so it FUCKing SUCKS when I get sad. I struggle and suffer to not eat even though I'm not hungry. When I am hungry, I can choose to not eat and not suffer. If I'm bored, it's a struggle to not eat.   I blame my parents; they treated food as a reward and pick-me-ups instead of something to sustain your body and give it nutrients. Ugh. It's difficult to change my attitude towards food.",False,False

I work with someone who’s extremely thin. Their family is very thin too. They eat whatever they want all day. Sweets, Treats, full fat drinks, full meals. It drives me crazy. We all measured ourselves while it was slow and their waist was the same as my thigh! Immediate trigger because their internal organs could very well fit in my leg. But seeing them everyday pushes me to do better because what I am isn’t good enough. ",False,False
