I went to boot camp in summer 2009. The rules in the dining facility stated you had to drink 3 eight oz glasses of non-carbonated, non-caffeinated liquid each meal. That gets really old really fast. I dropped a ton of weight because I would chug liquid and feel too full to eat, and you only got maybe 5 min at the table. So...one day I had a bowl of oatmeal at breakfast. It was not flavored and very thick. Being military boot camp food, it was not good at all. I decided it was not worth eating and I also really didn't want 3 glasses of liquid. I scooped the oatmeal to the side of the bowl and poured 8oz of orange Gatorade into the bottom, before covering it with the oatmeal. It seemed like it was going to work...until the thick surface tension of the oatmeal broke and a fountain of orange Gatorade flowed out of the top. I freaked out, trying to mix it together as best as I could so my sneaky liquid-hiding wouldn't be discovered. It was so thick, it really didn't mix well. I quickly got up and left the table and dumped my tray at the clipper. That day I learned that oatmeal can hide a lot...but not orange Gatorade. ",False,False
