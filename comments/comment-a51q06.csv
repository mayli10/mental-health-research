The media are problematic but I have a theory that we're not a symptom of the media, but the media is a symptom of us. Images on social media and magazines are a response to supply and demand. It's not a cause it's a reflection. I'm constantly complimented for losing and maintaining (ugh) my current weight. But my desire to get even more thin and my drive to hurt myself isn't driven by people in the media. I think we definitely have problems comparing ourselves to people, I think none of us really understand how to be normal so we desperately try to look like our favorite thinspo. But I still think that's one tiny factor in a myriad of problems that we face. What about the advertisements for food? Food? The way our families treat us? How people are generally so ignorant about these problems that hiding in plain sight is easy because my diet looks healthy to onlookers? How about how driving home the health side effects are attractive to us and make me feel like I haven't done well enough at this instead of acting as the deterrent other people think it is? I don't hear anyone talk about that except on pro ana sites! This is beautifully spoken and though it's not incorrect I'd just like to see other factors given some attention. ",False,False

And I have spent so much of my time when I was ill and then in Recovery trying to explain that eating disorders do not come from the media.  The pathological hatred I felt at my own body was not from magazines, and I did not wish to look appealing sexually or in line with beauty standards - I wanted to look emaciated and shocking. I hated those who propogated the notion that girls starve themselves to death or near death because they want to look like pretty models or actresses. It patronises us all and belittles mental illness in a way that no one would dream of treating non-ed mental illness.    ",False,False
