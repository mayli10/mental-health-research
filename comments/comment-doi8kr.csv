It’s about privacy. I don’t want that comment to send you into a downward cycle either, but it was a dick thing to say and I’m sorry he said that.",False,False

He is also a friend of ours. I'm trying to stay positive and not let it bother me because I think he just said it objectively—like he noticed a change and would adapt my workout structure as a result. He's also entirely unaware of my ED. I sound like I'm making excuses for him, but I'm just trying to look on the bright side and understand where he's coming from so that I don't let a little comment send me into a downward cycle, ya know?",False,True
