It was a while ago, but my views are really positive. The staff were professional and made sure the patients had all the tools they needed to be successful, but didn’t do the work for us. At first I was a little put off by them because they seemed to put a lot of responsibility back on me when things weren’t going well, but then I realized they were putting responsibility on me to actually USE the skills they were teaching me, and then things started to get better quick. They have apartments you can live in for PHP and IOP which was actually really helpful and I was able to stay for PHP too. You do a lot of pulling together your own meals with food items that are prepped in the kitchen, so you get a feel for what you like and dislike and have some control over WHAT you’re eating even if you don’t have control over how many calories you eat. It was very home like which helped me bring recovery home with me and not just be working on it in treatment. Stuff still gets hard but nowhere like it did before I went there so I’m really glad I went.",False,False
