I felt SO attacked bc there was no way I could answer that question honestly. Plus ( and I hate this) I don't wanna give her any tips and then she loses weight quicker than me. So I had to give her some bs answer about portion control..... which isn't technically lying......,False,False

Something tells me that everyone who is considered ""skinny"" probably has an ED of some kind. Just tell them that if they want to lose weight, eat healthy and exercise, be real. Tell them to lay off the carbs, eat a lot of fruits/veg/protein and run an hour 4 days a week AKA burn more than you consume, and they'll drop weight at a good pace.  &amp;#x200B;  Why can't  WE just apply this to our own damn lives?! Also, I'd be flattered if people looked at me as thinspo... Even if you feel angry at the lengths you go to  in order to have your body, you can always rationalize in your head that you can probably still maintain a skinny body without being insane about how to have it.  Also, is your UGW anorexia or just being skinny? There have been days where my body has looked so skeletal that people were honestly repulsed and scared for me- but than there are days where I'm just ""skinny"" and people do admire/envy that. I think it sucks that it's not permanent and anyone, I mean ANYONE (who is able bodied) can achieve whatever body type they want. Whether it be anorexic, fit, obese, healthy, average (which, I don't even understand what determines ""average"") - my point being: Bodies are just a physical manifestation of what you put into it and how often you are utilizing it actively. I feel like all of us here have so much more trauma that we take out on ourselves physically whilst wanting to fit into societies standards of deserving of respect/admiration. To be honest, the girls I find attractive (I am not a lesbian, but I get girl crushes) are usually on the thicker side, yet, I want to be 60s cocaine model thin. It's about having control and being skinny- but we know that isn't what is solely considered beautiful. We just need to channel our energy into being proud of ourselves for achieving the body we want without doing scary things to get there- things that make us feel helpless to our mental illness.  &amp;#x200B;  Sorry for the long post. I hate when people comment on my body whether it be good or bad. I get too validated from hearing what I want, and if I don't hear it than I feel depressed. Those comments are usually people asking me if I'm anorexic or if I have aids. I see myself in the mirror and want to be even skinnier. I know what is scary skinny and  I don't want to get pre 2k19 Eugenia Cooney but I also find Victoria Secret models to be thicker than where I want to be. I think that's really unhealthy and I question why I have these thoughts that are considered disordered.  &amp;#x200B;  I just wanna stop having a shitty relationship with food. We NEED food. We might as well realize that thin is a science and the science aint that hard. Eat less than you burn. Work out. Eat vegetables and protein cause that shit don't make you sluggish. If you get too skinny you will literally get bloated from one olive. That is not good either.  &amp;#x200B;  Be smart and safe, friends. I really hope we get through this together- if everyone loved themselves and.. let's face it, loved how they looked, this world would be a lot happier. We can all, as humans, do that with some self love and self discipline.",False,False
