'Cos I can't eat *anything* whether tasting good or bad without the dire danger of a binge. Lately my go-to food has been plain rice, eaten raw. Not only is this bland ""dish"" less tasty than most any other choice of food, eating it is a serious chore â€“ punishing on the teeth, even the molars.   But this is the low I've sunk to this in hopes of curbing my binge tendencies. *News flash* â€“ hasn't worked.   I've acquired a taste for raw rice! Sprinkle on some powdered spices, sweet or savory, then moisten lightly with olive oil, almond milk or even mustard, and I'll crunch thru' bowl after condiment-bowl until easily a pound of rice is gone.   *Wish I was joking, even a little bitâ€¦* We're talking Raw. Rice. Sauerkraut to which I've lifelong been indifferent would be the same thing. I'm addicted to food. *Every food.*",False,False
