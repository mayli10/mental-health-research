I understand completely about comparing myself to the attractive people of the world.  Recently made a ""gay Twitter"" account and started following people -- interesting people, hot people, porn people, porn aggregators... and realized how toxic it can be. The shallow people, the gorgeous people, the people who seem to live glamorous lives and get as much action as they  can handle with people who are gorgeous like them...  But at the end of the day, I can't help but wonder if they have struggles just like the rest of us do... Even r/bigdickproblems is full of people who have issues because of something so many of us would want to have!  No one is perfect. Everyone has a struggle, even if they dont realize that struggle. And I would argue that those who DON'T recognize their issues are probably some of the worst-off of us all.  We all hurt in some way. But we can all also overcome those hurts in our lives. I try to look at the people, the places, and the scenarios, and remember to add an asterisk if I start to wish for what they have over what I have.   Because no one has it all. We just have different parts. It's up to us to assemble those parts in the ways that leave us the most fulfilled, and, hopefully, help to fulfill others along the way.  Hang in there!",False,False

Someone having an amazing body is the most obvious trigger, but often it can also be seeing a really cute guy at the grocery store checkout line. Basically anything in life that makes me feel not good enough.  For me the reflex to lose weight whenever I feel inadequate stems from it working in the past. I did undeniably look better at a BMI 25 than at a BMI 28, better at a 22 than 25, better at a 20 than 22 and so on. Only now at BMI 17 I've hit the limit where it no longer works and I would only look sick if I lost more weight. But it's still the go-to solution for my brain and I have to fight the thought every time it pops up.",False,False
