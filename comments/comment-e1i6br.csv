It's especially worse now that I have had a ""good"" period because I've been living with my SO and sometimes with him and his family and I literally had/have no way to restrict because I haven't eaten alone in almost 1-2 months now. So because i'm eating breakfast, lunch and a healthy dinner (that I don't make myself - so it could contain all kinds of fats and oils that actually scare me a lot and that I avoid whenever I cook myself) and very often some kind of dessert every.single.day and I actually feel good while eating sometimes (because I love my SO and his family, so eating with them kinda takes away the scary/disgusting part of eating), I feel pretty much recovered and healthy! And it's so frustrating because I know that I'm not - all the thoughts and fears are still there, they're just repressed. But at the same time, what if I'm actually recovered/didn't have an eating disorder in the first place.  I mean, it's extremely exhausting. Constantly going back and forth like that and not knowing if you have a problem or not. So for me, it helped a lot to see various people over the last months - nurses, psychologists, volunteers in various organisations, doctors - and hear what THEY have to say. These people, these healthy people, who look at you from a normal-human-being-perspective. We should not listen to ourselves and let ourselves decide if we are sick or not - it's really not up to us. We should listen to the people around us and to the professionals, and if they decide that we have an ED and we need help, then we do :)  I really hope that you won't cancel! I was about to cancel the very very first time I went to someone to talk about my problems for the first time, but I'm so glad that I did not. And I wanted to cancel all the other time after that, but the more I forced myself to go, the better I felt and the more help I received. The professionals want the best for you, they're there to help you and you deserve that help!  I didn't feel ready for recovery the first few times I've talked to professionals about these things, but the more I talked to them and the more hope they gave me, the more sure I became that this is what I want. For me, it just helped a lot to talk with people who have either recovered or helped someone else recover, and that told me that it IS possible to recover and that there IS a light in the end of the tunnel. And in the end, I asked myself: would I rather live this miserable life for the rest of my life, or would I rather try going to a professional and get even a slight chance of getting healthy and living a great life? I chose the last one :) Before I had the hope and the belief that things CAN get better, I saw no point of getting treatment, because I thought that things would be this way all my life. But apparently no, things don't have to be this way.   I don't know if what I wrote made sense, but I do hope you'll go to the appointment and get help! You don't deserve to suffer (no matter how serious your illness is) on your own for the rest of your life. Accept the help that is being given to you and hopefully, everything will work out. But you don't know if it works out if you don't try and give it some effort first! That's how I think about it at least :)",False,True

Like, is me explaining my idiosyncrasies around food/exercise really enough to diagnose me within just a few minutes?? I just don't know if I believe it. Because I do eat! It may be a small amount, but surely it has to be more than people with eating disorders - right??   Thank you so much. I just have to not cancel (again) because of my anxiety. Which I will probably do because thinking about going to a professional about this causes me so much anxiety!   Do you feel ready to get healthy? Idk if I will ever feel ready?",False,False

Like when I went to my doctor to talk about my eating problems for the first time, at the end she asked me for how long I've had *my* eating disorder and mentioned *my* eating disorder again and both times I had to correct her and say, haha no, lady you don't understand - I don't have an eating disorder - I have *disordered eating*! I mean I didn't say it in that exact way but I corrected her every time she mentioned it because it was just so unreal and weird to have her to say those two words. I'm hoping that your program will help you - wishing you the best!",False,True

I go back and forth thinking I need help and then thinking I'm completely fine and just health conscious. There's nothing abnormal about not being able to eat in front of other people, losing 70 lbs in less than a year and being borderline undeweight, exercising compulsively if I feel I ate too much, or have a mental breakdown if I gain a fraction of a lb from day to day - right?  I am supposed to be starting an outpatient program, and in the last email they sent me they mentioned my ""eating disorder."" I was shocked because I haven't been diagnosed with anything yet, but just from the phone consultation it appears they think I actually do have some sort of disorder. So scary, but most of me still doesn't believe it.",False,False
