Sorry you didn't have anyone to spend the day with &lt;3    &amp;#x200B;  I find joining different groups/ activities is a great way to meet new people.  Things like yoga, intramural sports, art classes, etc are all fun ways to meet people.  If you are short on cash volunteering for a cause you care about can be a fun way to meet new people.  It doesn't always work but I'd say about  half of the time I do something like that I make at least one or two friends and if not I still enjoy the activity/  get some social interaction",False,False

I'm in recovery now, and I'm encouraged by the idea that someday I'm gonna get my shit together enough that I can actually see my family. I started the day off strong with lots of plans to occupy my time, but I powered through those and now I'm feeling pretty lonely and depressed. I let the neighborhood cat in and let him sit with me for a few hours. We will get through this, dude.",False,False
