Try not weighing yourself for half the amount of times you normally would during the day. Do that for a week. Then try skipping weighing yourself one or two days a week. Do this until you only weigh yourself once a week. I usually weigh myself Sunday mornings right when I wake up but after I pee lol,False,False
