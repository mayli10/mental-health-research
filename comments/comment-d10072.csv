My therapist/nutritionist (and people on this sub) explained it that the rise in glucose after eating triggers the release of insulin which looks for glucose to turn into energy, and if you’ve been restricting your body is REALLY looking for some glucose to turn into energy so as a result you crave more. If you don’t have enough protein and fiber in your system especially it could exacerbate it. Also mentally your brain reacts to restriction by compensating. It thinks in terms of survival, which is important because you’re important ☺️",False,False

Try to eat your 3 meals and 3 snacks, and to eat enough (this is important !!) for all of them. It will normalize after a while. Don't exercise, it will make it worse though !   Good luck ! Don't feel guilty. Your body is hungry so you're eating, nothing to feel shame about. And hey, congratulations on trying to eat better and nourishing your body. You did good !",False,False
