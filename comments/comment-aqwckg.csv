I brought one once and the Dr photocopied it and then used it as evidence against me that I was being dramatic. (He was an asshole)  I'd recommend just being straight forward with your doctor about your symptoms. Be truthful about your disordered thoughts, actions, and physical experiences. Don't worry about having to lead the conversion. Doctors have an order of operations they observe when screening for EDs and they will ask for the information they need. If by the end of the appointment you feel they missed something important, then you can go ahead and address it then.  Although the diagnostic requirements for EDs are still not very thorough, ultimately what your doctor needs to know is that your ED symptoms are interfering with your life. Even if you don't meet all diagnostic criteria, saying ""the thoughts/behaviors are interfering with my life"" should get the Dr's attention .  Best of luck, friend.",False,False
