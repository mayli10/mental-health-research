I‚Äôve been thinking it‚Äôs time to talk to him about it, but I‚Äôm not diagnosed or underweight, so I feel like I can‚Äôt say anything. I‚Äôm losing weight rapidly (172-145 in 2.5 months) and purging. Logically I know my habits aren‚Äôt normal, but I‚Äôm still working on validating my own disordered eating in my headüòÖ",False,True

He has concern for you, enough to notice and mention it.",False,False

I'm right there with you too. I got the nickname huesos (bones in Spanish) at work and some part of me loves it.   I think it is good to actually realize that it isn't as good as we think. Being recognized for being skinny can feel great, but it is also dangerous. Please be safe!",False,False
