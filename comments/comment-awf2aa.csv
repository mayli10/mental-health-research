My top tips:  - Read up on the company/industry you're applying to as they'll likely ask questions about this.  - Why do you want to work there?  - Why are you the best candidate for this job? What can *you* offer them?  - Be confident in your abilities. Sell yourself to them.  - Be prepared for scenario based questions, e.g: give an example of a challenge you faced at work, and how did you overcome it? How have you managed conflict in the work place?  - Smile! Try to enjoy it. Don't think of it as an interview but as a chat.   I'm someone who gets so anxious with this kinda thing but honestly all the above has helped me massively with interviews. Worst case scenario they don't hire you but just use it as a learning curve! Good luck! ",False,False

I can't help but feel like a failure because I've lost 75 pounds and am now just under 15 from my UGW and I just... gave up. My UGW is around a BMI of 19 so it wouldn't even drop me into the underweight category. I know this is a good choice for me because I was getting so weak and miserable with how much I was restricting/exercising, but I still would like to lose some weight even though my dysmorphia has magically cleared up quite a bit and I can see that I do look pretty thin now.   I feel like maybe I was faking my disorder for six months. I've had issues with overeating/binging since I was a kid, and I go through periods where I'll restrict heavily for a few months and then relapse into binging again. This was the worst restriction relapse of my life, and I lost 75 pounds in 6 months, hitting a weight I haven't been since I was 9 or 10 and going below my previous lowest weight at this height that I hit when I was 13 by almost 20 pounds. I thought, maybe, I actually qualified as anorexic this time. But if I can go back to eating with no intervention, if I can eat over my TDEE for almost a week straight without freaking out because I know this is what's supposed to happen in recovery, then did I ever even have an ED in the first place?  Or maybe I'm not recovering, really, and my disorder is just changing and letting me eat a little more so I can exercise more. My sedentary TDEE is supposed to be around 1700 but I generally get anywhere from 12,000 to 20,000 steps a day and I run three times a week. I'm still weighing myself daily and tracking calories because I'm terrified I'll revert to my ""fuck it, eat everything, but mostly mac and cheese"" mode and gain everything back and I'll feel so unhealthy and gross. I want to be healthy. I'm going into health as a career. I want to be healthy, and look healthy, which means I want to stay thin because people are more prone to believing you're healthy when you're thin. I eat a lot of fruits and veggies now, and if I revert to eating junk I know my taste buds will go back to the way they were and I'll stop loving the taste of raw carrots and celery, or bowls of cauliflower rice and peas and spinach.  I want to keep most of my ortho tendencies (except my aversion to fat because holy fucking shit I studied nutrition I know I need more than like 10g of fat a day) because they make me healthy.  My calorie goals might be too low for recovery. My goal is to stay in the 1200-1700 range, and definitely try to be under 2000. I've had days this week where I ate 5,000 calories, which is fine for one off things, my body is trying to renourish itself and that's part of the process. I just don't want it to be a pattern. Yesterday I only had about 1200 calories and I also ran 7.5 miles and went skiing. I only logged 1127 calories so I should've had a little more at dinner to at least get over 1200, but I did have a spoonful or two of unlogged Enlightened ice cream and some samples at Costco that I didn't log so that probably got me over the 1200 mark.   I both hate and love how successful I feel for eating so little yesterday while exercising so much. I know that's just another iteration of disordered behavior, but I also know that a week ago I would've done the same amount of exercise but only eaten 900 calories so this is progress.  The best thing I've gotten with this magic switch flip into ""recovery"" is that my obsession with numbers has gone away. For months, every food I consumed had to be in a quantity so that the calorie count was divisible by five. Daily totals had to be certain numbers that felt safe (like, 750 was safe, 765 was safe, but 755 and 760 weren't), and I would plan out my days of food several days in advance, calculating everything to the gram to make sure the numbers worked out. Now I can be a little more relaxed when I eat, like I can tare my scale with my bowl then take it off the scale and dump in however much food I want before weighing it, and if it ends up being 83 calories of blueberries instead of 75, I don't have to pick blueberries out of the bowl and put them back in the package one by one until the calories are right. But I also know my compulsions with numbers, and I think this might be the biggest thing I'll have to watch out for relapsing into because this number obsession is usually what devolves into me restricting more and more heavily as the safe number choices get lower every week.   I don't know the point of this post. Sorry for a novel, y'all. I'm glad I'm eating more because I love exercise now and I was getting to a point where it was becoming a chore because I was weak. I'm scared of gaining weight even though I know it's part of the process. I don't want to grow out of my new clothes because I'm fitting in size 6s and smalls, which I never in my life thought I could be. I'm scared I'll get my period back because I haven't had it in 5 months, since before I even hit a healthy BMI, and I don't know how much of that was because of my birth control and how much was the restricting. All I want is to have energy, to keep the body I have now, and to not start binging again.",False,False
