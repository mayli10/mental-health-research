Happy I could make your day better in some way !,False,True

Also, I found this really really reallyyy funny to think about, and Iâ€™m probably going to hell. Iâ€™m sorry. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚",False,False

To keep the acid levels down, swish some baking soda or something basic, maybe even drink a little to help with heartburn. Avoid any abrasive things like eating or teeth clenching or whatever since theyâ€™ll be weakened from the acid.  Take what I say with a grain of salt because I could be wrong, but Iâ€™ve been regularly purging for about 4 years and have yet to get a cavity. ðŸ¤ž",False,False

I just mildly remember it from a chem lab a few years ago and it seemed right at the time. Nothing online seems to agree though so who knows ",False,False

I don't think that would be food safe lol",False,False

Aluminum foil isnâ€™t actually bare aluminum but instead thin metal coated with a tiny amount of plastic IIRC.,False,False

That sounds impractical, and the highly acidic stomach acid might react with the aluminum?  I think you should just implement other safety behaviors, like gargling water, or gargling water with baking soda (like the other user says, it tastes unpleasant but it's good for your teeth). also of course never brush your teeth after purging. And it never hurts to use a straw when you drink acidic drinks.",False,False

I think whatâ€™s helped my teeth most is gargling and spitting with warm water between purges, and avoiding brushing my teeth or using mouthwash for at least 30mins after a purge.   You can also gargle with bicarb soda + water irl, tho it tastes gnarly haha.",False,False
