My weight varies within a 5 lb range depending on how hydrated I am when I weigh myself. I think often when you are maintaining a low weight, that weight stays super constant because you;re doing the exact same thing (Eating the same food etc) to keep it there. It's impossible for you to have gained 1.2 lbs of muscle/fat/bone/organ tissue in a day. You might have gained a tiny bit of actual body tissue, and your body is also likely holding some water, and maybe poop, etc. When you say freaking out - are you scared you will ""gain 1.2 pounds per day"" forever? Can you identify the fear more specifically?",False,False

For me I feel so much better just getting out of my room and outside...  thoughts seem to slow down and not cycle so much. No one can see your gain and your body really needs it ðŸ’“,False,False
