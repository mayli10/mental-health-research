I had a feeling before even opening the video that there was going to be an ED involved. I felt her interlude in the middle to really stress how destructive her behaviors were was very moving, especially because she knew it would disrupt the flow of the video and upset her perfectionism but she did it anyway because of how important she felt it was.  I was honestly shell-shocked and taken aback when she suddenly dropped her sponsor in right at the end. I thought it was going to be BetterHelp and that made me disheartened and then it ended up being a calorie counting app and I was speechless tbh lol. I do feel bad that she is getting so much flack, and she seems like someone who takes things to heart and probably feels terrible already. Hope she starts doing better, she seems like a very sweet girl and I relate a lot to all of the struggles she has faced.",False,False

I just felt kind of gutted when I saw that.",False,True

Like, I understand how she explained it helped her, but having an eating disorder herself and talking to a specialist you think she’d know about the hypocrisy in that?",False,True

I truly do not think she knew the extent of her actions as she seems to have gone through a number of issues these past couple years and this is a new one for her. It’s also relatively new for me too and I am glad that it maybe has not gone to the same extent for her where that kind of knowledge and behavior is ingrained in her. At least I hope not, I don’t know what’s been going on in her head so I wouldn’t be able to say for sure.  That being said, I do hope she addresses it - be it in a tweet or video. Though I’m sure she fully aware of the screw up and has anxiety and depression and is probably mad at herself, I feel for her fans she needs to step up and give a TW for the app and say that calorie counting can be a trigger etc.",False,False
ed7pm9i,t3_acfuma,t3_acfuma,sadboyofearth,1,2019-01-04 02:50:55,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/acfuma/anyone_else_see_the_elle_mills_video/ed7pm9i/,I think it depends for everyone and some people would benefit from it.  It really seemed like the video was more geared toward non-disordered-eating people.  To be really blunt from what she said she’s struggled with this for a few months where as a lot of us have dealt with it for year.  Her thinking probably isn’t as ingrained and she likely doesn’t know the full extent of behaviors.  Calorie counting may have never been part of her problems and for many people calorie counting isn’t a problem.  I think she was trying to give people what they asked for the “how can they lose weight like her” thing. So I’m really not mad at it but I wish she had given something a bit better as a solution but I don’t think she has it right now to give.,False,False

Toward the end of the video she encourages those who are suffering to seek help but then continues to push them to use a calorie counting app that will only feed their disorder. An app that determines which foods are “good” and “bad” for you. ,False,False
