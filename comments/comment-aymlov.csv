I don’t find your tone argumentative or anything like that. I’m happy that you are willing to discuss this with me!    On that note, I think you understand what I am getting at. (And I greatly appreciate that.)  It is easy to believe that our vape juice just dissipates into the ether when we walk away from it, but the reality is very different.  Shit lingers. And coats surfaces.  And smells, even if you can’t smell it.   OYEAPSA.  We can’t smell shit.  When we damage our bodies so badly, it affects even “inconsequential” parts of our lives, such as our sense of smell. We (people with EDs) are notorious for having incompetent (if not entirely ineffective) senses of smell.   Bet you didn’t know that. Anyway, don’t get in a fight with a “smelling” person about your personal stench, or even someone else’s. No one can win here. ",False,False

I started smoking because nicotine = suppressed appetite. I continue smoking because nicotine = “the only stable thing in life?”   Jk. Even as a smoker who has switched to vapes, I veto it. Vaping is just as addictive and the ‘stealth’ aspect that people imagine makes us more inclined to use in places we would NEVER light a cigarette. There may be no burning tobacco, but by using in public places (esp. contained ones like a work restroom) we expose others who may not wish to use our drugs.   Some people might say, ‘so what?’  In that case, I will make a crude analogy. Say I am a drug user who instead of enjoying the ‘many benefits of nicotine’ enjoys the ‘many benefits of GHB.’  Say I am at a casual gathering of friends where no one would expect me to be using GHB (much like no one would expect me to use nicotine, aerosolized, in the restroom at work).   Similar stats. Both groups are people who have reasonable cause to trust me.   Say I, as a hypothetical GHB user, were to put some into my own drink, so that I could reap the benefits. Say I, having partaken in as much as I want at the time, now walk away from my glass of water (much like walking out of the restroom I have been vaping in.)  Any of my friends may decide to drink from my glass of water (as many of my coworkers may choose to use the restroom.)  They have unknowingly taken a substance that I only intended for myself and that I know to have negative consequences for some/most people.   Would I feel good about knowingly (knowing the effects) exposing my friends to what is commonly referred to as “The Date Rape Drug” at a function they would (and should) normally feel safe going to?  The answer is no. So should I feel good about knowingly (knowing the effects) exposing my coworkers to what is scientifically known as a “cancer inducing compound” in an environment where they would (and should) normally feel safe?  The answer is no.   I apologize for the rant about smoking/vaping. I realise not many people need to hear it.   *However*, I hope that I have shed a bit of light on why it is not okay to vape in places like one’s work environment.   TL;DR: &gt;Vaping in public and enclosed spaces is similar to dosing your own water with GHB at a friendly event where you leave your glass unattended. It all boils down to consent. ",False,False
