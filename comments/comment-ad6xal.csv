My boyfriend was so worried about my b/p'ing that he told my mom, who then opened up and said that if she hadn't had an anorexic roommate in college, she would've ended up anorexic herself. She was so comforting and still is, and the best part about opening up to someone who knows the struggle is that they know taking away control over your life will not help. My mom said ""I'll always be here for you, but I know that this issue is about control. I'm not going to tell you how or when to eat. You'll be on your own some day so you need to be able to work on this on your own.""  So, if anyone at all knows about it. It may be helpful to ask them to let an adult you trust know, because sometimes saying it yourself is just too painful. But I really encourage you to reach out to someone irl. Saying it to us here is a good first step but theres only so much strangers on the internet can do to help.  I hope you find someone to talk to. We're all here for you. ",False,False

I decided that I wouldn't tell anyone else.   Then I told my bf, and he said something like, ""I've battled weight before, I've tried doing that as well. I know how hard it is to not like who you are"" and it was so nice.",False,False

One friend was really awesome and we just talked about it like you would anything else. One friend was worried and I was scared of interference so underplayed the severity. Boyfriend's have always been the worst. ,False,False

It was really really great and I love the way he handled it. When my parents found out, they didn‚Äôt understand and told me if losing weight is the goal, it wasn‚Äôt the right way to do it. That was less great of an experience, but support from my boyfriend was very helpful!",False,False

Most of the people I‚Äôm close with have been very supportive and they really try to understand and help without pressuring me, but some people I was close with reacted more with judgment or disgust or even worse absolute nonchalance (so I‚Äôm not very close with them anymore). Telling my parents was the most difficult part for me, and they were very concerned and for a while tried to be controlling about it, but now they‚Äôre focusing more on trying to help me help myself.   Honestly telling SOMEBODY helped me a lot, because it no longer being secret felt like part of the burden was lifted off of my shoulders. If you have someone you are close to and trust, I would say you should reach out to them. I know it‚Äôs very scary/embarrassing/awkward, but having someone you‚Äôre close with who can listen and understand is very valuable. ",False,False

That's an unusual reaction, though, and I wouldn't expect it as a default in your situation.  I just tell them matter of factly that some symptoms or behaviors are due to my bulimia, which I've had for so-and-so long, and that I am not willing to recover and that they better keep their nose out of it if they want the friendship/relationship to continue.
