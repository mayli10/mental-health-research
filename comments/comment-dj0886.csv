I promise you, you are not less valid in your ED just because you're not UW, even if that's what your ED tells you.  I'm not underweight yet, I just relapsed at the very end of August so a little over a month and a half ago, but I have lost 4 BMI points in that time. Even not being underweight, I've lost my period, my hair is falling out, my nail beds are blue, and my BP is 75/45. There can absolutely be negative and dangerous side effects even when normal weight.  Hope you have a good day :/ EDs are such a bitch",False,True

You literally replied to me on a different thread talking about the same thing. I know you’re not the only one.

Since my e experience was from losing weight and going from overweight/obese to being Underweight that is where I spoke from.
