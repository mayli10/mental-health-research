I don't give disordered advice. That's what influenced mine and I refuse to do that to someone. I never use my ED to one-up someone. I'm sick and I don't want this for anyone.    I've asked him to take a break from the diet/food talk for a little while. Sorry for rambling, your comment really helped.",False,True

We've talked and things are better than they were. Thank you for your comment.",False,True

I don't think he always understands what it's like or how mentally exhausting this is. I've talked to him and told him I need a break from the food/diet talk. Thank you for commenting.,False,True

No. You can't help your feelings, and your brain is eating itself alive without your permission. I don't even know how to describe why, but if I were you, I'd feel...weirdly angry.  But if you take it out on him at all, then YTA. You're not wrong for feeling shitty, and neither is he.  Can you ban weight and food as a topic for a while? It'd be nice if you were in a position to be able to support him, but you're not. He can't expect you to. You can be there for him during other situations.",False,False

You have every right to be annoyed, but it can be good to remember that everyone has their own struggles too.This diet is probably hard for him as it is a complete change in the way he eats. Considering that he should still learn how to just suck it up as it is for his own health and he made the change himself. On the other hand, you could express your feelings to him and explain how the way he acts makes you feel. A little communication and compromise is all you guys need.",False,False

If you have a meaningful discussion about how and why you're triggered, that's the only way he will know to do anything different.  If you have talked and he still does it, he's the asshoke.  If you haven't talked but magically expect him to change, you're the asshole.  The act of being triggered by this doesn't make you an asshole imo. It's a mental illness you can't control what triggers it.",False,False
