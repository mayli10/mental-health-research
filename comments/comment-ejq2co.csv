When I was in middle school I had severe depression and anxiety, cried every day and night endlessly, fantasized about just dying, didn‚Äôt have any friends or anyone to talk to, etc. One day I went to my mom crying and I told her that I needed help from a doctor. She told me ‚Äúno daughter of mine is going to be locked up in a mental institution‚Äù and told me to brush it off. My depression kept getting worse until I developed a few eating disorders. The worst thing is that we apparently have a family history of depression and mental illness that she knew about the whole time, and she says she never saw my eating disorders coming and she was never aware that I had any problems üò¢",False,False

I was just sick of the way one of my ""friends"" kept dismissing my mental health issues and my binge eating problems (even though his OWN mental health and weight problems were obviously very very important and real) and I was like, okay then, screw you, I'm gonna show you how messed up I am and it'll be all your fault that I swapped from one form of self harm to a more recognisable one and then you'll feel soooo guilty and you'll know it was all because you were mean to me!  Of course. That's not how anything turned out and it's not how I think about it now. But it's like... mentally, I picture my eating as an enormous railway lever that can switch between two tracks, ""BINGING"" or ""RESTRICTING"". There is no in-between, but for the first time ever I heaved the lever over to the other side. It's alarming how similar the thought processes are. Binging was a coping mechanism, restricting became a coping mechanism. Binging was, deep down, just a form of self harm, and obviously so is restricting. Binging was about control (""you can't tell me what NOT to eat!""). We all know how restricting is about control lol.  The desire to make it visually undeniable that you're suffering is... real. Sometimes after a lifetime of feeling like nobody can tell, that nobody believes you, you just want to be someone people look at and go ""wow, you can tell they're going through it"".  It never really works out like that though. It's not too late for you to turn things around. We're always here to carry you.",False,False

It started with severe depression and emerging AN-R behaviours. I got completely shut down when my parents figured out I was about ready to yeet myself so I poured all my internal anger into my ED and completely locked up emotionally.  Years of suffering could have been avoided and I could be doing something with my life right now üôÉ  Ofc this is a terrible mindset to have but its so hard to not think about all that could have been when in ED lows. I don't know how long you've had an ED for but everything is so much gloomier for me because I've spent all my teen years so far with some form and degree of this. Not really knowing what ""normal"" is.",False,False

Mom couldnt accept i was depressed because she blamed all her shortcomings in her relationship with my father on us and blamed his shortcomings on us, yelled at us constantly to the point we didnt want to come home from school and would be literally shaking by the time we got to our stop to get off.
