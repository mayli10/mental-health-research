They see weight loss and don’t conceptualize it concretely. They think “oh she must have cut back to only eating noodles once a week”,False,False

I initially lost 40 lb in a very short time when I started 2 yrs ago. It was like no one cared at all how I lost the weight and no one was even suspicious that I was down 40 lb in essentially 2 months.,False,False

It’s in our culture to complement those who lose weight without ever wondering if anything negative is behind it. This is why I tend not to complement weight loss in anyone unless I know they’re doing it intentionally and like/want recognition.,False,False
