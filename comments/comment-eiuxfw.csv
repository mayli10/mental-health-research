Idk I don't like to track calories and eat whole foods and pretend we're all good haha. But I still keep track of bread and stuff that adds up quickly. Imo grapes don't add up -that- quickly. But you're like trying to be a fruitarian so it might feel different and it might be worth counting? Ymmv.,False,False

I remember one time I ate a whole bag of cherries and was sad when I looked at the calorie count, lol. (I assumed there were like 3 cups in the bag, 90 cals/cup + 10 cal Roundup for Ana = 300 calories in the bag, yikes sis)   So if you eat the whole pineapple or the whole bag of grapes, it's worth looking at the calorie counts.",False,False

Unfortunately it's hard to give exact statistics on calories in fresh produce because they can vary depending on the size or even the harvest.,False,False

If you are really concerned with the number of calories, look at My Fitness Pal or Carb Manager.  Remember to subtract fiber.  In my opinion, fruit calories can add up quickly.  I try to keep my diet low-carb though...",False,False
