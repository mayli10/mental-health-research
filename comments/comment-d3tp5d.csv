But other times, yeah, people can display poor self-awareness when choosing to comment, and I'm sorry you've had to deal with that.   However, it's a good thing that you can identify that as a trigger, and recognize that this community isn't healthy for you right now. Do you have any support resources that are less triggering than EDanon? Can we help find a healthier space for you?",False,False

My ed makes me feel like an impostor because of my weight and makes me feel like a failure because because I feel like underweight people are better at being ""sick/anorexic "" than I am because of a stupid number.  I have to keep telling myself that the number doesn't matter,  I am just as sick/anorexic as those underweight because I am having health problems due to my ED and weight loss that underweight people have. I am hypotensive, anemic, borderline bradycardia and have started having episodes where I want to pass out.",False,False
