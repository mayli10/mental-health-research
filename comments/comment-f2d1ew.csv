Your body is prob trying to take control because you're not giving the nutrients it needs to sustain its physical health. If you haven't been restricting, it's likely because you're not taking care of your mental health as well as you should be.   Step 2. (I can't fucking stress this enough) Don't fucking restrict/overexecise/purge to compensate for the binge.   Fucking. Stop. It.   Unless you actually enjoy continually punishing yourself trapped inside the the binge &gt; restrict &gt; binge or binge &gt; purge &gt; restrict cycles.   Step 3. Think about what you binged on and why.   Did you over consume ""bad"" foods? Did you gorge yourself while you were zoned out in front the TV? Was it because of boredom? Was it because you were stressed? What triggered the binge? Write down a list of things you're feeling. Related to the binge (including before the binge) and in general.   Were you actually hungry before the binge? Again, see #2 in relation to this. Were you overeating or were you just eating and your dumb ED brain kicked in to scream that you were eating too much, which caused you to start compulsively binge because ""fuck it, we're already eating, let's just go balls to the wall""?   Step 4: Write down another list of alternative actions you could take if you feel another binge coming on.  Figure out what things prevent you from binging (not in terms of what helps you restrict, see #2 - just what helps you stop/keep from binging). For me it's things like video games, hiking, journaling, yoga, getting out of the house in general, talking to my bf, going to a dance class, or taking a bath/shower.  Step 5. Wait. If you feel an urge coming on again, refer to the lists you just wrote.",False,False
