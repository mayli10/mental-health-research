I just wanted him to love me. After he found out, he felt bad for awhile and told me he loved me (it worked, I thought!). Then he cheated on. Twice. If he doesn't love you by now, he won't. It's him, not you. He is getting something from you and that's all he wants, or else he'd look deeper. Sorry. You deserve better.",False,False
