Whether that be go on a walk, call a parent/grandparent/ aunt/uncle/someone you dont talk to often and catching up for a while, asking a friend to come study with you. This will sounds stupid. But just dont purge. If you go into the bathroom and kneel in front of the toilet, take a breath and tell yourself, every time I purge, the physical symptoms get worse. Every time I purge, the next binge will be harder to resist. Every time I purge, the next purge will be harder to resist.   It isnt easy. But you *want* to stop purging and that will make all the difference. You are stronger than this. I believe in you &lt;3",False,False

Thatâ€™s really the best and most effective thing you could do. Once you stop purging most of the physical side effects go away. Get a good enamel strengthening toothpaste and floss floss floss. Try to be gentle to yourself because stress and anxiety really only trigger the urges to binge or purge even more;;,False,False

Also if you have burns from acid or the inside of your mouth is irritated in general, salt will help it heal sooner. It may hurt but it helps in the long run. If it feels like your lips or throat is swelling you need to go to a profession of some kinds. I don't know where you live, but when I lived in Germany they had these things that are like don't ask don't tell clinics. You go get treatment you and as long as they don't think you'll die in the next few days they'll release you no questions asked. You can always look into this for your area. As for your cheeks, you can try rubbing eggs on them. It sounds silly but it works. (Also I mean like an uncracked egg, you can just put it back after you're done) Don't use the ice after the salt as that will make the burn worse if you use them together. I'd also treat your fingers if you used them to purge, as the acid will kill your nail health as well as can cause blisters so be careful with that. Another thing that might help with the swelling is Aleo, Your body is probably reacting to constantly being sick, mixed with trying to cure itself from the overexposure to stomach acid. I think you will be fine but of course if the swelling gets worse or doesn't go down within the next few days I would DEFINITELY go to a doctor or hospital of some kind as that's never a good sign. I hope this helped and I hope nothing is too bad\~",False,False
