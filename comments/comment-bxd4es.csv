I feel distant from everything so nothing makes me as sad as it used to. I used to cry over nothing and now I feel like it really doesn't matter and I don't care. Which is great because I haven't cried in forever, I just wish I could actually focus on something and not be so antsy all the time.",False,True

Effexor works on serotonin/norepinephrine and Wellbutrin works on dopamine and norepinephrine.   It really depends on your brain chemistry to which one makes you lose your appetite. Low serotonin can induce food cravings (mainly sweet foods, carby things) as carbs trigger insulin and insulin improves serotonin transport thus increasing serotonin levels for a short amount of time. However, if you have too much serotonin from medication, it can have the opposite effect and make you tired and sleepy thus decreasing energy expenditure (which makes you gain weight easier, because your body is burning less calories).  Dopamine/norepinephrine (but mainly the norepinephrine) lowers appetite because its a stimulant (it stimulates the nervous system) and stimulants generally lower appetite. Ever heard of people saying they lose their appetite when stressed? Thats because stress hormones have the same effect. They increase your so called â€˜fight or flightâ€™ mode and make you lose your appetite by stimulating the nervous system.  Also food triggers dopamine release (main reason why food you enjoy is addicting) and if your body already has more dopamine (from the medication) you wont crave the dopamine hit as much.",False,False
