Generous of you... I just assume they're a holier-than-thou one-upper XD,False,False

Just because someone doesn't have the body type I find *most* attractive doesn't mean I won't think she is hot.",False,False

That covers a whole range of “types” for me tho. Anybody can look good if they know how to execute their preferred style properly.,False,False

I was in a two year relationship with a person I thought was super ugly. As a result our physical relationship was basically non-existent (and I'm suppeeerrr physical).  I don't think there's a problem with having a type as long as you don't think there's something inherently wrong with people who don't fit your type. Like I prefer short people. When I see someone who's 6'4"" I'm not like ewww what the fuck is wrong with that person. I'm like I'm sure some people would think they're gorgeous, but I'm just not that person.",False,False

It's likely to be the first thing that attracts you to a person, or vice versa. We all have preferences, and there's nothing wrong with that, but in my opinion, it shows a lack of class to be vocally disgusted by people who you find unattractive. I think this subreddit tries to move away from saying 'X body type is attractive/unattractive' because it's not a helpful addition to the healing process.",False,False

I’ve noticed people in this sub discouraging that people are only attracted to us at our LWs, but I don’t think I’ve seen any other body gatekeeping.",False,False

I guess the problem for me is that I find lots of people attractive and maybe that isn't the case for other people, so when they say that their SO has to be attractive it really is much more superficial than it seems to me. I feel like only 10% of people are legitimately unattractive, and even that may be kind of high.",False,True

I also totally understand a man of that caliber will want an attractive wife not only physically but intellectually.",False,False
