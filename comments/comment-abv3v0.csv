I’ve lost about 30lbs between Sept - Dec, and the way family and friends and colleagues are validating my weight loss is both amazing and fucking awful. I feel you on the “how fat was I before?” :( because now I feel an even bigger urgency to maintain and continue to lose weight - maintain that “sexy body” my friends keep saying to me. Even when I look in the mirror and see my thigh gap disappearing because holiday binges were real. Maybe it’s because I’m short so every inch fat is seen/felt.   I follow so many body posi people ..I’m a joke 😭. One half tells me to love my body and accept it. The other half is chastising it.   There’s two of me. And right now, the latter is winning. By society and my own understanding skinny me is prettier and more worthy of life. Period.  ",False,False
