Body check spaces, regardless of the intent behind them, always become toxic war zones.   They inspire people to compete with eachother. And after this, comes the flexing. Then there will always be someone who gets exposed for editing their pictures causing these big divides between people.  And, I honestly can't stress this enough, people from emaciation fetish forums will *almost* always leak in. Remember when that lad from that emaciation fetish subreddit (which for obvious reasons I wont name) started lurking around here looking for pictures? Yikes  r/EDAnonymous is honestly the most supportive, rationable, comforting place for eating disorder support I've ever crossed. Not once have I seen the kind of bullshit that goes down on MPA or Tumblr. Don't make the same mistakes they did.",False,False
