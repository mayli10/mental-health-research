Thanks for the health tips mother dear, but I prefer this over looking like you. When I drop dead tomorrow from my single diet soda, don't bother coming to the funeral.",False,False

People with a certain disease get tummy aches after having anything with aspartame. Sucralose, the next most common artificial sweetener, has also been well-studied compared to many other food items, though not quite as much as aspartame. It's also been deemed safe for consumption.",False,False

Like another poster said, the ED would harm me before anything else does.   Even health foods are studied and analyzed and considered ""unhealthy"". It's. like every food is super healthy the next week and then dangerous the next, because they can't stop with their lame studies lol   It's expensive but I really like monkfruit. Not because I'm afraid of artificial sweeteners (nothing like an ice cold diet coke!) it's just that it tastes a lot like real sugar to me.",False,False
