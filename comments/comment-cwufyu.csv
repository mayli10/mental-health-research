My doctor thought I had an overactive thyroid because she was shocked that I could be almost underweight but eating so much (went from restricting earlier this year to just eating whatever but feeling shitty about it for about 3 months a while back - was still counting cals - went from 95 lbs to 105 after the first month and just maintained 105). Thyroid turned out to be entirely normal.,False,False

Thisll change when my classes start again though, I usually carry quest bars and or popcorn and or a low cal meal of like veggies and shirataki noodles and a thermos of tea at school. I'm restricting 500 and under right now but it is not gonna last lmao. I'm 5'11"" so 1,000 is pretty low for me and I'll probably need to do that for school.   I rarely rarely rarely fast. As others said, it makes me bingey. When I have, Ive capped it at 48 hours and stuck to water, coffee, broth, and tea during, and still took my meds and vitamins.   If you can nip your c/sing in the bud I'd encourage you to do so!! It can fuck up your stomach long term.",False,False

I don't eat at work and its a hit or miss if I do when I get home. I know its mad bad for me but its almost like unconscious restricting and then. I just sometimes fill the calories with alcohol because I'm a really healthy human being,False,False

I don't exercise but I have a high BMR and can maintain a BMI of 18.6 eating 2300-3000+ cals a day. If I'm fasting I'm only drinking water or 0 cal drinks, my longest fast was about 48 hrs.",False,False
