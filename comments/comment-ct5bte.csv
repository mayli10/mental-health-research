One time my ex tracked my phone when I was bingeing and he was so sick of it that he was like, ‚ÄúWhat else do you want?‚Äù And I said, ‚ÄúDonuts‚Äù. And he drove me and bought my donuts, and said I had to eat them with him, and he literally watched me binge while he ate like two (he was an ex bulimic). I thought that would be my low point, but it wasn‚Äôt lmao  I know how you feel about the catharsis though. As much as I hate bingeing, I must admit, the first few bites actually are somewhat blissful. It‚Äôs almost as if I *want* to binge then. For instance, today, my first donut was a jelly-filled donut, and I thought, ‚ÄúOh my god this is fucking delicious.‚Äù I then moved on to a cake donut, and ate half, before most of the euphoria went away and then I had to continue bingeing out of punishment. And of course, bingeing is my coping mechanism, to block out my pains. I‚Äôm going through a break up with the aforementioned ex, and the pain of bingeing is welcomed in lieu of the pain of missing him. Even when I‚Äôm restricting though, often times, I leave room in my plan for little bites of sweets, and I‚Äôm always looking forward to them. But I suppose that‚Äôs why I have a bingeing problem instead of a restricting one &gt;.&lt;  I don‚Äôt know whether I love or hate food tbh  Actually, I think I love food and hate fat &gt;.&lt; :/ it‚Äôs just a shame they‚Äôre contradictory",False,True

It was cathartic for us. I don't think normal people see junk food in the light we do. For us, junk food is like a guy that we bang that we know we shouldn't bang but we do anyway even though it's toxic. Total love/hate.
