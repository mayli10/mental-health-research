People didn’t leave their houses.   ...except me who of course needed that Taco Bell binge like I need air in my lungs. So I got in my car and drove to Taco Bell,  ordered $45 dollars worth of shit (obviously) and when I got to the window to pay, I said “Obviously the only person in the group without all-wheel drive gets sent to pick up everyone’s food. *rolls eyes* Anyways can you put 4 sets of silverware in the bag thanks bye. ” Proceeded to drive to Dairy Queen and do the same thing. Nearly got stuck in the snow 5 times but who cares, I had my food to keep me company.   Fuck me. 😂",False,False
