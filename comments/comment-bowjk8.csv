The self checkout at the shops here have a video feed on the monitor, so you have to see yourself if you want to make sure the price scanned right.

Glad you'll get to see him again soon.  We usually spoon and he holds my stomach or a boob. Boob is fine (they're the one thing I like about the weight gain. I'll actually be kind of sad to see them go but sacrifices must be made), stomach is a major no. I usually end up lying awake until I'm sure he's heavily asleep before rolling him over.

My face looks the most decent (even pretty sometimes???) in my bathroom mirror at home. I look skinnier in some mirrors on campus, fatter in others.  I can walk into two different bathrooms and go from looking dry and dehydrated to greasy and puffy. Its maddening!",False,False

Thank you for asking :) It was a long time coming for me studying abroad, and my boyfriend was the one driving me to do it because he knows it's what I've always wanted.

I can't imagine being that far away from my boyfriend for that long, but I have a friend who's doing a year abroad 2000 miles away and she and her boyfriend are doing well despite the time difference and distance. I hope it's working out well for you too.  It doesn't help that mine is a cuddler too, so I usually end up waiting for him to fall asleep while staving off a panic attack and then prying his hands off me and rolling him away because I can't stand for him to touch my stomach or my arm or anything because it just makes me hyper aware of all the fat...",False,False
