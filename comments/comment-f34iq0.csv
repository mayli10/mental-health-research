So you don't have to worry about looking weird.   Another option, if you're only akward about telling the server in front of your friend, maybe you could pretend to go to the toilets right after the server came to take your order, run after him and tell him that you forgot to tell him you don't want the cheese or dressing (and bullshit something about being lactose intolerant because he doesn't know you don't have allergies).  Or as the other comments say, simply ask for the dressing on the side (which is pretty normal) and pretend that the cheese is weird in front of your friends.  And as a last option but I know it's the hardest one, you can try to enjoy yourself. One meal with cheese and dressing won't make you gain anything I promise.  Whatever you chose to do, I hope you can enjoy yourself tomorrow !",False,False
