Just because I was skinny everyone  always thought it was ok to comment on my eating habits and sometimes force me to eat in public. The overweight middle aged women were the worst.  Imagine if they actually found out I have restrictive behaviors? They would rip me apart.   I’m scared of people noticing me eat. I haven’t told anyone, not even my spouse of therapist. I hate the idea of being watched. ",False,False
