In fact I silently lapped them up. They helped me to get sicker and I wanted that.   Im recovering atm and I try to manage my own triggers, I don‚Äôt want them censored. Imo it‚Äôs not recovery if I‚Äôm only living inside the ‚Äûsafe space‚Äú bubble. If I don‚Äôt like it, I try to ignore, or focus on why I‚Äôm allowing myself to get triggered.   Throw your triggers at me, I can take it lmao üòâ",False,False

I don't understand why you and op are so uncomfortable saying that it's because they were more insecure because they weren't even close to being as skinny as they wanted to be while the skinniest people were more aware of how underweight they were,False,False

I don't get why that's strange, that part seems obvious to me.",False,False

Unless they had severe body dismorphia the ‚Äúskinnier‚Äù people knew how scrawny they were and therefore they were happier with their weight than the ones who weren‚Äôt as deep into ana (that doesnt mean they were gonna stop starving themselves).,False,False

Like someone just saying ""oh your eating today"" while I ate lunch at work was bad. Or seeing my bony hands while I worked made me think about restricting. Hell, just having to stop to eat made me feel weak for having to do so. I never said anything about things being triggering to anyone though. Now that I'm actively restricting the ED voice is damn  near silent. I feel like trash all the time but no thoughts.  If someone is trying to be ok with putting on weight then it makes sense that they would be easily triggered since just existing in there current body is triggering.",False,False
