The transition from restrictive ED to genuine BED is, in my experience, pretty rare - which doesn't change anything but it's just a thought (and yes, I know someone will reply saying ""it happened to me"". I am not denying or invalidating your experiences, people)",False,True

Though that might just be evidence of lacking adequate emotional support in the effort to physically recover- reframing the mental response, as you said.",False,False
