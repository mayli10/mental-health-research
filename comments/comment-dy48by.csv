Then thaw, then press. It's how I got over my aversion to it.  -Morningstar chikn meal starter strips. Higher protein and lower cal.  -Veggies. -Protein powder.

I ate cold raw tofu at work the other day because Iâ€™m disgusting. That didnâ€™t feel strong at all...  it felt embarassing   But you can at least put soy sauce, garlic, and sriracha on the tofu and sautÃ© it in a pan for a bit. Itâ€™s good :)  Besides that I do a lot of soy or pea protein drinks. Theyâ€™re around &gt;!100cals!&lt; each and 2 a day gets me my recommended protein",False,False

It is delicious cold (you can top it with roe, scallions, fresh ginger, avocado, sambal). I make a sauce out of one tbsp tamari/soy sauce (you could do liquid aminos instead for more protein) and 1/2 tsp toasted sesame oil.   Some other ways to eat tofu: silken tofu in miso soup, add tofu cubes to vegetarian Tom yum, Tom kha, or Soto ayam. Make gado gado (Indonesian mixed cooked and raw vegetable and protein salad) and use pb2 for the dressing.   Iâ€™m not sure about the calorie profile of tempeh, but I like it baked in a tamarind/sweet soy sauce glaze.   Other decent sources of protein are egg whites, Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, and farmerâ€™s cheese. I get sick from low fat dairy though so it is sadly not in my repertoire.   Explore cuisine has an edamame spaghetti that is very high in protein. Trader Joeâ€™s lentil sedanini are also fairly high in protein, but the macros of the edamame spaghetti are better.",False,False
