I'm very small-breasted and while I'm cisgender, feeling womanly and feminine is something I really struggle with because I feel like I don't 'deserve' to be like that and was forced into the the role of a son as a child, including being repeatedly misgendered from a young age. So, hearing people describe people describe it as having a 'boyish' figure hits me so hard because it feels like another confirmation that I am too awful to deserve a beautiful, womanly body and that I'm back with my crazy family trying to convince me I'm a boy. I'm a lot closer to understanding that my body is just as womanly as any other person who identifies that way, but it's not 100% and seeing that kind of attitude on this sub (given that 99% of the time this place is so loving and uplifting) made me really sad.",False,False
