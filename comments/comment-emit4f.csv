fds8oto,t3_emit4f,t3_emit4f,Illogicalbiologist,1,2020-01-10 16:54:46,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/emit4f/_/fds8oto/,I had to write a letter addressed to my eating disorder the other day and they tried to get me to give it a human name. I tried to use my own name because its legit just me? But *apparently* that‚Äôs not okayüôÑ sometimes treatment is condescending as fuck.,False,False
