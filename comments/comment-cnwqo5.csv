Writing how much I’ve lost, how much I’ve got to go, making graphs and shit. Totally obsessive but fun time sink. The weigh in is the best part of my day, I even weigh myself during the day and at night so the buildup is even better and it probs triggers me into wanting to continue to fast...  BUT ITS SO BORING. You fuckin said it with the binging, like at least that’s something you know? Plus like that massive surge of good brain chemicals- serotonin? Dopamine? Whichever- coming in with the planning of a binge and following through with it. I mean it’s terrible after, I’ll feel so full I think my stomachs about to burst  Fasting is more peaceful than my past of binging and purging and to me it’s less......... damaging? But something chaotic and broken in me misses the fucked it cycle B/P gave me.   I just want results now. No waiting around.   Thank god for YouTube and mukbangs",False,True

I don't think I ever have like had so much energy fasting that I clean the entire house bc that's a bit much for me when I have 0 energy but I definitely get that high and euphoria. But I also get the depression - although that may have more to do with my actual depression? But not eating certainly doesn't help. Either way it sucks bc eventually I just get so bored I feel like my brain is crumbling. At least when I'm in a binge cycle I have some kind of entertainment and fleeting moment of enjoyment...I still would rather fast though (obviously). Torture &amp; boredom &gt; torture &amp; weight gain any day lol. Although I do spend about 30% of my time while fasting on doing the numbers thing - on a dry erase board, on my notes app, on 4 different notebooks...idk, makes me feel like I'm accomplishing something. Really the only highlight of the day during fasting is the weigh-in and getting to cross off more numbers. And occasionally feeling skinny but I don't typically feel that way until a lot of pounds disappear since I am a logical person unfortunately and realize that all of that loss isn't all fat.",False,False

I literally have no one to talk to about this shit so it’s nice to have this subreddit and get to hear from people that are in the same shit as me",False,True

I'm trying to fill my time with TV or video games or reading this sub but I feel like everyday I'm just waiting for next morning's weigh in. On the bright side I'm finally feeling vague excitement to wake up the next day... on the not as bright side, it's for all the wrong reasons",False,False
