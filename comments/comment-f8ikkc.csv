I use it to weight light envelopes I ship as well. This uses AAA batteries (comes with a set) and comes with a adapter which is awesome.  https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00U667TV6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1,False,False

Amazon has good ones or $30. I subtract 5%-10% of what my fitbit says for calories burned and I eat accordingly. Track that for 2 weeks and see how much weigh I lost.  &amp;#x200B;  My caloric intake is very accurate with a scale. I will slowly know. My cardo is almost similar every time I do it as well.,False,False
