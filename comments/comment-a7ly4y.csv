I am an empathetic, ""highly sensitive"" person (sounds like such a snowflake way to describe oneself, I know, but it comes with a lot of undesirable problems that I've struggled to address via psychiatry... as I imagine you might relate). I think a lot about the bleak outlook of climate change, microplastics in the ocean, chemicals leeching out of household goods, antibiotic resistance, basically the end of the world...  I also tend put off thinking about my own future by fixating on food and weight instead. Like, I need to focus on losing weight *first* before I get my financial life in order, etc. However -- I have already lost weight... a lot of weight... and I feel no less ready or inclined to deal with anything. I wonder what would happen if I did reach some sort of stopping point? What then? Would I have to actually live my life?",False,False

I know it's escapism/distraction from my own problems, but yeah, I've always been over sensitive to suffering and injustice in the world.  But then I get times when I hate myself for being so self absorbed and not doing things like volunteer work and feeling self pity when I have a roof over my head and the basics that a lot don't have...it's a vicious circle, but 100% agree with you.

I'm an escapist with many exit routes when I need check out of the world, from writing, to random hookups, to weed, to booze, and, of course, to hunger highs and binging and purging. I turn to the toilet just as often as I turn to astrology and music.   Lately I've been trying to use that to convince myself to be healthier.

I think I'm addicted to escaping. Usually it's cannabis, but I'm unemployed and on the job hunt so I can't risk failing a drug screen. I've been drinking much more than usual, but the calories freak me out so I turn to sleeping pills and OTC medication and occasional benzos.    I haven't been truly satisfied with my life in so long.
