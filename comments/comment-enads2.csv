I got invited to a pot luck this weekend and I considered it for a moment but I'm really not going to go and eat food in a group and drink beer (gag) especially since my ex is going and he's the reason this whole thing started up again  So yes, I have been spending an increasing amount of time alone in my room and only maintain regular contact with one person who doesn't even know whats going on and I'm nowhere near ready to tell her",False,False

Apparently it was an awesome party and I feel like shit for not hanging out with everyone but I physically cannot be sober around such large amounts of food or I will binge.,False,False

I've already written it up, but am still not ready to take the plunge.  I don't know what the solution is. It's something i wanted to ask too.",False,False
