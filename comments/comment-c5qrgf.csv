If you haven't stopped already, stop counting calories. I've been more or less in this exact position—where I was able to diet normally at one point—and there are just times when the bar for relapse is lower. I can't really explain why.  &amp;#x200B;  Last year I relapsed hard at a really exciting point in my life and nearly ruined my relationship, lost contact with everything non-appearance related that I like about myself, etc. etc. all the good ole E.D. stuff. I stopped seeing my therapist slightly before, which maybe played a role, but I felt so stable before that it's hard to believe just that would cause a relapse. It was really insidious and happened fast. You deserve to not be sick regardless of how you look.",False,False

But it's with fun stuff, like camping, summer sports, DnD with friends, weekend trips with my husband, etc.   The first time, I was in my first year of uni. It was definitely challenging but it started the same way as this time, healthy weight loss that snowballed into snacking on ice chips and doing cardio for an hour because I ate 4 perogies the previous day.   Life is really good, my relationship is super solid, work is going great, I'm in school part time but it's very chill and I'm doing awesome in my courses. I'm financially set and can pretty much enjoy anything I want.   I'm feeling once again just obsessed with weight loss and being thin. My self esteem is not doing well at all, despite lots of compliments and positive reinforcement.",False,True
