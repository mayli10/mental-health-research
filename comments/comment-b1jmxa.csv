Generally even when I'm eating one meal a day or restricting I don't feel too many negative effects. Drinking lots of water and making sure I have electrolytes helps a lot. I also try to make sure I'm still getting enough vitamins and minerals from what food I am eating. ,False,False

I also eat really high volumes of foods that are low in calories but not processed. So just large servings of vegetables that don’t amount to many calories. Eating a ‘healthy’ high volume diet seems to keep my body happy and not as foggy. That’s what’s keeps me going. There was an initial hump I had to get over that was pretty difficult. ,False,False
