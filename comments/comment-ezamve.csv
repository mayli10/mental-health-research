I’ve been eating more for my boyfriend as he got so worried when I was really ill and I’ve been feeling less ill now. I don’t know how much longer I can keep going like this so I’m bound to end up restricting harder and ill again though...  If I ever do get ill like that again I don’t think I’ll ever go to hospital since they’ll tell me Mum why I went there as I’m only 16. I’ll remember to try and buy some pedialyte although I don’t think I’ll ever use the carnation breakfast essentials. I’m glad it helped you during your pregnancy and I hope it worked out well for you. :3,False,True

I’m not that ill luckily, I don’t need the doctors or anything. I got completely better after I ate something so you don’t have to worry either.  It’s been hours since then and I can feel myself starting to feel more ill though... most of the symptoms are more minor but I’m so much colder it’s unbearable, and I can’t get warm at all. But never mind, as I’ve learned my lesson about posting about feeling ill. If I tell people everyone panics so I’ll try and avoid doing that in future. Yesterday I just needed someone as my boyfriend was away and I had to tell someone how sick I felt.  I’m just so cold now... I’ve been cold basically all day but it’s so bad now... so much worse even than earlier...",False,True
