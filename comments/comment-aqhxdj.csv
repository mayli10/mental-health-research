My nutritionist seemed to agree the reason I wasn’t gaining weight at first was bc I was eating too much fat. I wasn’t getting enough calories as fat is so filling and reduces appetite I felt comfortable on 1500 (my macros used to be over 45% fat). I’ve increased carbs and lo and behold it’s easy to go over 2000 and I’m gaining weight! I’ve actually reduced nuts intake since I started gaining.,False,False
