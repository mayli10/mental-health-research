I hate shopping for clothing and turn from the more chill ass pleasant person to a level 10 raging bitch after spending about 3 min in a retail store. Normally I shop alone.   For some reason I do the same thing. Like obviously my girlfriend has randomly decided to call me a whale by insinuating i would look cute in a baggy sweater right? Or openly mocking me if she suggests something skimpy? /s ,False,False

Hes always been super supportive of my goals in a *healthy* way. It's sad cause he thinks I've stopped purging but in actuality I've just mastered the art of being silent. ,False,True

I'm sure he didn't mean that in any insulting way, just trying to find a solution that would make you feel better without making you feel like you need to lose any weight",False,False
