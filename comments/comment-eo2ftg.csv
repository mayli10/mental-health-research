Its hard enough having a mental illness and balancing schoolwork at the same time. My second year of university I failed 2 classes and had to drop them, and got mediocre grades in the other few I was taking. I still ended up being admitted as a transfer to my dream school because I applied myself in other areas. One bad score here and there won’t kill your chances at a good career :)",False,False

A ton of my peers are failing their classes also. One of my classmates took the ACT test and scored an 11 XD (really really horrible) lol,False,False

A while ago, I decided to apply for the US National Guard and I began exercising and eating more,  after a month of getting straight, I was disqualified from enlisting because I had cancer as a child. I wanted to relapse so BAD! (I didn’t because I made so much mental progress.)  Oof, hopefully you still pass or something to that extent, School can be rough",False,False
