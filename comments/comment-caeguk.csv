I know muscle can weigh more but she just has a pretty normal body type (like not overly toned or anything). I guess my mind just insisted she must be like 100 pounds because she works out.,False,False

HOW. even when i‚Äôm UW my brain insists i‚Äôm chubby around the waist and flabby on my butt and i wish i could snap out of it",False,True

Then I moved 500 miles away and I'm consistently one of the thinnest around lol. My body dysmorphia made a lot of sense once I moved; LA promotes a certain type of toxic vanity.",False,False

You're kind of just expected to go to the gym regularly and care about what you eat a lot.  Everyone has a tub of protein powder in their apt and everyone is on some kind of diet. If you go out drinking.. you get the skinny vodka drink on an empty stomach and then hit the gym in the morning to work off your hangover.  Casual clothes here aren't sweats, it's athletic wear... bc I guess if you're not dolled up you have to imply you're gonna go to the gym later or something lol.

Or is it really just healthy eating and hard workouts? I've always been envious of the idea that some people just get skinny naturally and are happy as they lose weight but maybe that's not the case...?,False,False

I moved from NY to East Asia and I was considered quite thin by most people's standards but when I moved here, I wasn't considered thin anymore. I was called ""chubby"". I went from a size S to a size XXL just because of how they size clothing here (I haven't gained any weight). I could easily find clothes back home but now I have to be careful where I shop.
