So if you're drinking zero calorie fizzy drinks, you're introducing gasses that can cause stomach grumbles. It also happens from swallowing air. You also have bacteria in your digestive tract that releases its own gas when it consumes certain foods. They are unique  to each person and rely more on you being perceptive in what foods make you feel bloated/gassy.  Unfortunately it's a very unique thing with little in terms of concrete help other than avoiding fizz.",False,False
