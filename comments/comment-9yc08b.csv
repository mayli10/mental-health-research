I'm absolutely crazy. ,False,False

The typical stuff that's difficult for ED folks to grasp, eating a varied, nutritious diet, a reasonable exercise routine, probably even other forms of stress-reduction and self-care.  If you feel you can stay in your weight range then I really do think it's a good idea to try to maintain instead of going lower. They have TDEE calculators online that estimate how many calories you need, I would suggest slowly upping your calories to maintenance level. If you have a nutritionist or dietitian to help you with this, that's even better. ",False,False

When I was fat weight he thought I looked ""the best I've ever looked"" meanwhile I wanted to LITERALLY tear my skin off. Now I'm back in safe weight and he tells me ""sweetie I don't care as long as you're healthy"" ..... So what does that mean tho??? Skinny? Eating the right food? What's the right food????? I quit carbs and sugar and I don't eat more than 1300 Calories ever.  Running? cause I'm great at running! Flexible okay I'm very flexible!    BUT THEN sometimes he hugs me and says wow you're so thin. And I'm like FUCK YEAH wait if I'm skinnier would it be better or is that too much? Cause really really I can stay here at this range. But... I can go skinnier.    Help someone please tell me what to do lol. ",False,False

I've been in recovery/relapse cycles for far too long so I get how it feels, both the improvement in mood and mindset and that inevitable desire to return to the disorder. It happens to us all at some point or another, triggers are everywhere. That's awesome that despite them you are continuing to do what is best for YOU, it shows great strength. ",False,False

I also cannot believe how little I think about food and I can be around tasty food and not binge on it... it's fucking crazy. Somehow though I'm feeling this seduction about getting back to being scary thin and feel bad that I ""wasted"" being even thinner (none of my family saw me a few months ago when I was really at my worst both in mood and face).

Sometimes I would ask people if they could explain what they mean by ""healthy"" and it's generally not weight-related, they moreso notice color in the face, shiny hair, bright eyes, more energetic demeanor, etc. But the ED mindset twists it into ""You're getting fat and everyone notices."" ðŸ˜–",False,False
