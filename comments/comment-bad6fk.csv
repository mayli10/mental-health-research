I guess since I don't eat food I haven't logged beforehand it keeps it in check so I don't eat more than I planned to but has the side effect of making it hard to discern feelings.,False,True

There are soooo many different ways people have of determining this for themselves so you might wanna do some googling or whatever, but for me I have to feel out if it’s “stomach hunger” or “mouth hunger”. Stomach hunger is pretty quickly satisfied (since I’ve shrunk my stomach down to the size of a garden pea) but my mouth hunger is constantly ravenous and if it’s in charge I could eat ad infinitum.

I put my height and weight in a spoiler tag and wrote TW next to it.  Yeah—I think the stress and crappy emotions could have to do with it; I mean I haven't been really sleeping regularly lately and I have had to work on an assignment for a really stressful college class.

I don't have any advice on how to get rid of the feeling, but, if this is any comfort, it went away for me on it's own after a couple of weeks.   I just had to accept how hungry I was for a couple of weeks and just ate more than normal - the important thing is just not to let feeling constantly hungry turn into eating a bunch of junk food. I just ate extra relatively healthy snacks until my body got over whatever it was doing and went back to not feeling hungry all the time. I think if I ate a bunch of junk I would have gotten used to that and kept eating more even when my body re-adjusted, but I am a huge sucker for sweets/junk so maybe that isn't a problem for you.
