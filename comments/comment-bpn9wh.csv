It's so upsetting that eating when I'm not hungry turns me into a ravenous black hole monster, and!! It happens no matter what I eat or how much. I can suck down the kitchen and still be desperately hungry. I really do hate it.",False,False

It just give my subconscious brain the green light to eat everything in sight. Damn, thinking about it, I think my only safe processed food are protein bars and shakes.   I don't think you're greedy. That food is designed to taste good and entice people to eat it over other food.",False,False

When you eat just a bite, you are raising your blood glucose levels. Insulin increases and hormones (leptin and ghrelin) are telling your brain to increase/decrease appetite. Appetite is important from a biological standpoint to get the body to eat food.  When you aren’t eating, let’s say you are sleeping, your body has no need to raise blood sugar levels since there is no food coming in. So appetite is tucked away until you eat food again.",False,False
