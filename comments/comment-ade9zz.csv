I don't think either is right or wrong; probably depends on the person. But what worked for me was ""eat whatever the hell you want as long as you gain weight"". Gradually I branched out more. It took a really long time. But it was very important in my recovery that I was in charge of as much as I could possibly be in charge of, and the weight gain was the most critical thing to address, so no one cared how I did it.

Broth and apples will not restore weight or provide adequate nutrition. I know that may sound harsh and I apologize but I‚Äôve been there and that is not maximum, stepping outside your comfort zone, fuck-this-disorder-I-won‚Äôt-let-it-win determination and effort.  B) is too much too soon and risks making the disorder worse and/or relapse.  There‚Äôs a middle ground, going at your own pace, baby steps, slowly building yourself up to something like normal behavior, but pushing yourself a little outside your comfort zone. This is what I‚Äôm doing and it‚Äôs working for me. Most days I eat surplus calories, some days maintenance bc I‚Äôve got to go at my own pace so I don‚Äôt freak out. As long as the weight doesn‚Äôt go back down, I consider it successful.  Having said that who knows, maybe I‚Äôm still batshit crazy and full of shit üòè but I‚Äôm weight restoring and feeling ok with it inside (which is more important than the weight restoration imo) so it seems not the case. Ofc everyone‚Äôs different too and there‚Äôs no one-fits-all solution for this complex disorder.",False,False
