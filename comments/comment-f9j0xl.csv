Both situations are bad and i didnt realize i was making it sound like i was jealous, so my bad on that part. It should be more ""i wish we could all eat normally"" instead of ""i wish i could restrict/i wish i could eat more"".  Thanks for your input! I agree about EDs being hell regardless. Best wishes to you.",False,True

And it escalates really fast. I eat maybe every two days and then when I do have a “proper” meal it’s salad and my daily intake is still way fucking lower than I need. I’m also gonna be in the hospital soon if this keeps up (which it will). I hate food and the experience of eating has become such a sad and upsetting practice for me. I can’t tell you enough how bad life’s gotten even tho I’m “”skinny”” now.   I will never be ok eating ever again and that’s not something I’d wish on an enemy. So try not to “grass is greener” restriction if you can help it.   Your situation also blows tho and I’m sorry you’re going through it. It’s not a worse deal- just a different one. I’m not jealous of you and you shouldn’t be jealous of me. EDs are literal Hell.,False,False
