I didn't even pay any attention to his body, he just had a perfectly proportionate face, flattering haircut and glasses that fit everything else flawlessly. I instantly felt like a potato in comparison, and my brain's way of coping with that is to lose more weight.  It literally makes no sense because I'm already underweight, but I guess on a deeper psychological level it helps me cope and gives me some hope for the future. Like it's temporarily okay for me to be inadequate and look worse than somebody else as long as I'm actively losing weight and *\~working towards a better me\~*.",False,False
