Of course, the shorts cling to your legs when wet, but it’s still better than typical swimwear. Plus it protects you from the sun if you’re outdoors.",False,False

I haven't been in a bikini for years before, because I couldn't handle being that ashamed of my half-naked body in front of others. But I decided to give it a try.   I wear board shorts instead of a normal bikini-bottom (not knee-length, but it covers my whole butt) and still cross my arms in front of my tummy to hide it when I walk to the pool, but as soon as I'm in the pool, noone can really see the body and I can focus on swimming. Times flies when I bring a friend and chat a little while swimming. I also completely forget about my body dysmorphia... When I get out of  the pool, I hurry to the changing room, but I still feel way better about myself in general.   During summer there are  almost NO people at  the indoor pool, because everybody is outside, especially in the evening. At first it took me an hour for 1km, but now it just takes like 35-40min, sometimes less. When  you  go more  often, you'll notice that around some times the pool will be almost empty.  And that's when I go :D  And yes, there are girls or boys that are better looking, thinner, more beautiful, etc., and I feel awful when they look at   me, BUT in summer I'd also see them on the street in shorts  and a croptop and feel like shit. Also the majority of people there isn't those super hot celebrity-look-alikes. I became way more accepting with my body since I see those average / overweight people regularly wearing their bikinis in confidence, showing (normal!) cellulite, a few fat rolls or other  ""flaws"". The majority  of people doesn't  give a shit.",False,False
