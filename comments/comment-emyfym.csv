I kinda had to start with talking about how I had no idea how to talk about any of that and build up from there lol.   I think it does come naturally to some people and that's maybe a normal to strive for. but also that if you grow up not talking about your emotions and issues and/or having to be Fine at all times, it's normal *considering the circumstances* to have a hella difficult time doing those things sans practice.",False,False
