It would be helpful if you could put in a TW that your thoughts may be triggering though.",False,False

I think especially with ortho, because everybody seems to understand that bulimia is unhealthy, it's obvious, but orthorexics can keep their actual fear and distress hidden and pretend that they love all the clean foods their eating and get labelled as a ""health nut"", and it becomes your identity to all of your friends, so then when you eat things that used to be against the rules it you get nervous that people are going to call you out.  But if it helps, the non-ED people in your life definitely aren't not thinking badly of you for it. They're probably thinking, oh thank god I don't have to feel guilty eating processed food around Y/N anymore. And I guess it's true that a lot of ED people have competitive thoughts and compare themselves like you said, but that says more about them than you.  You deserve recovery. We all do.",False,False

I used to look at other people’s ED tumblrs and hope they got fat. It’s all lies your disease whispers in your ear: everyone is laughing behind your back, waiting for you to fail. But they aren’t, most people are either in your corner or aren’t paying attention to you unless they’re disordered too. When I recovered, I started seeing other people with more empathy as well as myself.",False,False

I understand needing to vent but this is a shared space full of vulnerable people and you need to be respectful of others consider how your words can impact them.  You should probably delete this.,False,False
