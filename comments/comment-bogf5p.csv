Physically all you have to do is eat. If you saw a doctor they'd be able to tell you when, how much, and what, but if that isn't going to happen you'll have to wing it.",False,False

Even if you were not a minor. At this point, it may be advisable to go voluntarily, because there's a risk of re feeding syndrome.   If you are still in a caloric deficit, your body may begin to start digesting your cardiac tissue to keep your brain functioning.",False,False

Your heart could give out any minute. Lunar is right, voluntary is so much better. If you wait until you pass out or have a heart attack, you will be rushed to a hospital and then be involuntarily committed. Please get help now, before that happens. You are scarily close to death.

If you experience these symptoms (those associated with refeeding syndrome) you absolutely must seek medical care. It will not be possible to manage them at home and could very probably result in your death-   - fatigue  - weakness  - partial or complete paralysis   - confusion  - difficulty breathing   -high blood pressure (which might feel like a strong pulse in your head and is often accompanied by dizziness or swelling of the hands and feet)   - seizures  - heart arrhythmias (fluttering, skipped beats, rapid or slow beats, pounding feeling in the chest)",False,False

Talk to an adult, someone at school or a doctor. At such a low BMI, a small electrolyte imbalance could put you into a coma, or your heart could give out.

Having been there myself it's a little personal so i had to say *something.*   Small chest pains can mean big problems. I only get little flutters even when I'm knocking on heaven's door so to speak. I get the confusion between am i dying/is this anxiety, because I too am subject to both, but really you only get one life so it's nothing to gamble with. Going to the ER over a panic attack is far preferable to going to the morgue for what was actually a heart attack.   I'm by no means a doctor or a nutritionist, but just speaking from my own experience, at first it's *so* much easier to have liquids than solids and to have high-calorie/low volume foods (kind of the opposite of what we usually eat). You might not realize it while you're still starving, but your body has adapted to that nutritional level and won't really be able to cope well with a normal load of food to digest. You'll have to help it out a little- smoothies, nuts and nut butters, nutrition shakes (Ensure or a generic version is the best- it's actually what they give to us during inpatient stays to supplement solid nutrition. If you don't want to explain it to your caretakers just say you're having indigestion or want a quick grab-and-go breakfast. whatever it takes to get what you need).   It won't be easy. It won't be comfortable. I don't say any of that to discourage you- just to let you know that anyone who has come back from such a dangerous situation has had to go through those feelings too- and that even when it feels ugly regaining your strength is one of the most beautiful things on this Earth. You need it. You deserve it. You are alive and this are entitled to remain alive.   You gotta fight for your life because that really is what's on the line here.   I don't know you but i'm rooting for you &lt;3",False,False

I was hospitalized with a BMI of 12.9 four or five years ago.   With a BMI that low it doesn't even matter anymore if you're a minor or not.   It is an acute threat to your life and that alone is grounds for a legally sanctioned, unwilling hospital stay.   I want to stress though that it isn't actually safe to refeed from such a low weight and that hospitalization is the safest bet for you. It's even more dangerous to remain at such a low BMI, though, so if you are completely unwilling to or unable to seek professional health, eating more on your own is the best bet. Either way your heart is liable to stop at any moment, though. Your life is worth so much more than a number on the scale even if it doesn't feel like it.   And, a voluntary psych stay is far more pleasant than an involuntary psych stay.   I wish you best of luck and I hope you can be brave enough to ask for help. It will be given to you. You will be taken seriously because this is a very serious situation.   I know that absolutely no one can *make* someone recover. And you don't have to completely. But if you want to continue to live you do have to gain some weight.   Please stay safe hun. Please.",False,False
