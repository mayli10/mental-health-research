You're in uni, it's a stressful time and your weight fluctuating is nothing to get too hung up on. I know it sounds like a broken record at this point, but a clean diet, exercise, and patience is all you need if you want to lose the extra weight while not falling into these terrible habits you'll regret later. Try thinking of why you've shifted your diet from eating healthier to more of whatever this term - is it stress or deadlines? Finding a better coping mechanism than food is what helped me break out of eating junk food all the time (I'm in uni too). You've got this! Feel free to DM me if you need any advice or if you want to vent \^\^",False,False
