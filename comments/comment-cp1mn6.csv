The ones that have electrodes for the hands too are usually more accurate, more expensive too. But even if they’re not accurate, it’s somewhat of an indicator for fluctuations",False,False

I have one that’s pretty accurate, but the most accurate ways to measure are with a callipers, water displacement, or a DEXA scan. Try one/a few of those to compare and then you’ll know how much you can trust your scale.",False,False

If your dehydrated, you’re less conductive, and the scale assumes it’s because you have fat (which is low conductance) instead of less water (high conductance, but a double negative. TLDR: if you’re dehydrated it thinks you have a high BF% even if you don’t.",False,False

I get a body composition scan done monthly at my gym. Most nice gyms have the machines to do it. Most will also do it for you for free.,False,False
