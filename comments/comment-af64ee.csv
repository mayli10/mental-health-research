Do you *know* for sure they wouldn’t support you getting help? I know that culturally some families are resistant to acknowledging mental health issues, which would be a very difficult situation.

There are usually phone, text, and online chat options. Sometimes they can only talk for so long, but you can always call again and talk to another person.   I’ve also had plenty of times where I’ve walked into my local ER and said I need a mental health evaluation. (Believe me, doing this is better than coming later in an ambulance because I waited too long and the crisis actually happened.) Sometimes I’ve been admitted, and while it’s not super fun, having a few days in a safe environment is sometimes what I need. Plus they can quickly get you set up with a therapist and med provider if you need that/are interested.  Like the slam poet Neil Hilborn said, “I’m so lucky we lived through who we were to become who we are.”  It’s luck/chance/the sense of humor of some fickle god that I’ve stayed alive long enough to see my mental health improve. I was suicidal nearly every day for a pretty long time. And now most days I’m not. And it’s not like everything is sunshine and puppies and unicorns with glitter poop, but I feel like maybe I’ve got a chance at a contented life.  I know that when you’re in the dark and when just being conscious feels painful...there’s not much I can say to help. I’m sorry that the hurt is so great right now. I hope you will reach out for support so that you can live through this and find out what is on the other side. All the best. &lt;3",False,False
