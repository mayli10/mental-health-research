I have another idea - would caloric liquids feel safer in the AM than food? My ED-food-rules sometimes are such that steamed soymilk, or yogurt, is okay but solid food is not. One way for you to introduce AM ""food"" might be a liquid. Or a popsicle (I'm in love with popsicles). A popsicle in the AM isn't ideal but it's also not nothing. Second idea - you could decide ""I will try X suggestion for a day and re-evaluate."" That can be a lot less scary than going from no food in the morning to food every morning. Anyway, keep us updated, and I'm also here for you if you want to talk.",False,False

You're right- I AM always thinking about food. Perhaps learning to eat in the morning would actually help me to think about food less.   I just want to stop bingeing, just like you.  &amp;#x200B;  Let me know if you ever need to talk.",False,True

If you ever need to chat, let me know. I totally understand.   Eating in private is such a weird feeling. I know when I'm trying to hide it. I know when someone leaves the room I'm already thinking of running to the pantry. I hate it.",False,True

I think it would be unrealistic to think you could just follow her advice right away, it takes so long to change your behaviours. Would it be possible for you to try to follow her advice for like a week, and see if it could help with the binging? What is the worst thing that could happen/do you have anything to lose? You can allways go back to your old behaviours if you want. I know it's super hard to break old behavious, and it's so easy for them to creep back, but I think you should be proud of you for getting help, that's more than many can do &lt;3.",False,False

Why are you thinking about food - like fantasizing over stuff you won't let yourself eat? Thinking about food because you are hungry? It sounds like you're thinking about food 24/7 now so can you describe more about how eating in the AM makes you think about food more? Are you willing to eat more in the afternoon or evening? FWIW I am in a similar place in that I'm at a healthy weight, lean, muscular, gorgeous body, so I get that. I'd also like to stop bingeing :P",False,False

Self-sabotage is real.  This person may be trying to help you in a way that isnt helpful just now. We dont have EDs because we dont know how to eat....we have EDs for a whole host of other complicated reasons. Telling someone only ""just do this and you will be fine!"" fails to address the difficulties which put you there in the first place.  You have already started taking steps, the next is to continue to be as honest as you can be. If ""just eat a snack and some protein in the morning"" doesnt work for you, tell your therapist and tell them why. Even when you dont know exactly why things are difficult, telling your therapist that is an important step. It is their job to help you sort out these thoughts and feelings but they dont know about what you dont tell them.  It is okay to say, ""I couldn't do what you suggested because it was too overwhelming."" In fact, you NEED to share those things to make progress. Any therapist worth their salt is going to praise you for being honest with yourself and help you find a new strategy which helps you.",False,False
