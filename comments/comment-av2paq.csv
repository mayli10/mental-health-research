I bet they don't hone in on specific features as much or allow small imperfections to overtake their feelings about the rest of themselves. My old friends never voiced the level of specificity about insecurities that I did. They would say they felt *too big* while I would say I felt too big in the thighs, waist, feet, etc. I don't know, really. Maybe it's all just pathology, like the plastic surgery repeat offender vs. the one timer. ",False,False

That is part of growing up. I did to, in middel school i disliked my body because i thought i was fat, then i started working out and once i got a slight 6 pack i eased off a bit and made sure i ate healthy.  This wont work for everyone  But sticking to the hate is unhealthy, but when people do stick to it, it is ofter because of a disorder. ",False,False

I honestly dont believe anyone if they say they like their body. Like my own insecurities lead me to believe that there are exactly zero people who like their body,False,False

I figured since I felt that way my whole life, other people must too? Idk.",False,False
