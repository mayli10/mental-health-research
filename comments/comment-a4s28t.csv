You definitely aren’t going to gain weight from 1200 per day and you’ll probably have way more energy!  Don’t get discouraged if the scale acts weird today, changing up your calories can make you retain water for a bit.  Good luck !",False,False

I always think the same thing when I think about increasing calories and it's been really hard recently but I just have to think of it as a means to stay focused for the things I have to get done. It's not going to be easy but it will be worth it and you won't gain any fat from 1200, especially if you exercise even a little bit.",False,False

I know it probably feels really uncomfortable, but you will be just fine. It's also very courageous of you to be willing to try and up your calories a little. You can do this though, and you'll definitely be okay. You're helping your brain and body function properly by getting the nutrients you need. ",False,False
