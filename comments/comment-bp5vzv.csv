Thank you for your kind words, I really appreciate them. Itâ€™s crazy just how a slight deviation from your plan can just ruin everything?! Roommates are kinda annoying, but at least itâ€™s an extra layer of control because you canâ€™t make cookies and pizza and milkshakes. Well, not as easily anyway.",False,True

Definitely violates rules.  That being said, I am so so sorry that you're struggling with binging so much. Before I lived on my own (which will be ending soon thanks to roommates), I was the same way. A single unplanned thing, and the whole day was off. And like, it's impossible to not eat the thing offered to you because even its presence messes up the mental plan I have for the day surrounding food",False,False
