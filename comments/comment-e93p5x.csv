Weighed myself, and I‚Äôm less than 1kg up- I‚Äôd noticed I was overeating, but neglected that I was climbing up mountains and castles and stuff, so I was burning more calories too!",False,False

(for a visual: i ate an apple, then i ate 1/8 block of tofu, then another 1/8 block, then another 1/8 block, then a serving of nuts... it takes a while.) then snap a pic lmao. behavioral, spend an hour of my FREE time - not work, ect - doing something non-food, exercise, or body centric, like drawing or going out with friends. i've been totally obsessed and i didn't realize that until i started trying to find what i DO with my time when i'm relaxing and all i do, legitimately, is exercise for as much time as is available, eat to fuel exercise (when i'm doing good), then read and watch ED, food, or exercise content.",False,False

My whole body and head aches from laying on my uncomfortable mattress for two whole days only to get up to grab comfort food. Today I said fuck it and got out of bed.
