Sometimes I wish I could cut my arm or leg off so that it wouldn't show up on the scale.   I used to have really long hair but it kept falling out and also I didn't want to add extra weight so I chopped it short.   I want to get lipo so bad but they probably won't let me because you have to be above a certain weight like uhhh hello fat is still fat at any weight.,False,False

I asked my mom what Auntie had done to her, and she told me that doctors sucked the fat off her body. From that moment on I was obsessed with the idea of just removing fat from my body.

Over and over until it was like sun rays of deep swollen grazes. Whilst crying in the shower.   Did it make me feel better in those fat moments? Maybe, it was a good way to externalise the self hatred and panic. But the truth was it was usually work stress or relationship stress that set it off. In those moments it‚Äôs like impossible to have a relative understanding of your fat, your mind just zooms in 1000x on the problem areas, magnifying the curves and not noticing all of the angles that are there too.
