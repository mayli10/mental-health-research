That sounds so fucked up, to try and ease any anger just remind yourself that you both are young but he’s definitely still a child and I don’t want to excuse how he behaved at all because it was not acceptable. Just for your own peace of mind to help maybe not take it so personally. Kids say fucked up things sometimes especially boys ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY LIKE SOMEONE and they try covering themselves so they don’t get shit from their friends later. You’re beautiful and always remember that ❤️",False,False
