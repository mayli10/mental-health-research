And that is 100% fact, so please try to keep that in your head. I would suggest against new body checking (like tape measure) because then you are compensating for one behavior by adding another. Just as unhealthy. I know the struggle of BDD, I've had it literally since my first memory at 4 yrs old. I know how it feels. It seems like each day you dont weigh yourself you look bigger. But try to keep it in your head that it is literally impossible to get bigger when barely eating",False,False

Yes, your dysmorphia is fucking with you. No, you are not crazy.   You have come back from this before and you can do it again. You are allowed to do *what works for you*. You are able to tell your therapist that *they were wrong*. It's **fucking shitty** that this trial and error situation has set you back but it isn't forever. It's also super fucking shitty that you need to advocate for yourself when you're already low, but it will help you.",False,False

I gave my scale to my parents after rehab. I wanted to sell it online but they said we should keep it so I could smash it as a symbol or something. Well, I never smashed it, and now I just have to obsessively measure my waist and shit instead of weighing myself regularly. I know they're both disordered behaviors but as someone who doesn't really want to try recovery again it just makes me more frustrated",False,False

You body checking/weight checking is part of the anxiety. It does give you *temporary* relief, but it is not real relief. If you felt that the scale was reality, you wouldn't have to weigh yourself 4/5 times to confirm for yourself (which is excessive). The scale is apart of the cycle you are caught in, and that is why you are better without it than with it.   One of the problems with scales is that they are not objective. Move them and your weight changes. If they are not calibrated and if they ever move, then it is not a reliable scale. the scale enables your behavior, and it does not help your dysmorphia.   I know right now, it is very tough, I know that it is still close to impossible for me not to weigh myself regularly/obsessively. I have to remind myself that the scale *does* lie, and the scale doesn't know what your body is doing.   I am really sorry you are going through this right now, and i would suggest you talk with your therapist about this, and talk about how you are working through your current anxiety without the scale, they will likely give you some good insights.
