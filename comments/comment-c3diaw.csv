Sometimes I distract from real stress by focusing on the ED. But I might actually deal with the source of stress better and work through it, if I didn't have this ED to project on to. So it's kind of the ED being devious at playing my protective friend. It's not. It just wants to live forever in my brain.   &amp;#x200B;  Sometimes I wouldn't feel stress about other things in the first place, and would take them on the chin if it wasn't for this on going chronic stress I'm dealing with as a result of an ED. But having the ed can make other things harder to deal with. It messes with your perceptions when you're tired, weakened and depleted.",False,False
