There’s absolutely no way you gain 10lbs of fat from a 3 day binge. I went to a wedding in Poland for two weeks, and I would call the whole trip a binge. I was eating every 2 hours. At the wedding itself, I’m pretty sure I’m consumed 10k calories in food and alcohol over 30 hours. When I got back, I was almost 15lb heavier, but a week later, after a few good poops, I was back to the weight I was before my trip.   Don’t fast, it’s not going help. Your digestion will just slow down and you’ll get your poop all impacted in your intestines and you will bloat even more. Don’t eat less than 300 calories below your maintenance. The way to prevent further binging is to reassure your body that it’s not in danger of starving. A calorie deficit above 300 will trigger your body’s “famine alert! Must eat everything in sight while I can” switch. Put on some loose fitting clothes, eat lots of fiber and drink lots of water, and in a few days your body will feel like the binge never even happened.   And yes you should follow that impulse to sign up for a gym. I want to do the same and I’m also intimidated by the fact that I’ve never really seriously worked out before and don’t know how to use the equipment. But google is free. I am looking out beginner strength training workouts and they look doable at home so I plan on doing those and hopefully I’ll have enough confidence to actually tackle the gym once I’ve outgrown those exercises. Let’s start tomorrow?",False,False
