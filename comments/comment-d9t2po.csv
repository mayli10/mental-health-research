Normally I'm coming off a fast too, so I'm gathering up all this food like ""I can totally get through this"". But then I end up in discomfort and have all this food that idk what to do with, because I literally cannot consume much for the following day, two if its really bad. By that point, my planned fasting window has rolled around and I can't eat it even if I wanted to.  My ED would actually be a money saver if I wasn't a dumb bitch who had no sense of my limits.",False,False
