I have serious depression and low self-esteems and that often results in me hating myself... but I have to constantly check myself and remind myself that I AM a good person and a good friend and an amazing girlfriend. I have to not put myself down around my boyfriend because I don’t want him to start thinking those terrible things about me. It’s almost good, in a fake it till you make it kind of way— if I can try to think fewer bad thoughts about myself, they maybe won’t manifest into bad feelings. ",False,False

One thing I've found, and I'm not sure if this will help, but when I'm feeling particularly low about myself, it really helps me to focus on others.

He’d talked about how I need to work on liking myself not just for me but to maintain a healthy relationship with him. Because over time my negativity and questioning towards myself will start to wear at him and he’ll start to wonder if he also has issues/ should be more critical of himself.  It’s weird dating someone who has so much confidence and love towards themselves (in a healthy and non arrogant way).  He used to have self image issues and has since found his own confidence (and can’t really remember how it happened so I don’t really get any answers there 😭) but I think it’s good to be around people who have a different viewpoint. I’ve learned a lot of things from him I probably wouldn’t have learned on my own.,False,False

It was uni time and I was drunk and high and going clubbing and everybody was pissed off with me for making everybody late cause i was too busy sniffing speed and coke because i was so embarrassed (I'm not a club person, I hated my weight and think I am repulsive too), I was kinda hoping they'd go without me. In the end they kinda did. On the way there I stopped a fight between two guys and let the one guy run off and calmed down the other and his girlfriend. Then I met this other guy near a club. He was super hot, I was super high. After nearly getting myself into another fight, this time involving knives, the guy pulled me back and then eventually the two gangs dissipated and nothing bad happened. So he was kinda my knight in shining armour too. I asked him to come to the other club and met my friends and some other people. Then on the way back to our flats me and this guy kissed, a lot. Eventually my friends had to pry us off eachother to get back to the flats but it was amazing cause I never did stuff like that, especially kiss random hot guys who think I'm also hot. But when we all got back to my room (i think maybe he was expecting to be the only one), we spoke and I told him how ugly I thought I was and fat and how I had to get high to get confident and how this never normally happens and how could he be interested in me basically everything you described and later on he left, after kissing me again, gave me his number. Texted me a couple times the next day, and basically never spoke to me again. So yeah. Fun times.   But just learn from it and realise you're obviously not ugly and believe that you can find someone, don't give up just cause some people are dickheads. Just keep being a nice person and if you're losing weight do it for you, and trust the person who comes along, the right person, will love you for your personality cause right now I'm with a guy, it's a trial relationship but I hate myself and he knows I do but he still likes me and doesn't care about my weight or how I feel about myself, he wants to help and make me happy. Just keep the faith. ",False,False

At one point in my life, I was around 170 pounds and I did get lots of attention. I'm still not sure why. I gained more weight and go no attention and then I decided to lose weight which sparked my ED. Now I'm 125-127 and still, no one wants to date me. At this point,  I guess it does have something to do with how much I hate myself but I've been conditioned this way for so long that hating myself is a part of me. I dont know how to not hate myself.

Start with whenever you think something negative about yourself, you also have to come up with two positive things about yourself, even if it feels fake or like a reach at first. I was listening to a psychology podcast the other day, and it was about relationships but it applies to your relationship with yourself too. They said it takes hearing something positive four times to sink in the same as one negative thing. The negative thoughts may always be there to a degree (they are for me, I’m on a treadmill as I write this sooo) but you can work to balance them out more. Just fake it til ya make it, tell yourself you’re someone who loves themselves and follow it up with at least a few winning qualities about yourself. Also if you were once obese and you aren’t anymore, odds are you’re a supremely tough and dedicated person who can tackle this too. Ps get a therapist, they’re super helpful.",False,False

It feels like every person I like has some sort of ED history though, so they all sorta GET it, but most just had disordered behaviours and didn’t really have much of those self-hating thoughts (which I’m glad they didn’t, but I digress) so they got sick of me real quick.

Because then he could be the good guy telling me I was pretty when I didn’t think I was. I don’t think he did it consciously lol. But he was certainly full of himself so I guess it all falls into place.   Similarly to you I got drunk with this guy and cried about how fat and ugly I was and how I used to be skinny and beautiful and now I was fat and worthless.
