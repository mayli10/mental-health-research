The chips and ice-cream comment, I thought she's probably not lying, but that's all she's had. I think my main worry doesn't come from her weight loss itself, but her refusal to say she's dieted, as well as the fact she just doesn't seem to look well.   I feel bad speculating, but I do feel for her. Hope she gets the help she deserves, should she need it.",False,True

Her weight loss does look extreme to me, because I hadn’t watched or seen anything about her for years and she popped up on my Instagram feed looking like half of herself. She’s looking good and happy though, so good for her. I also think it was triggered by the end of her marriage. Maybe she doesn’t eat healthily, but does eat a lot less. At some point in my life, i wanted to eat a desert that was over 300 cal, so I’d eat only that the whole day, it’s everything but healthy, but i still lost weight. Maybe she’s doing something like this.",False,False
