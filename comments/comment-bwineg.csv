It’s not like anyone comes over to my house anymore so I don’t have to worry about people thinking I’m insane because panty hose and mismatched sheets are strewn about my house.,False,True

I need to see if there is a bunch of cat hair stuck to the back of my or see if my outfit really matches or is wrinkly. But the mirror just crushes my soul. Ironically I also choose to decorate with mirrors so everyone where I go in my house I see some sort of reflection :/,False,True

I feel like a Victorian woman in mourning but ut genuinely helps my mental state. I have a large mirror in my room and about 50% of the time I have it covered with a blanket because I cannot STAND to see myself (but I gotta keep it around to make sure my outfits aren't too whack),False,False
