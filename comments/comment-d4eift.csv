We all know that1/3 of people recover, but because of the people we surround ourselves with on the sub and hear about, we think it’s never possible for anyone to recover. I’m glad she’s sharing the narrative that it can happen. Not the bullshit Lifetime movie where they eat one cookie and recover, but the idea of intentional recovery and healing working for some.  Not only that, but I’m so glad she’s fighting back against the bullshit that just because we had EDs, we’re not credible to ever talk about or attempt anything healthy. It’s condescending as shit when people pretend we’re invalid and shit because of our experience, even when people do recover.",False,False
