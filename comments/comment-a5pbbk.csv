I'd say the best ones are Maple Waffle, Birthday Cake, and Chocolate Mocha.   I disagree about the raspberry though. I find it just as filling... but I'm prone to eating it faster due to its sweetness :p ",False,False

I totally understand. 120 is NOT fat, but there are definitely days that I feel huge next to people of all different sizes. Always comparing. But then I have moments of clarity - ugh ed brain. I'm on the lower end of healthy for my weight (used to be 160) and I want to stay forever here, I feel comfort here. But how can I do that if I eat 800.but even at 1500 that's still under what I need... Such a struggle when you think about *being thin enough for help*... I know better but sometimes ed wins even though I know it is and it's just me giving in. The struggle is so real!!  Good luck with your therapist. Eating at maintenance does feel amazing, but its also terrifying. I lost weight with baby steps and so I also encourage recovery and weight gain with baby steps. We can do this! üí™üèª",False,True

I've started with this new therapist and I love how direct she is ""well we're gonna have up figure out how to stop counting CALoRiEs and we're gonna need to figure out why you think being 120 lbs is unbearably fat."" And I've been on a kick about it this whole week and my brain just is ScREamInG I KNOW IT'S NOT FAT BUT IT IS ON ME. I want to recover but I want the feeling of control over my body.
