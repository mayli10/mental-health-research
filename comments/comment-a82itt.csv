I have been into benzos for quite some time. Originally Valium and then Xanax and it really does make you just forget the whole world. Taking it, you just donâ€™t feeeeel like doing anything and  that includes eating. I was taking like idk 4 mg a day- not extreme amounts but enough. Now that Iâ€™m not, definitely eating more. It sucks - the balance of life is hard to maintain. ",False,False

I really appreciate when ppl on here share about the specific substances they struggle with.   You are fighting and struggling because of all the ""positive"" effects of xanax. It feels great to be relaxed and free from anxiety so I can't blame anyone who uses substances to obtain that feeling.  Talking about your choices in life will help you reflect on them and possibly work towards taking steps to change things you identify as harming you. Making posts like this is a great step to committing to being self-aware",False,False

Even if it starts out cheap enough, tolerance builds quickly. I swear that it goes up faster the second time you pick up an old vice, that's how it felt for me, at least. Benzos are so dangerously powerful. You might already know this, but withdrawal can *literally kill you*.  What might be a tempting short term solution will bring you so so much heartache if you allow yourself to give in. Having that temptation around you makes it that much harder, but you have it in you to ignore the siren call.  Future You is depending on Present You!",False,False
