If I know I'm drinking wine at night, I just don't eat all day because I know I'll get the munchies when I start to drink.

This is actually how I kicked off my recovery lol gave me a reason to be stoned all day (every day) and not deal with my mental health, just eat. And then after a few weeks of eating the mental health is getting better too :)   I also had a problem taking constant chops/bizzles/ mokes (weed+tobacco together in the bowl) so I reasoned I couldn't take another until after I had eaten, since nicotine suppresses appetite and I definitely wasn't gonna eat after. Bf's idea but it stuck",False,False
