Can I repost my diatribe I keep posting around here about no-counting carb restriction?  If you like the state of ketosis that such extended fasting induces, carb restriction might actually be a good thing, if you decide that attempting functional recovery (which could be as small of a step as adding an extra eating day) is worth it.",False,False

I used to eat around 700 Cal a day and was always thinking about food. Now that I eat once a week I don't feel hungry or think about food that much.  It is boring not being able to eat but I think it's worth it. The lessening of the food thoughts is reason enough for me to fast.,False,False

It absolutely *is* hard at first. The inclination to eat pops up every few hours, and sometimes follows me around for hours on end.   But it does eventually wear itself out, and your mind kinda ""quiets"" and you can focus on other things. I like that state, when I get there. ",False,False
