I have a BMI that fluctuates 18.5-19 so not even underweight and I can barely fast over 24 hrs and get crazily nauseous (to the point of almost puking) and unable to sleep at all. If you post about it they act like these symptoms are completely weird or mean you have some kind of sickness/illness or deficiency but in my experience it's just because my body really wants me to eat!! I regularly intermittent fast already so I'm used to going w/o food.,False,False

Start slow, fast for 8 hours, after a week start fasting for 12 hours. Increase it slowly and you will be able to fast for a few days.
