I’ve not been binging for the past few days idk something in me snapped or something i’ve been on 500-700 cals a day i’m definitely craving a huge fuck off dominos though lmao. I know realistically i have other things to be proud of but it seems my weight and my stretch marks and my body is all i care about",False,True

And I definitely hate what I see in the mirror. I hope I’m not overstepping but what helps me is to try and focus on stuff that I know I’m happy with/ good at. For example you sounds like a witty and hilarious person (not gonna lie your line about being in a hit collab with a comorbid disorder had me chortling lol who cannot relate). For me I’m not very clever lol but when my bf compliments that I’m hard working or cute it makes me... hate myself less?? So basically even though I hate everything about my appearance and food behaviours, I feel better about myself when I focus on other parts of my life. Other things that help me = brushing my teeth after dinner (when I’m likely to binge), planning pre-portioned evening snacks so I don’t go crazy, and errr being too broke for my binge foods lol.",False,False
