I guess I can try to look at some things and celebrate them as small victories, rather than chastising myself over what I'm not doing.   I have like one person who knows somewhat an extent of how things are, but I don't think I want her knowing anymore because really if I could make it so she didn't know at all, I'd be a lot happier.  Super grateful for internet hugs ðŸ˜Š hopefully I can just get back on track so I'm not sending myself into shitty spirals but we'll see.",False,True

Set the bar low, celebrate small victories (just one day without b/p is a win!), go a bit easier on yourself......I know all of this is way easier said than done, trust me, I know. But it's one of the main things that really helps me get out of a bad cycle. That, and accountability with someone I'm close to, but I know that's not always an option for a lot of people with EDs.   Also have an internet hug!  (&gt; \^\_\^ )&gt; I know this stuff is really hard to go through.",False,False
