I think the killer when it comes to EDs really is the loneliness :( be safe friend.,False,False

I want to purge a lot but I don‚Äôt wanna go down that path.   My boyfriend jusy went on a diet to lose 5 pounds  üôÑbut he doesn‚Äôt understand that I am struggling again.

This week I‚Äôve eaten practically nothing. I‚Äôm quickly slipping back in to anorexia and I‚Äôm too ashamed to open up to anyone irl about it. It‚Äôs been a shitty couple weeks in general that has left me thinking about picking up the bottle again (one of the other issues I have) or suicide. I guess not eating was the ‚Äúbest‚Äù coping method I have available right now but it‚Äôs so fucking embarrassing to be a 30 year old man with an eating disorder that I can‚Äôt talk about it. Sorry I just needed to vent. Anyway I hope your doing alright and hopefully one day we‚Äôll find a way to recover from this shit.",False,False

I keep telling myself I can start over tomorrow. That I need to reel it in and just eat a reasonable amount so I don‚Äôt feel the urge to purge. But you already know how hard that is. I‚Äôve slept for 2-3 hours every day this week. I‚Äôm exhausted. The fact that you‚Äôre managing to get up and go to work is more than enough. I‚Äôm sorry this shit eats at you.,False,False
