Was obese almost all of my life and while all of my problems did not go away by losing weight (and I actually gained a few problems, I‚Äôm posting here after all...) I can assure you so many problems did go away.   Being fat sucks. In every single way you can think. I don‚Äôt really understand the anti-fatphobic angle in the SJW world either, other than the concept of not being mean to fat people just because they are fat. Of course that is valid.  But getting and being fat is absolutely something one should be afraid of or strive against. IT PHYSICALLY HURTS. It is beyond uncomfortable. Physically, socially, mentally, emotionally. If I had never gotten thin I would never have realized just how much it all hurts because it was just my reality.  Because I have seen both sides I can never ever support any kind of HAES/body positive movement that encourages being, getting, or staying fat. I don‚Äôt hate or judge anyone for being fat because I know how and why it happens...I just would never wish it on anyone or tell them their overall quality of life would not improve if they were no longer fat.   I will take my thin ED over my fat ED any day. Both are uncomfortable and unhealthy and unpleasant but life in general is better thin, always.  ",False,False

Who knows whether or not the trend would continue below 121lb but I look pretty ""thin"" by most people's standards at 121lb...so I think yes I am happier when I'm thin.  Also, I'm sorry but this is just being honest, from my corner of the world, the only women who have gotten visibly angry at me in my entire life were overweight women. and I do my best to treat everyone the same so I don't think I provoked that.

Losing 30lbs definitely improved my overall happiness. Getting dressed in the morning and having my clothes all look good on me every day means I can confidently wear whatever I want whenever I want. Getting dressed tends to be one of the first things anyone does in the morning and not feeling confident in something you want to wear can set you into a negative mood for the rest of the day. It's not exactly that wearing something different is such a big deal, it's that if you're in a negative mood you're more likely to keep reacting negatively towards things that happen. Like if you go out to lunch and they get your order slightly wrong you'll probably be okay with that if you had a good morning, but if you had a poor morning you'll probably just feel worse. Losing weight absolutely can make people happier overall. I think the real issue is trying to find the right weight for you. Being too thin comes with it's own problems, but different people at different weights will be happier even if they have to deal with those problems while others will only be happy if they don't have to deal with them. It's a bit more complicated than just saying losing weight makes people happier, but it's also not inaccurate to say that.",False,False
