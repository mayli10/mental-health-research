Commitment usually is more complex. That commenter appears to have had an unusual experience with psychiatry. The vast majority aren’t like that  And I’ve been brought to the hospital by cops before. Nothing like being arrested. And I was in the middle of killing myself so it’s unlikely to ever happen to you,False,False

Being brought to a hospital by law enforcement is not the same as being arrested. Commitment is not the same as criminal proceedings. If you resist they may use force by putting you in cuffs, that’s not being assaulted.   I have worked both sides of this issue, it is much more than “filling out some paperwork.” The majority of commitment referrals are not upheld in court. The decision to have someone on a medical or psychiatric hold is not a decision made lightly by doctors. They are trained to recognize people in crisis. They’re not picking out random people with mental illnesses and locking them up. Your conspiracy theories have no bearing in the real world.  Most of all, shame on your for trying to frighten a child away from getting treatment for a deadly psychiatric disorder.",False,False

How can you acknowledge the existence of forced commitment a paragraph after denying that it exists?  &gt; And mentally ill people do “have a trial” if they’re evaluated by a doctor and found to be a danger to themselves or others and require longer than the typical 72 hour hold for treatment.  False. All it takes it a doctor submitting some paperwork. You *could* theoretically take it to court, but you’d have to wait possibly months and by then the damage is already done most of the time. They only do that if you someone have the resources to get a lawyer and file to have it taken to court.   &gt; Court-ordered mental health commitment is no small understanding, and it doesn’t usually happen until months to years of treatment failure/safety incidents.   You’re confusing forced commitment and forced OP treatment. All is takes for forced commitment is for a doctor to say so, and it happens. Forced OP treatment does actually go to trial and takes more than one little form to be filled out, but with the stigma against mental health and myths about treatment, the judge very rarely rules in the victim’s favor.   Here’s how forced commitment works:   1. Someone reports someone for being mentally ill. It could be a neighbor, a counselor, a stranger on the street, anyone.   2. Police and EMTs “pick the person up” and take them to a hospital. This is what I referred to as being arrested, since it basically is, though in hindsight people who are arrested are afforded more rights (trial, lawyer, no detainment without a charge) so it’s not quite the same. But it is the same in the way that you have no choice and if you resist you will be assaulted.   3. At the hospital, a doctor determines if the person should be let go or imprisoned. This *should* be done by a quick visit with the person, but sometimes the doctor never even lays eyes on them. If the doctor says they should be locked up, they are. No questions asked. There is absolutely no way to fight this. You’re stripped of all of your basic human rights.   4. If a doctor thinks the (adult) person should be held longer than three days, they file some extra paperwork. Lawyers are not offered. Unless you have the knowledge that you can hire a lawyer and money, you have no way to fight this. Even if you do, they can deny you access to a lawyer and/or keep you so sedated that you can’t function well enough to find a lawyer. If you don’t have outside help in this circumstance, there’s absolutely nothing you can do. All of this was under the caveat “if you’re an adult” because if your a minor, like OP likely is, there’s absolutely nothing that she can do if her parents refuse to pay *thousands* of dollars to have her released.",False,False
