It doesn’t usually happen with kids, bc usually I see kids and think ‘ew a kid’ but god I look at old pictures of myself pre puberty (which was only like..4.5 years ago, I was a late bloomer) and fuck, my thighs.   They were so straight. Now I have that curve thing on the top inside? Lmao fuck that shit, I hate that part of my body more than anything else and I want it g o n e ",False,False

I have a separate Instagram specifically for following food / exercise / health accounts, and came across this amazingly fit mother-daughter pair of runners. The daughter is in high school, and I swear she's got to have a body fat percentage in the single digits. I wish I'd had her life when I was her age.  It's really strange to see a skinny young girl who looks like a runway model...and then realize it's the other way around, that it's the models who look like skinny, underdeveloped children in the middle of a preadolescent growth spurt. And yet we worship that degree of thinness in adult female bodies, where it's seen as elegant and refined. Even a lot of men find that look attractive. Pretty messed up.",False,False

For some reason (big trigger warning) I feel that womanly curves are cumbersome and I just want to have those little kid chicken legs and feel so light that I could effortlessly run around and almost fly away from life lol. I associate being super tiny with freedom, almost like if I were able to get rid of all the shape I've gained as I've grown into an adult I'd get a clean fresh start and be too lovable and delicate-looking to elicit people's nastiness, perversions, and bad intentions. I think I developed this fantasy because I'm pretty petite height wise though and so I gravitate towards the carefree, affection-inducing look of young women with childlike bodies. I've never had the ""I want to look like a model"" obsession.",False,False

I'm at the point where I'm comparing to my 12 year old sister. We are basically the same weight (she doesn't weigh but I found out when she told me her weight because she was weighing their new puppy). Also body checks - wishing my thighs were as small as her's. Comparing how far my fingers can go around her bicep compared to mine. She eats well and seems to be well adjusted, and she's really gotten into makeup and her appearance but seems to have decent confidence - though I'm still careful to not make comments or talk about things that might trigger something. I feel so pathetic.",False,False
