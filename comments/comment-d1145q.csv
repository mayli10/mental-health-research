It has the same texture as hummus. I‚Äôm pretty sure the brownie hummus is made from chickpeas just like normal hummus. It‚Äôs 80 calories for 2 tbsps so not terrible. I don‚Äôt know where you live but there‚Äôs a brand in the US called Hope Organics and they just came out with a chocolate dip made from cashews and almonds. They also make hummus so it‚Äôs all in the same area in the store. The chocolate dip straight up tastes like frosting. That‚Äôs why I ate the whole container haha,False,False
