There is a period of time when first starting a medication before it takes it's true effect. This period of time will usually have many side effects. Example, I was put on lexapro for anxiety. Went from sleeping 3-5 hours a night to a minimum of 10, usually up to 14. After that 4-6 week adjustment period, my sleep started to normalize and I could reliably get up to 7 hours.   So, if you just started this med, give it 4-6 weeks before you make any judgements on if it is working. I would HIGHLY suggest keeping a journal tracking symptoms you experience, when you experience them, and for how long. Then, after those 4-6 weeks, if you are still experiencing them, you and your doctor make a decision. If it has helped with the binging, your doctor may keep you on it, because side effects can stay for as long as a year (in my case at least) before you truly adjust. If it hasn't helped with the binging, your doctor will likely change the meds.   Either way, consider keeping a journal of side effects, and also binges, for your doctor to determine its effectiveness. It may feel shitty and uncomfortable to write quantity and times of binges but it can be helpful, especially for you, if you notice amounts or times of binging going down over the long term.  Sorry that was so long! I hope that helped at least somewhat!",False,False
