You're saying that anorexia isn't as bad as bulimia, or binging and purging in general, yet the only examples of *why* it's not as bad are actually about how it's perceived by society in general, not the illness itself. I would agree with you that anorexia is given more of a spotlight in the media, but it's a very warped and unhelpful perception.  The reason you wrote this is that you're putting too much importance on your own need to feel 'validation'. What would make you feel better? If the media started to warp and romanticise *your* life? If *your* ED became the most well-known one? If magically you had 'an anorexic's mind'? How about an anoexic's body - would you like that too? Would you feel more 'valid' if you were visibly sick as well as just sick in your head? And if you magically got all those things, would they make your illness any better? Would you have a lower mortality rate, or be less susceptible to complications from your ED? Maybe you just think anorexics make for better-looking corpses.  I see in your other comment that you have asked at least one anorexic person for tips on restricting, and you were upset when they didn't give you the answers you wanted. Is that what triggered this post? You're jealous that anorexic people are keeping the secret of How To Be Skinny from you? Why do you think they would do that? Is anorexia a super secret club that only the cool kids can get into?  You know absolutely nothing about anorexia except what you've watched on TV.
