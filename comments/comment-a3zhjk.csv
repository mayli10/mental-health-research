I don't know how I ended up on an eating disorder forum, but I might as well share so you guys don't do harm while you're fasting.    Seriously, if you want to get skinny fast WHILE getting healthier mentally and physically then check out 'snake juice' on youtube. (disclaimer, i have absolutely no training or certifications that should lead you to trust me... but seriously, trust me.)",False,False

I’ll definitely try Tylenol, it sounds like the best option so far tbh if powerade 0 doesn’t work. ",False,True

I find tylenol to be more effective for hunger headaches. aspirin is anti-inflammatory but tylenol works on your brain in a legit mysterious way (not completely understood!) that is not really dependent on the cause of the headache. There has even been research that tylenol blunts negative (and positive) emotions.  ,False,False

So on that front you should be okay. The other reason people typically avoid NSAIDS is because they can irritate the stomach lining if taken without food. If you've eaten within 3 hours before taking an aspirin, then that shouldn't be a problem either.  If you know aspirin works for you, I say go for it. If the aspirin alone doesn't work, you can safely stack an appropriate dose of non-NSAID pain killers like Tylenol. I have frequent headaches and tylenol+aspirin usually does the trick for me.  Good luck with your head, hopefully it feels better soon.",False,False
