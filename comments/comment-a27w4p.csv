I feel lucky to have friends who are accepting of the anxiety that I experience and willing to work with me in ways that make me feel more confortable so I dont have to miss out entirely. I would love to get to a point where I dont have to panic over making choices at a restaurant, but idk if that's gonna happen anytime soon. ",False,False

I think it's kind of sad that they don't realize how wrong my food logic is, but its really nice to know that they accept me and my massive anxieties. It helps me feel like I can still go out and hang without feeling pressured and stared at and everything. ",False,False

To the point where one of my best friends sent me the menu of a restaurant ahead of time because she knew I probably wouldn't come if I couldn't plan what I was gonna eat days in advance. But they all have unhealthy relationships with food (they are overweight) so they fail to see this as anything other than preparation to make healthy informed choices. ,False,False
