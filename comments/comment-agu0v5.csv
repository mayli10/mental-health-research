I did try to talk to one of the colleagues I am close with about how our other colleagues behavior was worrisome to me, but also a trigger. I definitely got the impression that she didn't see the need for concern on their part, but I am betting I pick up on someone else's disordered habits more easily because I am familiar with them myself. The problem is they are sort of bragging about it, announcing how many calories they're going to eat, not wanting to feel full, wanting to be more bony...it's like my interior monologue is going through a speaker and it wants to make me scream. Part of me feels also bitter and angry and wants to say, this is nothing to brag about...try eating half that much per day, or doing this for 22 years of your life. And then, of course, I just feel bad for the fact that they feel this way to, albeit a little baffled as to how they're announcing their disordered behavior when I try to hide mine.",False,True

I’ve been trying to deal with being open at work recently so I can give you my thoughts, but I haven’t experienced the same kind of situation.   I think there are a couple of approaches you could take, or a combination of both. You could speak to the colleague you’re close with - something like ‘I’ve noticed that [other colleague] does [behaviour] and it worries me because of [concern about other colleague] but also [impact on me]. I can’t continue to remove myself from the situation every time but I don’t know how to approach her about it. What do you think?’ Then, you could also approach the colleague causing the problem, mention specific examples (this is important) and why they make you concerned about her (I’m assuming gender, sorry!). Concentrate on this rather than yourself and see how it goes. If you feel you can take it further and talk about your own problem or ask her to change her behaviour, go ahead and try it - right then, or at a future point. And if not, you’ve only shown concern and that will hopefully be taken well.   There are good ways to handle difficult conversations and you can google ideas about this, but they’re generally focussed on giving feedback so a bit different to this situation. It’s important to give specific examples and explain the impact.   You say you’re up for a promotion. I think as long as you handle things professionally, calmly and appropriately, nothing should affect that. If the way you’ve dealt with it is raised as part of the promotion process, be prepared to be professional, calm and rational. Think about how you want to talk about the issues you experience with food, if at all, and specifically how/if this affects you at work and how you deal with that, and what support you need. I’ve just done this with a new manager and HR and I’d be happy to talk more about it if that would help.   As a higher level member of staff you will be able to have more say in fostering a culture that doesn’t allow comments and behaviours of any kind that might impact on other staff. In general, any member of staff should feel comfortable speaking openly to colleagues about things like this - but it’s never that easy. ",False,False
