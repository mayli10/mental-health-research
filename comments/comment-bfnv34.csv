I've tried calm harm but found it didn't really help with binges. Distraction techniques don't really work for me. The only thing I've found that works is getting out of the house for the rest of the day but that's not always possible. I'm so sorry to hear that you've been struggling too. The last thing I want is for others to feel pain and struggle too x,False,True

Keep going- it’s cathartic to get it all out ♥️ the nhs is so underfunded at the moment that the wait lists put you through so much shit trying to get better, but please hold on and see what they have to offer. They made me download an app called calmharm and I thought it was incredibly stupid and patronising at first but now I use it to stop my binges, perhaps it could help you? Because my binges are a form of self harm. I really really feel you, I’m in almost exactly the same place as you, obese forever, got down to borderline underweight and then all of a sudden the binge train came through town and splattered me on the rails. I’ve put on 70lbs. I’m so torn up by the amount of weight I’ve gained- it’s a gut wrenching feeling, how much I’ve changed. I’ve waited three years for help but I literally got kicked out by my EMDR therapist for being too unstable lol so. Mindfulness is honestly so useless imo so don’t blame yourself for not having success with it. I’m so so sorry that I don’t have any advice for you or anything but you’re always welcome to message me and vent if you like!",False,False

No therapist or councillor. Sorry again to have reached out. It does help to type all this shit out. Obviously there's more but I'll shut up for the time being.,False,True

I just don't have the determination or motivation. It feels like I need help. Mainly for the accountability aspect. But nobody wants to help. Truly.,False,True

Feels like a stream of consciousness blog of some sorts lol. I've been obese all my life, and I'm finally thin and fit. Now I'm putting all the weight back on in the biggest yoyo of my life so far, feels bad.",False,True

I feel like Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. I have one side of me who wants to focus on improving my running times, fitness, and transitioning, and the other addict side focused on quick pleasures from drinking and b/p.",False,True

I enjoy Yoga, Pilates, and Running. I want to focus on fitness. But I can't. I'm forever locked in this thought cycle. I don't even know what I'm expecting from the NHS. Some magic cure or something. I understand that I need to want to recover. But the determination isnt there. I know I'm influencing my younger sister to develop an ED too. She uses to have ARFID and mentions to my Nan and Mum she hears me being ill in the bathroom. She's started refusing meals and doesn't eat much at all.",False,True

Nobody else deserves to take on board my mental issues. I feel bad because I can clearly tell my mum is fed up with it. Fed up with coming home to find me passed out on the couch with tons of food and booze missing. I've put on at least 15lbs from this endless cycle. Right now my family are at the beach without me because I didn't want to come out with my bloated body. I'm failing at everything, work and university. I've got deadlines due in a couple of days that I haven't worked on due to being occupied with b/p and drinking. It's taking all my willpower right now not to self harm. I've completely lied my way through my private transition. My psychologist thinks I'm mentally stable but that's obviously far from the case. I'm sorry that I responded. As I said nobody else deserves to take on my burdens.",False,True
