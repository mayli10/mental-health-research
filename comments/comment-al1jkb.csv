I apologize for the novel I'm about to type*    While it is quite rare, there ARE some conditions out there that prevent absorption of energy/nutrients into the bloodstream. The digestive system and process of digestion is decently complex and these conditions can interfere with this process at a few different levels.    For example, some diseases (caused by pathogen or genetic mutation) can damage the intestinal walls so that partly digested food can't get through effectively. This would result in most energy/nutrients being lost in waste matter (sorry, I know, tmi).    Who knows what exactly is going on with Ms. Kinoshita, but I would imagine she has some kind of condition interfering with normal digestion.    To be honest, I don't envy her. She has to eat an gnarly amount of food to maintain a steady state (if this is true). Sure, it means she can eat whatever she wants, but I think that would get old very fast. Imagine having to face that terrible after-binge feeling each day. Nonono.    I felt compelled to make this comment. Sorry if it's rambly. I wish anyone who reads this well.",False,False

This is their job - to attract advertisers, partnership and pay their bills. Imagine eating that amount of food. I can only think of the agony and the feeling of sickness, excessive heart burn, farts, nausea..

He seems like the type to do IF and OMAD, though, so that's probably it. Added with sufficient exercise and it technically adds up.

Sometimes he's chill af and seems so easygoing. Other times he's very well spoken and his intelligence is apparent (like in the first Veronica Wang video.) And then there are those times where's just... odd. Case in point: the crying videos, the mental breakdown videos, his excessive exuberance that looks more staged than real upon closer inspection, his dramatics. Don't get me wrong, I'm a mess too so I'm not even saying Nikocado is a ""bad"" guy or something. Just strange, moreso, for lack thereof. I totally get what you mean about the familiarity and closeness feeling, though. Mukbangs can definitely make you feel less lonely if it's done by someone whose personality you enjoy. ",False,True
