It's fucking scary and hard because trying to learn something frantically like this is almost impossible to do. It's hard enough to make a coherent post to Reddit while feeling this way, let alone waiting and hoping someone who knows something about the topic actually responds and helps you.  I literally do an extremely dangerous form of purging now, and there are still 2 things I won't ever touch: laxatives (mostly just because they're absolutely useless haha) and emetics. The risk is just too high with them because if you don't vomit it up, they're extremely toxic to you. It's usually the people who can't finger purge or purge hands-free that have to resort to these methods, and they usually can't conventionally purge because these are the people who *have* stronger stomachs. Of course, I wouldn't advise emetics to anyone because they are unreliable, but pragmatically, ED people who can't be bulimic due to lack of gag reflex (probably like both of us), should probably stay away from these substances most.",False,False

I have never salt purged, but I can imagine what type of pain you're in. Most of the pain will be due to minor/moderate dehydration (more pronounced of a feeling because it's rapid though), so please please please continue drinking water to minimize any amount of cell damage you might sustain. I don't want to scare you, and it shouldn't be too much (like you would probably survive/be okay regardless), but idk, helping your bloodstream become more isotonic again will only help you. I guess what I'I saying is, if your goal is to not just get by but get back to 100%, you gotta keeping drinking that water (to a limit of course, don't chug until you're in extreme pain from that lol). Your thirst will almost definitely kick in by tomorrow morning if you don't though, and probably by later today, so just listen to what your body says/asks forðŸ’• It knows what it needs to maintain homeostasis; you just have to actually understand it and listen to what it says",False,False

After this binge + drinking sips of water the whole hour i feel like iâ€™m carrying 2 kg in my stomach, honestly, i donâ€™t care about numbers i just want to get this pain away.

If you think something is wrong though, do see a doctor.  And please drink more water. I know it hurts, but you need to do it to balance out the hypertonic solution that your cells will shrivel in (the cause of dehydration).  Also, you're going to hold a fuck ton of water weight on the scales tomorrow, so don't freak out about that.",False,False

Stay hydrated and please don't drink that much salt again. If your symptoms worsen, please reach out to go to an urgent care center.

I'm commenting before removing the post because I can see you're in pain. Apparently, that's almost 13,952 mg which is above the Tolerable Upper Limit.  I'm guessing the food mixed with a mega-dose of sodium is causing you pain. A doctor is the only professional that can help give a medical recommendation, but if that's not an option I would rest and definitely stay hydrated with water. Shoot me a message if you want to check in about how you're doing.",False,False
