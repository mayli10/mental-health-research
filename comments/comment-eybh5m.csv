Sometimes i add (one teaspoon of peanut butter) as well as (one teaspoon of honey) and just a little bit of almond milk and coconut chunks.

This was a significant component of why my ED started and still a big part of my restricting now that I’m back struggling with these thoughts/behaviors after a long period of recovery.  I’ve had foods I feel are good choices but even with the best of those I’ve still felt a little...sullied after eating them.   I was so excited the other week when I realized I’ve finally found a food combo that I still feel clean after eating. I’ve NEVER had that. (It’s a particular plain fat-free greek yogurt, a little bit of protein granola, and fresh blueberries.) I’m not sure why this magical thing has happened. Is it the macros? The color? Flavor? No idea but I could cry with gratitude.",False,False
