I want to eat but it's emotion not physical.  2) tightness - I fast often and usually if I properly hydrate, and take in some nominal cal from some liquid fasts or dumb OMADS,  I don't experience pain but just an uncomfortable nadda.    3) serious cramping/pangs. usually if I go beyond 30 H fasting while not being very careful with what I am taking in  I'll feel like shocking pain across my stomach, usually with extreme nausea and back pain. I find this is usually caused by dehydration and messed up blood sugar. if I EVER feel psychical pian I'll literally drink sugar water/honey tea with some no salt (potassium) and sea salt in it. and most of the time it will help a lot. Of course if you are fasting to the point of having real hunger pangs then  you need to ease back into solid food.  for me trying to get down soild foods at this point, I wont be able to keep it down or feel comfortable.",False,False
