Ephedrine is a vasoconstrictor so the little capillaries in your extremities are constricting and causing your hands to get less blood. I would stop taking it if I were you. Don't worry too much though, because it's not yet a problem of your central circulatory system (heart), so it's reversible and will stop when you stop stacking. ",False,False

I'm just surprised I could get something like this without any other real symptoms? I've tried searching for ec stacks and hand discoloration on Reddit and Google and can't find any references of it, especially since my hands aren't getting cold during it. just confusing. but thank you.",False,True
