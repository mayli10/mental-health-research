To add to this after a bit I also just had headaches and heart palpitations. And I was still hungry as hell all the time.   Please be careful, seizures are a real risk when abusing Wellbutrin. Don’t mix it with alcohol. I learned the hard way.",False,False

I'm not a doctor obvi but you may have a tolerance for ADHD meds but Wellbutrin is an antidepressant and a smoking cessation aid so it may take some getting used to ♥️ I hope it helps you though  also it doesn't really feel like speed, it feels like I drank 10 cups of coffee with a mild dopamine hit but that wore off after about a week and I was left with anxiety and insomnia",False,False

I don't find that either suppress my appetite to be honest, but I've never thought about going up to 300mg's because it doesn't seem worth it for a whole host of reasons. I thought when I started each of them it would be a night and day difference but nope, not for me..",False,False
