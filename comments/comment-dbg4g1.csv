P much once I hit a “healthy” weight the flow started to be “normal”. I also had them more often than usual for about 6 months after that (usually my cycle is like one period per 2-3 months, and I started to get them monthly at that point). Then my cycle kind of balanced out to how it always had been.",False,False

You are doing great, and I know recovery can be very challenging. As the period goes, it depends on the person for how long it will take to come back. I was recovered for about two years, and my period was on and off, highly irregular, and usually very light. I eventually went on birth control which regulates my period to every 28 days, and it would last 7 days. However, if you don’t think you are ready mentally to go on birth control, I wouldn’t recommend it. It had my emotions all over the place and took several kinds to find the right form of birth control for me. You could always talk to a doctor/gynecologist if you are worried.",False,False
