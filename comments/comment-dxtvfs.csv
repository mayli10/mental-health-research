I had the same issue, I was a D even at a very low weight, and although they were way smaller than they normally would be at a normal weight, I still qualified for a reduction because your insurance takes your body size into account when they are determining if they are ‚Äútoo big‚Äù or whatever. My consultation was free, they took pics and sent them to my insurance company for me. All I had to do was go in and they called me a couple weeks later saying my insurance had approved me. If surgery is something you want to do I would definitely say it‚Äôs worth a try!!   My breasts were a huge factor in my disordered eating. This all started because I wanted to make them disappear. I still struggle, but it made a huge difference in the level of comfort I felt within my own body",False,False

I wish I had some advice but I'm kinda stuck in the same issues! I've lost a lot of weight, then gained it back (and more), then lost it all again (and more) and honesty my boobs look like weird deflated balloons. The only thing that's made me feel better about them is getting my nipples pierced but obviously that's not for everyone lol.",False,False

In under two years, I went from a rather fit 150 to an out of shape 275. It was a mixture of a ton of medication and coping with food.   Obviously, I didn't die.   Within two years I was back down to 145 (no weight loss surgery).   My lowest was 130, but to get there I stopped eating and now am dealing with hairloss from malnutrition. (for anyone reading it takes THREE years for your hair to be what it was if ever.)   Currently, I'm between 145-150 (I do not own a scale).   My poor body. üò≠   TBH I have a very beautiful face, and so having to explain to men my body is NOT pretty has/is heartbreaking. It's the hardest part. No one has ever acted bothered, they admire my accomplishment.. but to some extent it obviously has to ""effect how they see me"".   My arms were the worst. So bad. I have a 24 inch waist, and had HUGE arm flaps. I couldn't wear clothes that fit because everything had to accommodate my arms. This past May I had my arms done (wrist to arm pit). Even typing this fosters tears of relief. IDGAF, about the multiple feet worth of scars. 11/10 would do again. The surgeon removed less then two pounds of fat, from each arm and skin- overnight I looked like I'd lost 20 pounds.   This January, I'm having a lower body lift and January 2021 I'm having my breasts done.   I currently wear a DD, but have the breast fat of someone whose probably a B/C. My breasts look decades older then my mother's who is almost 70.  Now, after having my arms done- my heart aches knowing I waited a decade to have surgery. Being uncomfortable in my skin consumed my 20s.   I'm typing all this to say sometimes surgery is the only thing that will make you feel like yourself. Sometimes, self acceptance isn't on the plate. Surgery isn't always a slippery slope my saggy legs don't bother me.   This one procedure, may literally change how you see yourself and that's priceless.",False,False
