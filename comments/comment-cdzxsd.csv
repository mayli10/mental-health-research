Otherwise making sure I keep my fluids up and eating small regular meals rather than one big one helps to give me consistent energy.,False,False

My work already knows that I’m never fully functioning 100% because they never see me eat and I work there about 40-50 hours a week.   How I also function is knowing that they’re patient with me and not judging me when they know I’m having brain fog. Stuff like doing things all out of order (think like, make a peanut butter and jelly sandwhich. Put some jelly in between two slices of bread but put the peanut butter on top. Ya. )",False,False
