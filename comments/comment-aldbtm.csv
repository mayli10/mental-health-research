Worse than regular eyelashes. So my dumbass didn’t even wash my hands before I picked it out of my eye, because I just couldn’t even think straight. Then I got pink eye the next day lol it was SO SWOLLEN. I had to call into work for the whole weekend.  ",False,False

I was just having a minor meltdown and needed somewhere to let it out because there were still other people in the office. It's not that bad really, it just felt like hell at the time.  Unfortunately I work with books so we're not allowed any food or drink except water in the office, so I'm sort of stuck until I get home and I ran out of gum. Just trying to make it through the last hour now! Then I'll get home and freak out about the audition...",False,True

Is there anyway you could grab a stick of gum or travel size mouthwash from nearby? That might help with the vomit taste and just make you feel a little better overall. I'd also highly recommend eating something, especially something carby like a piece of naan, as it might help your stomach calm down. I know I binge after purging a lot and a piece of naan usually helps me calm down.   Good luck at your audition today!! I hope you feel better and I just know you're gonna kill that audition",False,False
