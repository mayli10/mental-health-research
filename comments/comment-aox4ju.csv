An ED, unless you're incredibly underweight (I saw a number of professionals with a BMI as low as 14ish and nothing happened. I guess the threshold is absolutely crazy) is not grounds to warrant that on its own. Maybe look up your local mental health laws just to be certain, but I think it'd be okay :) ",False,False

Hiding it won't help. A diagnosis won't really change anything and it's a therapist's job to help you with it, or not help you with it if you're not ready. I've gone to therapy sessions with therapists who knew about my ED and if you don't want to talk about it, they don't make you, just like a handyman isn't going to insist on fixing your AC if you called them to fix you're fridge.",False,False
