Also relationship weight sucks, every time I’m with him I feel comfortable eating more than I should and I try to restrict when I’m not with him but it’s difficult knowing what good GOOD food tastes like",False,False

He does what he can to support me, but I’ve never made it a big deal in our relationship. I don’t utilize most behaviors around him for that reason- I don’t want him involved in what he shouldn’t be. We lived together for almost 2 years, during which that was hard. Now we’re LDR, and this summer we’re going to start doing vanlife. It’s hard and anxiety provoking, but I think being in that position will push me into being more healthy because I can’t sneak much in that environment, nor do I want to have that dynamic.   I consider myself mostly recovered - had a issue with binging almost a year ago- but my AN has been in remission a while and it’s just a habit thing for me (like residual OCD). I’m grateful to have a position  where I’ll be pushed to be genuine, and I don’t want to hide from him- or anybody I love who supports me.",False,False
