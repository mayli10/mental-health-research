(Or at least I did, though we’ve both since quit our jobs. But she’s still in my life as a “mom” and friend.) Also had a work dad. We were a cute little dysfunctional family and I love them both so much.  I’m drunk (I mean...no I’m not it’s 11 am of course I haven’t been drinking) and feel like sharing sooo.  She was my direct supervisor but she caught on pretty quick that I was fucked up (idk if she suspected ED, I was underweight but in remission so not crazy about my food intake, but obv had anxiety and self esteem issues.) I didn’t tell her a lot at first but she knew that I had an abusive mother so she kind of felt the need to step up and nurture me a bit.  Then a bunch of shit happened and she stepped up majorly. My mother came to town and treated me so terribly that I walked into work one day and had a breakdown in work mom’s office begging her to just give me a hug and tell me I’m not a horrible worthless piece of shit. She offered to let me stay with her until my mother left town because she was concerned about my mental and physical safety, but I said no because I thought I could tough it out and didn’t want to impose.   Fast forward to later that night and I called her hysterical begging her to come get me because I couldn’t take any more of bio mom’s abuse. So work mom came and got me in the middle of the night and brought me back to her place. I had a complete breakdown and to this day am not sure exactly what I told her, but I know I told her about my ED history. She knew I couldn’t stomach much because of how upset I was, but she made me foods she used to make for her kids when they were sick. She sat me down the next morning and made sure I ate something. She went to work then came to get me when it was time for my shift. Told my one coworker I trusted that if my mother showed up when work mom wasn’t around, he was to remove her from the building immediately.  After mommy dearest left, I made work mom search under every bed and in every closet before I’d go back into my house. My weight was dropping just from stress, so she’d bring extra food with her every day and make a mini meal for me to have at my desk. She instructed the dining director to give me any food I might ask for at any time. Work dad brought me soup and fruit throughout the day to go with what work mom brought for me.  Work moms (and dads) are the absolute best. I miss mine 😪",False,False

More of a “look at your stash of Diet Coke with disapproval bc all you have for lunch is soda” type of work mom. ,False,False
