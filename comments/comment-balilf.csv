I always get the vegetarian options - the standards are those listed.   My estimate is that, from lowest to highest, they'd be:   * collard greens (gomen) * cabbage (tikil gomen) * mushrooms (engudai tibs, though these aren't standard, they sound good!) * lentils (missir wett) * split peas (ate kik alicha) * chick peas (buticha and shiro) * then last: beets and potatoes (key sir)  You should also know, going in, that ethiopian is eaten by tearing injera (spongy flatbread) and scooping the stews (above.) I'm sure you could also just ask for a fork, but it's half the experience :) ",False,False

It will likely be served on a soft teff flour wrap, if you haven't eaten Ethiopian before.  I hope you have a nice time and enjoy the food.  ",False,False
