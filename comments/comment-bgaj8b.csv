I'm in my first office job and can't believe how much we talk about food and how much cake and doughnuts people bring in for the office. It's such a daily struggle.

I work in a lab so we can't have food at all and it's awesome! I used to work with this group of ladies who went out for Mexican food EVERYDAY (well 5 days a week). Isn't it so nice when people just leave you alone :D Happy for you, hope you love it there!!!",False,False
