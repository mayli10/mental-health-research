I think itâ€™s something like 40% of bulimics are also alcoholics. Love being a part of another statistic lol ðŸ‘Œ,False,False

Sometimes i substitute meals with drinks bc that'll atleast lift my mood/take my mind off things/make me more creative and motivated but the liquid calories in alcohol are a bitch. And i ONLY crave super unhealthy food when i'm drunk and end up binging on crisps or anything fried.  And the next day i feel hungover and wanna treat myself a big breakfast so that isn't helping either. So for now i just stopped drinking completely and i'm doing fine bc i know it saves me a ton of calories and nerves.,False,False

But now theyâ€™re battling it out. Unfortunately, it doesnâ€™t matter who wins because either way, I lose.",False,False
