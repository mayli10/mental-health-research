She's advising someone with an ED history to diet?! I'd get a new therapist or at least tell her how she's triggering you. She might be too uneducated about EDs to realize how inappropriate her care is.,False,False

They want you to come to your own realizations.   I don’t think that she’s encouraging weight loss so much as she’s seeing if you’re going to let the guise of the disorder take hold or if you’re actually doing better.   Does she say things to not count calories and such?  Or does she not talk much about methods?,False,False
