Even if you still *don’t want* to eat, the munchies will give you back an appetite so that you *can* eat more. Plus it’ll take away the pain from eating. If you do this though, go for sativas. They wont give you the munchies as badly and shouldn’t impair you as badly, especially when you build up a bit of a tolerance. Not saying you should go buy weed right now, just sharing what Ive found helped, haha.      And just remember, you are not your illness. Theres way more to you then just having an ED. Maybe you just haven’t found it yet, and the EDs holding you back from finding it. There can be great joy and many new discoveries in recovery &lt;3",False,False

Inpatient support to gain weight will help with the self-hate and anxiety a LOT. It’s absolutely terrifying I know but I know if I didn’t gain some weight and nutrition my brain chemicals wouldn’t have stabilized enough to get me to where I am today- which is back in grad school and not failing classes, unable to concentrate on reading assignments because my brain kept hyper-focusing on food and weight.

I can *kinda* understand not wanting to go see doctors incase something unwanted happens. It was for different reasons, but still made me scared to go back to that specific medical centre.      Also wanted to point out the way the title was worded. *Im not giving you shit for it*, just pointing it out. I know you meant “...2-3 years” as in 2 or 3 years, but using a slash (/) instead of dash (-) means it could also be read as “... two thirds years” as in the fraction 2/3.
