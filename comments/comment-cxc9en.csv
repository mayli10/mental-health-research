I hope you can take some kind of solace knowing you're not alone at this particular moment. I feel like this is a time where you need to focus on you and your disorder as to prevent you from being harm from this heart break. I feel a bit like a hypocrite being obsessed as I am with my own disorder, but we're only human and I'd like you to have that in mind. You're only human and mistakes will happen, but, as it's always been, at the end of the day the only person who is there for you is yourself. I recommend taking this time to reflect on why you want to do this to yourself while also showing yourself some well-deserved love. I'm not an expert, but I hope this helps you maybe a little.",False,False

Personally, when I am extremely sad due to this type of events, I try my best to still be eating healty foods, for example is I don’t feel hungry at all I’ll try to go out with some friends and eat a small piece of good food or drink a smoothie at least. And same thing if I think I want to binge on sugar! I go outside and bring fruits with me. You will have to be very stong the next few months, but if you stay strong (and I know you can) and motivated, you will soon be okay but don’t forget that you are the priority and a breakup is hard thing to go through so you body will probably ask you different things. ❤️ Im sending you a lot of love",False,False
