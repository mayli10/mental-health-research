I have also been surprised that he isn't more concerned. I think he just doesn't know enough to understand how serious/dangerous the behaviors are. But I'm also sorta relieved he doesn't understand so I can get away with it.,False,False

Also I know what you mean but the “but also...”.  The thing is I don’t lie anymore. We have lived together for about 2 yrs and now I just tell him about the urges, he tried to help me, and then I just said I was gonna do it. Did it upstairs where he couldn’t hear. Then come back and he said he was sad I did it but then things were back to normal. Like part of me is like... why doesn’t he care or get mad more (since I’ve done this before a lot... he doesn’t even seemed phased. But then I wouldn’t want him mad at me????)",False,True

Thank god I bought a bath bomb earlier in the day so I just took my bath right after dinner so he wouldn't know I was purging.  He knows I have b/p in the past, does not know I'm struggling with it again, and any time I vomit around him like I'm legitimately sick to my stomach he always assumed I purged so I have to be careful because he will never believe me if he does realize what I'm doing and I try to make an excuse.   I feel bad for lying but also...ugh there is no also. It's just bad.",False,False
