He played it off as an issue of closeness which is fine i guess but he should have at least consulted me in past convos about starting birth control if he didn't want to use condoms.,False,False

Was he TRYING to hurt you or...?? Like from the way you said that to him I can only assume he knows about your ED so...  I commend you for making that effort in the first place though, it was a HUGE first step and it's not your fault it got shot down. As the other user said, there are other ways you could release control. There are apps that you can use to randomise a recipe for you, some of them can even do it based on ingredients you already have. You could also go on another recipe sub here or something and close your eyes and go eenie-meenie lol.  Good luck!!",False,False
