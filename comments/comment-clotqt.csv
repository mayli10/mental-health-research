No one in OP makes you /do/ anything. They‚Äôre just there to talk things out with you and offer support. I haven‚Äôt been feeling ready for ANY of this lol. But I find that just taking the steps means that I have the resources available for when I do feel /ready/ for something. Remember, there‚Äôs a little bit of a wait list. So I would hate for you to really need the resources and then be stuck waiting for a phone call for a few weeks just to get to them. Regardless of what you choose, best of luck!!! üòò",False,True

I would highly recommend them, and they do offer OP for relapse. I would suggest setting up an assessment with them, because there is a bit of a waiting list for OP. It took about a month between my assessment and them being able to set me up with a psych. But they‚Äôre definitely a great place for resources, and I can‚Äôt say enough good things about the people that I‚Äôve worked with there thus far.",False,True

I'm in Seattle and relapsing again but I know it's going to break my partner's heart. I'm not underweight yet so idk if anyone would think I need treatment...,False,False
