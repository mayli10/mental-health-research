It totally sucks. I slept on and off all day and my sleep schedule is now royally fucked (fortunately I can work from home all this week on my own time).   I wasn’t able to do my IF and I gave up tracking calories. I’m calling it a cheat day and hoping that I haven’t done too much damage.",False,True

Please try not to restrict, it only fucks up your progress and you might end up in hospital. If it helps, I had a fever a couple months back and a stomach flu. I dropped 7 pounds in two weeks. Granted, I ended up in the hospital and was kinda extreme, but your body burns sooo many more calories when sick!",False,False
