That thing just throws my brain for a dizzying loop because it's yet another datapoint whose realness I have no clue how to evaluate, but it's a datapoint produced by ScIEncE so *must* be more real than my brain, right? It actually gets my weight spot on from my measurements, but then I don't like how the body looks literally ANYWHERE on the slider. So I feel both confused and despondent. ARgHHghhghgH",False,False
