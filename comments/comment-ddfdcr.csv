Yeah, it was pretty crazy. When I was overeating to the point of vomiting (in 1993) I was oblivious to hunger cues, kept going, for some reason I couldn't stop. I was driven by neuroses that were too complicated for my child brain to understand.  I had a rocky childhood due to family trauma, my health, my Dad's health. Mum didn't care that I was overweight and I was bullied at school. The other parents were opinionated and thought I was an abomination and Mum was crazy. They'd say to their kids ""what is wrong with that mother"" ""her daughter is so fat""  Mum was scatterbrained and there was always some drama around Dad and my older siblings. I didn't have a social conscience or awareness of how I appeared to anyone else throughout the time. It occurred to me later whilst still living in a dysfunctional state.  Paranoia can make you binge and effect your eating habits and body image. So, other mental health. I've had two psychotic episodes as well as an ED and it fed into it. While you're eating (or not eating) a lot of chatter runs through your head and I think it can be impulsive, unconscious or a bi-product of conditioning  My last psychotic episode (in my late 20s) was severe and it lasted a couple of years min and I was hospitalised. It was very traumatic to have both at the same time. By the time I was 19 I was traumatised off scales and couldn't use them for years. I'd been using scales since I was 4 or 5yrs old- they were in the family home",False,False

Overtime though, the body wears it down and learns its tricks and does absolutely everything it can to get sustenance into you. Probably for the best, but it just feels even more hellish, being caught in the middle of it all.
