If you are below 1500 you did not gain weight. It’s water. Restaurant food adds salt to EVERYTHING like I swear to god you order a fruit bowl at a cafe and they probably toss some on top for good measure. Excess sodium hangs onto any and all water it can in your body, and you had four days of it.   You did not gain fat.   Drink a ton of water. Seriously. Like 140 ounces of water, to flush it out. Decaf coffee and tea count too. Weigh yourself in 2 days and you should be back to normal.   Be safe and I’m sending love❤️",False,False
