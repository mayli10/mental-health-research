Bad days happen, and I think this is more to try and stop people punishing themselves and ending up in a vicious cycle, rather than saying your actions don't matter at all.   I know I personally do better if I think of a binge as something I can set behind me and then continue to eat properly after, rather than something I have to restrict for because that just leads to another binge. If I forgive myself and go back to trying to eat mindfully my binges are less frequent. ",False,False

Your actions today don't matter in the long term? Yeah, sure. So, nothing prevents you from repeating them tomorrow... And the day after... And the day after... And so on.
