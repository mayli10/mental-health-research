I have an innate sense of justice and cant stand it when people just blatantly get away with stuff!  However, when I'm pushed to my limit, I'm also very vindictive and have no issue with using any kind of adjectives and observations to call out someone.   If you've been dealing with this for years, god bless you and all your efforts. I would've already had a new job after being fired for ""creating an unsafe work environment"" lmao âœŒ",False,False

The store manager offered a sit down but I honestly have nothing to say to her, I hate confrontation and I don't think that she would even care to hear what I have to say. Funny you should bring up the way she treats customers. There's been quite a few complaints from customers that she is rude and not helpful, which is hysterical to me because she literally acts like she's the best thing since sliced bread. I have no problem taking this higher if my immediate supervisor is acting shady (cause he is). I don't look in her direction, I don't speak to her, I actively tried to avoid her and she is still inserting herself into my life. It's just crazy to me that she thinks I hate her for ""no reason at all"" and acts like the victim when she literally created her own problem. I've dealt with a lot of bs in my life but this takes the fucking cake.  Thanks for taking the time to reply to my post, it means a lot!",False,True

Tell her literally everything and even get your coworkers involved. Bring up her sales and the way she treat customers, even if it's not much. Having a lot of dirt can help your case and at least get her a ""private meeting"" in the managers office.",False,False
