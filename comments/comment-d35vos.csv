I was an 8th grade and after years of disordered eating was finally diagnosed with an eating disorder after a sudden weight loss. I was diagnosed with Anorexia but Orthoroxia would have been a more accurate diagnosis. My bmi was 11.6. I was actually embarrassed of how I looked and felt that I'd lost too much. My body ached constantly and was pulling all sorts of fun tricks on me. I lost feeling in my legs all the time and fainted often. Hair (lanugo) had grown all over my body, and was especially thick over my stomach. I couldn't keep up a conversation with anyone, I was always loosing my train of thought. I could spent minutes trying to remember a common word, and I often did. Where I live, winters are BURTAL and the weather is rarely ever above freezing. -20^(o) F would barely phase the locals, it is so common. Luckily, my hair didn't fall out, but it was brittle and dry-looking. I could barely tolerate existing.   Even though I wanted to gain weight at my lw (and my eating disorder didn't fight my thoughts), I couldn't. My eating disorder had already trapped me in a cage and had complete authority over my eating. I felt I was skinny enough for a brownie, but that wouldn't have stopped my eating disorder from hurling a ""what do you think you're doing, fat fuck?"" my direction if I tried to eat one. Even a baby carrot would have gotten that reaction.  I guess what I'm saying is: reaching your a weight you think is low enough won't dissolve your rules around food. You won't be able to finally eat or feel good about yourself. **The only think that changes is instead of hating yourself for being too large, you hate yourself for being so emaciated.**",False,False

But I donâ€™t want to go lower than my LW if that makes sense. I can logically see that my LW was too low. ED brain tells me I can go lower since others have but Iâ€™m really trying to fight those voices. I remind myself how horrible it was then and how hopeless, useless and burdensome was although I often romanticize it and think it wasnâ€™t that bad.",False,False

I remember seeing pictures from a few years ago of me at my lowest and desperately wanting to go back to that again and not understanding how I still thought I was fat. Now I'm at that weight again and I feel like I look like a whale.,False,False

For every milestone I reach, my brain goes 'yeah, but think of how much better it would be if you were X pounds lower' regardless of how I look to others.",False,False
