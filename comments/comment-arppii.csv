BUT you shouldn't be afraid of continuing to gain. If you feel that your body is pushing you to gain, don't be afraid to let it happen. For a lot of people, complete recovery necessitates going over bmi 20. I strongly disagree with the idea in treatment that a person with an ED should be encouraged to eat as much as they want UP UNTIL bmi 20. then some doctors are like ""ok don't overdo it you don't want to get fat.""  what a horrible line to draw.  recovery is not straight forward. it's very individual. there is no hard right or hard wrong. and finding the balance between restriction/healthy eating and overeating/binging is very difficult.  just be kind to your body, listen to what it wants. don't judge it for what it needs. take good care of it and you will eventually find your healthy balance.",False,False

Just maintain. If you keep gaining you might actually trigger yourself into your old habits again.,False,False

You've done a lot of hard work getting to this BMI, and by all means it's a healthy one. Overshooting could trigger another spiral. Best of luck in recovery :)",False,False
