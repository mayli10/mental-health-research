I swear, on different days, my height will vary from 5’7” to 5’9”! Maybe I’m just not standing completely straight or something is up with my spine or whoever is measuring it is not doing it the same way someone else does it?! If I wear heels though, I generally stand at the same height or just taller than my fiancé or FWB who are both 6’ or slightly above. I don’t know any more.  The mysteries of life.",False,False
