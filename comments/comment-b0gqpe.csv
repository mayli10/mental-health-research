Everyone says it gets better but thats never what you wanna hear. You have tunnel vision NOW. Everything seems impossibly overwhelming NOW. ""It gets better"" is one of those things that doesnt feel real until you're on the other side of it. Depression is such a bitch bc it honestly does make all of your problems feel so impossible to overcome and so heavy and so so fucking stressful. None of my problems seemed fixable until i swallowed an entire handful of pills and then i realized everything could be fixed, but not if i died. High school is bullshit. Dont die until youve lived because high school is NOT living. Theres an entirely different world out there. ""If youre going through hell keep going"". None of the bad shit can last forever. Just hunker down and keep going and know living is worth it and you are worth it 💕 I want you here and so does your boyfriend and everyone on this sub. Were all rooting for you so much. I wouldnt believe that if i was you because when i was you it sounded like bullshit, but i promise you its really really true. You just gotta keep going. ",False,False

Please please find someone qualified to talk to like a therapist or a school counselor. You don’t necessarily have to tell them you’re suicidal or have an eating disorder if you don’t want to, but maybe talking to them about other stresses in your life or your family situation can help you.  All the best ❤️ ",False,False

Breathe. I know you can’t exactly logic away suicidal thoughts, but the best advice I’ve ever gotten was that if you’re seeking relief, relief is an emotion you need to be alive to experience.   Remember “darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.”  If you are in crisis please call 1-800-273-8255 (suicide prevention lifeline) or use their online chat on suicidepreventionlifeline.org or text “start” to 741741 (crisis text line).   You matter SO much. To me and A LOT of people ❤️ praying you feel better soon ❤️",False,False

Shits rough, right?   Best advice I can give is to try and separate the rational from the irrational. to realize that the shity voice in your head that tells you that life's not worth living is fucking wrong.    And keep venting and talking here. It helps.",False,False
