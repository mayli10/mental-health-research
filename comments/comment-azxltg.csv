There was a girl I used to know who loved attention. She wasn't thin but she wasn't big either and to be honest we weren't that close until she had confessed to me one day that she had an ED and said she wouldn't eat and wanted to die.   I suddenly went into mum mode, made sure to check up on her and talked her into getting help. She would go to counselling and would make a big show of trying to eat in front of us but then would ask me to take finish her food all the time which I thought was helping her idk.  One day she seemed pretty upset and I couldn't contact her, she had said she was suicidal and I was worried so I called her sister but she didn't answer either. Now it was the day of the week she should be at the doctors but I was really worried I decided to call the hospital she was at. I googled it, it didn't come up. I googled similar names, nothing came up. Eventually I decided I would Just go to her house to check up on her as she was just two streets away.   Her mum (who was supposed to know about the ED) answered and was very confused when I asked for her. She said she was at dance class like she was every wednesday. Confused I asked about the hospital appointments which was met with more confusion. It wasn't until I was explaining about the ED that the mum told me it didnt exist and called her daughter's dance studio herself to yell at her.  Turns out as one of four children she felt really left out and just wanted attention. She told me she had lied about everything including things like Self harm and suicide attempts because she knew I'd struggled with those things.   Im sure she had some mental illness, but the toll it had taken on my own ED, SH, and anxiety made me so hurt.  ",False,False

I wouldn't outright say I have an ED, but I'd be like, ""I haven't eaten in 6 days"" to my friend and pretend that I am just getting into fasting for health reasons. I would say shit like that because I wanted someone to notice and realize I'm not okay and express concern. I was obviously horrible at asking for what I needed. ",False,False
