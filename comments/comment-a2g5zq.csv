Lozenges (can be) reasonable here - Â£1 or Â£1.50 for a pack of 12, or Â£7 for a pack of 72 and come in 3 strengths and they work for me  I wouldn't recommend starting to use them just as an appetite suppressant, but if the other option is you start smoking cigarettes then they are a better option.  Best plan is pick up a Diet Pepsi and some sugar free, low cal fruity gum ðŸ˜Š",False,False

Got extremely dizzy/lightheaded, started vomiting, had to go to ER. Moral of story- if you DO end up using nicotine gum for appetite suppressing with no initial tolerance- be careful!! ",False,False
