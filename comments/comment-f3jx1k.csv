That makes so much sense. Putting myself in his shoes, I actually get that. I just immediately jumped to him using the word ""heavy"" and me replacing that with a ""*oh my God, I'm fat. He actually thinks I'm fat. I'm not thin enough for him anymore. I'm fat. He really thinks I'm fat.*"" thought process.   You're so right about the validation part. You know how when you're just so *in* your ED that it escapes you sometimes how your normal isn't actually normal? I guess that was part of the problem on my part here. Thank you, this really helped coming from the viewpoint you presented. I'm still upset about it but I'm going to try to remember this to help not feel so horrible about it at least.",False,True

The weight gain may still not be visibly noticeable, but feeling you on top of him may have made him realize and think about what you said earlier. And because he loves you he naturally wants to validate your feelings and automatically did that, before his brain could catch up with the fact that this validation isn‚Äôt the good kind. I would definitely be upset but try not to take it TOO hard. He told you before that the weight gain wasn‚Äôt noticeable and the only reason he did notice it was because it was fresh in his mind.   Weight can be lost, but supportive and loving partners are hard to find. I promise he still loves you and is still attracted to you despite however much weight you gained. I‚Äôm sorry this is sticking with you, but try to be kind to yourself üíù",False,False
