I'm being salty and immature and I'm tired but I also shouldn't be complaining about something so petty and probably unintentional when he made time to visit me in my new state for a week which means I get to spend time with him, *and* he has been paying for everything which means I get to explore cool things in my new state and we've been having a great time for the most part otherwise, so I feel ungrateful/childish for being stung by something so minor, although I didn't let it show except to make a goofy face and say ""Well we did do a lot today."" And he has since apologized for it. Ugh.",False,True
