Every once in a while, I get a fleeting urge, but upping my calories some and employing some of the concepts from the brain over binge podcast really helped me in a lot of ways. I found the binge m/restrict cycle so incredibly miserable that ultimately slower weight loss was worth it for me if it meant ending it.",False,False

The cycle being: restrict &gt; feel deprived &gt; hunger/urge &gt; binge &gt; shame/guilt &gt; optional purge &gt; restrict. This is tricky with an ED obviously. The key is not to over-restrict. If you feel deprived, you have to restrict less or you'll fall into the binge cycle.  This is much easier to type than actually do, though...",False,False

While I'm in the early stages - and I'm not sure if I was binging or whether it was just reactive eating/going through extreme hunger -  mechanical eating has been incredibly helpful so far. At this point, I do my very best to eat three meals and two/three snacks a day with no more than three hours between each meal/snack. Consistency, apparently, is key. Over time, your hunger/satiety cues should hopefully normalise.",False,False
