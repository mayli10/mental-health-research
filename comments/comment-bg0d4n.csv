He went to therapy with you and your mum’s bbq, he obviously cares a lot about you. Just say something to him next time he makes you feel embarrassed or belittled, he probably doesn’t even realize he’s doing it.",False,False

It seems weird to me that in a diagnostic/intake appointment as an adult you would not be alone.  I did have a parent present for my intake appointments when I was a teenager because I had to have them there as a minor.  It doesn’t seem like your bf was there to learn how to be supportive.  It sounds like your bf learned what he needs to do to be supportive and is actively and intentionally doing the exact opposite of what he needs to do to be supportive.  I’m with all these other people who are telling you that he comes across as super controlling.  Seriously.  Does he even know what bulimia even is??  Telling you not to eat things and even telling you how you feel (you aren’t hungry.).  That’s entering into gaslighting territory.  If he really is just a total ass about the ED stuff and not more then maybe you can fix things by imposing boundaries between your recovery and him and getting him to hands off.  But my immediate thought process was why the fuck is a boyfriend present at an outpatient diagnostic appointment?,False,False

How long have you *really* been thinking about ending it? It feels like it's probably been a long time coming.  I'll never tell anyone NOT to break up with a dick, it just sounds like something else is going on. Being inconsiderate about a newly diagnosed mental illness is pretty common. That doesn't make it okay, but it takes some uncomfortable conversations to get everyone on the same page so you can recover. Sometimes that does mean removing toxic people, though.",False,False

Your hair, your ED recovery, that’s all about you, he shouldn’t feel the need to approve/allow your actions. I wouldn’t be able to be in a relationship where I’d feel like I need permission from my SO to do stuff, unless it’s something that you’re doing together or would affect you both.   I also think that you should trust your instincts. If it feels like he’s trying to control you, then he probably is.... but that’s just my 2 cents. I don’t have the whole picture.",False,False

Have an individual part of the session, explain how you are feeling. Then have your bf come in and have her explain to him the nature of eating disorders and how what he's saying and doing isn't helpful. Sometimes when a person doen't understand they can become dismissive- it may not be that he doesnt care, but that he cant empathize and reverts to dismissive or he doesnt want to admit that he doesnt know what to do.  If that doesnt change anything, I'd say you need to think about taking a break until you are more recovered or just cutting ties completely- nothing is worse for an eating disorder than a partner who doesnt understand and triggers you constantly.  Good luck. Dlnt let him belittle you. Believe your body. If you are hungry, eat. And do your best to stop when you reach the point of full but not overfill. And if you go past that point, give yourself some grace and ease. What you're going through is very stressful and it's completely natural to revert to or lean on habits that help you cope, even if they aren't healthy.  I wish you the best, because you deserve it",False,False

Those things he’s saying can be very triggering for someone with an eating disorder. The shear fact that he’s rolling his eyes when you tell him how you feel pretty much means he doesn’t care about them, and sometimes you gotta let go of the people you love when you’re recovering, especially if they become a trigger. I know it’s probably what you don’t really want to hear but it’s just my 2 cents and you can take it with a grain of salt. I would just want you to know that I would break the relationship over that.
