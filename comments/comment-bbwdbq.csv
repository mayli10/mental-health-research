Yesterday I had some dental stuff done and didn't eat anything before hand so by the end of it all the only thing in my stomach was various dental substances that leaked down my throat...

And I even had some chocolate covered pretzel/popcorn mix afterwards!!! I added it all up the best I could and it was equivalent to my BMR, if not a little less... But I still feel so invalid as if having one meal and 2 snacks means I can't have an ED.
