I love my mother because she’s my mom, but I don’t like her at all. I try to give her the benefit of the doubt; that she didn’t know better.   You get some serious props for realizing how you talk about yourself, others, and your daughter will become the way she views reality and herself.  You seem like a good mother.   ",False,False

So many years of my mom saying “You eat to much!” “Stop eating so much! Your wasting all my money!” “EAT! You need to eat! I don’t care if you don’t want to!” while shes dieting or doing her disordered eating habits and pushing all of it onto me as well.      Then there was a bunch of other stuff with being abused, and doing certain drugs (whether willingly or because I was being forced to do them) that definitely made it worse, but I feel like its safe to say that shes the reason it started.",False,False

I'm to the point now where I don't let that kind of speech fly around me - family or not. I have shitty extended family that will say these kind of things and I'll straight up call them out in front of everyone. No food is as delicious as watching them recoil in shock and then the fantastic awkward silence they have to stew in afterwards when you point out that what they're saying makes them an asshole in front of the whole family.,False,False

Your girlfriend’s, and your value isn’t determined by how skinny you are or how you look. If that were even slightly true, we’d have supermodels for doctors and everyone would be depressed due to being so critical of themself",False,False

That is an incredible thing to do, and truly shows how much you care about her. Go you!!  Here's a bit of perspective to help: imagine that horrible dialogue from her aunt, but coming from your own brain, nonstop all day long, or every time you eat or drink, feel hungry, feel self-conscious, see yourself in the mirror or in photos, or accidentally find yourself comparing yourself to other people on the street who are heavier or lighter than you. That's what this mental illness can be like.  Obviously it's different for everyone and there's a spectrum of severity, with peaks and valleys, but I just wanted to help you out a bit more in your quest to understand what this illness is like.   That's just my two cents. ",False,False

That hit me like a ton of bricks after realizing that I speak down to myself and criticize everything I do partly because I grew up hearing it nonstop from my mother. It is so true for me and has made me really think about how I speak and what I say to my baby to build her up rather than tear her down. ,False,False

It's certainly not everything but her aunt sounds a lot like the commentary my brain loves to provide.  &lt;3 it really means a lot to me that there are people willing to browse these subreddits and pay so much attention to understanding what it's like to have an ED.

That's definitely a good representation of part of the struggle, but you experience doesn't encompass everything. I think it's really cool of you to use this shitty moment as an opportunity to empathize with your girlfriend, but don't get all ""I know exactly what you're going through"" from this one experience.
