Iâ€™d been in remission for 2 years, and it seemed (at first) that the baby helped keep me healthy. Iâ€™d almost doubled my weight when pregnant, and didnâ€™t care, I didnâ€™t mind that I had some residual baby weight afterwards. I loved my baby and nothing else mattered. I thought I had beaten my illness. I didnâ€™t know Iâ€™d relapse 6 months later after breastfeeding dropped a tonne of weight. I just have to do what I can. Sheâ€™s 13 now and she and her younger brother are my biggest motivation to keep well, I need to be a good role model at this critical age. But itâ€™s easier said than done, especially after 20+ years ðŸ˜¬",False,False

I've been told that not having children is selfish but I don't think there's anything *more* selfish than giving birth to them knowing damn well that I'll pass EDs and other mental illnesses down to them.,False,False

There are a few reasons Iâ€™m never having kids, but mental illness is definitely one of them. Depression runs strong on my dads side of the family, and eating disorders are hugely hereditable.   If you do have kids or adopt though, your experience means youâ€™ll be well aware of warning signs and hopefully able to address the situation quickly, if not prevent it entirely by raising your child with a strong sense of self, agency, coping strategies etc.",False,False

My entire family has an unhealthy relationship with food. It makes things difficult. I have the best mother in the world, and I don't blame her for my ed, but I certainly picked up on her unhealthy habits that she picked up from her own wonderful mother. I don't believe that having an ed made my mother a bad parent. I do believe that, if you know that you have an ed and want a family, treatment should maybe be a part of that family plan. I don't think that you should exclude motherhood from your future plans if it's something you want and something you could excel at.",False,False

You could be the first in your family to break the cycle. Think of the future you want for yourself and work everyday to achieve that. Remember that there will be bad days and setbacks, but that progress isn't always linear and it doesn't mean that you'll never succeed. Just don't give up. I'm certain that you can do it. When things get hard just remember what you're working towards. One day you'll be ready and I'm sure that you'll be a wonderful parent.",False,False
