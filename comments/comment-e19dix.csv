But if I’m restricting, and I start smelling really good food. I have to leave immediately or it’s all gonna get eaten, so I really relate to that.  It’s so weird how sometimes I feel like I have more self control than the average person (restricting) and then I feel like a whore for food a day later when I binge. Lol we have all gotta get our shit together",False,True

It's my peak fear food and also the love of my life, my absolute downfall!  But seriously, even the smell of it is guaranteed to trigger a binge. I can't have it anywhere near me or I will absolutely annihilate it, along with any shred of self respect I may have left...",False,False

They’re low carb, lower in calories than other chocolate I’ve seen but kind of pricey. Sometimes on sale for $2 a bar at Whole Foods, but I paid $4 a bar at a different store. I don’t eat this a lot because I don’t want to shit myself (lots of sugar substitutes in these bars).   Sugar free chocolate pudding or Fiber One chocolate brownies are other options.",False,False

I feel like crap.  I regret everything! Damn you, chocolate!",False,False
