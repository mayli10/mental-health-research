Actually my boyfriend got it for me when I was at the worst of my relapse, and it helped immensely because up to that point I was restricting to around 1200 calories a day while working out at least 3 hours every day. In my mind that was perfectly reasonable, but having the tracker showed me a more realistic estimate of my calorie expenditure, so it encouraged me to eat a little bit more and have more manageable workouts.   After around 6 months I stopped using it, because not gonna lie, I did become very obsessive about it. Being orthorexic and studying for a STEM degree, it's very easy for me to get addicted to anything that involves numbers, pretty graphs, and statistics. Taking the tracker off felt extremely liberating, but at the same time having used it for a while I now know more or less how much food I should actually be eating on a normal day and how many calories I burn during a typical workout.   Overall my experience with the Mi band was good, I'd say it was instrumental in the start of my recovery. After a while though it was doing more harm than good, so be careful: once you start it's not easy to quit.",False,False

Could you please tell me why getting rid of your FitBit helped you? I'm thinking of buying a Mi band 4 for tracking physical activity, but I gotta admit I'm pretty obsessive and I don't know how I'll react to having a fitness tracker. I'm not looking to develop or go back to any ED, I'm just trying to recover and maintain a healthy lifestyle. So this post kinda worried me. What impact did the fitbit have on you?",False,False
