It was a few years ago now, and standards/resources have made leaps and bounds since then.   I never asked for a low dose; I know other people who did and got gatekept.

If you're anywhere in CA I can probably give you the name of a better clinic.  I mean, did the doctors give you a reason why they wouldn't give you a very low dose? Fuck the ""all or nothing"" attitude, that makes literally no sense. If I couldn't start on a low dose I wouldn't start at all. I know some people weather drastic hormonal shifts pretty well, but there is just no way in hell I'm throwing my oversensitive body that kind of a curveball. Plus I'm paranoid about my singing voice. Or, hell, what if I start and absolutely hate it and suddenly know I'm making the wrong decision, you know? There are lots of reasons not to want to start at a typical dose. Or to stay on a low dose permanently.  But just FYI, a permanent low dose will eventually masculinize your body just as much as a higher one, it just takes much longer. If you're aiming for androgyny, you'd probably want to be on T for a while and then stop, not keep taking it in perpetuity.",False,False
