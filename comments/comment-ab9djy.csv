I also struggle with drinking enough water, but I'm consciously trying to make it a habit (having a glass before meals, for example) and I find it actually does make quite a difference in how I feel. But bodies are just weird sometimes... try to remind yourself that things inevitably change and whatever discomfort you're in cannot last forever.",False,False

Iâ€™ve eaten a lot over the past week so it might just be because Iâ€™ve eaten more than usual and water weight shit maybe? Idk but itâ€™s stressing me out in itself. Drinking water is something I always struggle with, itâ€™s just so bland and I can never remind myself to drink it :/",False,True

I was thinking Iâ€™d have to switch to a different type. I donâ€™t think I can see a doctor about it and I canâ€™t quit altogether but this is a much better alternative. Iâ€™m in the UK, can I buy those brands here or are they US specific? Iâ€™ve heard of psyllium husk which I can get here but is it a safe type of lax to use?",False,True

I'm pretty cautious about lax because I have a GI disorder, so I'm not trying to abuse them in a reckless manner...  Anyway, you've heard this before, but DRINK LOTS OF WATER and try not to fret too much about it. It seems like my random episodes of constipation coincide with times of heightened stress or anxiety, even if I'm not aware of it on a conscious level. Hopefully, this is just holiday-related tension manifesting in your body and it will pass as you settle into the new year.",False,False

It's time to start weaning off, at this rate you could develop paralytic bowel, ileus, toxic megacolon....all sorts of terrible things. Senna is a stimulant laxative and chronic use leads to bowel dependence. I've known people who've had to get ostomies because of their laxative abuse.  &amp;#x200B;   Switch to an osmotic laxative such as Miralax (polyethylene glycol) and docusate sodium (Colace). Drink lots of water with these and stay active if your body can handle it (20-30 min walk a day should be fine). Expect for it to take a few weeks for things to readjust.....best would be for you to see your doctor ASAP but if that's too overwhelming start with switching from stimulant to osmotic laxatives.
