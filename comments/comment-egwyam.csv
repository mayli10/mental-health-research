I know it’s f...ing hard but it will get better. You‘ll accept you body a bite more each day even if it seems impossible right now. I mean you‘ve probably been uw for a long time and now you‘ve suddenly got this new body. You‘re uw self has become you‘re „normal“ and obviously you‘ll need some time to get used to your new body. I know it sucks. But at least you‘re not dying anymore. You can actually begin to enjoy your life an have the energy to do the things you couldn’t all this time. To something that you enjoy, meet up with friends, find a hobby. Don’t isolate yourself, it‘ll just make you more depressed. AND NEVER EVER EVER be ashamed of your body. nobody, literally nobody will judge you, or think that you‘re huge now - if that’s a concern of yours. People who care about you are actually happy, that you choose recovery. Everything will get better, even if it seems impossible right now.",False,False
