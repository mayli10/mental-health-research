Sometimes people are dumb and he might be projecting his insecurities onto you without even realising it. He can't read your mind.   Its OK to ask for only positive comments about your body and not to be able to handle jokes. I would feel really hurt as well.  You can just say that you have been really insecure recently and you need him to be your cheerleader not your critic because you're not in a place to have your flaws pointed out constantly. Then after you have that conversation challenge him every time he does it. He will soon understand that you're not OK with it",False,False
