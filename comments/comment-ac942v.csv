You just have to trust that recovery WILL help your hair eventually. In my experience, hair is a bit slow on the uptake so regrowth doesn’t start the day you start recovery. Be patient and good luck with your recovery!",False,True

I’m actually attempting recovery and am trying to stop restricting entirely. It feels like my hair’s been getting worse though. :( I’m trying to be patient but this is really reassuring. I just miss my old hair &amp; am so mad at myself for letting it get this bad.,False,False

Your hair *will* grow back. Since I posted this, I have little baby hair antennas all over my scalp! That day at the salon, my stylist actually told me they were starting to grow in a little bit. I have a bit of perma-frizz these days since the baby hairs are too light to lay down properly, but they’ll get longer eventually.   After my first relapse a decade ago, the same thing happened. My hair fell out dramatically, and then grew back in gradually. But I had to start eating a bit more to make it happen. Same with this time. I upped my calorie intake a bit and my hair started growing back. I’m kind of teetering between restriction and recovery but the extra calories I AM consuming are helping with my hair.   There are things you can be doing *now* to protect the hair you still have. Shampoo less often, don’t rake a brush through wet hair, decrease your heat styling. Stuff like that. And of course easing up on the restriction if you feel that you can. ",False,True

I’m pretty much in the same situation as this post. Just curious, has your hair grown back like it did before? You totally don’t have to answer if you’re not comfortable, I’m just really curious as to if I’ve permanently ruined everything. (I’m not postpartum but I’ve been restricting for 8ish months).

My stylist did a blunt cut, took about 5 inches of scraggles but my hair looks long and thick with the consistent ends. My ends are just below my bra’s clasp-band now. Nothing dramatic, didn’t add any more layers or do any bangs. She said bangs are a bad idea unless you lose hair from your hairline, because they draw hair away from the crown which is where women usually lose their hair instead.   I’m 100% going to grow it back out but it will look healthy in the meantime. I recommend a good solid trim like this without dramatically changing your style or color. I’ve had a lot of feelings this year and have trusted NONE of them when it came to my hair. But a trim isn’t a cut, it just freshens you up. At the very least go have someone WASH your hair because my stylist working out the kinks in my neck while the conditioner was in almost made me cry with how nice it is to be touched with just kindness.
