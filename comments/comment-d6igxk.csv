Also how disrespectful is that to say to someone who is starting a (not disordered lol) weight loss program.  I feel like I used to see people say that a lot on that big weight loss subreddit back in the day to people being excited about losing the first couple of pounds.  Like okay maybe it's water weight but everyone is going to lose ""water weight"" when they start dieting.  It's the start of the process so don't be a dick.",False,False

It's just our bodies preparing for when we get pregnant and that area needs to stretch!,False,False

I’ve been getting random swelling quite often for YEARS (even when I’m not nearing my period or when I’m eating very low salt and drinking enough water) and doctors haven’t been helpful. At least the weight from fat can be controlled with CICO, but my water weight gain is so fucking unpredictable and it makes me look so puffy and fat in an instant.",False,False

Got a flabby stomach? Sadly 1000 crunches a day won't make you lose fat in that are specifically. What it WILL do is build muscle and give definition and tone to the area, which makes it seem like targeted fat loss.",False,False

Yeah, I feel good for about 30 minutes, but that's it. I feel like crap afterwards.
