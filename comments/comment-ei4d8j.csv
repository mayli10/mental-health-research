More about a control that we can't feel in our daily lives? Body dysmorphia is a bitch too. Like wow, everyone says I'm thin but I can't tell. Fucking kick ass. Ultimately the only thing that is static between all EDs is that we're all suffering with our bodies.",False,False

In high school, I straight-up had no concept of disordered eating being a thing that even existed. It wasn’t until gaining weight in college - and seeing how differently guys would treat me, even platonically - that I began to impose judgment on my own body. I’m sure there are many, many gay guys who have ED-like thoughts and behaviors, but never process or talk about them.",False,False

I never thought I would ever fall into a disordered mindset because I never cared about my body image and really loved food. I’m not attributing my issues solely to my sexuality, but I came out about two years ago and have become really self-conscious and weight-obsessed within the past year or so.",False,False

It was actually kinda comical - I’d only weigh myself at my yearly doctor’s checkup, and every.single.time. I was 140lb on the dot.   Pretty much just ate whenever I wanted to, which was only (a) when I was hungry or (b) at restaurants/parties, where I’d stuff myself to fullness and then just skip breakfast the next morning without a second thought. I didn’t “like” or “dislike” my body — I just didn’t think about it at all.  Being a guy helps - our bodies aren’t policed to nearly the extent womens’ are.",False,False

And it was great;  I woke up, ate what I felt like because I was hungry, or even just because that was what I was supposed to do to survive and give my body what it needed. I wasn't thinking about food outside of mealtimes. I ate without thinking of the impact it would have on my body. I didn't actively want to lose weight- it didn't really matter to me and there was more important stuff to spend my energy on. Once in a blue moon i'd have moments where i wanted to restrict, but they'd pass. I didn't count calories. I didn't punish myself for eating. It was so peaceful and I am jealous of anyone who feels like that all of the time. Presently i'm relapsing pretty hard so all of that has gone out the window   I have no idea what it's like to lose weight the healthy way, so to an extent I agree with you. I think the difference with us is that while people may go on diets and feel bad about their bodies, they don't internalize it so much. They don't take their weight as a reflection of their entire self worth. They won't think about it all the time, or have intrusive, illogical thoughts about their weight and body image. That's what I think about it anyway.",False,False

It might not be manic/obsessive or dysmorphia based but I think there’s always a psychological aspect to eating more than you need. A lot of people don’t think of being obese/overeating as an eating disorder because it’s so common.,False,False

Especially with 2020 starting everyone will be talking about going to the gym and loosing weight and eating better. Maybe we just do an extreme version of it.,False,False
