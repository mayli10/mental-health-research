I'm taking a shit ton of painkillers for the tension headaches.  Maybe try massaging your jaw a little? Also lots of people take magnesium supplements for the dreaded gurning/clenching when rolling on MD, that could be a good idea to help, I'm not sure. Even so extra magnesium supplements will only help if you're restricting/purging etc",False,False

So in theory, reducing stress levels will reduce jaw clenching.   There are slim mouth guards that are designed to protect your teeth from clenching/grinding. They're designed to be worn at night but you could wear them in the daytime if you wished.",False,False
