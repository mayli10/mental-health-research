I think she wears it in pigtails because it brings all of her hair to the front, giving it the appearance of being thicker. I think that's also why she curls it. Hair looks thicker when it's curled.

We have no idea what things are like behind the scenes. Of course they're not going to be berating her about her disorder in front of the camera. And she's a 24 year old woman. There's only so much they can do as parents.  They probably want to be supportive of her YouTube career because it's one thing outside of her disorder that she has. She's too sick right now to be a productive member of society. Do people just expect her to lay around in bed all day doing nothing? At least she has something that gives her a purpose or that she can be proud of.  If they really were trying to exploit her they'd probably make their own channel and talk about her illness without her consent.  I mean, I could be wrong. But I just don't think we know enough about her life outside of her YouTube videos to make assumptions about her family.  So yeah I think that's a good point that her dad's comments might not be weird but rather because he's upset.",False,False

I won't say she is *only* famous for her disorder but at this point no one can deny it's a huge contributor to her fanbase/popularity. For these reasons, I feel terribly sorry for her and can't imagine how she'll move forward with a healthy recovery when every part of her social media and life is going to be full of triggering comments telling her she ""looks healthy"", emphasizing how she's gained weight, making direct comparisons on what she looks like vs how she used to. Think about how offended most of us get hearing something like that even once and then multiply it on a much more massive scale. I for one think trying to make her channel recovery-based will not only harm her recovery, but I'm almost positive she will immediately start losing subs/followers/media attention as she gains weight and probably end up on a similar path as alyrealrecovery or w/e because so many of her fans only follow her for her weight.
