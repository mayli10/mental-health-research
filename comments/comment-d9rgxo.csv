I recently in the past 6 or 8 months GAINED 20 and omg it's so noticeable, clothes don't fit right anymore, sweet ass collar bones fading away, I feel like a damn cow. I think other people don't notice as much as we notice ourselves. I've had people say I look the same after gaining but holy shit I know better because I critique the shit out of myself. I always say nobody cares about my weight more than I do and therefore most people probably don't notice my ups and downs. Idk if that's good or bad lol",False,False
