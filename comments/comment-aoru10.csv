Binging wouldn’t be so bad if everyone binged on celery, but there’s no appeal to that (and no sugar). I wasn’t justifying your therapist, sorry if it sounds like i was, i have no idea what the fuck is best or i’d be a therapist. Tell your therapist when they take a bad approach, everyone is still learning, until the day they die.  My point was that sugar addictions are very real and you saying your therapist was “convinced” makes it sound like you’re in denial about how real and how bad sugar addiction can be. Even if it’s not something you like hearing about, it doesn’t mean you should just blow it off.",False,False

What's harming me more? My ""sugar addiction"", let's just say I have one: is it harming my health, finances, relationships, job? You could argue it's harming my health, but my finances, relationships, and job are unaffected. My ED behaviors/thoughts? Obsessive body thoughts, fear of untrackable food, low energy at work, irritability: these things degrade my finances, relationships, jobs when they get bad. They're more of a problem than my ""sugar addiction"": I'm not diabetic snorting Skittles and hocking my furniture on Craigslist for scones.",False,False

Not introduce new fears. It's pretty accepted in ED recovery that worrying about nutrition is a late stage for recovery, or it's just going to be triggering. Also, yes, if you're struggling with ED stuff (like me and I assume you and most of the people hete) you're *a little crazy*.",False,False

Even if sugar isn’t as addictive (not sure haven’t studied it myself), you can still be addicted to it in the same way you can be addicted to cocaine.  You’re crazy if you think them telling you that is them “pushing” their “food science” on you lol. They’re simply telling you something that they (and most people studying sugar addiction) believe. Their goals are also to educate you, even if it’s about things you don’t want to hear (sugar addiction).",False,False

You're a shitty therapist if you push your *controversial* food science (yes, there are some studies that suggest sugar giving us a similar response to cocaine, but we also get that response to sex, other ""natural"" things; it's not scientific consensus, which should be the bar for therapist imo) on patients. Especially irresponsible if they are a person you know struggles with food and their goals are to remove fear around food, not increase it.",False,False

My new one definitely has ~~~Food Beliefs~~~ (she has a parenting blog that I read some of before I started seeing her, saw some minor stuff about GMOs) but she's good enough at her job to feel out the type of feedback I want/need for ED stuff. Like, the first time it came up she immediately wanted to know what *I* considered problematic about my eating habits/body thoughts and what I wanted to change about them (if anything).

I would suggest keep working on your anxiety, that might help lessen the ed. Or at least that is what happens in my case. And maybe look for other therapists that is specialised in ED. And ask for a referral or to change. That is your right as a patient, but I guess it depends on insurance and bureaucracy. ",False,False
