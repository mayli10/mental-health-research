See, your kidneys can only manage and excrete excess water up to a certain point - around 1 liter per hour. Beyond that, water causes excessive dilution of sodium and important elecrolytes in your blood. This in itself is a condition known as hyponatremia. When this happens, your body tries to regulate that by increasing water retention/edema in the peripheral regions of the body (such as the legs) and, most importantly, by increasing fluid shifts from the bloodstreams to the cells, which then begin to swell. Swelling can impact pressure and blood flows inside the brain, which in turn can result in a series of neurological symptoms which may vary from dizziness and mild nausea to seizures, coma and ultimately death.  Water loading is a common technique used by anorexics in treatment centers before weigh-in to appear heavier than they are. There are girls who have lost their sight or suffered long-term brain damage from that.",False,False
