Laura was a spiritual type who hugged me at the end of every session. She had long auburn hair and wore prairie skirts and used the word “beautiful” a lot ― often after I’d said things that were not even remotely beautiful (which was confusing to me until I realized that she used “beautiful” in spaces where most therapists would say, “I understand”).  &gt;Around that time, Laura told me she thought I needed a higher level of care and suggested an inpatient treatment facility in Colorado. And that was when I quit seeing Laura. I told myself I was tired of her spiritual approach, but in retrospect I think it might’ve had more to do with the fact that I wasn’t ready to get better. I wasn’t ready to let go of my disordered eating.  I hate how much this reminds me of my last therapist and when I stopped seeing them. It was around the time they told me I needed to giant 10-15 more pounds. They were one of those 'the world is beautiful!'-types that could never properly echo back to me what I said in the last session.    I'm really conflicted about articles like this. I'm glad there are prominent figures airing out their problems to let others know that they're normal human beings, and I commend them all for having the courage to publically acknowledge engaging in behavior often considered shameful, but I hate that it destroys my illusion of thin perfection.   I've always had certain ideals in mind for what I wanted my body to be. It would change every so often, but it was nearly always tied to thinness. As a tween/young teen, I'd internally celebrate eating much less than my chubby, same-age cousins. I enjoyed seeing that small keyhole form above my thighs, right below my crotch. I'd compare my body to my pretty friends who easily attracted boys. I got older and my ideals expanded; I compared myself to idols and then I got sick. When celebrities who I would compare myself to admit to having an eating disordered history, I feel frustrated. It means what I was comparing myself to and holding myself to was something I can't have while healthy. It's so disappointing. It's selfish of me and I won't deny that.   I'm glad she was able to begin to overcome it, though. This and the Taylor Swift admission has really thrown a wrench in my thinking process. ",False,False
