Idk if you do that already. But if you dont, a good place to start would be doing laundry, and then dishes. The basics. And then find some dusting, and then vacuuming. That could occupy an entire day, or you could do a small amount every day for a week, etc. If you get yourself out of bed each day and do something productive, it might be easier to get out of the house too.   Maybe find a park nearby and go for a short and easy walk. Or find a dog park! If not allergic! And pet some dogs and meet their owners! If you go often you can make acquaintances with some nice doggie owners",False,False
