It's not 100g for everyone in the same way not every woman needs 1800kcals and not everyone does 10,000 steps a day. These are just averages.",False,False

During my heavy restriction period I was in so deep with my ed that I didn't even notice being lightheaded or weak at the gym. Now that I'm in recovery, if I restrict for a day and try and work out the next morning, I can absolutely feel it. Much weaker, less endurance, everything. it's nuts how I didn't realize before ",False,False
