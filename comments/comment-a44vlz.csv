I was hoping today would be the start but Iâ€™m making dinner and Iâ€™ll be around 2000 calories &amp; I honestly doubt thatâ€™s all Iâ€™ll eat tonight. Refraining from a glass of wine is already hard &amp; I said I wouldnâ€™t have any tonight ðŸ˜¹ðŸ˜¹  Then tomorrow we have some breakfast w Santa thing... I normally donâ€™t even eat breakfast so thatâ€™s gonna throw my whole day off  Ugh ugh ugh. Why is winter so centered around food?!?!!????!!!",False,True

On the plus side idk if this will be helpful for you but I also find it helps the other way round, like one good day and Iâ€™m back on track.. so I always remind myself of that when Iâ€™m about to ruin a good day after a string of bad days, do I make any sense??? Idk Iâ€™m rambling ignore me ",False,False

My weight started to plateau and I was having problems losing, so I was trying to restrict to about 500ish a day and I havenâ€™t been able to stop binging. Literally what the fuck is wrong with me, Iâ€™m so annoyed with myself all the time and I feel like such a failure. ",False,False
