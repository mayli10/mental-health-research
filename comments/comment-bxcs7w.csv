But I kept finding it everywhere and haven’t had the confidence, since! Maybe I need a liner or something to keep it in place.  Good luck! I’m sure you’ll rock it! Red makes everyone look fierce.  I’m ok. I’m really proud of myself. I had a meal and a bit of dessert.. and left it. I feel a bit panicky and like I’m losing control but I’m talking to myself. I’m levelling with myself. We’re rationalizing and addressing the underlying anxiety. It’s an iceberg. I could purge, sure, but underneath is still a mountain.   Thank you for checking in. So extremely sweet of you. Good luck tomorrow, wear the hell out of that red! Knock em dead.",False,True

I'm going to wear it tomorrow, too. In public. To work. I'm kind of nervous lol I have never wore red lipstick in public before but I'm feeling pretty good! I heard it's a thrill to wear it.  How are you? Are you holding up okay?",False,False

I've been waiting for more trauma therapy since November and I hate the wait.   I want to get it done with!   If I won millions, I'd DEFINITELY use it to set up an ED clinic.  I had to travel miles for my outpatient and it wasn't even in my health authority.  There should be more, especially for eating disorders.  You'll get there though, but I know how you feel.  It's an upsetting time for you and nobody deserves to feel left alone with their problems.  I'll keep my fingers crossed as well.  A year is worst case scenario but I bet it won't take that long.  Walks are a great idea.  There's a little park where I live with this small cluster of trees.  I like to go in there and read a book when the weather's nice.  It's really peaceful and nobody knows I'm there.  I don't know if you like ASMR, but I find it pretty helpful for relaxation.  I'm broke too, so it's good to have a virtual spa treatment for free on youtube, ha!  Enjoy your nature trails :)  Inbox always open.   x",False,False

It made me feel really cared for. Really, thank you.   Admittedly my funds are air tight right now, but I’m sure I can find something to do without spending anything. Maybe find a trail nearby and get into taking walks. That could be nice for my mental health, too. I could bring along a journal as you suggested.   That’s so sweet of you. I did call my doctor and ask if there’s an ETA yet, unfortunately he said our area is the most scarce with resources so our waiting list can take up to a year... a bit scary to consider. I’m only almost 3 months in and feel it was a lifetime ago I got the courage to ask for mental health help again. I’m crossing my fingers something happens soon by a stroke of luck.    Thank you again. You’re so kind.",False,True

That's how it works, grrr@EDs.  You know that a flat stomach, thigh gap, bikini bridge or whatever else is dressed up with photoshop in magazines isn't worth losing your partner over.  Being thin isn't even \*really\* what we want.  You know that you don't have control of it, it's the disorder controlling you.  It wants you to fuck up, lose everything while making you think you're powerful and thin is where it's at.  You're gorgeous.  Ask your boyfriend.  You do NOT need to change your appearance.  You're good with words.  You're intelligent.    You're definitely not stupid and there's no shame.  You're having a tough time with a mental illness.  Don't be hard on yourself because that makes it worse.    Do something really nice for yourself.  Spoil yourself.  Treat yourself to something within your budget that you can use to give you a boost whether it's a new notebook or stationery, or some bits so you can spend a good couple of hours soaking in a bathtub with a face mask, follow up with lotions and potions.  Whatever your thing is take time out to actively make yourself feel special.  Distractions are fantastic.  My thing is knitting and crochet.  I have more sweaters and amigurumi toys than most stores on etsy probably, but it takes my mind off crap.  Go for a walk somewhere quiet and write about it.  Start collecting pictures and postcards and stick them in a journal.  Endless options.  &amp;#x200B;  Just remember this - EDs are liars and nothing good comes from them, only misery.  Until you get some help, hang on in there.  Don't pressure yourself.  It won't always be like this and never feel ashamed.  When you feel stronger you can fight it better.    If I had some cash I'd pay for you to go private for therapy.   Have you been in touch with the health care service?  They might be able to give you a rough idea where about you are on the list now.  You'll deal with this.  X",False,False

I found journaling and art to be helpful in recovery, good way to process emotions and get busy when urges strike. Sometimes if the urges/anxiety were too intense for words I’d just color in the paper with sharpie, rows of different colors down the whole page (or multiple pages lol) until things felt lighter again.",False,False

You have the capability to do anything you need to do to be healthy. You. Are. Capable. I have a thing I'm going to try, and you're more than welcome to do it with me, is instead of getting your confidence from numbers, try colors. I'm going to do reds for the first time in my life. Red nails. Red lips. Red pants. Red shoes. Red blazer. Anything red except my hair because I have a kick ass balayage rn but I think it might work! It still gets the looks, the compliments, the awe, the mystique and powerful aura you might want. It's a luxurious color.",False,False
