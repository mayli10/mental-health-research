It was such a well-written post that was clearly helping people. Not a single person in the comments had anything but love and support to share.

I remember saving that post earlier this week from the woman who recovered and encouraged everyone else to do the same. I saved it because it was the best example I had seen of a beautiful, supportive post that showed that r/proed isn't toxic or negative place. and ironically, now it's gone, because people think that's exactly what it is. i'm so mad.  i don't really have anything else i want to recover - but i just hate that it's all gone. unlike many other people, i made the decision not to use alt accounts, and not to use an anonymous account on reddit. i want my reddit post history to be a representation of who i am. i want to feel like i'm not wasting my time writing nonsense anonymously on the internet, but rather that i'm in some way contributing to our world's collective consciousness and leaving my own small mark on the world, and forming real connections, even if it's over the internet. I *want* r/proed to show up in my post history, because I'm not ashamed of it. And I'm upset that it's all gone, because it was a part of who I am.  ",False,False
