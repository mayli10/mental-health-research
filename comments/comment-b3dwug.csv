When I went through that phase after restrictive eating I looked up so many articles to try and explain why I was eating so much when I had restricted so well before.  I’m pretty sure that it’s your body panicking once it got food and is trying to STOCK UP before it goes into “starvation” again. Really, it’s a domino effect. One day you’re eating close to nothing and you eat One (1) cookie and it’s downhill from there, your body is like PLEASE GIMME.  I agree with what other commenters have said and that you can’t go back to restriction for a while, it’ll just become a cycle. You have to unfortunately try and cope with the weight gain and eat normally and the weight will begin to even out! (It usually does)   I hope you are doing okay and good luck! &lt;3",False,False

It happened to me, and it was a disaster. My advice is to not aim to go back to any kind of restriction for a while. It sucks, but we’ve got to work with the hand we’re dealt and it’s nigh impossible to dive straight back into restriction. If you can aim to get closer to true maintenance (not 1200cal/ day), then you can at least stop the weight gain and begin to normalise your eating patterns. It sucks so much, but truly that’s the best advice I can give.   Also, it’s quite possible that the number on the scale isn’t your true weight, binging leads to a shit tonne of water retention, so things may well not be as bad as they seem rn. ",False,False
