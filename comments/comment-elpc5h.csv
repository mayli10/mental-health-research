It is only “restriction” when you have issues with satiety, such as an addiction to food etc. Those of us who are “naturally overweight” will likely always have to exercise control over our caloric consumption (aka restriction) for the rest of our lives if being at the lower end of a healthy BMI is our goal.   The problem with having an ED isn’t merely the act of caloric restriction, like the HAES/pro-obesity propagandists want us to believe. It’s our psychological states and the destructive behaviours that follow from a lack of self respect. You can restrict calories without harming your health or psyche. You can restrict calories as an act of self care and self love (in fact, for binge/overeaters this is really the only approach to food that *is* self care)  Imo it’s cruel and unnecessary to train people with EDs to think the only solution to their mental pain is to just free feed and allow themselves to get fat. Obesity is a genuine health issues and all of our problems won’t be solved merely by giving up on paying attention to what we consume. That was the worst part of recovery, having some therapists tell me I needed to completely let go of any dietary control (I have celiac disease so that’s a laugh, I have to spend the rest of my life reading labels to stay alive) when what actually helped me was gaining genuine self-respect through feminist theory and anti-capitalist political consciousness raising, and learning to detach my sense of worth from my appearance. That doesn’t mean I don’t still want to maintain a lower body weight/avoid being fat, but I no longer think I’m a bad person when I gain weight. Our weight is separate from our value as people and we deserve health, and that’s what we should be focusing on long before trying to detach ourselves from obsessively reading labels and counting calories. Telling someone who is reacting to living in a fucked up obesity-promoting food culture to not care about how much they consume is abusive.",False,False
