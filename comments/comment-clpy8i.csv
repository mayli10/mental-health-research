My ex hadn't seen me in over a week and half when they asked if I'd like to come over to our formerly shared apartment for a late dinner (also we had sex oh lawdy) a few days ago. When they saw me they told me I'm going to die. Which apparently I wasn't so much a turn off enough yet to not be attractive enough to not have sex with, so...? My ED brain is now unsure if that means I haven't actually lost enough weight yet?  For dinner it was really cute that they bought a few packages of [food], except they made me eat all of it (which to be fair I did happily since I love it and it's fairly low calories while being protein) and kept telling me I've lost too much weight and need to eat.  It's validating but also depressing that I can't even see my own changes. For all I know I look larger than when I started.",False,False

I think it's normal to feel proud in a way because it's like a separate bracket for people noticing your weightloss.
