This is huge, seriously. Like its so hard to try and get better all by yourself but no one understands!! friends and family tell you to go to therapy!! therapists tell you to just eat and exercise!!!! So instead all the heavy lifting of actually facing our burdens and the stuff that keeps us locked into this HELL falls on our shoulders, alone, hush-fucking-hush. and people wonder why EDs are so isolating.
