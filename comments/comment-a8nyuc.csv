Once had a friend say ""wow you lost weight"". Afterwards I gained about 4 kgs in a month from binging, then started to lose it again. I was almost back to the original weight when the friend goes ""did you lose MORE weight?? ""  I've come to the conclusion that people have no idea what anyone looks like, no clue how height and weight work, and certainly no self awareness of how they act when it comes to appearances ",False,False

I‚Äôm not sure if I look thin and need to be like ‚Äútrying to gain‚Äù or if I should just say ‚Äúthank you.‚Äù If I say thank you and they were concerned it‚Äôs gonna get awkward. I usually just panicked and am like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the same as last time you saw me!!‚Äù ,False,False

Not even a question, just a statement. And almost EVERY GODDAMN TIME, I have not lost. And it just makes me want to cry or stop existing.
