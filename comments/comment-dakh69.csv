Not considered disordered to eat less than a full meal, after an earlier meal that was pretty large or involved fatty foods. (Whereas in the U.S. people squawk at you for this, like, ""that cAN't be your dINneR"")  - less of a dessert culture. Here, some families eat one or two scoops of ice cream every single night, and it's not considered insane. Whereas in France, for instance, dessert can be a bit of yogurt, fruit, cheese, etc.  - people don't show up to random events with calorific treats all the time, and abundant sugar is not normalized at school. Here, it can be like, soccer game? CHIPS/CANDY! Volunteer event? DOUGHNUTS! Random school event/holiday/birthday? RICE KRISPY TREATS AND CUPCAKES AND COOKIES!   - people don't regularly eat fast food, or at restaurants (Chilis, etc) that are essentially no better than McDonald's in terms of calories/nutritional value. In the U.S., there's lots of microwave dinners, too, or other packaged junk. This is becoming more common in Europe, but it's nothing like the problem here (which has developed, in part, due to the U.S.'s shitty work culture and corresponding lack of personal time).
