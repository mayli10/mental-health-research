But IKWYM - it's like they want their ideal girlfriend to defy science - be stick thin but eat a ton. or never hold back or pick the 'girl item on the menu'. I hate it when they say 'I love a girl who eats' - yet they want a stick thin model,False,False

I have a history of anorexia and he encouraged bingeing when I was with him. Then he'd shame the weight gain and say sick things like 'I love making people put on lots of weight'.,False,False

I remember my father made my mom so ashamed of her body at the beach that she ran to the car, wrapped herself in a towel and cried. I remember immediately grabbing a towel to wrap around myself, at like 6 or 7 yrs old. And couldn't swim, just sat frozen in the sand, ashamed and afraid. She spent the next month eating and drinking nothing but honey and lemon in water. Then, nothing but eggs and tuna. All 4 children developed severe eating disorders. This kind of behaviour impacts everyone in touches, and it quite literally kills people.   I'm so sorry you had to go through that. It's so painful. The hurt doesn't go away.",False,False
