Sometimes it helps me to tell myself that by stopping a binge and having a glass of water I am doing something kind to my body.  I too am having a tough one this week, spent a lot of time crying and doing anything I can to stop bad thoughts but sometimes it feels like someone is stood there banging pots and pans together right next to my ear and screaming my own bad memories at me. I don’t really have any good advice on how to deal with it but I hope it’s at least comforting to know that you aren’t completely alone. Also if it makes you feel better about the cookies I ate brownie mix **powder** (yep, dry ass powder) straight out of the box today because self control is a skill I don’t have apparently!!!!
