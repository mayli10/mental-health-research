If I want a certain food but am afraid I'll B/P on it then I'll just go buy a single serving or portion. A lot of bad foods for me are carb heavy, I'm not doing keto but how/what I eat is typically considered lower carb. Its hard to figure out and it'll take some trial and error but just focus on making small steps.",False,False

I’m feeling fairly good on self-recovery from bulimia right now. I eat a little below maintenance with lots of lean protein and carby veggies like sweet potato. Too much carbs/sugar deffo makes me bloat so I’m avoiding that but definitely not keto. Working out hard (I love spin) to get some endorphins going.   It’s actually a pretty stereotypical “healthy lifestyle” and I’m steadily losing weight... like if I can actually maintain this and not binge... feels too good to be true tbh haha ,False,False
