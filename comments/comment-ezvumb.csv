This is the disorder talking. EDs are tricky bitches, it's going to try and keep you under its control. 200 calories is NOWHERE NEAR enough for our bodies. Fight back against that irrational voice. ED recovery is an ongoing war, not a single battle. It's going to take time to be able to eat more and go against what the disorder is telling you.",False,False

Minimum 3 full meals a day is ""enough"". You may not be feeling hunger pangs, but EDs mess up our hunger/fullness ques.     Plus, if you're eating more (great job by the way!!), your stomach is trying to adjust and settle in an environment where your eating habits are constantly changing.",False,False

If it was a while ago/you didn't eat much... then it is hunger. That is how your body tells you to eat. Your stomach is saying ""I need food ASAP"".  If the last time you ate it was relatively recently and you binged, then that's the opposite; it's your stomach saying ""please not again"".  If you purged, it's your stomach saying ""ow, don't do that"".
