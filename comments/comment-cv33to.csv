I think what we really miss is that total feeling of being in power and control and perfect, and the key is finding something healthier that gives you that same feeling. usually that means setting some kind of goal for yourself or learning/doing something and putting your all into it",False,False

Just saying as a PSA, I’m very much involved in my ED. I count the calories of everything I eat, I exercise on the floor at night, I don’t eat for most of the day and this sub makes me feel less alone when I’m going through it. I don’t know how it could help you if you’re trying to recover, but if it works for you then I’m happy :-)",False,False
