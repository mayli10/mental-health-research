Grains sugar protein and dietary fat!  This can equal 1,350kcal if servings sizes are used.  LOL idk but that’s a shot. A few years back I lived of those and oatmeal. I wasn’t an anoretic then but I was still thin and was feeling very bored with food so I just ate that. When I cut pb&amp;j‘s out, I began to become severely underweight. If you’re not allergic (and Ik it’s silly) that could be a menu solution lol.  *ps make sure to get something with calcium and all those vitamins",False,False

You won't absorb fat soluble vitamins if you're not getting enough fat, no. A lot of the solubility of vitamins and minerals is enhanced by eating foods that often go together. So eating a salad with an oil based dressing allows you to absorb fat soluble vitamins like vitamin K, which is in spinach. Without vitamin K, your body has a harder time absorbing calcium and vitamin D. If you aren't absorbing calcium and vitamin D you're not going to be doing much with protein. It's kind of a domino effect. The best way to make sure your body is getting everything is to eat a balanced and varied diet, but if you're unable or unwilling to do that, you still need the balance of the macronutrients to allow you to absorb and use the micronutrients.",False,False

It's too expensive though, but I'd be searching to create something like that. I would add nuts probably, or peanut butter as it is less expensive. Maybe a stupid question but won't my multivitamins work if I don't eat enough fat?",False,True

I had a partner who did not have an eating disorder but who did have like, sort of chronic undereating because of depression, and Soylent was really helpful. Also eggs are not really enough fat to like, make sure that your able to absorb your vitamins, maybe consider almonds, avocado, or oil.",False,False
