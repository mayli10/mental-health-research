I don’t think I have any words to help. I remember feeling that my treatment team was unnecessarily coercive. They were so busy fighting against my eating disorder that they never stopped to realize that I wasn’t fighting back. I think it’s in large part due to the fact that they get so many young girls that don’t really want to be there/ get competitive with one another/ use treatment as a way to prove they are “sick enough”. Reality is, when you are young, having an eating disorder doesn’t seem that bad. I would have never wanted to give it up at that age. As an adult, I am fully aware of what my eating disorder has taken from me and the way it impacts my life and the lives of the people I love the most. And I HATE myself for it. I was in treatment because I wanted to be there, it was 100% my decision because I wanted to get better, I was putting my career in jeopardy, I was spending thousands of dollars I don’t have (and a whole lot more when you factor in missing wages), to be treated as though I didn’t want to be there or that I wouldn’t be compliant if they weren’t semi-abusive was incredibly disheartening.   Dealing with young people who just compete with one another while in treatment, or who just don’t try, is massively triggering. I wish there were more programs that only took older adults. It would be so great to be in a room with people whose lives are in the same place as mine, where most people are using their own resources to be there and therefore much more likely to be motivated, not to mention rules would probably look different and how we are treated different too.   Nutrition in eating disorders.....100% I’ve come to the conclusion that they don’t have any freaking idea what they are actually doing. I’ve given up trying to get them to explain their reasoning and theories. This isn’t my eating disorder doing the talking at all for this one.   And finally, the level of professionalism and quality care I received from higher levels of care has been appalling and at times incredibly unethical. I’m not surprised by your whole therapist thing. I think that the best in the mental health business have their own private practices. Those who work in higher levels of care are either starting out, not good at their jobs, etc. Companies hire based on who they can get for less and it shows. I think even those who are amazing at their jobs end up incredibly burnt out after working in these positions for awhile, and aren’t able to perform at their best. In addition, the TAs they have sit with you all day usually do not have the education or experience to have any real business working with mental health disorders. I felt like I needed someone who actually knew how to help me or recognize I was struggling (more due to PTSD than ED) but instead got glorified camp counselors hired with little to no background in mental health.   I’ve become pretty jaded with the eating disorder treatment community. I think a HUGE reason that both relapse rates and dropout rates are so high isn’t because eating disorders are difficult to treat, but because the standard of care is such poor quality.",False,False
