Starting friday I've got: 4 days in a hotel and eating out with family, aside from the two large family dinners 2 of those days, one drinking and cookies night, one potluck with friends after a lunch with friends, post Christmas dinner with the grandparents, and a new year's eve party/potluck. Everyone at work is so excited to have days off...and I'm freaked the heck out because january is cultural diet obession season and I'll have had 7 days in 2 weeks of large unavoidable food events.

Or does your family know about your ED?  Sometimes honesty helps.   I’ve had my ED for about 7 years now and I confided in my family about it about 2 years ago. They now know I get stressed out during the holidays, so they make me a special little “healthy plate.” They even include the tiny utensils :,)  But if hey don’t know about your ED and you’re not comfortable with telling them, you could always just load up on healthier stuff like salad and roasted veggies.   It can also help if you focus more on the social aspect of the family dinners than the food/eating aspect! Take the time to catch up with your family members!  Best of luck friend!❤️❤️❤️",False,False
