Eating disorders that are unresolved within 5 years of the onset of fatigue/pain are considered “exclusionary” in the diagnosis of CFS. In other words, you technically can’t be diagnosed with CFS if you’ve had an eating disorder within the past 5 years - for the exact reasons you mention - EDs mess with your body, so it’s impossible to tell if the fatigue/pain are due to CFS or an ED (since neither illness has a diagnostic biomarker). Hope you get some better answers soon so you can start to feel better. ",False,False
