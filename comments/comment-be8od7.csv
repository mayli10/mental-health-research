I know how you feel (I used to be extremely extremely obsessive about calories but I'm currently just a fat lazy fuck) but *please* stay safe. I know it sucks to feel like you're not thin enough but that's already like, lower than I've ever been and I'm 5'0"". Please, please, please remember to stay safe and to make sure you're not doing irreversible harm to your body.",False,False
