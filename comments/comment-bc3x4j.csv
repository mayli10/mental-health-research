Basically, you have to stop and force yourself to find one thing you can see. Once youâ€™ve identified it, focus on it for a little while. Describe it to yourself. Then move on to something you can feel. Analyze it. Not an emotion feeling, something you can physically feel like your feet flat on the ground for example. Then something you can smell, then something you can taste, even if itâ€™s just the inside of your mouth or if you just licked an envelope lol, and finally something you can hear. It helps trick your mind out of the racing thoughts. Maybe give it a try sometime if you feel comfortable? I hope it helps!",False,False
