It's 1:30 a.m. for me and I'm actually only awake right now because I've been agonizing over the brunch menu for the place I'm going for my friend's birthday tomorrow. This place doesn't have a calorie count, but I definitely don't trust the calorie counts on menus in general. So stressful",False,False

We took the kids to Olive garden on Tuesday for a night out so I ordered the soup and salad and then ended up eating part of my daughters mac and cheese and a bite of everyone else's.

I want to eat alone. Calories are not a big problem because for example, if I know I’m going to eat out for dinner I restrict during the day. I feel a bit less guilty. ",False,False

I'll order a Diet Coke or coffee and tell the waitress I'm, ""Just here for the company.""  Otherwise I'll get only a side salad with the dressing on the side and pick at that.  One thing that's helpful is the people I would usually eat out with have shit taste in food and restaurants, and they go places where I wouldn't want to eat the food anyway. No big loss there. But if they could see me on a binge day when I go have gourmet Italian or Chinese, they'd never be able to keep up, haha.",False,False

You know those restaurants prepare it lighter when they send it off to be tested. I’m the same way. I hate when they drench a perfectly good veggie in butter or oil.

I generally avoid restaurants but a few weeks ago I went to a BJ’s Brewhouse and found a 600kcal “light fare” zucchini noodle chicken. Only, when it came out, it was literally swimming in cooking oil. I asked for something else and asked if the Brussels sprouts could be steamed, yes they could.   I got them and also swimming in oil. Pan fried. I explain I ordered them steamed. “Oh we don’t make them that way, just be glad they aren’t deep fried ha ha”  I hate restaurants. ",False,False

If it’s not I’m internally screaming and stressed and more likely to end up purging. I can’t focus on being with the people I go with. It’s all about food and ordering what will “do the least damage” and how fast in eating compared to others and I fucking hate it.,False,False

I have my safe places that I only eat at.   It’s sucks because tonight for instance I’d like to go to a nice romantic meal with my wife and there is a nice Italian place by our house.  I just can’t bring myself to eat pasta and bread and a Caesar salad and wine and not knowing the ingredients and calories.   Did they use oil in the sauce? What about the chicken? ,False,True

Or they don't list the calories. So either way I end up terrified and can't decide what to choose. I also dislike eating out because I don't like eating in front of people. I find it very stressful.
