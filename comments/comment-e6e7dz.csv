You, just like everyone else, make mistakes. So you could have been nicer with the subject. So you shouldnt have assumed him being a man eliminated any chances of him having an ED. Cant do shit to change the past now, and that's okay. Just accept your mistake and move on. Use this as a learning experience rather than an opportunity to step yourself further into your own self hatred. Outlook is everything. Instead of beating yourself up for this one let it go and be proud that you're emotionally mature enough to recognize that you have some room for improvement.",False,False

From what I gather, he was eating during a 4 hour work shift, correct? I’m sorry but he can wait to eat after or before he works. It would be one thing if it was an 8 hour shift and he didn’t get a lunch break, but 4 hours is pretty much the minimum work shift available. Now, of course, say he works multiple jobs and literally doesn’t have time to eat in between these jobs, that would be a separate conversation. Or, if he was in recovery in a specifically timed eating schedule. But, don’t blame yourself. Housekeeping is a time crunch as it is, and I’m sure you were nice about asking him. Most other companies wouldn’t be so nice about it since it’s pretty common knowledge/work policy not to eat unless you’re on a mandated break.",False,False
