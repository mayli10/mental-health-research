I've got an embarrassing story that might make you feel better..? Once, when I was in a big over exercising phase, I was running on the treadmill. Well, I was on mile 8 and had that runners high going strong and didnt want to stop to change my tampon, so I pulled it out mid stride and it fell on the floor and after I was done running I forgot about it...and my dad found it. Yeah. Couldn't really explain that one. Probably shouldn't be sharing that, either ðŸ˜‚",False,False

Like I said you've been more honest and open about this than a lot of people would have been. You should be super proud of yourself for being the sort of person who DOES care and DOES reach out and talk to people to figure out what to do next.   You're a good person.

My dog has eaten more oatmeal than I can say because he was a greedy and sneaky little monster.   Even if the dog at the plastic it's usually fine.  I dog sit too and recently looked after a pup who had swallowed - now this is disgusting - a dog poop bag full of his own poop. He hadn't passed it through so I had to keep an eye out for the bag coming out of him while I was looking after him. Gak. It happened, took him for a walk and he pooped out this long disgusting plastic shit.  Anyway, long story short is that dogs are capable of eating all sorts and being totally fine. They're natural scavengers and have sturdy stomachs. MUCH better than human stomachs.",False,False

I've covered the whole shebang in the past like 4 months.   its so embarrassing to think about. and like my busted ass brain is like...you're not sick yet, you dont look skinny enough yet for people to worry. so im trying to downplay what i said in my frenzied texts.   yeah i downplayed how much food was in the trash too...she ended up texting me back and saying she didn't notice. THANK GOD. but omg. youre so right. it represents everything ive bee. hiding...like...my dad even said he c/s carbs while on atkins. so like its something people do. but just my ED brain totally shorted out. wow like its truly eye opening. i wish i could delete a text that has been sent to my poor aunt.   i love her so much. she really only told me about her bulimia a couple years ago and i promised i would never do anything like that to lose weight. and like...thT honestly was the thing keeping me from purging all this time. so. idk   thank you for talkimg to me. im so ashamed of my reaction. of this post.",False,True

The dog getting in to the trash is an accident. It must feel like a huge deal because what's in the trash represents your ED and secret.   Here are some things to think if your mind is spiralling: The dog can't talk and will never tell anyone what it ate.   - Whether food is fresh, stale or chewed and spat, it's still just food and is very very unlikely to hurt the dog.   - People have left over and wasted food in their trash all the time, it's normal, it just feels like it isn't normal to someone with an ED because our brains are ridiculous. You can just tell her it was leftover/unwanted food, there's nothing weird about that.  - You are already handling this in a very strong way. A lot of people would not have said anything so that fact that you have told your friend that her dog has eaten something he hasn't will only improve the way she sees you. She's going to trust you more for being honest.  - Last one... it's a tough one but it's worth saying... your reaction to this just shows you how bad you feel about C/S. Maybe this could be used as a turning point to try to break the habit. I won't preach recovery because I am in relapse and have my own habits but this is clearly a big thing for you and it could be seen as a positive turning point.    I hope all that helps? I'm going to be on my phone for most of the day today because I have a hospital appointment so if you need someone to message as this goes on feel free to message me. You got this! You can get through this.",False,False

You don't have to say exactly what the dog ate.  I've grown up with dogs and they can eat basically anything. If she asks just say you had some stale bread and left over snacks in there.   If there was a lot of chocolate then tell her there was left over chocolate because dogs can get sick from that.   You definitely don't have to tell her that it was C/S stuff.
