Sometimes it's 80% nutritional foods which lowers the calories too.  It means I get more vitamins and good stuff in a binge and makes the cravings for the next binge weaker.   I literally made this method up myself after so many years of trying to get help but it works for me.   A shit ton of chocolate bars and a banana is better than a shit ton of chocolate bars and no banana.",False,False

I've been on this same pattern for a really long time but more and more I am finding another step. It's taking aaaaaages. The best thing that has worked for me is being just slightly more aware of binge foods.   I go to the shop to buy the normal junk like chips, ice-cream, cake, biscuits etc but I am slowly training my mind to look at the rest of the shop too. I go around making bargains in my head like ""if you're going to eat an entire pint of ice-cream and a shit load of crisps then you damn well will eat a banana/avocado/insert other high fat or bad fruit or veg here"". ""If you're going to eat a fuck ton of pasta and sauce tonight then you'll damn we'll eat it with a salad"" That sort of thing. Basically I have added extra food to my binge foods but it's actually working! Now I am more likely to choose a banana instead of a huge chocolate bar, or a yoghurt instead of ice-cream.   Bananas used to be a mega fear food for me so putting them in to the 'binge' catagory had a weird effect of making them a 'good' binge food.   Does this all make sense?",False,False
