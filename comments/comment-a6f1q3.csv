I also just felt gross all the time. Then I went plant based to lower my cholesterol and it helped me lose weight faster and keep it off. Also my blood work is better than it's ever been now. I'm not deficient in anything and my cholesterol levels are normal again. ",False,False

They give you immediate energy and will fuel your brain especially. Surviving on fat and protein alone will keep some of your basal needs in check for a while but it‚Äôs not sustainable and is in fact dangerous as it can cause kidney and liver problems, lean muscle loss, decrease nutrients necessary for organ function (including brain and heart function), and typically is only helpful for weight loss for a short period. Most doctors will advise against keto long-term without strict doctor supervision as a medical necessity. This is because in order to replace the nutrients you lack, you have to closely monitor the other foods you‚Äôre consuming. Unsupervised keto dieters may end up taking in more saturated fats or cholesterol which causes heart problems.  &gt; Critics say the keto-type diets usually work only in the short term and can be unhealthy.  &gt;For starters, most of the lost weight is water weight, according to Lisa Cimperman, R.D.N., a clinical dietitian at University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland, Ohio, and a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.  &gt;...  &gt;‚ÄúKeto diets should only be used under clinical supervision and only for brief periods,‚Äù Francine Blinten, R.D., a certified clinical nutritionist and public health consultant in Old Greenwich, Connecticut, told Healthline. ‚ÄúThey have worked successfully on some cancer patients in conjunction with chemotherapy to shrink tumors and to reduce seizures among people suffering from epilepsy.‚Äù  &gt;In the general population, Blinten said a keto diet should only be considered in extreme cases.  &gt;‚ÄúIt can do more harm than good. It can damage the heart, which is also a muscle,‚Äù she explained.

Also:  &gt; In addition, some diets restrict carbohydrate intake so much that in the long term they can result in vitamin or mineral deficiencies, bone loss and gastrointestinal disturbances and may increase risks of various chronic diseases.
