That's all!"" train whenever people talk about their real, lived experiences with how they are treated before/after weight loss/gain.  I am no more confident than I was before I started losing weight. If anything, I'm less confident, since I only really started to scrutinise my body and how it looked once I started restricting. But I *am* treated better.  Also, plenty of people gain weight without being hyper conscious of it and so are acting the same as they ever were, but notice they're getting treated worse, and then they realise how much weight they've gained and put 2 + 2 together.  More objectively, it sucks to see people participating in the exact same behaviour that gets fat people ridiculed but they get a pass - or even praised for it - if they're skinny. The quirky fit girl is fun - the quirky fat girl is annoying. The geeky fit guy is sweet - the geeky fat guy is gross. The confident fit girl is inspiring - the confident fat girl is delusional. Obviously not everybody thinks that (before people come in to say ""I was skinny and quirky and people said I was annoying-""), but enough that it's an observable pattern.  Absolutely, a lot of people who intentionally lose weight or tone their body will feel more confident, and that confidence will show in their behaviour and personality, which of course is more interesting and attractive to others than someone with low confidence. But fat people are judged more harshly than thin people, with degrees ranging on how fat/thin they are, and trying to dismiss all of that with ""it's just confidence"" doesn't help anybody.  Also... I don't know if you've noticed, but the examples you brought up of ""confidence"" after losing weight all had to do with people accepting you/being nicer to you because you were skinnier, and your internalised impression that people dislike fat people, so can we really say that they have nothing to do with each other?",False,False

I'm still overweight, but with my height and build I look more like the average for my area. So basically I don't stick out as being so fat like I did before. I felt like I'd noticed people being nicer and friendlier and more receptive to me than before if I was in a good mood, and also more apologetic/understanding of me if I was in a bad mood (and, lbr, we get hangry a lot). I had a couple of moments of ""Oh, that was a pleasant interaction-!"" before I realised that it's because I'm not as fat any more.  I help a friend sell her handmade stuff at a market once a year when she visits my town and the differences in people's reactions to me this year vs. last year was INTENSE. People were generally more interested in what I was saying and you're exactly right - looking back on it, people were making excuses not to talk to/make eye contact with me, listen to me, etc. I didn't realise why at the time (I just figured, y'know, people are awkward around salespeople) and now I'm like oh... no... it's totally because I was way fatter before.  It really is like a sliding scale where you can see people start to treat you just a little better when you get a little thinner. I think thin people (especially people with EDs) struggle with the concept of ""thin privilege"" because we hear ""privilege"" and we automatically assume that it means they can't have any problems, or that their problems aren't valid, etc. But like... one, of course you can still have problems when you're thin, and yes body shaming happens to EVERYONE, but until you've been fat... you have NO idea what totally other plane of existence it is.",False,False

I have never been overweight, but I was definitely more “average” than skinny before so I guess I was mostly just “there”. Not treated badly, but not really noticed. Idk. It almost validates my irrational fears about being at a healthier weight again, even though I know it would probably be for the best.

Sure i faked it but everyone who really knew me could tell it was a sham. anyways when i became underweight people kind of... became more open to me i guess. i mean i still had tons of friends while fat because i was “funny” and “i brought energy to the conversation” (dont have energy anymore tho :/)  i thought it was because i looked more visually appealing and took up less space, but in reality it was because MY ATTITUDE changed. I became more social the skinnier i got because i felt that i could finally stand around in a circle at lunch with my skinny white friends and not look out of place.  I could take a photo and look like i BELONGED to the group. i was finally done with being the friend nobody wanted to date. And best of all i got over my fear of touching people, its irrational i know but i felt people didn’t want to be touched by a fat person so i hardly made physical contact. But now i can sit at a bench and have my knees touching someone else’s and not have a total panic attack over it.   so in conclusion skinny privilege is built up of how people see you and how you act. they visually see a skinny person and i guess that someone equates to nice in this society or maybe it could be weakness.( weakness could translate into being nice but thats is another discussion for another time.)   And the second part is how you act. If you are verbally more outgoing and friendly due to being skinny and feeling great that could also attract “skinny privilege”. anyways thanks for reading my rant, i kinda got off track but i think i hit the mark in the end. kinda...   *(put that in quotes because every time i ask someone when they remember if i was “fat” they just say “You werent fat. You just had a bit more meat.”  which in hindsight i was only SLIGHTLY overweight)",False,False
