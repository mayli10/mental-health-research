I mean I have to go at least 18hrs every day but while I’m fasting I’ll drink lattes and coffee w/cream and sugar. It probably does bring me out ketosis or whateve but I can’t just sip on water and 0 cal energy drinks all day LOL 🤷🏿‍♀️🤷🏿‍♀️🤷🏿‍♀️🤷🏿‍♀️,False,False

I used to he able to lose lots of weight by fasting and just chewing gum and sipping 0 cal tea but now that I'm at a much lower weight It's hard to lose even 1 pound by fasting. ,False,False
