Logically, I know that I am neither completely ugly nor extremely fat. However, that is what I see in the mirror. I don't think I will ever completely overcome my mental barriers.. they are part of me, but at least I would like to understand and be able to talk to people without fear of rejection.",False,True

In the past whenever I try to reach out and talk about my dysmorphia or how I saw myself, people would invalidate it with things like ""Shut up, you're tiny"" or ""I would hate to know what you think of me"". After a while I stopped talking about it all together. No one knows how I actually see myself. Everyone assumes I just see what they see and deem it ugly, when in reality: I don't see what they see at all. It frustrates me to no end.",False,False
