I lost weight initially but within a week had gained it back and a few days after was up from my start weight. I continued to steady gain though not in a linear way more in a lose .2, gain .4 type of way. I stopped gaining last week as I reduced calories to 2,000 (I just needed a little break). I‚Äôll up them back to 2,500 next week as I have another 2 kilo to gain",False,False
