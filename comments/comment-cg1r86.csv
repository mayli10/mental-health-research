And I’m kind of excited but terrified to weigh in this week and see if I’ve lost, gained, or maintained. It would be cool to lose and know that I could maybe try the full meal plan without being so worried about gaining.",False,False

I'm eating 3 meals and 3 snacks and I actually haven't gained a pound. I'm somewhat frustrated because I feel like I'm eating 24/7 and I can't possibly eat anymore. My body apparently doesn't agree though...more food it is. I do love trying new things, though, and my mood has been much improved, despite the intense guilt I feel over eating so much more. It's crazy how much an eating disorder twists things!",False,False
