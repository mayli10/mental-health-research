I get the unsweetened vanilla or hazelnut syrup and then add sugar because it comes out as fewer calories than if you get the sweet flavored syrup but tastes the same. There are probably lower cal options, especially if you add splenda instead of sugar, but I'm fine with what it comes out to personally because drinks are the only sweet thing I really have.",False,False

I get dunkin every day, and I've just about mastered the menu. Personally, I love creamy and sweet. There's a way to hack it. It's very simple. I will usually do a small or medium coffee. Make sure you ask for 1 cream (super important cause they usually through 3 of those bad boys in u less otherwise stated) which one cream usually rounds out to be 35 calories. Then I ask for 4 or 5 splendas depending on your taste. On the occasion I'll get 1 pump of a flavoring but I specifically ask for JUST one cause they'll pump half the bottle in there if you don't ask specifically.  And that's it. You can get away with a creamy, low cal coffee by limiting the cream and adding splenda. If you can't handle splenda try 1 cream and 1 pump of flavoring which is pretty sweet in itself. 1 cream = 35 cals and up to 3 creams is 100 cals. So if 1 cream isn't enough you can get away with 2 and have a delish 60-100 cal coffee! ",False,False
