It’s sucks seeing the sizes, but you can get to accepting that later. The clothes have to fit. Get rid of the old smaller stuff.   Think of this as your new normal. It takes time to get used to. It doesn’t always feel good. But I try to tell myself, this is what your healthy body looks like. Sometimes recently I have moments where I feel PROUD of my body because it’s healthy and it’s been so hard to get this far.  Everyone has something they don’t like about their body. A lot of people don’t let it impact their life. How freeing would it be to be one of them?  Do some worksheets! We did this in treatment and it’s very grounding. Pinterest has a ton, and you can also google body positivity worksheets.  Body acceptance is the first thing to go when you get sick and it’s the last thing to come back when you recover. But you will get there. It just takes time.",False,False

I can totally zoom in on physical attributes/changes that I hate and that distress can just amplify and amplify until I’m about ready to claw off my own skin. But if I focus on the things a nourished body and mind can do for me...that helps? Running really helps me trust my body more - to trust that it is a good body. I can stand up without greying out. My heart is reliable. I can think clearly. I don’t have to be constantly going to medical appointments, and worrying about those appointments, and dealing with medical bills. I can have interests and conversations outside of food. I can be part of life in a way I can’t when I’m restricting intensely or when underweight.   Though for me, hating myself is also a much broader and deeper thing than my physical appearance. It’s been a loooong slow process of starting to look at the foundational ideals of my life that were preventing me from feeling ok about myself, from feeling like enough, from feeling at peace, from experiencing love. A good therapist and a couple of really wonderful irl support people have been an important part of that process. (And a lot of time.) At my first therapy appointment...ohhh, almost 5 years ago now, I told them “I just want to not hate myself, but I don’t really think that’s possible.” But I’m finally truly getting out of hating myself with the fire of a thousand suns. Apparently while I may be intelligent in some respects, I’m a really slow learner in this area  ;)",False,False

After a year or so in recovery I didn't even think about my weight anymore (and I didn't get fat, just heavier than with an ED). I was recovered for literally ten years. Trust the process.  And don't relapse into BED, which is still a legit ED. Stay vigilant and protect your recovery. Good luck!",False,False
