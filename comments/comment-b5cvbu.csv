TBH I've been snacking a lot of shit because the company I work for has a lot of free gourmet snacks and my previously-food-insecure ass gained like 5lbs because I would go HAM on like all fancy chips and granola bars and cookies or whatever. I just went back to not snacking because I have no self control and every snack just leads to more snacks lol.",False,False

So like 2 hard boiled eggs, a cheese stick, some hummus, maybe a few other safe food things depending on where I want my lunch calories to be.  Also cooking a lot has been hard, so I'm doing a mix of meal prepping and having easy stuff on hand so that if I actually AM hungry, I can just grab something or throw something in the microwave. That way I don't also have the mental block of cooking.",False,False
