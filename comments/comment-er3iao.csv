I'm seriously bugging now, worried someone I know is going to find mine.   Aside from all that, I feel for you. That would be so so triggering. I'm sorry he ambushed you like that.

I appreciate your concern but this is private and I don't want to talk about it."" You could also go with most of the former, and a list of ways they could help, if there are any. Anyway, let us know how it goes.",False,False
