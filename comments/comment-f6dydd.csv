I'm so sorry.   And don't forget that the school scale is much more likely to have been off than your home one. You were wearing clothes, in the middle of the day (not first thing in a morning), it's not a newer scale and it's been much more thoroughly used.",False,False

Like I stepped on the scale and it was 150 and I wanted to die. All the other girls were just looking at me like wow she’s so fat. I know I was visibly overweight but there’s just something extra traumatic about having EVERYONE see your weight. I still get a little sad when I think about it ngl.,False,False

You have way more water/food weight after a meal.  If you usually weight yourself in the morning before eating/drinking anything (like I do) it's normal to see the number changing if you weight yourself at school. I easily weight 2 more kilogramms at noon than at 8am.  Don't be too hard on yourself.,False,False

I remember in elementary school (we were barely 9 years old) a girl got weighed and she was one of the first of us to be over 100 lbs and I remember people making fun of her.  It didn't even happen to me and it still haunts me. Especially the fact that it was done in front of the whole class.,False,False
