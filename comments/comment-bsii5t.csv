I've tried pressed fruit bars but I end up having to eat them every half hour or so to prevent passing out so it ends up just being higher cals than a protein bar.  Thank you for the advice tho &lt;3,False,False

Like (for myself) i consider over 600 to be high restricting but for a normal person I know that would be like shocking low. But then I come on here and see people talking about eating 1-200 daily and feel like a fat slob for eating 3 times that,False,False
