I've always been this way, as has my whole family (my brother is 6'5"" and only 155 lbs/70 kgs) so it's very likely genetic (I don't have any thyroid issues for those wondering). When I was young and all through high school I participated in a lot of sport such as athletics, waterpolo, hockey etc, so that was a contributing factor, but I have always had 3 large meals every day with snacks in-between and I love to eat. I have never restricted my diet and I have never counted calories; I always thought it a waste of time and I never knew how, and to be honest couldn't be bothered to learn how to count them either so I can't give you haw many calories are in my typical daily intake. I would definitely not say that I have a small appetite, however I eat relatively slowly but I will always finish everything on my plate otherwise I feel incredibly rude and disrespectful. I also generally eat whatever I want whenever I'm hungry or bored so my daily diet looks something like this:  breakfast: cereal and a cup of tea or coffee  mid morning snack: a slice of cake or brownie or a few biscuits  lunch: sandwich/wrap if I'm at home hot chips or sushi if I'm at uni  afternoon snack: same as morning snack   dinner (always before 7pm): This is usually my biggest meal of the day and it varies a lot so anything from pasta to stew to salad.  I will say that this year I have been far less active than normal (i.e. sport 2-5 day a week has reduced to maybe 1-2 times a month) and I have noticed that I am less toned and have put on a bit of weight around my hips, but nothing that anyone would (or has) noticed and my weight has stayed the same but fat is lighter than muscle ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø.",False,False
