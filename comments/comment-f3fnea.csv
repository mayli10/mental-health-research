I reached and surpassed my GW but I still get anxious when I add up my calories and realise I’m at/above my estimated maintenance. I’m still afraid to eat and just live my goddamn life. It really isn’t easy to just be “normal” as soon as you feel like you’re thin enough, it’s just the ED trying to convince you to keep restricting. I’m still experiencing health problems from rapid weight loss and extreme restriction that I thought would be fixed from eating at maintenance such as amenorrhea and I can’t help but feel like I’ve ruined my body forever. I cannot express ENOUGH how much I would recommend seeing a registered dietitian because I would give anything to go back in time and go down that path myself. Please take care of yourself, you’re worth it and deserve to be healthy. :)",False,False

Then you had to build a daily meal plan.    Personally, I wasn’t a huge fan, but I guess the goal was getting people with EDs to build meals without thinking about calories",False,False
