I think it’s amazing when people in this community post their break throughs and victories. To me, they’re very inspiring. I just woke up, and reading this gave me one of my first smiles of the day. I think talking to your mom and reaching out shows a lot of courage on your part. I think it’s so important to share moments like this on this sub, so again, thank you for sharing this with us all ❤️",False,False

It's a big day but I cant sleep cause my disordered brain keeps telling me I just singlehandedly ruined my chances at a good life even tho logically I know this disorder may not get me skinny but WILL ruin my body's ability to do what I want,False,True

Also, i don’t think anyone will be sick and tired of anyone’s posts. I can’t speak for everyone but i know sometimes (a lot of the time) i can’t help but to vent. Also seeing other people’s ups and improvements helps, or even seeing other people’s lows shows that people aren’t alone. I hope things keep going up for you.",False,False
