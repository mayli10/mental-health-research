Pretty much every dude I've ever slept with has complimented my enormous fucking ass and yet gone on about how cute some tiny little waif is. Like...you know I'm not the same size as that when I have the ""thicc"" ""bubble butt"" you love, right? You can't have both (at least not when you're a 30 yr old short-ass eating disordered piece of shit of Eastern European Jewish extraction...)  Like, it's annoying af. On the other hand, if you were in the mood for silver linings, you have a sister who loves you enough to hug and express concern and a friend who is interested enough in you to write poems featuring you :p lil bit jealous on that count tbh. Still, if people could just NEVER COMMENT ON ANYONE ELSE'S BODY EVER, that'd be perfect.  (apologies for anything, I'm pretty drunk tbh)",False,False
