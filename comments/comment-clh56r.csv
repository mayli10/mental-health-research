I was concerned too but when I started going I realise that people are too busy working out to pay attention to what you're doing; just go, do whatever you want to do at your own pace, don't worry about people looking at you! If you want to go on the treadmill only, that's fine. If you do want to lift weights, go for it; just don't push it too hard to start with or you risk injury.  There will usually be staff at the gym as well, you can go to them for any advice/issues you have with any of the equipment. Trust me, they're used to beginners coming up to them and will try their best to help.  A lot of the time I go and walk/jog on the treadmill while listening to podcasts for the entire time :)",False,False
