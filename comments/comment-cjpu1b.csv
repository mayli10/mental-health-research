I am constantly thinking about what I look like, and everything that is wrong with me. i use MFP and pre-log and re-log things over and over; I also will over log things, like I know a serving is so many calories, I will knowingly log that I ate more than I actually did just to make *completely* sure that I count everything.   But like then some days, I’ll eat whatever I want, and I won’t log a single thing, but I will absolutely hate and despise myself the rest of the day. My day will be completely ruined.  I don’t know. Maybe it’s more “disordered” eating.",False,False
