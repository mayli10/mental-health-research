I do drink a high protein meal replacement shake, but most of what I get through my diet is carbs and fat. I focus a little more on carbs because they help with my migraines. I do plan to supplement more protein in the future when I can afford to. I'll probably go for whey protein powder. Then maybe I can also stop taking a calcium supplement since whey is a dairy product. I try to focus on being as healthy as I can despite my current circumstances.",False,True

I made my way up to to maintenance calories slowly before I started trying to gain weight. Then gaining back up to a healthy weight took me a whole year.  I know that anything you do at all burns more on top of your BMR. At a BMI of 18.5 my estimated TDEE is around 1500 calories. Still, if I eat under my BMR that means I'm definitely at a significant deficit. I don't understand how I can eat at a deficit every day for months and not lose any weight. Yet now it seems that suddenly I have when I started eating above my BMR.",False,True

Your TDEE is probably 300-500 kcal higher than that even if you are sedentary. So yes, it makes sense that you are losing because you are still in a deficit. It has nothing to do with eating more than before, everything to do with still eating less than you expend.  You're on a good track, though. Going from a huge deficit to gaining all at once can be really hard, so if you try slowly moving to smaller deficit (like you already have), then to maintenance, then a small surplus it might be more doable.",False,False

I suppose that lately however most of calories have been from fat. I have been eating a lot more meat-based foods rather than plant-based foods.
