Iâ€™m in Canada as well, and I smoked from 14-24 daily with no problems. I quit for my boyfriend who is a staunch (gay) catholic principal, and didnâ€™t like it. (despite all of his friends smoking - who are all gay teachers. Hypocrite. )   He broke up with me and I developed an ED out of depression and couldnâ€™t get hungry, so I tried smoking weed again, and my heart would race and I felt like I was going to die.   Something that helped me sleep and relax me made me feel the opposite.",False,False

Iâ€™ve never had a problem, but then again itâ€™s never really a good idea to take lax unless you really need it anyways.   But yeah, weed lowers your blood pressure, so if you already have low blood pressure from restricting then youâ€™re in for a bad time. I get weird heart palpitations if I restrict before smoking which, on top of being pretty bad for you, just feels fucking terrible. Eat a little bit before hand (maybe something with salt? Idk Iâ€™m not a doctor) and monitor your blood pressure fairly regularly. If itâ€™s too low then maybe itâ€™s best to abstain for a while until itâ€™s back up to normal levels. I donâ€™t know where you live, but in Canada pharmacists and doctors are becoming more knowledgeable about this kind of thing, so you can always call a Shopperâ€™s (they have a medical marijuana branch of their pharmacy, IIRC) and ask a pharmacist  about what you can do in terms of harm reduction. You can also call your provincial healthcare hotline and talk to a nurse about it if your pharmacy doesnâ€™t have a medical marijuana arm (again, provided you live in Canada)",False,False

I used to have an increased heart rate while high, but since Iâ€™ve been restricting more/my overall RHR is lower, I get a super slow heart rate while high and I can feel it beating super heavily, if that makes sense? Like itâ€™ll only be going 44-46 BPM, but I can feel every single pulse throughout my entire body",False,False
