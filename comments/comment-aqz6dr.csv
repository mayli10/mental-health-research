I relate hard-core to everything you said. My main issue has always been my lower stomach pouch. I remember already as a kid wondering what a flat stomach would feel like. I only got there at 24. I spent hours and hours on end on the mirror, jn awe, touching it, i still put my hand on it ro feel it randomly during thr day. Feels weird. Looks weird  But great weird.  The whole weird emotions is such a bitch. Everytime i notice a new change in my body it's like i realize how fat i was before in places i had never noticed. So it's definitely bittersweet.  And yeah I definitely catch myself thinking ""now what"" but soon enough i find something else to focus on. Right now I'm focusing on a thigh gap, which i never ever ever ever ever felt the need to have before but that's when my stomach was my main problem in life. Now that it's solved i needed to find new ones and i did. I now hate my thighs. ",False,False
