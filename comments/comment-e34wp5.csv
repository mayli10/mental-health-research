It is mostly water weight, looking at your height your BMR is 1300 or more, so the most you could have gained if you literally did nothing all day is around 200grams or barely half a pound. However add any activities to that (even a short walk) and it goes down even more.  You said you drank a lot of water, which should in theory flush you out - but it doesn’t always work instantly - it can take a few days to work. Combined with pickles which are a high sodium food you are mostly likely retaining water. Especially if you took lax pills, Senna based ones make my legs look like dumplings next day! And if you were low carb prior to the binge and then had a lot of carby foods it will take a few days to go down as well.  Be kind to yourself, try some peppermint and dandelion tea and it will go away. Perhaps try to stick to low sodium foods to help it flush out? If you are really desperate you could try some herbal based water retention pills, just use as instructed since they can mess with your liver otherwise.  You will be ok! 💕",False,False
