It was just a troll, they were making fun of you and saying that you‚Äôre gonna die soon. It was horribly rude and I couldn‚Äôt just let them be rude like that.  I was hospitalized around this time last year and I know how hard it is. I have rumination disorder along with anorexia, so I continuously regurgitated food and they always thought it was me trying to purge. It was one of the worst times of my life. I know recovery is hard and you‚Äôre bound to fail a few times, but just keep your head up and stay strong! ",False,False
