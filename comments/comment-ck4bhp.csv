And tbh? I can't see myself ever eating more than i currently do.  It takes less for me to feel full now that ive adjusted, and i'm also more aware of how uncomfortable being full is  Once i reach my caloric limit for the day, i don't see eating any more as an option, so even if i did eat, i wouldn't enjoy it and even if i pushed my self-expectations aside, i'd feel guilty afterwards  My mental stability depends too much on the structure meeting my tdee and not exceeding it each day provides to deviate from it  I used to naturally calorie cycle (e.g. one day i'd eat 3,000 calories, the next i'd eat 1,000-- not that i kept track, but just, without being disordered, some days i'd overeat and then have less of an appetite afterwards and eat less the next day) but now i don't do that unless i eat above my tdee due to social eating and purposefully eat at a deficit the next day/a day in advance  I used to think fasting/eating at a deficit was a tool to eat more the next day and indulge. But honestly, whenever i've tried to do this recently, i realized it wasn't it and i wasnt going to enjoy it and ate at maintenance anyway despite being at a deficit from the day before.   I guess ""planning"" to overeat/indulge is never as good as when it happens naturally (which never happens anymore because I'm too conscious of my intake in the first place)  I remember fantasizing about being the weight i am now and indulging guilt-free, but now it's like, i don't even want to, and not just because of disordered thinking or because i'd freak out. But because it'd make me physically feel bad and it's not worth it when i already can indulge in moderation every day (and i do, i still eat junk). And because this is just my way of life now and i don't put food on a pedestal while at the same time also beating myself up the same way i did 30+ lbs ago  I used to be scared of developing binge eating, i thought based on the ED communities i frequent that if i deprived myself it'd come back around and bite me in the ass because that's just how it is. Used to be so so scared. But now I'm here and im find? Im underweight and my period is gone and i sorta feel vaguely tired 24/7 but im fine and my appetite isn't crazy and my body isnt screaming at me to eat and i get full when i do eat and i can still run long distance and im fine?",False,False
