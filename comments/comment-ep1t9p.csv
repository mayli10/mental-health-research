I developed my ed when I was a little dumb tumblr girl in 2014/2015 and they were pretty much just the sound track to everything in my early teens lmao. Especially the songs leave before the lights come on and no buses.,False,False

I think I've envisioned the scissors bit since 2nd or 3rd grade. Never actually vocalized it. Beautiful.,False,True

I’m off the deep end, watch as I dive in...”  Nightmare and Gasoline by Halsey. Relatable from start to finish, but especially: “Broke down and put myself back together again, stared in the mirror and punched it to shatters, collected the pieces and picked out a dagger. I've pinched my skin in between my two fingers and wished I could cut some parts off with some scissors”   and “low on self esteem so you run on gasoline. I think there’s a flaw in my code, these voices won’t leave me alone”  Perfect Blue Buildings by Counting Crows: “it’s 4:30 am on a Tuesday, it doesn’t get much worse than this...gonna get me a little oblivion, try to keep myself away from me”",False,False

Also look into the band Mother Mother. I'm not sure if one of the members has ED problems but the lyrics really feel like they know the stuff. They're much into mental instability and the struggle for willing to live, very much like ""hey, I'm a mess, everything is shit, I'm batshit mindfucked but yeah I keep trying because being alive can be beautiful and I'm gonna someday enjoy it too"". Which is basically what I need in those moments. Check on Body, Oh Ana, Mouth of the Devil, It's Alright, Get Up or Dance&amp;cry. Good for both quality sulking and getting back on your feet.",False,False
