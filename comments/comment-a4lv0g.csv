I grew up on comments about how tiny I was and then I hit about twelve and my latin hips showed up and suddenly they were the focus of any comments directed toward my body. It was pretty jarring for an already self conscious middle schooler. It also caused a massive identity crisis because I didn't really know who I was aside from *the skinny kid*. And here I am today, eighteen years old and missing those curves but still terrified of getting them back. ",False,False

My parents raved about how small she was, and she’d make fun of me for being fat. She once called me out on wearing tank tops under everything to like squeeze the fat lol and make me look thinner, which is 100% was I was doing but I was so embarrassed that she not only noticed but called me out in front of the family... now I’ve lost almost 50 pounds and she’s put on at least 30 and doesn’t seem concerned with slowing down... ha",False,False

My sisters use to make fun of how bony I was too. My body issues started when I was 9 or 10 and in retrospect that makes sense because I put on a TON of weight around that time. Nothing ridiculous, normal puberty weight gain but not being skinny anymore was so disconcerting for me. I remember I quit ballet in fifth grade because I thought I looked fat in a leotard.

I was the same size as my younger sister until she grew taller than me around puberty. I used to throw up a few nights a week until high school( unintentionally, a lot of foods made me sick). I knew people that were jealous of my vomiting episodes because it made me skinny. Like, I was skinny because I was sick, who the fuck would want that? I was always the small girl. ",False,False

Always so skinny as a kid but ate a lot (I was super active) and people always commented on how skinny I was. This lasted until I was in my early 20s. Still pretty small but my curves developed which I immediately hated because it took away my ""skinniness"". Through my experience with dating I have learnt that men actually prefer curves, and I'm working on looking in the mirror and trying to love my curves, and I really hope I do love them someday.
