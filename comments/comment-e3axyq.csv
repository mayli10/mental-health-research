I identify as a lesbian bc I am attracted to girls in every way, but I dont know if I don't know if I repulse guys because I think I'm too gross for them and they only want the body (MY body, which is gross). I have to go rn but it's amazing how I was wondering about this and it was just posted lmao ed brain everyone",False,False

I would hook up with guys just to feel better about my body because I never thought men really cared about anything more than just getting laid to anything. I got with my ex girlfriend through our shared ED past and I wasn‚Äôt quite over mine when we got together so we would both trigger the fuck out of each other. Now when I hook up with women I notice that I am attracted to women of every size but end up hooking up with really tiny petite girls with small breasts and and I wonder whether Im actually just doing this out of jealousy. I question my sexuality all the time, whether i hate hooking up with boys because it reminds me of a time I hated myself or because I‚Äôm jealous that I don‚Äôt look more like a boy and want to put myself in a position where I‚Äôm treated like one so I usually go for bi girls who prefer men (F19, i sort of identify as a woman?). It puts me in a weird position. Is this about my ED, body dysmorphia, gender dysmorphia, trauma, or just plain envy.",False,False

I just had a conversation with my therapist about this. Like, am I gay or afraid of men? Am I gay or just insecure around men because of stereotypes about their preferences?? Am I actually straight and only developed an interest in women because a woman showed interest in me? And am I only interested in women because I‚Äôm obsessed with body image and how I compare to those around me?   And I get the feeling repulsive thing. Like that‚Äôs very much at the root of my ED - feeling unwanted and unwantable - but the ways it‚Äôs affected my ability to experiment or date or now be married is wild.",False,False
