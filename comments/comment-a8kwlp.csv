I somehow managed to fill in the other numbers even though I don't feel a lot of physical sensations about how much I ate until I'm way too full. so I filled it in with what I do feel (which in my case is mostly emotional or social feelings).  and it's helping me a lot to log my food in a way that references those numbers instead of calories.... like ""I started eating dinner feeling around a 4 and then after 1 plate of food I was feeling a 6"" and stuff like that.",False,False

I used colors (sometimes more than one) to indicate how I felt that day and left plenty of space to write about what happened, how I reacted, etc. For me it ended up being more or less an anxiety log.   Then during sessions we could talk about specific events and days in more detail. ",False,False
