You‚Äôre definitely not stupid, it‚Äôs the disorder making you freak out. And the disorder loves to lie to keep us feeling like shit.

I have been over eating above/around maintenance with heavy exercise the past few days. I am currently ballooning up from food bloat and water retention and I feel massive but I know I didn‚Äôt do enough damage to gain weight, which isn‚Äôt as good as losing but it could be worse.",False,False

I mean, the immutable 3500kcals is how I tend to think too, but life and bodies are not perfect spreadsheets. And I certainly don‚Äôt want to invalidate OPs true lived experience.   If I can eat zero cals for four days and lose 0.2 pounds (an experience the universe has blessed me with)...is the math a lie? Or is it more that nailing down the exact in/out math for CICO is nigh on impossible and that in the short term there‚Äôs also loads of variability.",False,False
