I feel like anyone who struggles with food is a kindred spirit...we all just ""get"" it, you know? It's so isolating and mentally tormenting to constantly be picking apart your body and the way people view you and analyzing what you put in your body versus how much you weigh, etc. My boyfriend of 2 years recently broke up with me so I also relate to not feeling like people love you as much anymore. But you know what? Now is the time you have to love yourself enough to go the extra mile and invest some time in making yourself feel good!! So yes, shower, lotion, face masks, candles, dim lights, Netflix, cozy blankets, movie nights, do all the nice things for yourself! Part of why we binge is because we feel empty inside, so try filling yourself up in other ways. Of course still eat and nourish your body but just be mindful of how you feel before you eat. And for the veggies, do you have access to an oven? I really love roasting up a bunch of cauliflower. I chop it first from the head into smaller chunks and put it on a baking sheet with some salt. If you've ever used nutritional yeast it's a topping they usually have in the spice section and it has a very cheesy flavor but only 20 calories per tablespoon and it's a probiotic with B12, too! I love seasoning with that. I like to dip the cauliflower in ketchup (maybe too weird, idk haha). I also love to steam a bunch of chopped carrots with sea salt on them and eat big bowls of those, but if you don't have a steamer you can either put the chopped carrots in a pan with about 0.5 inches water on the highest stove setting or put the carrots in a microwavable bowl for about 5 min in the microwave with the same amount of water in the bowl. Edamame is also super good if you get the steam able bag kind and it's usually 130 calories for a huge bag of it that you steam in the microwave for 5 min. Lastly I get cauliflower rice from the frozen aisle, microwave it for 5 min in the bag, and season it with nutritional yeast and everything but the bagel seasoning! I usually make an egg white omelet with turkey to put on top of the cauliflower rice (1 egg, 3 egg whites, a slice of turkey, green onion if you want) and a tablespoon of hummus on top. It's incredibly high volume and filling. If you're in the mood for something sweet, chopping an apple and seasoning it with cinnamon and baking it in the oven for 15 min at 425 degrees is EXCELLENT, or you can microwave frozen fruit for a couple minutes to have a pie-like dessert.
