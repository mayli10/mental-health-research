I know it triggers binges for me so I don't keep it in the house. I also don't eat keto sweetners like erythritol and Stevie because I know it'll trigger me. Sometimes that's what it takes. The cravings have stopped for me,False,False

I just accepted that my cheat days will always be binges so I eat nothing else all day and then I tell myself I can have as much of whatever I want but only in one sitting, so once I’m full then that’s it. So I guess it’s not really a cheat day but a cheat meal? Cue me eating until I’m in physical pain and looking like a pregnant lady. It’s worth it for me, though, because it’s the only thing that keeps me on track the rest of the week.",False,False
