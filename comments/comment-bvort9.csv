I was diagnosed by my psychiatrists with purely restrictive, then B/P anorexia. The binging was/is due to ‚Äúrestriction‚Äù- after a period of malnourishment and starvation, when one's muscle and fat stores are cannibalized for fuel, it‚Äôs very common to binge. I was severely underweight when I started binging.  It complicates things even more when you‚Äôre an athlete in an endurance sport where leanness is emphasized, eating disorders are rampant, and training energy expenditure is high.   Here are the diagnostic criteria   From DSM 5:  Anorexia nervosa   A. Restriction of energy intake relative to requirements leading to a significantly low body weight in the context of age, sex, developmental trajectory, and physical health. Significantly low weight is defined as a weight that is less than minimally normal or, for children and adolescents, less than that minimally expected.   B. Intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, or persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain, even though at a significantly low weight.   C. Disturbance in the way in which one's body weight or shape is experienced, undue influence of body weight or shape on self-evaluation, or persistent lack of recognition of the seriousness of the current low body weight.    The minimum level of severity is based, for adults, on current body mass index (BMI) (see below) or for children and adolescents, on BMI percentile. The ranges below are derived from World Health Organization categories for thinness in adults; for children and adolescents, corresponding BMI percentiles should be used. The level of severity may be increased to reflect clinical symptoms, the degree of functional disability, and the need for supervision. Mild: BMI &gt; 17 kg/m2   Moderate: BMI 16-16.99 kg/m2   Severe: BMI 15-15.99 kg/m2   Extreme: BMI &lt; 15 kg/m2   Bulimia Nervosa: 307.51 (F50.2)  A. Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating is characterized by BOTH of the following:  1. Eating in a discrete amount of time (ex: within a 2 hour period) an amount of food that is definitely larger than what most individuals would eat in a similar period of time under similar circumstances.   2. Sense of lack of control over eating during an episode.   B. Recurrent inappropriate compensatory behavior in order to prevent weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting; misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other medications; fasting; or excessive exercise.   C. The binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors both occur, on average, at least once a week for three months.   D. Self-evaluation is unduly influenced by body shape and weight.   E. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during episodes of anorexia nervosa.",False,True

Just wanted to post a little comment about a misconception. If you binge and then restrict or workout to make up the calories, that‚Äôs considered bulimia (sometimes called exercise or restrictive bulimia). If you restrict and the lack of food causes you to binge sometimes, that may be AN. Not trying to diagnose, just wanted to share. Sending you love and support in recovery üíì",False,False
