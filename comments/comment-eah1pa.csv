I say this because from my experience, my mom is a yo-yo dieter, she often cooks healthy meals.  So I ask if she can make me some, or if I can help.  When she goes on walks, I ask if I can come with.  Like...using her lifestyle changes to help me get more steps in/eat healthier while losing weight in the process.  I also have kind of a strained relationship with my mom ATM...so trying to do small “bonding” baby step things like these seems to help a bit...  I can understand that your ED makes you perceive your mom’s weight loss as a threat.  Especially if you’re gaining while she’s losing.  But...your ED voice isn’t being rational and I feel like, if you take a big step back, maybe you can use your mom’s changes to help you towards your goals.    Also...good for your mom dude.  I’m proud hearing about her.  I realize how hard it is to see this as positive, but having an unhealthy parent would suck, having to watch a parent slowly begin to die from being obese would suck.  Have you ever thought about how your obese mom has fueled your ED?  What it was like growing up in a house with a parent that didn’t care about health?  Edit to add:  you’re not a garbage person.  The ED voice just isn’t always rational, that’s all :-)",False,False
