If you’ve been abstaining from behaviors and the thing you’re struggling with the most is bad body image, that shows how far you’ve come and how hard you’ve worked! There are some awesome body-positive documentaries, influencers, books, etc, out there—maybe immersing yourself in some of that might help? I hope it gets better and congratulations on doing this well in your recovery!!",False,False

Healing the body is only temporary unless the soul is healed too. That’s what I think is more important this time I think if I heal from within my body will naturally heal as a consequence and this time in alignment with my inner healing. Have you addressed what the root cause of your ED could be? I believe finding this and working on the issues around that is the key to lasting success and inner peace. Best wishes",False,False

I didn’t substantially address the underlying issues and wasn’t really monitoring the smaller signs going on mentally.,False,False
