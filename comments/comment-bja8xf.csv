I still look at the MPA community, and its absolutely still toxic. Now the site admins just get to profit off of everyone's suffering too.",False,False

Anyway, yes, it definitely was like that at a time, but it hasn't been that way for years. The mods will delete anything that teaches others how to purge, restrict, etc.",False,False

Unfortunately, I missed the ""prime"" age when I ""should"" have been using it around 15 or whatever, but even now, I don't really feel out of place. I think most people on that site are in their early 20's honestly. No one there is allowed to be overtly proED, and I don't know why everyone says it's not welcoming to all BMI's because no one was anything but sweet to me when I was at a higher weight.  I mean sure, there tends to be more anorexics and bulimics on there (I usually talk to the bulimics and they're all pretty sweet) and perhaps the user base is younger, but I think that's the only reason the content might be a bit influenced. And I do think r/proED was very similar before the Reddit ban. Idk, to me, all ED communities seem super welcoming.",False,False
