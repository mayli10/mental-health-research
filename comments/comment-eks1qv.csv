I've always had insomnia, and now I dream about binging. The other night I had a dream that all of my drains were clogged with my vomit. Woke up thinking it was real, freaking out about how tf I was gonna explain it to my landlord  On top of that I've developed night eating syndrome. Sometimes I wake up and eat like a third of the daily calories I allow myself, even if I try to knock myself out with Benadryl or melatonin. Apparently it's pretty common in people who have/had restrictive EDs",False,False
