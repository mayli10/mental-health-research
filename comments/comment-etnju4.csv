It's possible to fluctuate 10lbs in food and water weight alone. Speaking from experience. I've dropped 10lbs in 3 days before because I started out super bloated (after a binge streak) and shed a bunch of food and water weight. My actual fat loss was less than a lb.  Having a lot of water and fiber in your diet can help regulate that food/water weight because you'll shed it faster (water flushes out water retention, fiber helps move food weight through you quickly)",False,False

Our 2 year anniversary would have been in 3 days. The whole incident set me off into a spiral of crazy binging under the guise of recovery.

I’ve gone from 143 back up to 148 in two days then back down to 143 in 4 days of restricting. Not even heavy restricting, I’ve been eating 1000 a day on average since my last binge (which was only 1000 calories above my tdee)  I don’t get it, why is it so easy for me to gain and to lose?
