I'm writing a thesis right now and have to spend so many hours straight sitting down, my poor tailbone is bruising like crazy.",False,False

I also can't sleep on my back cause of it. Wearing belts is a no go aswell. Some pants I can't wear cause where the seam meets and makes that big bulgy square in the back touches it (what I mean [https://imgur.com/E3j7t8O](https://imgur.com/E3j7t8O)). I have to be careful when I sit on the toilet and not touch my tailbone to the back part of the toilet seat as that pain is Incredibly bad. Driving hurts for long drives even with a tailbone pillow.  &gt;any other ED people feel like through judging yourself and others you  isolate yourself to the point where people of normal weight aren’t even  attractive?  I definitely relate to this. Some people I used to find attractive I no longer do. My thinspo has slowly just turned into bonespo as much as I hate to admit it.,False,False
