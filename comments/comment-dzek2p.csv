I tend to get bingey in the spring and summer and restricty in the fall and winter leading to a never-ending weight yo-yo.,False,False

(oh, if i could go back :/ ) when winter/autumn started to hit, and my workload got larger, my exercise dropped, and i cut my net calorie intake beyond compensating for a reduced workout load.",False,False

I have bipolar disorder, and my mood phases are really intertwined with my eating habits. With mania I bounce between being great at restricting and eating all the things with reckless abandon. When I’m depressed I don’t eat at all or I b/p. Mixed states are the worst because I just get dysphoria and panic about food. Like I can’t even enjoy losing weight and feel like death if I gain it. I tend to have mixed states most in the winter.",False,False
