If I end up having those certain foods (which for me are often not strictly the most caloric, but the ones I enjoy the most) I feel terrible about myself for days on end.   I could binge on a “safe” food and take in 2x the calories I intended to eat and feel shitty but get over it, but those fear foods could be less calories but make me feel a million times worse.   I have tried to treat myself with those foods by planning in advance (“I’m gonna have a small portion of French fries Friday night for working hard all week”) that way I look forward to my allotted opportunity to eat those foods in moderation instead of feeling guilty.",False,False
