It was shocking to see myself from different angles (and he takes great photos) and I even thought and SAID to him, ‘fuck I look skinny there’  ‘damn look at my spine’ ‘I have so many neck tendon things lol’.   Like I am convinced I’m this bulky thing walking around being a tourist then the photos are like, you ARE quite skinny.",False,False

Not sure if it would help necessarily but it’s a thought!,False,False
