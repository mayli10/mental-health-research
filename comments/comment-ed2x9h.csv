Even if doctors say them, really.  the doctors that diagnose us probably spent a couple weeks max learning about eating disorders anyway.  I started out restricting, then starting puking for awhile, then starting binging and puking for awhile after that, then starting just binging, then starting restricting again,then starting puking once in awhile, then stopped...  it's like...your body mind/body is gonna do whatever it's gonna do whether or not there's a diagnosis for it.   Don't live and die by the diagnosis.  i know a lot of people like to say it is hard to stop purging when you start.  Sure, maybe.  I purge maybe once a year now.  It's all gonna depend on YOU.  You are more than any diagnosis or statistic.  This is what I hate about forums like this.  Anyone elses's journey honestly isn't relevant.   There's like maybe 2 people i've felt completely simillar to on ED subreddits.  The path that your are on with very likely not coincide with anyone else's so don't feel like it has to.",False,False

My ex therapist actually made me tally up all the money I‚Äôd spent on food that was later purged or c/s bc she knew I‚Äôm terrified of financial problems and over the last month alone it was something like $300.
