Either you have to look deep inside to find out your trigger, or one day it'll just come to you.  After years of on and off binge and restrict phases, I one day realised that I binge because I use food as a ""reward"". When I feel like life is beating me down I feel like I *deserve* to eat a lot. Like I'm entitled to eating more than I should be allowed.  After realising that, I knew I couldn't go back to restricting the way I used to, but I could find a new normal.  I would suggest you do that - learn the reason you binge and then find a new normal.",False,False
