After all restrictive diets are awkward socially and they require you denying your preferences. That’s one of the reasons so many people are overweight; when they try to lose weight they do it by unsustainable methods.  I’m not saying no one can do well on those types of diets but if they are doing well then they probably aren’t as restrictive as you perceive them to be. Like intermittent fasters don’t necessarily eat healthy during their eating period, and vegans don’t have to be healthy all the time to be vegan. i suspect a lot of people do cheat on these types of diets at least every once in awhile or they make them satisfying in other ways.  Maybe part of it is that they have lives that aren’t centered around food. They focus on food but they have a lot of other things going on which hold more of their attention. I think part of the disorder is that you lose interest in other aspects of your life, or perhaps you purposefully don’t focus on those other parts of your life because you become obsessed with your diet and you think it matters more than other things. I’m not sure what causes that but maybe it’s a personality type or a learned behavior.",False,False

They all just have a framework of foods they eat and times they eat, and those decisions are already made, so they just don't really think about it that much.",False,False
