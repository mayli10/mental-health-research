I've had mine since I was about 14, but it always got worse as school did and I took a long break after HS and I just recently went to my first semester of college at age 22, and of course the ed didn't let up in the meantime especially with the drugs I was doing my whole life until 2017, but I was barely eating on days of and surrounding my classes and then ""binging"" (what my AN considers binging) on the weekends, and I'm a writer so it only spins deeper and deeper as I'm trying to write a piece and am a total perfectionist when it comes down to final drafts. maybe TMI to which I apologize but I'm obviously not a solitary case and I've seen many much worse than mine, aka the only reason I noticed the rabbit hole my ed went during school related periods. but I can't even find a damn documentary on the mixture of school and Eds! you can find a thousand on dance or modeling in relation to Eds but none on academia's role and it is frustrating with the considerable volume of people who suffer during school or whose disordered behaviors were born out of their academic careers. so yes I will be DMing you! I don't care how dry the studies currently are, I'm curious to see even minimal data. thanks!",False,False

I felt the NEED to do this survey cause I've been trying to gather data on extremely similar things - even searching studies on the struggles of eating disorders in academia / higher education / etc. It's something worth a study and record of so I appreciate the work you're doing. thanks &lt;3,False,False
