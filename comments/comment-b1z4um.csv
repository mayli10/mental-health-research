I’m hoping this time next year to be done with all my surgeries since I should be at my goal weight by July, and will start getting skin removed as soon as I can afterwards ",False,False

When I show people old pictures of me they don't believe it.  I'm done with it, no more bingeing for me, I refuse to let myself go back to how I was. I miss the feeling of being able to just slide clothes on.   I found collagen tablets and wearing a sort of compression singlet/shapewear helped with keeping my skin in. Good luck with your recovery and I hope in the future you can finally feel comfortable in your own body x",False,False

I’ve struggled with BED in the past, though I’m now pretty much in remission or recovered from it (still struggle with a restrictive ED, but I’m doing the best I can), but that’s how I put on my weight. I went from 230lbs at my highest (I’m 5’3”, so that was MASSIVE), and I’m now 150lbs, shooting for 110-120. I know I’ll have loose skin, and I’m I already know what surgeon I want to take it off. I’m just done with this body. I’m done with BED, I want to leave this body behind me like I left my BED behind ",False,False

I went from 229lbs to 121lbs and then back up to 181lbs *gee thanks BED*. At my lowest I had a lot of excess skin on my stomach and when I began to put on weight that's where it went back to.   I keep telling myself as soon as it goes again I'll be happy. ,False,False
