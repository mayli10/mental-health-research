I was very relieved when my date woke up and told me about how sick she was the night before because I was absolutely planning on starving myself all day even though we were just planning to see a movie together and then head home. I really didn't expect that when I woke up, but it happened. Worst part is that if we did go out it would be totally obvious I didn't eat and I'm supposed to seem more recovered than I probably am.",False,False

It does get so lonely tho, but at least it's not another reason to beat yourself up or feel pressured? ",False,True

Fucking vicious. Tbh, I'm really fucking lonely, but I think I'm giving up on dating for now. I just have no motivation for it, and it just doesn't seem worth it at the moment.",False,False
