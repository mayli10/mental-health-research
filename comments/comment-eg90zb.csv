People can be so thoughtless sometimes.  Honestly, due to my paranoia and social anxiety problems just being around people triggers disordered thoughts. I always assume that everyone's staring at me and how fat/ugly I am, especially if they're smaller than me (which most people are). Before starting my meds I'd also hallucinate hearing other people's thoughts, always berating me for my weight.  The only specific situation I can think of that triggered me badly was when my therapist didn't believe I had an eating disorder because I wasn't underweight.",False,False

My ED is constantly invalidated by my weight and it makes me want to just never eat again so that way maybe someone will believe me.",False,False
