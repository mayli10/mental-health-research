I recommend that to everyone on here; I probably sound like a broken record; I'm not the author LOL. I'm on day 14 of not bingeing and so much of it is the strategies in that book about treating bingeing as a HABIT that you can break. The other advice I have is that for me the first day is the hardest and scariest and after that it's easier to collect days in a row w/o bingeing. So I just kinda keep that in mind, knowing it will get easier",False,False

I need to avoid sugar and anything with flour or lots of animal fats in it. That helps deter the physical cravings but the mental obsession is super tough to get away from,False,False

Christmas I forced myself to start eating because I couldn’t get up in the morning, much less cope with my Big Girl responsibilities and grad finals... and I never stopped. We are talking driving around getting donuts at different places and hiding receipts binging. I couldn’t stop.  But a couple of months ago, I finally got it to stop. I think 70% of that was that I had gained 17 lb in 6 months so my body was happy BUT it’s also because I changed my expectation. I started to meal prep, eating 3 meals a day plus 1-2 meals a day, at a ~250-600 cal deficit per my Fitbit. “Normal dieting” but it’s so much easier when I know where my next meal is coming from and I can have what I want. I know I’m going to slide off the rails sooner or later to fasting and 300 cal days, so while I feel like I lost my ed membership at this point, we all know I’m fucked up lmao. It’s working and I feel so much better.",False,False
