I think excercise always makes me feel levelheaded too. I don't know if it helps me feel more in control, or if its the hit of dopamine, or not wanting to ""waste"" my hard work by drowning it in cals but it works.  Postponing it is really good advice too. When I worked with little kids and they got homesick we used to do that to them. ""If you still really miss mommy in 15 minutes, then we can call her"" - but by the time 15 minutes went by, they'd be playing with their friends, misery forgotten. I think this would work on my ED brain too - ""ok, if you still really want to binge in an hour, you can do it."" But when that hour comes, you tell yourself, ""you know what, maybe one more hour""",False,False

Basically 3 weeks ago I managed to stop purging through bulimia and therefore those huge huge binges where My body physically couldn’t handle the amount of food in me.   I started going to the gym. Not even a big gruelling workout or to make up for the binge.  I just did it because I wanted to feel slightly less shit and maybe sleep better. So I ended up doing like 15 mins on the rowing machine not all at once. Side effects of exercise lessens anxiety depression etc etc which we’ve all heard before but kind of ignore🤷🏽‍♀️. I think the dopamine helps lessen the urge to binge A LOT and you’ll be probably be proud of yourself. When we binge I think we’re just trying to feel better. And telling yourself again and again that this is the last time and you’ll start fasting puts a lot of pressure and stress. I kept telling myself the same thing and my constant failure was making me feel out of control. So I told myself is that if I’m going to eat it’s going to be to repair muscles and I can postpone my binge to _ hours or tomorrow. I might be purging through exercise but I prefer that🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️😭😪💕✌🏽,False,False

Binging is the bodys natural reaction to starvation. You are not weak, your body just wants you to LIVE. I went through the same thing when I started recovering. If you continue to eat enough, you will stop wanting to eat as much (Look up extreme hunger). Don't punish yourself, use this as an opportunity to start recovering. If you recover, you will never want to binge again. You won't feel the high starving gives you, but you also won't feel the way you feel right now ever again.",False,False
