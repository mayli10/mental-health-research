Of course everyone is like ""it's water weight and comes off"" and I mean yeah I have ED brain but literally it wasn't coming off. I had been going to the bathroom, so I thought I was just gaining.. but I think I have IBS or something because I took some lax the other day and went, but then I took more the next day and well... My stomach no longer looks like it has been.. I didn't know I was so constipated because I was still having movements. I thought my weight was just up because of a fucked metabolism which is also still possible, but I learned that all the weight I put on wasn't all fat. Just something else to consider if you haven't.",False,False
