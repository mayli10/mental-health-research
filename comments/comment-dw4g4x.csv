It's so glib, it assumes people have money (if they live in the U.S.), not to mention roughly ten spoons MINIMUM (when most people in crisis have negative fifty spoons). It also pretends that ""help,"" however that's defined, is guaranteed to work even when OP is like, already saying they're diagnosed as treatment resistant, and don't even know what to do anymore, and has DEFINITELY ALREADY TRIED ZOLOFT AND CBT, JFC $ANALPUNCHER420$, CAN'T YOU EVEN READ THE POST???  I'm just so exhausted by Karens and Steves online who think they know how healthcare or mental illness works. I mean God I hate even my own advice, but I feel like it's at least slightly better than, ""Go to the doctor for magic pills and very cheap therapy, sweaty, and maybe also try keto??""  And I'm sorry you're stuck navigating these awful systems for ED care in particular. ED treatment is pretty hellish, when it comes to both finding affordable care, and finding practices that are taking new patients. It all just sucks.",False,False

I feel like if you are an adult it’s even harder to get help since most treatment programs are centered around adolescents. Also as a child, your parents would be the ones jumping through healthcare bullshit not you but at least you can’t be forced inpatient against your will so there’s that lol. But yea getting professional help does become harder.",False,False
