I've been lifting 3 days a week for the last 44 days (fitness challenge), but I've only been able to eat at a deficit a handful of the days during the week. B/Ps were killing my deficit. And some days, I had to eat normally/TDEE Level in order to keep myself from passing out.   I am 25, F, 300+ lbs. In my experience, weigh ins on days after being in a deficit showed to be my lower weight days. I'd lose on avg 3lbs in a 7 day period if I managed to stick to my strict 1000cal/800cal restriction model. But I found my scale has not really dropped due to TDEE or binge consumption. I am waffling between the same 5lbs due to muscle gain! My legs are jiggling less (not at all if I slap it while flexing!). I went from struggling to do a few tricep dips, to being able to knock out 10 in a row without a problem. Clearly, I have gained muscle. Its obnoxious and I hate it.   Tldr; Internet given advice is to eat a deficit to avoid muscle gain. My experience shows that at least TDEE causes muscle gain, which reflects on my scale as maintaining weight level. Deficit causes weight level loss; I cannot make it stick. I have managed to stay under my SW since lifting.  Edit: updated tldr. Still annoyingly long for a tldr.",False,False

So, your body retains more water in these areas to heal and make them stronger. I don't know how much of that's true since she didn't provide a source for her information, but (according to this info) if you're gaining the next day its probably just water weight",False,False
