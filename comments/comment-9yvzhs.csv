Four whole YEARS of recovery literally gone OVERNIGHT. And I'm trying so hard not to spiral into a crisis but I just cannot cannot cannot gain weight again. I don't want to be underweight Surprisingly d enough. I just want to be and STAY in a comfortable weight zone and NEVER have it change ever again    And the worst part is I don't have the body dysmorphia as bad as before so this time I can SEE it ACTUALLY working. So how the HELL could I give it up?   But I miss my happy life even if it was happy AND fat. I just couldn't handle being unhappy AND fat. So I decided why not be unhappy AND skinny. :/   Ugh I just miss being recovered and happy. ,False,False

Even for a day, an hour, or 5 minutes. Recovery is a state of being, but something that you are or you aren’t. It’s just a lot of small incremental choices that are bundled together and called recovery. ",False,False
