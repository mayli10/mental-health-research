Iâ€™m not even GOOD at it, so I can only imagine how hard this is for you. But I fell in love with running and I just CANNOT do it without going crazy. I have a genetic issue that made running too hard on my body and I switched to the elliptical but I canâ€™t make myself stop, itâ€™s even more addictive and I get far too destructive.   Do you have a specific schedule or program or amount of time you can follow?   For me, the only chance I have is to find a specific structure with hard time limits and rules with specific goals and to then ALWAYS stop when I am supposed to. Itâ€™s such a slippery slope. I hope you can find a balance, we shouldnâ€™t have to have everything get taken away by this. ðŸ’•",False,False
