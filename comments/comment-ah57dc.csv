I went to the doc, they did a laparoscopy (I think it's called that, camera down throat) and found nothing strange. I only get it rarely, more often when Ive eaten a larger meal but also small meals, I don't have tooth decay, I don't suffer from weightloss. I do, however, sometimes get food that is not acidic at all and is basically just the food that I just chewed.  Posted this cuz I googled around cuz I just got to re-chew some doritos lol.",False,False

When the food just comes up after eating, why keep it in, right? I actually had no idea it was a disorder... I just assumed I had a special kind of acid reflux or something lol",False,False

I also have this, though its undiagnosed as I've always been too ashamed to tell a doctor...I knew it wasn't normal, but only just did some research on it a while ago. Honestly its hard to live with. Its try to but its hard to control for me, I still do it unconsciously like only kids do according to what I've read, which isn't much but yeah. its ruining my teeth and my life and I guess I'm glad to know I'm not alone as much as I wouldn't wish this on anyone!

My food almost always comes back up and occasionally I have to reswallow. It happens Every time I eat, not just mostly at night as with acid reflux. Something to think about i guess.  And it does sometimes trigger purging for me. If i can feel it coming up, i take it as a sign that my body doesnt want the food so ED brain tells me my body knows I'll get fat and it wants it out.  Idk, i guess we learn something new every day",False,False
