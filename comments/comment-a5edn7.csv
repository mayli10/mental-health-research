If the tapping on your shoulder thing is literally, and not an exaggeration, I'm going to assume he's oblivious to how he comes off.   I'd just wait for the next time he does something like that and say ""could you please not comment on my food choices? It makes me really uncomfortable.""   Or I really like another suggestion I read, something along the lines of ""Yes that is a big muffin, but you don't have to comment on it. That's a bit rude, don't you think?""   I like to give people the benefit of the doubt, so I'm going to assume he's not that much of an asshole on purpose. and I think it's fair to tell him he's making you uncomfortable. I'm totally socially oblivious, and I would appreciate if someone told me I was making them uncomfortable so I could change what I'm doing. It seems obvious to us to not comment on someone else's food, but that's not necessarily obvious for every other human. If nobody tells him his actions are out of line, he's never going to realize he needs to change. ",False,False

I'd ask him if he thinks what he's doing would be appropriate to an obese person, taunting them about how they eat. He can go two ways, either yes in which case he's a TOTAL DOUCHE or no which means there's reasoning with him. Try to explain that his comments about your food are hurtful and that you don't think it's funny and that they impact you. If he's really the ""nice guy"" everyone says he is, asking him to stop should be enough. If he doesn't stop I would bring it up with a trusted manager. I would document when you told him to stop and any comments or behaviors that follow. If sending him an email is something you feel comfortable doing that is a great way to establish a paper trail and prove to your bosses that you tried handling it in a professional manner. Do not discuss your ED with anyone there unless you feel comfortable with the entire office knowing. I hope he's not really trying to be mean, but sometimes people are just ignorant to what they're comments could be doing to someone. I hope this gets better! You should feel comfortable at work!",False,False
