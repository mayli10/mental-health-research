The 12yo track runner that got too obsessive for 5 months and landed herself in hospital, scared the shit out of herself and her family? Fully recovered might mean going 100% back into normality.   The 40yo binge eater realising their disorder is affecting their family's relationship with food? Full recovery might mean they learn about nutrition and make a daily conscious effort to eat well. A binge might be triggered by social events every so often but it's within the normal realm of social overeating.  Me, a 18yo anorexic who also binges and purges, has had this for 9 years, has no identity outside of the ED and has little concrete grounding supports to BUILD an identity (I.E a supportive family, hobbies/passions, friends from pre ED, supportive friends, a career, a partner, etc)... full recovery might mean I restore my physical health through a very gradual and ""safe"" process. Maybe along the way things get easier and can maintain a balanced diet that is just ""picky"" instead of restrictive. I might have to find other healthier ways to control my appearances and body in order to recognise myself. Or to be known as something. Be distinctive in some way other than ""the skinny girl""  But this is has been a significant period of half my life that will not fade into normality. I will be forever shaped by my ED. I don't find it depressing or discouraging though, it's just how things are sometimes.",False,False

Psychologists have reached a consensus that once an ED has manifested itself, it never truly goes away. One can learn how to manage it and live a healthy lifestyle, but the little voice in the back of your head never goes away. You can just learn how to cope with it. What I've learned in my personal experience is that relapse is practically inevitable.",False,False
