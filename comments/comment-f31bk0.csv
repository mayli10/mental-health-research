I just really struggle with this. My imposter syndrome and anxiety are crippling at the moment and I keep having panic attacks where all my instincts scream at me to run away. My mind is so mean to me, I feel like I do nothing but hurt people and cause trouble and my self worth dives through the floor and I end up badly depressed for a bit...  I’m not strong or useful or anything like that... but I’m really glad of your support. I feel like such an awful person almost all the time now but I’ll try not to cut off everyone who supports me.",False,True

You aren't a bad person for having problems in any way shape or form. everyone has them, some people just need more support with them and that is completely okay and natural. You deserve to feel at home and accepted, and if this alleviates the pain even a little bit then there is no reason you should deprive yourself of that.  I know it feels hopeless right now, eds are shitty as hell. But happiness is waiting for you down the road, and you can get to it at whatever pace you need, no matter how slow or fast. You are so strong for surviving every single day of your life.   You aren't alone in this, and there will always be someone out there that loves you and cares about you (thats me! and your family, friends, hell, even acquaintances!). I want you to feel safe and supported, and one day happy as well. My dms are always open for you &lt;3",False,False
