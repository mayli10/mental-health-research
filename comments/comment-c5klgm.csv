This was so sweet and helpful. I tend to be, probably like most of us, extremely harsh and critical about myself. But I realize that my coworkers really ultimately were on my side and supportive and maybe I can use that as fuel to feel more OK at work. I want to continue to move forward in my recovery for me, not for some jerk anyway. Realizing that my feelings are OK, and not wrong or bad has been one of the biggest things Iâ€™ve had to work on as well.",False,True

You should be proud of yourself, too, for your strength and resilience. Take comfort in them; you fight an eating disorder every hour of every day, you're more than capable of handling one douchebag for the workweek.     The fact is the comment this asshole made reflects only on him, not on you. Reading this, I'm not walking away thinking anything about your weight. I'm thinking, Christ, he's working in healthcare and he can't be sensitive about a fucking medical condition? You really dodged a bullet there.      I'm sure most, if not all, of your other coworkers feel as I do. I hope it keeps him awake at night, thinking about what a terrible thing he said and how everyone he works with now thinks less of him.     And jsyk, it's ok to be triggered. It's ok to be frustrated and upset; the situation is frustrating and upsetting. That doesn't mean you'll relapse. You can have all the negative feelings you want and still be okay. Sometimes you need to spend time just feeling your feelings before you can cope with them or move on.    I wish you well! ðŸŒ»",False,False
