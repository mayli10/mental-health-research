I also don’t need any of the extra apps either lol so I’m glad that they have one that’s not like an apple watch so I wouldn’t be paying for something I wouldn’t use. And the price for it is awesome too! I was expecting it to be close to their others, so I think I’ll definitely be getting one soon! :)",False,False

It’s cheaper than other fitbits but the only difference is it doesn’t have phone apps on it, which I don’t rly care about haha.  The screen is also smaller so it looks more sleek and less bulky in my opinion, and it’s easier to sleep with. Plus i still get text messages that pop up / phone calls! I thought it was most worth the price. It’s also pretty new! Hope this helps (: ",False,False

It was TERRIBLE for me, honestly only made me binge more and overexercise more.     I would HAVE to ""beat"" the amount of calories I burned the day before AND then I used that to justify eating more, which would nearly always result in a binge.     I remember one morning in a fit of mental clarity, I was walking on my treadmill and took it off and threw it across the room because the only reason I was walking was to get to TWO THOUSAND calories before lunch, which is....well, stupid and and then I'm sure I binged on double that later.",False,False

First off I got the Versa, and zeeeeero regrets I love it. The most helpful thing for me personally is that it makes me want to be consistent. Not in exercising specifically, but just in general. I get addicted to the stars &amp; trends side of things, so the drive for me is to consistently wear it so I can track everything and over time see how I’m doing and improving. The sleep tracking/insights is my absolute favorite, and I’ve gotten way better sleeps just simply from being mindful about sleep+wake times and how many hours I’m getting. Second to that would be heart rate; seeing the average resting number go down over time is incredibly motivating. And then the calorie tracking/integration with MFP.  So at the beginning even though I wasn’t (and still not yet lol) working out any more, just the want to be consistent so that I could track stuff and see stats; that alone helped me make a bunch of improvements and I’m feeling way better and more motivated now to keep going and make more changes, etc  Sorry long-winded but hopefully that made sense xD  (P.S. woven band is where it’s at! I got a cheap version off Amazon but it’s 100x better than the sweaty feeling of the original silicone one, and doesn’t tug and skin and hair like the metal mesh one people rave about)",False,False

Sometimes I bring it out when I want to obsess over something and blindly follow it, but I take the info with a grain of salt, because there are inaccuracies in it.   However, if you see that your step count or Calories burned for the day are low, it *can* motivate you to move more!",False,False

For me, it's basically ruined my life because I've become addicted to seeing the calorie number go up and not hitting my targets is not an option. But, if you find that you struggle to stay active, it's definitely motivating.  Also, I wouldn't say it helps with progress because seeing the calories you've burnt feels almost like permission to eat more. As for accuracy, I'd say it's pretty good, although it tends to underestimate calories burnt (I know this because I've eaten at what it said was ""maintenance"" and still lost weight).",False,False

It motivates me so much to walk more, if I get bored I just walk around and watch the step counter go up. It motivates me to move so much more, and at least every hour. I love seeing my heart rate during workouts and it definitely motivates me to put more effort in to see that cal number go up. I went from being petty sedentary to getting 20,000 + steps some days just because I saw it displayed!  It also made me realize, even without the gym I can burn lots of calories if I can’t make it just by walking around all day, which doesn’t take toooo much effort. And I’ve been working out more to try and hit my goals.  Moving more has also made me hungrier, but you can connect it to MFP and it’ll show u cals in vs / out! I actually love my Fitbit, even for sleep tracking and it’s guided relaxation. (-: ",False,False
