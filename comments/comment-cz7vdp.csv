When I tried to eat closer to maintenance it came back MAD, like the worst period I've ever had.  Now that I'm restricting again its light again so I think the ""lightness"" of it is just like a partial loss of what it's supposed to be.",False,False

However keep an eye on that. Bleeding thru a tampon every couple of hours is no fun...but if it happens within an hour's time, make a dr. appt.   Wonky periods can be caused by so much. Take it from me, an expert at bleeding; it's much better on your psyche to just see a doctor and know for sure.",False,False
