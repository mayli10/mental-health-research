Every medication works differently but she just never ate at all, was really hyper and energetic and would stay up all night on it but when she didnâ€™t have it she would go through straight up withdrawal symptoms. I donâ€™t wanna scare you away from it but I just donâ€™t wanna see you fall to the other side of the spectrum :/",False,False

Fluoxetine is indicated for bulimia â€” so I think I was prescribed it for the BED since the two disorders are so close together.   Finding the right medication for ANY disorder or illness is trial-and-error! Good luck!,False,False

I looked up fluoxetine and I think itâ€™ll be easier to get a prescription for it because vyvanse is almost impossible to get where I live due to strict regulations,False,True

Be warned â€” itâ€™s a controlled substance, so your insurance company will most likely need a prior authorization done for it, which includes your doctor verifying that you meet the criteria for BED.   What Iâ€™ve noticed: Vyvanse doesnâ€™t so much get rid of my appetite as it does make me more ambivalent about it. I still get hungry for sure, but it takes longer to feel that way and I feel less hungry even when eating less than I used to. But the biggest thing is the ambivalence â€” or the lack of urge. I can eat a meal and then not immediately get up for more. I might want to â€” my brain might tell me â€œOh, that other food looks good, letâ€™s go get some and muck up our day â€” but I donâ€™t. I just donâ€™t have the drive, the urge, to get up and binge. Itâ€™s..... refreshing.   But there are downsides to it. On a higher dose, I completely lose my ability to concentrate. I have Raynaudâ€™s, and amphetamines are contraindicated for it â€” it makes it worse. My heart rate is always high (used to be 70s, now its high 90s on a normal day). Itâ€™s worsened my insomnia. And itâ€™s not the cheapest medication out there.   I would definitely advise having a sit-down with your doctor first. Have you tried other medications (e.g., fluoxetine or SSRIs) or treatments (e.g., CBT)? You need to take some time to figure out all the pros and cons of medication NOW vs medication LATER. The biggest thing to remember is that Vyvanse is a crutch â€” it wonâ€™t change your eating behaviors permanently. If I skip a day, I revert back to binge behavior. So itâ€™s important that you have a plan in place to address your eating habits alongside taking the medication.",False,False
