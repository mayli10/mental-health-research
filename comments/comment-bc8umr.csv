Potatoes are so filling and taste great because they can be made in so many different ways.

Brown rice, veg, sometimes chicken if I need the protein, both beans, corn salsa (no tomatoes for me because reflux) very light cheese (for the fats), extra lettuce, and rarely guacamole if Iâ€™ve been super low restricting for a while.
