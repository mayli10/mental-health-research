A rude woman I hadn’t seen in a couple years asked what my “secret” was in front of like 10 friends and family members who all went quiet and I blanked and said “good old fashioned anorexia”  I told her repeatedly that I wasn’t joking and she clearly had her own issues with food because she asked me how long I could go without eating and took notes on everything I ate that night, it was awful and uncomfortable.   (But I advocate telling people anyways because their reaction is NOT your responsibility! It isn’t something to be ashamed of and they shouldn’t be commenting on your body anyway!)",False,False

Someone I know recently asked me about my ""weight loss secret"" (I went down 12 BMI points in a year and have only been weight restored for a month or so). I told her I'd just gained several lbs and that I really wouldn't recommend anorexia - that cut the conversation short.  It's great to say these things in the most upbeat, chipper tone of voice possible. I hope my efforts will stop some of these people from making unsolicited comments about other people's bodies in cuture.",False,False

I feel I do not have the capacity to judge that. I just laughed out loud though — I *wish* I could do this. If you think your extended family can take it then sure, give it a go. If you’re at all worried that it might go wrong, I’d hold off unfortunately.",False,False
