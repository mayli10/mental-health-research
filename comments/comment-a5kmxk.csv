It's done in the morning on an empty stomach, when you have a few hours to spare (I usually leave myself a good 4 hours). Mix 2-3 spoons of organic sea salt (\*\*MUST be unrefined - I typically use pink Himalayan) + 1 liter of warm water and drink it ALL in one go. Tastes like shit.. so I squeeze half a lemon in there and close my eyes. Then, I rush into bed, lie on my right side, and wait. It takes around 30 min to kick in. Since your body doesn't absorb the salt, it pretty much goes right through your intestines. It feels like a painless colonic, if you've ever had one done! The goal is to end up flushing clear water - that's when you know your colon is clear.  &amp;#x200B;  Disclaimer: There are many many pros + cons to the salt water flush! I DEFINITELY recommend researching it yourself before you try it. I'm not a nutritionist or anything so please take my advice with a grain of salt (heh)!!",False,False
