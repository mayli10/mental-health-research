I don't have an eating disorder, but my sister struggles with bulimia as well as some binge eating. She never opened up about it, but I always knew and was so so worried about her health. That isn't the case with everyone, but there is a chance your mom already knows something's up and is waiting for you to be ready to open up about it. My sister is working on getting better, and it's a lot easier now that we can all support her with recovery instead of keeping it as a secret/ ignoring it. Recovery is hard, but your mom will be happy to work with you to keep you healthy and get you the help you need.  Merry Christmas!",False,False

Maybe just wait for a quiet/calm time to sit and have a discussion, highlight your health problems &amp; concerns. Really sorry I don't have any advice but I just hope it goes well for you. You deserve peace ‚ù§",False,False
