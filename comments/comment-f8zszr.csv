Tbh I just brought it up extremely bluntly, like, 'i feel like you don't care or that nothing is wrong, and that makes me feel in my stupid ED brain that i need to/have tacit permission to get worse.' But we were already drinking so i think I was braver and dumber than normal lol",False,False

I really needed to hear this, it’s so easy to get caught up in your own ED brain and make assumptions like “they don’t care cos I’m not sick enough/skinny enough/faking it”.  If you don’t mind sharing, how did you approach your partner about the subject?",False,True

Like at all. The whole time I had thought he didn't care bc in my mind I wasn't ""sick enough"" to warrant concern, he was terrified. He was frustrated. He was upset because he was watching me hurt myself and felt powerless to stop that from happening. EDs deal heavily in secrets and lies-- and he knew that pushing me might just as well force me deeper into my own hidey-hole of lies and delusion, u feel me? BUT it was really helpful to the both of us to have a straight up convo about it-- it really does pay to try to imagine how the other person must feel, which with our garbage brains isn't easy or even possible all the time. But know that your bf might be totally worried or be feeling lots of feelings about this and just isn't verbalizing it.",False,False
