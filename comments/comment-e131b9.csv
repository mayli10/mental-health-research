Kind of shows my mindset at the time. I just want people to know what happened and be really damn careful, because so many sickos see mental illness or disordered thinking and will use it to their advantage :(   But I’m doing a whole lot better, right now I’m making a yummy pumpkin pie with my brother, I haven’t weighed/measured in months, I’ve just done a facemask and I’m so happy with life. Recovery is good so I wanna use my bad experiences to help whoever’s struggling rn ♡",False,True

Thank you for being willing to share about it, it’s so important that people know what’s out there. A lot of messed up people like to target the ed community, and I’m seriously so so sorry that somebody found and took advantage of you like that. I hope you’ve been indulging in some serious self care and receiving the love and support you deserve, thank goodness for your friend telling you to block them!",False,False
