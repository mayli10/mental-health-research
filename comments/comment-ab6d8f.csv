I only got weighed a couple times a month and it didn't affect what I got to eat just how much I got lectured about being fat and eating too much (my food intake was carefully controlled so my weight wasn't really a result of my own choices anyway).  TO ANYONE WHO STILL EXPERIENCES FORCED WEIGHING BY A PARENT: Say no. I was 11 when I refused the first time. She got pissed, but my life got a lot better. If you can safely refuse (I know that this might not be possible for everyone) say that weight is personal and that you would prefer to keep your weight to yourself.   My heart goes out to anyone who has or is experiencing this. It sucks but you will eventually turn 18.",False,True

It was lunch time when a couple of faculty who weren’t involved with my case were talking about what they wanted. Minutes go buy and I didn’t get anything, so one of them asks, “Oh, aren’t you going to get anything?” And I quickly reply, “Oh, no, I had an apple earlier, I’m full.” Oddly enough, she laughs and says “I wish I felt full on an apple!” The other lady, however, was visibly uncomfortable lol  Not ED-related:  My mom and I were planning a get-together and she wanted to go get food. ED said no, obviously, but I honestly just wanted to browse a thrift store. I said that to her, and she turns around and says, “Why are you so against spending time with me?” I was... baffled. “I just don’t want to get food... I thought laughing about thrift store finds would be fun, but whatever you want, I don’t care...” She starts to tear up and starts this long spiel about how I must hate her to avoid her so much and yadda yadda",False,False

There was a display case with large, really good looking cupcakes, and they had calories on little stands next to them. They were all between 950-1350 calories each (yeah they were big, but the thought still makes me wanna die). My boyfriend asked if I wanted one, and I said “Are you kidding?

My friend was like ""Aren't you having lunch"" and without thinking I said ""No I drank some orange juice earlier."" She looked at me like I was on crack haha. The logic in my head was I'd already spent my lunch food calories on the juice. I forgot that obviously normal healthy people don't skip a meal because they had a 200 calorie drink.
