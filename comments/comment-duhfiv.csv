Or at least their models with absurd bodies are. Seeing them always makes me feel like garbage... also idk whose boobs are shaped like VS bras but mine are not. Like why is there either weird gapping or uncomfy smooshing?!? Nothing convinces me that my boobs are monstrously misshapen like trying on bras at Victoria’s Secret (their bralettes are comfy though and I like those quite a bit).,False,False

But then I remind myself that the pics are definitely retouched to look perfect. Hate that they do this when young girls like my nieces see this &amp; think it's real &amp; ideal.,False,False
