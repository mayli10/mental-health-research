You need to dilute it in water first before using it, but it gets the job done. When you go through as much Splenda Zero (also 0 calories, unlike the packets) as I do, it's a lot cheaper to buy and prepare in bulk. I made a template for a homebrewed version [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EDFood/comments/afcn8g/creating_a_shelfstable_true_zerocalorie_splenda/), which I've actually used basically every day since I made it a couple weeks ago. Just be careful with the raw powder. It's very potent, 600x as sweet as sugar. Even opening up the package, if you get the powder in your nose, it'll smell very sweet for a while.  &amp;#x200B;  I can tell you artificial sweeteners have never had any impact on my weight loss (I have a long history of losing and keeping off triple digit weight). As far as appetite is concerned, I think they tend to suppress my appetite overall, although in some people I have heard the opposite is experienced. All I can tell you is I enjoy using them, I think they are overall more beneficial than detrimental, and while I do many disordered things on a daily/weekly experience, I don't view my use of artificial sweeteners as disordered because I've experimented with eliminating them altogether multiple times and it's never really done anything except make some foods a little more boring.",False,False

It’s a bit pricey but tastes just like sugar and doesn’t alter your glycemic index as far as I know. I struggle getting tired after sugar so I substitute with this. ,False,False

I use it to make things taste a bit sweeter, like when I add a bit of raw cacao powder to my cereal or yoghurt. It's about the sweetness, not finding something as close to sugar as possible.
