My entire body bloats and gets watery and puffy and it's just uncomfortable and annoying and UGH.  When I was at my lowest weight, and even 15-20 pounds less than I am now, I never hated my body.  I WAS, however, terrified that I would gain weight and then would hate it.  (FFW to now and turns out I was very right.)",False,False

When I’m bloated I do not. If I overeat one day, even if it won’t cause real weight gain, I’ll be big and bloated in the morning and I’ll feel like shit even though I know it’ll go back to normal the next day",False,False
