It doesnâ€™t matter how much or little I eat when I stand up I almost always feel like Iâ€™m going to pass out and I usually canâ€™t see at all for about 30 seconds. My BMI is like 22.7 so Iâ€™m not even close to underweight so idk whatâ€™s going on. Honestly the only thing that helps me is standing up really slowly or getting up and then bending over or kneeling if I have to. Hope you figure out whats up with your bp and feel better!",False,False

I've had low blood pressure since I was a kid, and, naturally, restricting makes it a whole lot worse. Never heard of the stomach flexing thing before. Where did you hear of it? And for how long you should do it?",False,False

Thereâ€™s also bouillon broth and lite salt that you can treat as kind of a daily tea. Making sure you drink lots of water will help with both the bp and keeping the water weight from the sodium in check if that worries you, fyi.  I have low bp even when Iâ€™m in a binge/normie cycle, so I can relate to the struggle ðŸ¤— ",False,False
