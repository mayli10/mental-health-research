If your goal weight was underweight you may have an ED. If you have body dysmorphia, you have an ED.  That speed of weight loss is not too fast for an obese person, but for someone who's simply overweight six months is too long to keep up that pace. 24.5 is still almost overweight.  If you didn't know that you're losing weight too fast for too long, that's just a lack of information and not a psychological problem per se. The fact that your BMI was 38 is more indicative of a problem than having lost weight to (barely) get into the normal range.  Have you been losing weight at the same rate the whole time or has it slowed down? 7kg/mo should be hard to maintain at your current weight. If it hasn't been getting harder to lose weight, you should probably ask for some basic tests for other causes of weight loss like hyperthyroidism or diabetes.",False,False

Based on the given stats, at 1.76m you’ve gone from 119kg(ish) to 76kgs in 6 months.? To lose that much over 6 months (43kg/24 weeks)- you had to be losing around 1.8kg per week.   At around 7700cals/kg, you would need to be at a deficit of 13800ish cals every week, or 1970ish a day- which is nearly your whole recommended calorie intake, meaning you are taking in very few/ no calories, which puts you at risk for serious nutritional deficiencies from starvation, as well as potential heart, bone and other organ issues. After six months of this, your body systems are likely not doing great, and it is important that you are thoroughly evaluated to make sure that your body isn’t under too much stress.   If you are still losing weight, you need to slow it way down. Your brain and body need nutrients to survive, living on body fat doesn’t give you what you need.",False,False

It takes time and a lot of work in therapy to accept the diagnosis- sometimes I still try to convince myself that everything is okay.,False,False
