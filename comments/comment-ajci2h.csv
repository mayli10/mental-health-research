This is the hardest thing with this crazy illness. Everyone hears ED and thinks you have to look a certain way. It doesn't matter. The struggle is really real and it doesn't always show on the outside. I've been through similar experiences and made to feel like it's not an issue because when I'm not underweight. I hope your dad goes away and educates himself on this and gives you the support you need. ,False,False

A lot of people are quite ignorant when it comes to eating disorders. They automatically assume that an ED means frail, skin and bones. It sucks that people don't take the time to listen and see how fucked up this illness is but like many things, that is out of our control. I dare not mention my ED to anyone I know personally. I already have to deal with me putting myself down, I dont need it from anyone else. Your dad sucks for saying what he said and thinking the way he does but who cares what he thinks. One good thing I did gain from my ED is not giving a fuck what others think and feel about me. I am my own critic. And that's enough on its own.  ",False,False

People are so poorly educated on EDs that the average person cannot fathom the severity of it (though that is never an excuse to be an asshole). On the other side of that, we, with all of our experience, know EDs inside and out and I think it's more a matter of how the topic is approached that really steers the conversation.  I recently re-came out to my dad about my ED and I approached it as an opportunity to educate him.  I didn't want to come across as dramatic because in my experience that instantly turns people away, so I waited for a time I felt I could speak to him calmly about it. I also made him a packet from information I pulled online, clinical descriptions of my ED, common side effects (and I made sure to tell him about my own physical side effects to get him to understand the severity of the situation), and the psychological impact these disorders have on the brain. I also included a write up on my expectations of him, how the best way to talk to me about my ED is, how to avoid common triggers, and how it's important he seek help too if he feels he needs it. I'm the same as you, high functioning and I don't fit the stereotypical ""look"" someone with an eating disorder is commonly portrayed. As I've tried to gather a support system, I also make sure to ask what they know about eating disorders. Most have said what they learned in HS health class, basic definititions of bulimia and anorexia, so education is of vital importance if we're going to want awareness and more resources available to us.  That's not to say this will always be enough, my dad is clearly uncomfortable and avoids it at all costs still, but at least now he knows, I'd rather him be uncomfortable and educated than ignorant.  But I am sorry you experienced such a terrible reaction, just don't let what you think he thinks about you become the dialogue for how you feel about yourself, it's not true. ",False,False

Try to be understanding of yourself and kind to yourself. It gets easier once you’re out of their house(assuming you still live at home).  Is therapy an option? It seems your parents may not take this seriously, but could you go to a school counselor or another trusted adult that might be able to advise you?  I also want to remind you that your problems are valid whether or not your family understands. I’m sorry that they don’t though. ",False,False

I'd suggest trying to educate your parents a bit about eating disorders and how there are many different forms that they can take. If that's too hard to do face to face, maybe link him to a website or give him a pamphlet of some sort explaining it?",False,False
