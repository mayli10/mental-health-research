And that is only ever on vacations so that is freaking great. Like I will restrict for a month and a half and nothing, then up to the cabin and have a nice fish fry and steak and bam, next day menses.     So kind of, but not in the same way.",False,False

And then I started cramping and like 10 mins later got the lightest spotting till I ate. Then the cramps were FULL FUCKING FORCE and I couldnt move",False,False

Same with the start, low cal, light brown spotting. Day two I binged. Day two at night changing my cup in the shower, I swear to god, if I ever went missing and cops showed up to search my house and sprayed luminol in my tub, they'd think my boyfriend murdered me. These are legitimate things that I thought about. But yes. Calories and quality of calories do affect my flow.",False,False
