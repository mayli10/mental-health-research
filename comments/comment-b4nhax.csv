I bundle up everyday, because even though I live somewhere hot, every building in my city blasts the AC all summer and I'm still freezing haha. I can't wait for the summer though.  I am the heathen that sits outside in 115° because it's \*orgasmic\* to feel fully warm.    &amp;#x200B;  As for remedies, I find baths are better for keeping me warm than showers.  If you're ok with calories, a nice meal will help or alcohol, which will artificially warm you up.  I use a weighted blanket that I bought for anxiety, but I actually find it helps me more with staying warm and not shivering.  I imagine a heated blanket would be amazing as well.    &amp;#x200B;  I kinda just live with it though.  I'm a healthy weight, but I never almost never eat enough food so my body can't regulate its temperature properly.  Good luck! ",False,False
