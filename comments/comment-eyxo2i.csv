This individual, being a physician, should know boundaries and how to treat people with tact and respect. Even a physician whose specialty is not EDs would still have been exposed - even if superficially -, and know that it's inappropriate to take this approach with anyone.",False,False

This coworker is a physician who has grabbed my arm and tried to measure my wrist with one of the patient tape measures, has told me I need to get pregnant again so I gain weight, has asked me how much I weigh in front of colleagues and patients, and have told me I am just skin and bones in front of these same individuals. It has been so frustrating. And it's hard to even go to HR because it is just an uncomfortable topic that isn't anyone's business.",False,False

The issue has recently been taken to HR for a specific person constantly harassing me about my weight. It is so frustrating and uncomfotsble for me.,False,False
