I starved myself while I was in my LDR with my now husband so when we met I was at my lowest weight. Then we moved in together, got married and then I had a baby 3 months ago so I porked the fuck up.   He still loves me. And he understands my ED and is supportive. He hates it but he doesn’t shame me nor does he get mad at me if I talk about what I’ve eaten or not eaten calorically.",False,False
