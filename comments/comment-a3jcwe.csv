Like I just say fuck it and eat, although, at first I did binge, but now they’re getting more into control meal territory since I got out of the “last binge” mindset. Also, I started listening to stop binging sleep hypnosis videos on YouTube. Although, I don’t really believe in them, I think they sort of have a placebo effect. ",False,False

I never did stop binge eating, just swing from bingeing to restricting, but slowly and gradually doing less and less of both, like a pendulum slowing down... I’m sorry I don’t have any other helpful tips, except that I wish I’d made more of an effort to aim for moderate intake of food and “normal” eating back when I first started bingeing instead of freaking out and just going from overeating to undereating and back again. A hundred millions times easier said than done. Anyway, you’re not alone. &lt;3",False,False

[here](http://fitting-it-all-in.com/dont-have-bed/) is one blog post about it, and if you'll google the phrase, you'll find more. basically, your body is bigtime pissed about being starved and wants to make sure it doesn't happen again. it doesn't necessarily mean you're developing BED or going to eat yourself into obesity. if you stick with recovery, your appetite will eventually stabilize.
