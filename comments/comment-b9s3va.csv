After a binge cycle I always have a few foods I’m still hung up on when I start restricting.  Currently: this 5,000 cal cinnamon roll platter from Costco (RIP me), peanut butter from the jar (also RIP), and the last one is this 300 cal cookie package lol at the disparity.  But every day I’m craving one or all of those things at least once, sometimes like 10 times throughout the day.  It seriously feels like the pain of when I broke up with my boyfriend haha.  Like I almost want to cry about it sometimes.  It’s really really hard.  Sometimes I get lucky and all the food I ate during a binge was gross so I have no leftover cravings.  Hmmm maybe I should stick to gross food binges.",False,False
