Big waste of money, too.  I purposefully buy food to chew and spit and I feel like a bit of a POS every time, but I usually buy cheap/shitty/expired stuff to do it with.  I buy expired bread at Ralph's in the discount bin because it's perfectly fine and it's going to get thrown out anyways so I may as well c/s it, right?? Also, shitty snacks and frozen apps from the 99 Cent Store.  And my boss always has food going bad in her fridge/cupboards so I'll c/s some of her bread/chips because I know half of it's going to go stale and get thrown out. I call all of this wallet-harm reduction. I've gotten fast food a few times to c/s but that shit is so oily and it ends up being too expensive in the long run.  I know it's a big waste of food, but food goes to waste all the time. Plus, it's probably about the amount of food I'd be eating if I wasn't restricting, so....IDK but these mental gymnastics work for me haaah.",False,False

Honestly, buying food just to spit it out is also a big food waste. If you have some control left about your eating behavior because you're not succumbed to your ED, maybe think about that you're wasting a perfect slice / loaf of bread.",False,False

But god forbid someone suggests that prolonged stress and rigid food rules might give rise to disordered food behaviors ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,False,False

No they do not realize it is disordered behavior. .. Just eat the damn bread once in a great while./s edited to add the sarcasm. Because we all know just eating the bread can be way harder then that.,False,False
