I’m not trying to make fun. I guess I’m just confused. But girl, I’ve been there lol. Pizza Hut was my binge place. Every day a large pizza. The same order. Then I would purge the whole thing. I did this for 4 months straight.   I still can’t go into a pizza hut or smell it without having a panic attack or crying now. It’s been over a year later. I’m in recovery now and it is still a no-go place for me.",False,False
