Seeing your vody change that much in such a short time is weird as fuck. Not to say that it is obviously mentally distressing because of the disorder screaming. I have been relapsing but things are getting better again :) thank you for your concern ! Recovery is so so so worth it.,False,False

I appreciate you not only taking time to answer my questions but also for your thoughtful, kind words. ‚Äútraumatizing‚Äù is exactly the word I‚Äôm instantly tempted to use to describe recent months. I refrain from using it because I worry about throwing such a heavy term around or sounding dramatic, but it‚Äôs really affirming to read how you described your experience. I‚Äôm happy to hear you went through recovery (and I sincerely hope you‚Äôve adjusted smoothly and are in a healthier place now!). I‚Äôm just really grateful to have the advice and warm encouragement from someone who‚Äôs walked a similar path - thank you. &lt;3",False,True

It was VERY sudden in the first weeks and it was really traumatizing but as the days went on I started to mentally adjust into this new body. I was also like you, I thought it was all fat because ""I wasn't that much UW and a lot of people were worse than me"". Honestly just trust your body. Stick to your 3 meals a day, add as many snacks as you like. If I can add, try to focus on something else in the meantime. Take strolls and notice the sun on your face and the landscape. Read those books you've been wanting to read. Draw. Spend time with your loved ones. It will get better :) good luck to you xx",False,False

I gained quickly when I was eating what I thought was around maintenance (I thought ‚Äúmetabolic damage‚Äù from restricting was a myth), and have been keeping my calories sub-1000 for over 6 weeks now out of intense fear. my body does not want to let go of any fat, and piles it on if I eat more than this allowance. so I‚Äôm trapped in this low cal, quasi-recovery state w no progress. it‚Äôs done a number to me emotionally, but it genuinely offers some relief to know I‚Äôm not alone - so thank you for commenting. I hope things redistribute and you can get to a healthier place soon &lt;3",False,True

I ask because I‚Äôm coming from a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù BMI (19.5 to 21), and it feels more like fat than water retention. but at this point I‚Äôm so lost and confused by my body that I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs real.

I tend to lose weight from my midsection, chest, arms, etc. first and then like exclusively from my thighs, and I found that when I gained weight, it went first to my thighs, then my upper body, so like the reverse.

I rapidly gained 10-15 lbs and my fat distribution is pretty messed up right now. I think everything went to my midsection and I now have a disproportionately large gut, but my legs and arms still look like sticks. I don't think mine has gone back to normal yet because I've been restricting (again) and my body wants to preserve as much abdominal fat as it can. I think it will redistribute eventually, but you have stop restricting for it to happen. ",False,False

And most of the weight went into my stomach, my upper thighs and my face.  It redistributed though.
