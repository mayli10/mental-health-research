I have felt the exact same way, with school and especially the cute outfits! man, i just wanna looks so bomb and color coordinate but! ugh!  and there were days last year, i felt so so bad about myself that i physically didn't want to go outside, and i can't count the amount of times i have lied just to avoid going outside on days like these and stay home having panic attacks but honestly it gets better. It may sound absolutely hopeless but u'll hit a point where it's not a big deal anymore. it's really hard to find that tiny perspective in a mindset, but it's there. I'm not saying it will magically get better with ED and self-image, it will just kinda fall it place.",False,False

I'm a bit older so no school for me anymore, but i definitely had those feelings after summer breaks. If your mum is supportive, have you thought about maybe writing her a letter? That way you can word it properly without feeling nervous and don't have to be around her when she finds it. That way she can first think about it herself and then approach you rather than you having to do it.",False,False
