The closest I got to receiving a ""compliment"" was resentful comments from people who wanted to lose weight and thought it was somehow easy for me, which missed the point that food was very strictly rationed at home (my grandfather was a starved prisoner of war, who saw people starve, and brought my dad up with harsh ideas about greed and eating more than rations) and being skinny didn't seem to be regarded as being an attractive body type anyway - it was just a goal that some people seemed to aspire to.   It seemed particularly ridiculous when people with a good bust expressed frustration that ""there was nothing for them in clothes shops"", but told me that I was so lucky as ""you can wear whatever you want"", when I was actually flat chested with pipe cleaner arms and legs and got derided for it. Girls/women would call me unhealthy and accuse me of having anorexia, and men would make comments, even heckle me in public!!, about being a ""skinny bitch"", ""I like a woman with more weight on her"". So, my first eating disorder as a teenager was actually binge eating to put on weight to stop getting picked on for being skinny.  When I developed my adult figure I became very pear-shaped. My upper body is two sizes smaller than my lower  body, regardless of whether I'm 7 stone or 11 stone. I recently did a college course and when we were sitting at a table for coffee break, some ladies were talking about the Slimming World and Weightwatchers clubs they attend. One of them commented to me ""You don't need to worry about going to slimming world. What size are you? A size 10? I told her I was a size 12 top (I'm still relatively flat chested, with skinny forearms and hands) but my upper arms and stomach make me a size 12) and size 16 trousers. They didn't believe me until I stood up to show them.   My body dysmorphia was due to feeling that my very pear shaped body is viewed by society as being very disproportionate. Having a proportionate hips and bust is the most common body type, whether that is straight up and down, or an hour glass figure, and this is the body type that is overwhelmingly represented in the media. A 'top-heavy' figure, where the bust is disproportionately bigger than the hips is also well represented in the media. The pear shaped body type is rarely represented in the media.  So, I feel that my pear shaped body has been the crux of my eating disorders. You get criticism for having a big butt and thighs, so you lose weight (through diet and exercise), then, when your butt is 'the right size' you get criticism for being flat as a pancake, having skeletal arms, and looking gaunt. So you put on weight to look better, then you get criticism for having a fat butt again. So you get criticism for part of your body being too fat, or too thin, plus criticism for not having a proportionate balanced figure.  People with a naturally proportionate figure don't seem to understand that people with a pear figure can't just achieve a proportionate balanced figure by spot reduction exercise. I went to the gym and only used gym equipment for the lower half of my body. Yes, I toned up the muscles of my butt and thighs. But I also lost weight on the upper half of my body and my face by burning calories, so I retained my disproportionate pear shaped figure. But because the media is 99% proportionate figures, whether they be fat or thin, most people seem baffled by people with a disproportionate pear shape figure.  Some clothes brands are making an effort to represent more diverse body types in their advertising, including a model with a pear shaped figure like mine.  Pear shaped women are so under represented in advertising and the media that many people, including women who call themselves fat acceptance activists seem to have difficulty believing that they exist.  There was a recent Twitter drama where a pear shaped woman modelling underwear for ASOS was accused by fat acceptance activists of padding her hips in order to model size 20 knickers (and thereby apparently taking modelling work from genuinely fat models). They said that there is no way that she could have size 20 hips and bottom because her bust and stomach were size 16. They said there is no way that body fat naturally bulges in that way. This fat activist claimed ""No one is that shape"". So many people who are part of the fat acceptance movement and campaign against body shaming of fat people were making comments body shaming the model for her natural pear shaped figure.   This just goes to show that body shaming isn't just about size or weight, it's about what is perceived to be an acceptable, natural shape. This was basically apple shaped women body shaming a pear shaped woman.  After decades of worrying about how my body is perceived by others, and periodically yo-yo-ing between exercising to lose weight and binge eating to put on weight, I'm now just concentrating on eating well and exercising to be healthy, and ignoring the body shamers, regardless of whether those body shamers are shaming people for being 'too thin', 'too fat', or for not having a proportionate bust and hips.  I had what is now called orthorexia over 25 years ago. This followed a spurious food allergy test performed by a quack in a health food shop who told me my (hormonal, age related) acne was because I was allergic to sugar (but not fructose or honey?!), tomatoes, potatoes, wheat and dairy products. But my 'clean eating' (there weren't these descriptive terms 25 years ago) habits were so restrictive as I cut out a lot of normal foods (e.g. baked beans because of the sugar and tomato sauce) and included extortionately priced and/or gimmicky foods that (at least 25 years ago) tasted horrible, like carob bars, and cornflakes that tasted like cardboard. It's interesting to recently read that this kind of disordered eating is termed orthorexia, and linked to social media. There wasn't any social media when I had orthorexia, but there were snake oil salesmen who were trying to capitalise on insecurities about acne to get me to spend money on their hocus pocus allergy testing and expensive food gimmicks. I just thought at the time that it was healthy eating habits that I must follow if I wanted to improve my skin, because I was unlucky enough to be prone to prone to acne and had food allergies - when in actual fact the restrictive eating made me underweight which prolonged my hormonal acne.  Tldr: diversity of representation and promotion of body acceptance is a good thing to get people to have self-acceptance and a healthy attitude towards their body. But it's not helpful to demand respect for your own body type (apple) and simultaneously be disrespectful of other people's body shapes (pear shape) just because you don't think pears exist because they are ignored by the media/advertising.",False,False

I was in solid recovery for about 6 years in there.   I’m more motivated to recover now but have less resources and no one forcing me to do anything. When I was a teen I could just up and go to treatment for months and still maintain my schooling, plus my mom has bomb ass insurance that paid for it. If I tried to do that now, my family would go bankrupt and I’d lose my job, which is clearly not an option because I have a child to feed and I like having a roof over my head.   My body can’t fucking handle any modicum of behaviors anymore so that nice floaty high that I get is quickly counterbalanced by low blood sugar, digestive issues, and migraines.   I’m more harm averse, too. I used to water fast for days, b/p until I bled, or c/s everything in my house. A lot of that stuff scares me now so I don’t do it. My biggest issue is compulsive exercise, which I’ve justified to myself is the “safest” way to get my fix.   I also give a fuck less about my body now. I don’t care how I look. This is all a fucked up coping skill and I know it. I don’t even let myself pretend it has anything to do with how I look because it doesn’t. My eating disorder makes me look *awful*. When I’m in a state of “recovery”, I look like I have some life to me. Even dropping a few pounds makes me look like I’m waiting to die. There ain’t nothing sexy about having gross hair, yellowing skin, a mustache, flaking nails, and eyes that look like they will pop out and roll away any moment.",False,False

Like I try and get the most out of the small amount of calories I let myself eat and take vitamins. I eat a lot more vegetables and small amounts of meat protein.  Verses when I was younger and I would just fast for days and then binge on junk food and repeat that process.    It comes and goes and I know it won’t ever completely go away and it’s like when I relapse I just hold onto the rails and try and stay safe and work my way out of it. Whenever I go through something emotionally big it’s a big trigger for me to find control in my life and over focus on something. So the best thing I have learned is just trying to be as safe and healthy as I can be when I’m in a full on relapse.,False,False

It started with just restricting and over time, evolved to include binging and purging and over-exercising. I didn't reach out for help until I was in college although my friends expressed concern all through high school and I was forced to see the school counselor for a while during my junior year. In college, things got much worse and I had to take multiple medical leaves of absence to go into treatment (inpatient, residential, PHP, &amp; IOP). I finally graduated undergrad when I was 26 due to all the time I spent in treatment. Now, I work full-time and have been doing a lot better than before but the eating disorder thoughts are still there and if I allow myself to listen to them, I can slip right back into a relapse.      I've found that I feel like I have more agency now that I used to feel I did which is a bit empowering but also can bring guilt because I'm making the choice to do this to myself when I know the outcome of engaging in behaviors has never been good.

Later on, when I was about 25, I experienced some hardships that triggered my restricting behavior and I’ve been restricting on and off ever since.
