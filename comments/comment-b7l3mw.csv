I would really encourage you talk to the mom first, tell her that you know, and discuss whether or not it’s a subject that she can be honest/upfront about with her child. If your friend was to find out about the ED, it should come directly from their parent imo. It could be stressful to hear it from an outside source and they may feel a lot of stress and pressure to bring it up and/or help their parent, which is no child’s job. Just my two cents, but it sounds like your friend could potentially have a lot to deal with on their plate, so I personally think you should encourage the Mom to take share some of the emotional effort involved.

I would maybe gently break the topic to your best friend, without mentioning the possible relapse and see how he thinks his mom is doing?  Also please don't let her make you feel like your ED is invalid, because it is! It just manifests different in every person.",False,False
