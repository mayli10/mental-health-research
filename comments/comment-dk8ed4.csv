I left my girlfriend in high school to date a guy that dumped me to date a girl!  That was over a decade ago and I am still friends with both. You can't control what your heart wants or who you are attracted to.  That being said it is wrong for him to do this behind your back.  It is a total betrayal of trust. It is normal to ignore small signs in the hopes that you may be wrong.  He needs to step up and be truthful in order to salvage any sort of healthy relationship/friendship.  I honestly don't think he did this to hurt you, but that does not make it right.",False,False

I 100% support him in experimenting, I just wish he had the guts to either dump me first or at least ask if I would be okay with an open relationship. He's ruined what was once a good relationship. We were even talking about getting a dog together, I'm so blindsided, but I'm sure there were signs I just missed or willfully ignored.   He's being very hard on himself right now, rightfully so, but I still love him and don't want him to be hurting even though he's the one whose hurt me. It's hard. It's going to be awkward having to live together while I find a new place!",False,True
