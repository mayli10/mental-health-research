There's so much evidence it is brain-based (chemical, neuronal wiring).",False,False

Sometimes we are feeling other things that we mix up as feeling fat, sure, but we are aware of the space we take up. Example: give someone a pair of platform shoes to walk around in ... feels different than flats. We're aware of our space.  some other fun ones for the medical professionals: at the next appt, try ""I feel thin"" and see if you get a reaction grab your boob / tummy / whatever and say ""I feel fat"" (breast tissue is fat - you are literally feeling fat)",False,False

I feel like ours is just more severe because maybe BDD, and of course we have an eating disorder so that makes us even more conscious and aware of ourselves. Also you said you work out a ton, well I do too and because you have to be conscious of your body when you're exercising, you're way more aware of your body generally even when you aren't being active.",False,False

It sucks being so self-aware of this feeling too. Like I get so hyper aware of my body's every movement that random moments where I just feel too fat are paralyzing for a lack of a better word. I mostly feel like this when it comes to my thighs. I can't tolerate the fact that my thighs jiggle, even though it gets less and less I just can't take it. It's crazy because like you said, it just happens randomly.",False,False
