And I love the idea of it, just she‚Äôs SO MUCH SKINNIER than me and it makes me insecure and I feel like she wouldn‚Äôt believe me or think I‚Äôm too fat for an ED (because I feel that way and I‚Äôm projecting lmao) and I‚Äôm scared if I speak to her it can actually trigger me more and put me in total relapse mode. Fuck. I wanna help but I also am scared for myself",False,True

It‚Äôs almost impossible to live with someone when you both have EDs and not make each other worse, even when you‚Äôre trying to support each other (ime). Good luck to you both in recovery.",False,False
