They waited until my weight hit a certain point.   I was inpatient getting medically stabilized for 5 weeks and residential living there for 6 weeks. I'm now doing a partial hospitalization program that runs 6 days a week.,False,True

Like the room is closing in on me. I also have random crying spells. I've been told it's because my coping skill was taken away so now I'm actually ""feeling"" things. I hate it because I tried my best to shut off emotions before.   The thing I hated most about it was how safe of a bubble it put me in. The place I was in for residential was really big about redirecting any sort behavior or any talk of eating disorders and they covered all nutritional information and it felt like you had to pretend eating disorders didn't exist even though we were all there for that. Going from such a safe bubble to real life has been such a shock and a change and I wish there had been more exposure to things there",False,True
