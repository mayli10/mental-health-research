Salt and hydration important as well!   The diet does a lot for my health, energy, how much I can eat and how hungry I feel throughout the day.   I feel good and can be on maintenance, whereas before my diet change I'd keep overeating then eat little next day etc. Used to eat tons of carbs, little salt, little protein, no fat, many processed foods and that ruined my body completely, and my body never got any signals that it was actually full, which was awful and as you can imagine created stress and problems unless I controlled calories, but then I would still be hungry the entire day!!!",False,False

I'm doing better with 3 bigger meals at set times and a bedtime snack if my stomach is keeping me awake. Still b/p but I'm down to like...once or twice a week now.  I'm home and alone all day (I'm housebound) so I understand the struggle with wanting to eat nonstop. It's hard. :/,False,False

I make sure to make healthy choices, but I eat what seems to be a fair amount for however hungry I am at the time. I don't get too hungry since starting my ADHD medicine  though. It suppresses appetites. My appetite was getting unbelievable beforehand though. My average daily intake is very close to what I need to maintain a healthy weight while sedentary. I thin carrying my heavy backpack around so often means I burn more than that, but I don't really know.",False,False

I don’t suggest OMAD, I think it’s better to give your body constan energy buy eating multiple times a day rather than “all at once” as this can trigger binges (at least for me). Intuitive eating can be good but not really for someone struggling with binge since it’s really easy to start ignoring your body and just keep going. Set meals and snacks are what I suggest, I’m no professional so all my advice comes from my own experience, But maybe it can be a little helpful.",False,False
