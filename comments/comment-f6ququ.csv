Because I did feel all those things: mental hunger and guilt and stuff. But I also agree that it was a much smaller “binge” and that I stopped it, which is a new experience lately!    And thank you :) I am moving back into restriction and not recovery ahahaha   But I also wish you the best!!",False,True

Sometimes your body is really hungry when your restrict a lot and when it’s full it stops. No matter what foods you eat, it’s a good thing that your body realized it was full",False,False

It’s more about the lack of control than the consumption. I would not describe what you ate as overly excessive at all, however, so try not to let it get to you. Hopefully the smaller ‘binges’ are a sign that you’re potentially moving towards recovery? I hope so, anyway :)",False,False

I know it can really be hard to eat more food than usual after a period of restriction but idk if I'd consider what you're describing a binge. If you feel that it was a binge though, that's valid and I wouldn't judge you for feeling that way, because it's mostly defined by your own feelings towards it",False,False
