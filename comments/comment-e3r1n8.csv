I work around them a lot and often they can come across as impatient/condescending/frustrated just because of the stress of the job. Same for doctors and other professions that do crazy stressful hours. I'm sorry they treated you like that - you absolutely should call ambulance if you suspect health problems. It's better to overreact or underreact.",False,False

The amount of time you’ve had your ed doesn’t matter. You could be just as unhealthy as someone who’s had it longer. You could get your electrolytes checked regularly for the peace of mind. It sounds like they didn’t even draw your blood? I’d keep an eye on your potassium, that was always a concern for me. Wishing you the best of health",False,False
