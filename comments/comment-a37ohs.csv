Cold sweats, shaking, vomiting, headache, emotional af, and made my fiance smell.. disgusting to me. Like sickly sweet. I couldn't have him anywhere near me for like 12 hours. Called my planned parenthood and apparently it's normal when you take more than the normal dose :/",False,False

My birth control packet says to double up if you skip a pill, so having potentially two in your system isn't a prolem. Its certainly better than the prospect of unwanted pregnancy, but you could also go a week without unprotected sex (recommended by the packet if you miss two consecutive days).  ðŸ¤·",False,False
