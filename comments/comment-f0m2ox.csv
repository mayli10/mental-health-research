I just think it's rude - you wouldn't do the same if someone gained lots of weight 🤦🏻‍♀️ like, don't comment on my body because then I know for sure you've been looking at me 😳 my university classes started up again this week and that's all I had all week, people commenting on my weight loss. And more than a few ""oh wow what's your secret? What have you been doing to lose so much??""   Okay, first of all it's not like I shed an entire army tank in weight, don't be rude. Second of all, it's called stress, anxiety, childhood trauma revisiting for shits and giggles, and depriving my body of a basic human need. Fancy having a go at that 'diet'?  I'm a salty bitch these days🤦🏻‍♀️",False,False
