YOU ARE SO MUCH BETTER. you are such a strong woman to have gone through what you have and battled EVERY single day against your disorder. you are so worthy of this recovery and so worthy of being healthy and happy with who you are and how far you’ve come.  your boyfriend loves you, for YOU. for your struggles, for your mind, your strength, your body. YES, your body! bigger or smaller, because it carries your beautiful mind and soul! you are alive, you are here and you have done amazing things going through recovery. you have worked so hard and deserve to love yourself after everything you’ve been through. try to take it easy on yourself- recovery is the hardest thing to do and you fucking did it! you are in recovery! there are so many more important things than our weight and size and body image and life is worth so much more than worrying about the changes that happen to our ever growing bodies.  good luck w/ everything and hope you can enjoy the rest of the holidays!!",False,False
