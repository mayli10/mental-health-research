A cup of broccoli or cauliflower has about 30 calories- if you loaded your plate up with a pyramid, no way that's more than 5 cups. So we'll say 150 to make sure there are no calories lurking there. Let's look at the oil- no way they used a full cup or even half a cup, their job is to feed every one while minimizing waste, not serve up a pool of oil with veg floating in it.  A quarter cup?  You'd see the oil dripping off.  It would be pooling on your plate. So we can say pretty confidently that there's no more than an eighth of a cup of oil since the veggies look steamed. That's two tablespoons as the absolute max that could be in there. Oils are between 100 and 130 calories per tablespoon, so let's say 250 as the absolute most calories that could be hiding in the huge pyramid stacked plate of veggies. It comes to 400 calories at the absolute most.    I bet you didn't make a plate that's a six inch tall tower of broccoli and cauliflower. I bet about two cups would be a filling meal, but I'll wiggle a bit and say 2.5.  So maybe you had 200 calories for lunch. And you ate vitamins and fiber and just a touch of healthy fats.    Perspective:  I had a protein bar for lunch. 220 calories, added sugar alcohols, but enough protein to keep me focused until dinner.   You did better than me.  You did great. It's gonna be fine.  Math said so. ",False,False
