This was totally unacceptable behaviour, I get this too sometimes on occasion and I'm sick and tired of it. No one would ever dare to mention weight gain to someone, so why the double standard? It makes my blood boil!",False,False

I'm so sorry you are having to deal with people commenting on your body as well, I know how hard it can be. It's never okay. Stay strong &lt;3",False,False

It sounds like your coworker is the jealous one and wants to feel better about herself by proving you have an ED. She's being very harmful by shaming you and demonizing your body to others. It is so very inappropriate to be measuring you. I cringe thinking about someone measuring my wrist without permission.    I am feeling better about my bosses response and am glad that she can empathize with my struggle enough to feel strong emotion. My initial anxiety over her being upset is that I didn't want to annoy or inconvenience anyone with my mental illness due to childhood trauma.,False,True

She had made so many comments, asking my how much I weigh, telling me I am just skin and bones, telling other colleagues I don't eat, trying to measure my wrist to prove how small I am... I finally had enough and confronted her, and told her to never talk about my body again, never mention my weight. I told her I was self conscious of my weight. Her response was horrible. She responded, ""Well, a lot of women would be jealous of your body."" I would much rather had her apologize and feel horrible and cry. I feel like she doesn't care that she offended me. I honestly hate working with her.",False,False

She tends to be really emotional, I just didn't see it coming for some reason. Probably stems from my own lack of self worth so anyone feeling bad for hurting me doesn't register/I take fault.",False,True

You couldn’t have done it better. Her reaction is up to her - and sometimes we’re emotional, and that’s ok. You don’t need to feel bad, and hopefully this helps her think about what she says to people that could be triggering.",False,False
