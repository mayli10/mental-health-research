It definitely helped me let go of some habits and actually expanded the range of foods I eat since before I was very restrictive. I still have lots of issues obviously but for me it helped to know that im giving myself wholesome food and not harming the planet or the animals on it. I also feel better eating many of my fear foods after seeing that they can't actually hurt me (after the adjustment period where I was super gassy and kinda bloated) I think what really helped me though was connecting it to something other than food. I went vegan partially so I could get away with ED crap, but it was and is more about the animals and the environment",False,False

It's very common for ED sufferers in general to adopt this diet, bc it is an excellent excuse to refuse random food.   Personally, maintaining a plant-based diet is very important to me, even though I'm aware it does enable my ED to some degree. That's the tradeoff I made. But if you're adopting this diet because you hope it will *help* your ED, that is a seriously bad idea that is likely to make your life even worse.  Best of luck, and I'm sorry for the laughter, but your friend's idea is really off the wall.",False,False

The most important thing to remember is that veganism IS NOT a diet, it’s an ethical philosophy and lifestyle. If you’re only seeing it as another diet, you’re talking about the whole-foods plant based diet and it won’t help. Dieting only makes ED symptoms worse. If you’re connecting with authentic vegan values of animal rights, empathy, and environmental/social justice, then it would likely be neutral or somewhat beneficial.",False,False

If you're prone to restricting, then going vegan will just cut down on any other safe foods you might have. If you're prone to bingeing, then going vegan could be a gateway to sliding down the restriction rabbit hole.
