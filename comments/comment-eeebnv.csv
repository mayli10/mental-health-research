I still have very bad days (like today), but honestly it makes a huge difference. My therapist always insists on the power of language, and I feel it's very true.  Just try telling yourself something nice today, even if you don't believe it. If it's too hard (or weird) you can start instead by listening and singing along to encouraging music when you feel down (and when you feel happy as well!).   My favorites are Marry the Night by Lady Gaga, Don't Give In by Snow Patrol, Don't Stop Me Now by Queen and Firework by Katy Perry. This is kind of hearing someone else tell you kind words. Please do me a favor and listen to these 4 songs right now :) I'mma go listen to Gaga right away.",False,False

I am not nice to myself and can‚Äôt even imagine being nice to myself or saying those words you suggested. I can‚Äôt even imagine thinking I deserve to be kind to myself.

Everyone here is so caring, each of us struggling through each day having our inner fight with food and weight and mental health.   I know it sucks to feel lonely.
