Breakthrough bleeding isn't like a normal period, and it's not usually affected by diet. The reality is that breakthrough bleeding is just very common for some people on continuous birth control, and what looks like a correlation between restriction/bleeding may be a coincidence.   Bleeding is especially common if you're on a progestin-only pill. Other known risk factors include: not taking your pill every day, taking your pill at different times of day, frequent vomiting/diarrhea, taking certain medications or supplements (e.g., St John's wort), and smoking.   I've been taking continuous BC for years, and used to bleed more early on. Now breakthrough bleeding only happens maybe every six months or so, and it's never significant. However, some people are unluckier. I hope it stops for you soon! This is not a petty complaint at all...I feel suicidal every time I bleed (due to dysphoria).",False,False
