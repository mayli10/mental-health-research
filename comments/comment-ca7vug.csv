My doctor thinks there might be something wrong with my brain, I’m 21 and I think I’ll be walking with a cane pretty soon. The only thing I’m qualified to do is heavy labour, which I loved and was very good at, now I can’t. I can’t leave the house alone anymore. The longer I’m stuck at home, the unhappier I get, I’m alone with my thoughts constantly but talking doesn’t help. I can’t remember the last time I was truly happy, if that time ever really existed.  It’s hard and I’m miserable,  Me and my siblings all have issues, I’m just more of the suffer in silence type, so she thought I was “normal” you know, healthy and balanced, the strong one. Boy, was she wrong.  I don’t know what kind of future there is for me with the way I’m going, but I’ll keep pushing through I guess. Thank you for taking the time. I really appreciate it.",False,True

Like I’ve been there too, just wish my mom would talk to me through things instead of dragging strangers into it but I think she probably felt like that was the best option without taking into consideration how that would make you feel. I’m sorry you’re feeling this way, please know that you should stick around and not do anything to jeopardize your life...",False,False
