Drink it quickly so you are not re-exposing your teeth to the acidity over and over.  Drink a little water after,  or milk.  Never brush within 1hr of eating or drinking anything besides water.  Also try either a high fluoride toothpaste or fluoride treatment.  You can also find re-mineralizing toothpaste online.  Also floss daily.",False,False

On the advice of my dentist: When eating or drinking acidic foods, I rinse my mouth well with water afterwards. Then wait 30mins before brushing teeth (or eating anything abrasive I guess?).  The acid softens enamel, so rinsing with water neutralizes the acid. Waiting gives time to ensure your enamel is harder.  I’ve also heard you can also use a straw to minimize contact with teeth. But I always feel like it touches my teeth anyway when I swallow.  Every dentist I’ve been to seems to highly recommend very different toothpastes/mouthwashes. I’ve settled on any that aren’t the abrasive whitening toothpastes and have higher fluoride. These tend to be aimed at people with braces (even though I don’t have braces lol)",False,False
