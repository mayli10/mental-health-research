They made or broke my day. It’s debilitating when just a throw away comment can break you down but take it from someone with a lot more experience “you have to be kind to you” and “you have to love you before anyone else.”  People won’t always tell you the truth. They will tell you what’s most convenient and beneficial to them. They will build you up to knock you down and try and hide your potential cause their jealous.   Be strong for you and stay strong for you, beauty comes from your confidence and how you project yourself.    Hope this helped.",False,False
