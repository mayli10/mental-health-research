I am 35 years old. I have been working with my ED’s since I was 18. Some days are good and some are days bad. Like you said above “I did it all to myself, willingly, if not enthusiastically.” Yeah I was complicit I wanted to get as skinny as I could. I wanted to be validated by it.   Honestly after years of analyzing the many phases of my ED and wrestling with the guilt of my actions and my lack of actions. I can say without doubt. I lost most of the things I loved and gain nothing.  I think ED suffers attach a lot of undue pressure on ourselves. A kind of survivor’s guilt. I know I always felt like somewhere at some point I would have to account for my cheating the natural order of things. Fortunately the universe doesn’t want to pay me back because I only hurt myself.   Today be kind to yourself. Don’t hate yourself. Accept things are happening and long term you’re trying to change. Remove the good and the bad the success and failure from the equation.   Horrible is a strong word. Things happened. You did what you had to. You can’t change the past. You are though trying to change your future. Take strength from that.   I know you feel like the pressure is crushing you now but remember pressure is how diamonds are made. After this you’ll be sparkling, a gem. Hang in there.   You’re only human &amp; to err is to be human.       Hope my sharing helped.",False,False
