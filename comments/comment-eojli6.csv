I used to get that with super low potassium.  Be careful, get it checked, it can affect your heart and it's really fucking scary when it hits your breathing muscles.",False,False

If you don't already make sure you are getting enough because the sodium/potassium pump is what allows your muscles to function including your heart. I'd go get some blood work to be on the safe side.,False,False

For me it's not in my face but mainly limbs. I think its caused by electrolyte imbalances (maybe magnesium or calcium, not sure tho). If the pins and needles in your chest are just superficially I wouldn't worry about it too much, but if its a deeper pain - definitely go see a doctor. It could be your heart.   Of course it would be amazing if you would eat something, although I know that is really hard. Otherwise really try correcting your electrolytes (e.g. electrolyte drinks, coconut water, broth...). But if it doesn't improve - please be responsible and go seek medical advice. I'm not a doctor and don't know what I'm talking about, this is just what seems to help me sometimes. Most of the time when I experience those symptoms my body just really needs food.",False,False
