I have a winged scapula, and it does sometimes look like it might break out of my skin, because it sticks out so much. But it's been 27 years, and has yet to happen. It does get more bruises/red marks than the other scapula though.",False,False

So itâ€™s not quite the bone breaking completely through the skin, but itâ€™s when they cause little cuts where they stick out and rub against things, you can get gel to cushion it? Itâ€™s designed for old people, but if it works it works ðŸ˜‚ Apparently though you do have to watch it if it does get cut because they can get infected quite quickly, just keep an eye on them!",False,False
