I only scroll through reddit if i'm eating something that i can 'pick' at. An example of this would be potatoes or fruit because i can just put it in a bowl and 'pick' at it with my hands while i look at reddit.   If i'm eating something like cereal, yogurt or soup, i have to watch a video since i find it hard to eat those foods and scroll through reddit at the same time. This has gotten to the point where sometimes i base what i eat around what i'm doing. If i can't find a video i like, i'll eat foods i can 'pick' at so i can look at reddit instead and vise versa.  I also *always* take 5 second breaks between each bite of my food. Lol im weird.",False,True
