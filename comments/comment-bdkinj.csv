I've also have been doing the same for five days but relapsed last night. I'm starting again today because I felt significantly better with my body and didnt feel like shit when I went to work the next morning. And I was able to go out with coworkers and actually going to a pool party where I had a couple beers and honestly didnt give a fuck.

This the most joyous post I have ever seen on this sub. You have inspired me so much! I feel like the person you were on vacation is the person we all want to be. What you just did reminds me of something my mom always told me: invite friends over at least once a month so you will have to deep clean your house and make your life presentable. If we can't do it for ourselves at first, we can get the ball rolling by doing it for others or for our reputation. Eventually, the idea is to love ourselves enough to treat our homes (our bodies are our most permanent home, aren't they?) with respect and care that for the moment, we can only summon for others.",False,False
