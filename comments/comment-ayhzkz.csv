Effy, Chris, and Tomas were my favs. There's so much of it that's incredibly fucked up, but also so much that makes me nostalgic for times that didn't even exist in my life lol. I didn't even have crazy teenage years (maybe that's why discovering it later on was so exciting lol). It just blew my mind all the heavy shit the show touched on..I'd never seen a US show like it.     I think if i had seen it at 15 it would have been bad for me. But for some reason finding it/watching it at 23 was a comfort more than a trigger. An escape that I have come back to manyyyy times in the last seven years",False,False

I was exactly the right age and at the exact point in my life to feel like I was watching a documentary about me when it first came out.
