I believe in you and your healing process.  Not to sound super crazy religious but praying helps, I feel that i’m talking to someone who understands and I can be completely honest. Regardless of your religion, there is something or someone  bigger than all of us and you can always pray and it’s also a form of meditation. Believe that everything will be okay cause EVERYTHING will be!  You are more than your past mistakes, you are magic and you’ll be able to recover from this!  big hugs!",False,False
