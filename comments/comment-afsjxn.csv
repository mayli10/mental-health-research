I also kind of realized that my ED is taking over my life, because besides postponing my permit, I didn't go to the winter banquet last year because of fear of the food.  Most of that fear was instilled in me by my dad, who was oddly upset that day, saying I had to eat, as a part of the socialization process, and that it didn't matter if the food wasn't vegan or had calorie counts.  I bought juniors XL rompers if I decided to go to the event (even though I saw pictures online of people wearing smaller sizes, and they were around my size, and the bigger women wore L or XL, but I'm body-dysmorphic, and must hide my stomach and back fat at all costs), but decided not to go because of the food, and fear of looking fat.  I also didn't go to the past 2 weddings my parents' coworkers had, because of fear of the food.  But I covered it up, saying I had too much homework, which was technically true (one of them was the weekend before final exams, so...)  My mom today said that according to her coworker (not that she has the authority to say it), I have symptoms for anorexia.  But because my BMI is 23, and I eat 1,300 calories, I guess my ED is lying to me, saying I don't need help, and that I look normal.  I've also read horror stories of people with EDs getting turned away because the ""professionals"" said the people didn't look like they had EDs, or were too old (I'm reading ""Next to Nothing,"" a great ED book, highly recommend.  Thanks again, I guess it took until now for me to realize my ED was a lying monster, taking over my life with numbers.  I hope you are doing okay too!",False,True

I spent all day on tumblr looking at thinspo and ana recipes and tips. In class the sound of someone crinkling a granola bar wrapper behind me drove me mad. I had to look up the calories and menus of any restaurant I went to BEFORE I even left my house. I became very antisocial because I never wanted to go anywhere because I feared there would be food there. Every movie I watched was about EDs. I would go to the library and sit in the ED section and read all the books. Even the playlists I listened to were from the “anorexia songs” lists you see on tumblr. It consumed my entire life.  I was so obsessed that when my mom came to visit me in college she cried for the whole 2 days she was there. I could hear her crying at night and she cried when she walked to her car to drive home. I ruined the entire visit with worrying and panicking about what we would eat. It hurts to remember that.,False,False
