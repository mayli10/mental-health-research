Sorry if that comes across as harsh, but right now you're helping someone else in their time of need. Maybe some day the pendulum will swing the other way and she'll be able to help you. But for right now, you're doing what you can. And sometimes that's the best we can do. And that's okay. Don't beat yourself up for not being perfect yourself, you can still help someone else.   Imo you're probably the best person for her to go to... You've found solutions for her that other nonED people wouldn't think of, and you're asking questions to make her feel ok about herself. You're doing so much good for her - it's okay if you can't do this for yourself yet. ",False,False

I understand that paradox. one part of my brain is logical understands,  how this illness is and how to help others and I can give great advice and be supportive. I am ask by many friends about nutrition etc. But when it comes to me, fuck everything I can die (this is the other side that I call: shit-throwing-monkey). It makes no sense, I know but that is part of the illness. We do not stop loving and caring for others because we are sick and hurting ourselves. In fact it is so brave of you to put so much of the energy you have to make sure she is fine, that is being a great friend.   But please you are as sick as she is, no matter what weight you are, you also need help, if you feel you can not vent with her, well, this subr is here for you, or even a diary. You gave her great advice, maybe try to adopt some of it? the vitamins at least? one step at the time. Take care and we are here to listen.",False,False

If anything, you probably have more helpful advice than others. If it feels like dealing with helping her with her ED is making yours worse, maybe try and take as much of a step back as you can without feeling like you are abandoning her (don't set yourself on fire to keep others warm, yada yada).   I'm sure a lot of us here are hypocrites in this way - we want other people to get better even if we're not working on ourselves. It doesn't make you a bad person, it makes you a person with empathy who can relate to the experiences of what someone is going through and wants them to get better. ",False,False

I'm sorry that you're caught in that situation though... I can totally understand why that triggers you... :(  I would be cautious about opening up to her... you're both in a vulnerable state. it would be a tricky conversation to have. do you have anyone else you can up to about what you're going through?",False,False
