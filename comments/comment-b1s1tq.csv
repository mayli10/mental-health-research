Maybe wait a bit before you mention the new Reddit account though!  Do you have your whole face in your YT videos? If so, people could have definitely linked your ED to not just your YT life, but your personal life as well. People online are crazy. They'll call your work and stuff when your channel gets bigger if something scandalous like that gets out :/ be safe out there!!",False,False

I have an email address for business enquiries which sometimes i have subscribers email asking for personal videos which has my full name on it so Iâ€™m going to try to get rid of that. my name is quite uncommon so iâ€™m not too surprised after a bit of digging they would find my facebook - itâ€™s all set to private so iâ€™m not scared theyâ€™ll get my personal info but i still donâ€™t really fancy getting private messages from subscribers on facebook.   i reply to a lot of comments but not all of them so ignoring it probably is the best bet. you were super helpful thank you and thank you so much for your kind words as well it actually meant a lot !!ðŸ’›,False,True

You've probably still got a decent chance at fixing this situation right now since you were able to catch it early on before it gets out of hand which means the ball is still in your park.

People can easily retrieve deleted posts/comments from a username on Reddit.   My recommendation? Delete everything. Delete the comment. Delete all the ASMR posts on the other Reddit account. Nuke everything while your channel is small. The person won't be bothered enough to care.  Then do what you should have done all along: make a new Reddit account for all your YT stuff.  Or, if you can, play it off like that Reddit account isn't yours, but idk the situation well enough to know if you can/should do that. Deleting and forgetting is probably your best bet.
