Drank lots of water and feel less bloated now. Gonna take a bubble bath now.",False,True

To gain a pound you have to be over by about 3500 and even then that's not concrete. I can eat 5000 cals in a day and I'll even out in a couple days. If you're used to low restricting you may see a slight increase on the scale but that's literally the food/poop weight and maybe water weight. You absolutely won't gain any fat from this. It would be impossible for there to be a visible difference in your body from this amount of calories. Try to do something soothing to take mind off it cause there's nothing to worry about.,False,False
