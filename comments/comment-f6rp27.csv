Always be vigilant. Never give away your location or other personal details. Always air on the side of caution.   I am a 35-year-old male and the internet is not safe for me either. Recently I met someone through an add site, to buy a piece of tech. When I went to meet the guy. There was three people there. Luckily, they were all younger than me and I knew the brother of one of the kids.   I later found out they were going to rob me.   We met at a public place (a large Irish shopping centre.) Looking back now it’s terrifying how innocent I was to it all.   Be Safe never give certain information out, if it gets weird shut it down and tell someone. Its not your fault don’t worry. Just tell an adult.",False,False
