Not working in retail but I am working a job that isn’t paying me nearly enough to do what I do. I’m depressed. Working 40 hours a week drains the life out of me and all I want is my own space to do my own thing like living at my moms is killing me. Not to mention I’m going through a break up (rip to the past year of my life) and my dog (aka my baby/best friend) just died 2 weeks ago. I feel disgusting. Please fucking help me somebody.,False,False

I've always had eating issues though never extreme enough to get beyond something like a 26 BMI, and never managed to get lower than a normal BMI. I thought they'd get better as I got older but really my issues have just gotten worse. I eat more compulsively and at the same time want to be thin more than ever. Like 10 years ago I would have been so psyched to be the weight I am now. But now I feel so disgusting. And I'm gaining again. ",False,False

That feeling hasn’t changed as I’ve aged. All that’s changed is the amount of smugness I feel for being in control when so many people my age are clearly out of control. I also look really young (thank you genetics and chipmunk cheeks I’ve always hated!), so I especially love when someone says, “oh wait until you have kids” or “wait until you hit 40, then there’s nothing you can do.” Like hell there isn’t.   So, yeah, it’s control. It makes me feel in control because I can stay on top of things. My house is clean; my clothes are clean; and my weight is stable at a healthy BMI. ",False,False
