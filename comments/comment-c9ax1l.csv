But I totally get the constant dissonance you have with wanting one thing at the probable expense of another. For instance, my partner loves to bond over food, the other night when he got off work late and I was already in bed, he brought up some chips and queso for us to share together in bed while watching a movie, its frustrating because I don't want to eat, but if I don't eat then he won't eat or he'll eat alone and we won't have those shared moments together, and besides, our relationship is sort of on the rocks so any instance of togetherness that I can hold on to, I try to relish in it. Its a constant battle with my mind telling me not to eat and wanting to be close to him. I know if we were apart I could lose so much weight, but I don't want to be apart from him.",False,False

Now I really wonder if that and my disordered eating are related. I mean I suffer from a lot of anxiety that I'm still learning to manage it and figure it out, so it wouldn't surprise me at all if it's all related.",False,False
