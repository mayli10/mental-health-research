Think of it as a score! So, lets say last month you went 31/31 days without purging. This month, your score for April is 29/30. Think about that! That's still SO great! thats not a failure! thats progress!   Dont give up on yourself. No shame in a stumble. You've come so far and you are so far from square one!",False,False
