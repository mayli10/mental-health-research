Look how they are doing mentally. Once you believe that this person meets the basic criteria of an eating disorder adress then just adress it in a non accusing way. Start maybe with ""Hey are you ok/ you dont seem well/ your behaviour worries me"" Now, i dont know in what relations you are with this person, but if it not somebody you could influence, hence it is a coworker/ friend, then be prepared to not do anything. You cant force anybody into recovery, if its your child/ so / sibling then maybe you will have a shot but otherwise if u will place yourself between the person and their disorder they will cut you out immidietly.",False,False
