I csnt think, I'm shaky, I'm exhausted, I'm in pain. I eat once a day at 4-4:30. Sometimes drinking liquids is too painful. I cant eat solids, been living off of yogurt and peanut butter. I just want to eat something solid, but I'm too afraid and I think my stomach would kill me. I'm going home for the weekend, and I literally have no sweet clue how I will manage eating an actual meal.",False,False
