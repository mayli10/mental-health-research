I only have a protein bar on me and for whatever reason sweets are safe foods so I’ve eaten nothing but breakfast bars for like a week.  I did end up going but I’m sitting here just like not knowing what to do with it.  My prof cancelled my 4pm class for March madness (lol) so I’m holed up in the classroom all alone.  So that helps?    Just gotta take that first bite...  one step at a time...  It’s less the food and more the flood of feelings that I’m afraid of...,False,True
