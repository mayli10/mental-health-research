I was sexually assaulted twice, once as a child and once as a young teenager but I never really started having any mental issues until late teens/early twenties. I know people always say EDs are linked to sexual abuse but for me it never made sense until I saw OP’s post. I’m still not sure if that’s part of my ED though. ",False,False

I was sexually abused when I was 13/14. I developed PTSD, depression, anxiety, because of it. Before that, I had OCD that mostly centered around food- how to organize it, specifically. For instance, it used to be that if a single macoroni noodle touched a single chicken nugget, I couldnt eat any of either. Then, I became disordered, skipping meals and binging after I was abused. I then kind of naturally went into ""remission"" but the stress of college and my abuser trying to get back into contact with me made me relapse hard.  Anyways, all that was to tell you: if what you're experiencing isnt normal, you're still not alone",False,False

I went from cutting, to eating disorder, to alcoholism, back to eating disorder. Literally every time I 'recover' from a self destructive habit...another pops up.

I recently released this year that my eating disorder was so bad in high school because I..... hated myself. Which ya, seems obvious. And diet culture contributed and all that Jazz, but I realized back then I just.... hated myself to my core and anorexia was a way of processing immense self hate. It has helped me because I still have disordered habits but working on self love (and starting antidepressants) means that it even when I slip up I never get as bad as I used to be, because I just don’t hate myself like that anymore .",False,False
