It wasnt until I was so emotional and psychologically vulnerable and exhausted that it just took over quietly (literally didn't realize I was losing weight until i stepped on a scale for the hell of it) so just be very very careful.  If possible, try and talk to somebody (counselor maybe?) about it.  And trult if you can fight it, don't let it take over, even slightly",False,False

I'd had that exact mindset for years.  I was just healthy and some people commented on my skinny figure, but I always had a voice telling me to skip some meals and lose a few pounds so i could see the bones and feel the effects.  But my common sense always kicked it out early.  It hit me in spells as well.  Then i went through and emotionally weakening time and I just gave in and now I still don't want to lose weight, but my head wants me to, and it's a constant battle.  Try and sort it out before it gets worse if you can",False,False
