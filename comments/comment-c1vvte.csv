It does something to how fast you digest food I believe (not entirely sure how it all works),False,False

Even though I know that CICO is how losing/gaining weight works, the only thing that makes me question it is I’m able to maintain my weight with a pretty large amount of calories even though I’m completely sedentary. I was also losing weight while eating over 3500-4000 calories a day when I went vegan a few years ago. Not trying to badmouth our lord and savior CICO but I feel like there’s a lot more factors involved and CICO is overly simplistic. Hope nobody hates me for this comment :/",False,False
