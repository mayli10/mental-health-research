I was triggered hard a couple weeks ago and it's been onnnnn. I'm kinda scared now, honestly, because it's been so long I can't safely eat even if I wanted to. Even miso fucks me up now. I do look at food porn a lot and that feels like I'm actually eating. I'm kinda just waiting for....something to switch on at the point. Its nice to meet you.",False,False

So I hear you re feeling of fasting state – after years of having breakfast and constantly snacking and never giving my digestive system a rest, I enjoy my body's level of energy in the morning, when I skip breakfast. The feeling is completely new even after 9 months of doing it (i.e. skipping breakfast). Emotions I'm experiencing are new in fasting state, for example I learnt to understand what ""hungry"" really feels like. And I'm somewhat more attuned to my emotions when I'm not stuffed with food. I don't feel ""ravenous"" – but I guess what ED-free people feel hunger like.  Fasting does come handy in my chaotic life, so I hear you on that – especially that I travel a lot and it's convenient not to obsess or plan about what to eat for breakfast. It freed up some mind space and time. But it's a thin line of fasting and being worried about my next calorie intake, restricting... I think I'm getting too obsessive about this so I'm currently monitoring my own behaviours. I'm glad I have my therapist's support, I journal and try to be kind with myself if and especially when I go back to my ED coping mechanisms.   You say that it feels ""vile"" ...One saying that really helped me – is that ""You can't hate yourself into the version of yourself that you can love"".   You say that you're too numb to feel. I hear you. I think numbing is what one feels when feelings overwhelm our souls, our beings – overwhelm is actually one of the two primary fears we have as babies (the other one is being dropped). So your feelings and emotions are all valid. And wanting to numb and run away from them – isn't shameful but a natural desire which is very valid to have. I hope you find your way to face your feelings, bit by bit – no matter how hard. Perhaps journal. Perhaps cry – crying won't destroy you – it will help the release and it's also – weirdly – crying is calorie free but it helps so much.  Be kind with yourself – and remember – you cannot hate yourself into a version of you which you can love.",False,False
