In a blender, combine:  * 1 small ripe avocado * 2/3 cup jarred jalapenos with juice (you can halve this if you're sensitive to spice) * 3 tbsp. ranch powder mix * 2/3 cup low-fat buttermilk * Juice of 1 lime  This allows me to have a nice big salad, and not feel guilty about the delicious ranch that goes with it. The dressing will keep for about a week in the refrigerator, so halve the recipe if you're not expecting to eat a lot of salads.  Triscuits are also a saving grace for me. Only 20 calories a cracker.",False,False

When I feel like I need to eat something I'll start with that and by the time I've gotten through like half of it I can get my mind out of binge mode and I've only eaten like 25-50 calories.,False,False
