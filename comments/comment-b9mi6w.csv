But itâ€™s hard to accept average when I was 98 lbs a year ago and got so many compliments despite being under weight.  As soon as I got into normal range weight they stopped.

Sure, maybe I might be restricting right now, but that's by chance. Over 95% of the time, I just have straight BED. I'm not anorexic. I've been overweight for almost half my life. I'm just controlling my binges better.""",False,False

I havent been purging and I cannot get on the diet train. I feel like a failure. I often feel like I dont really have an ed now since I'm not counting calories (which I need to do) and I'm keeping down my binges.

Iâ€™m so sorry. :/ And yeah, I feel this way a lot.  Even getting treatment (sort of, ED therapy) and having a Professional lookin me in the eye and confirming that The Eating Disorder is Bad and that I might very well need *more* help w/ it, I often donâ€™t feel like itâ€™s valid at this point. Because! Of my size! Which is! Reenforced for me elsewhere! Which is...ridiculous!!  AN is literally the only diagnosis you need to be underweight to formally receive, but people are just so unbelievably ignorant about eating disorders in general. Itâ€™s pretty wild.  I mean, for fuckâ€™s sake, especially with bulimia (but with EDNOS as well and certainly with BED), itâ€™s not at all uncommon to be normal weight or overweight or even obese! What youâ€™re going through is Real and valid as fuck, friend, and you are definitely not alone. ðŸ’›ðŸ’›ðŸ’›",False,False
