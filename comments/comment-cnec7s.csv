When I went home to visit my family, I had just told them about being diagnosed with an ED. My step dad was already speculating based on instagram pictures so I just confirmed it ahead of time to avoid being grilled when I got there. So of course as soon as I walk through the door, I’m greeted by disapproving and concerned looks from my step father, and then my mom chimes in that I’m not /that/ skinny, and the recovery center is probably just using me as an easy insurance claim lol. I’m not underweight, but I’m close to it, and even now after hashing it out with my mom about how minimizing my disorder is NOT helpful, she still maintains that x amount of pounds over the underweight category is totally fine, and I probably don’t need as intensive therapy as recommended. But let me tell you, it was suuuuuuuper awkward just standing there for about an eternity with both of my parents studying my body, making comments about my weight, and even arguing with each other about it. I think people who aren’t stuck in an ED mindset, don’t really see how much of an impact their comments can make. We’re getting to a place in society where there’s more bOdY pOsItIvItY, and women are striving to be “thicc AF”...  So even though your mind immediately takes those kinds of comments and runs with them, most people probably don’t mean it in a negative way, or mean for it to be perceived in a negative way. It’s still inconsiderate AF though.",False,False
