Low restricting is anything below 1000 and will turn me in a hungry famished beast that will be prone to binges and thinking about food 24/7 so it won’t work for me. It also depends on you though. I set these numbers because I workout 5x a week but it would be lower if I was sedentary.,False,False

I literally felt invalid and like my ED wasn't real any time I ate over 500. Coming on here was a good reality check in that sense. I'll get just as underweight ""high restricting"" if I do it a month or two longer than ""regular"" restricting. It's more about mindset and goals than the actual number imo",False,False

Really personal to each person down to height, activity, mindset, hormonal cycles, so many things...",False,False
