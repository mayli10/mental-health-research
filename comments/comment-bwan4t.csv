Being safe is important, I needed to hear that, thank you. I'm just frustrated and a little manic right now because my anxiety is in control. I'll hopefully calm down a bit when I get some alone time but being at work means I just have to sit and brood about things at my desk.  Really though, thank you.",False,True

There was just something comforting about the thought that even if I still looked fat I was 'healthy'.  I know I can't just not eat for that long too...I just went a little manic trying to work out if and how it would be possible to make it. I put a bit too much pressure on that goal if just so I would feel like I had made progress to getting to where I actually want to be.  On the plus side, I always lose weight doing a show, so there's always that?",False,True

That’s not what they came to the show for. Even if you didn’t eat anything between now and the show imagine how weak and tired you would be, being not able to preform your role or part correctly. There are always healthier alternatives. Stay safe girly.",False,False
