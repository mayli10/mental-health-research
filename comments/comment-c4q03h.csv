I like the stretch marks but hate the loose skin. Not sure if it would be worth it for me to visit a surgeon because in 20 years when I'm still paying that loan off will I still be glad or care that I removed it all... After all I'm mid 30s I don't need to impress anyone anymore.",False,False

I used to panic about this too which is why I never really restricted so low (also, health anxiety hehe). Iâ€™ve lost and gained the same 2-5lbs SO MANY TIMES throughout the past 3 months, restriction always works! You donâ€™t need to exercise to lose weight bc as long as youâ€™re at a deficit, the weight will come off.   One thing I do recommend is maybe try upping your intake? At least 1200, because if you restrict to 900 or less, once you wanna eat more to maintain/you binge, youâ€™ll only gain it back :/ Not all of it Ofc, but since youâ€™re at a lower weight, your body does require less calories to maintain.   Hope I made sense ðŸ˜‚ YOULL BE OKAY !!",False,False

Nope!   &gt;Has anyone else gained lots of weight and lost it again multiple times? Does restriction still work the second time around? Or the third?  Yep. Over the past 17 years I've gone from normal weight to underweight to normal again to overweight to a pound shy of obese, back to a normal weight and I've maintained a BMI of 20ish for over two years. All 100% due to my eating and drinking habits.  &gt;I'm freaking out right now, I just had a breakdown at the grocery store and I feel so stupid  Don't worry, you're far from the only one. It's okay. -hugs-",False,False
