I think people go into teaching for the wrong reason . They say ‚Äúomg I love kids so I‚Äôll be a teacher‚Äù but the reality is that kids will make you not like them veeeery quickly , that‚Äôs why is so freakin important to have a ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù. You have a ‚Äúwhy‚Äù and it‚Äôs a good one at that so I‚Äôm absolutely not worried about you at all.      There are a lot of teachers who like to complain online about how bad their jobs are. These are the teachers who went into it wanting to teach the top 5%... aka the kids who don‚Äôt need it. Yeah , my job is definitely hard especially because I do work with those kids who are struggling, but I see the impact we make and it is rewards as hell. I always find new things to get obsessed with... your class room is your island and you can make it such a great place if you want ! The good teachers I know who make a lasting impact are the ones like your teacher was, who have unwavering faith in kids to succeed, even the kids who are actively failing. The thing that keeps my job rewards is walking into the room, identifying the kids who need the most help, and saying to myself ‚Äúwhat one or two things can I do to help this child succeed today?‚Äù       I‚Äôm sorry for the huge wall of text but it just makes me so sad that teachers are out there venting to new potential teachers and scaring people away ! I see it all the time.   The reality is that teaching is a great challenging career for the right person, and I have badass insurance, enjoy summers off, lots of things to love ‚ù§Ô∏è  If you want to send me a message I can give you my number !

It's very refreshing! Especially because I'm going into it for the reason of being there for the difficult kids in the really rough schools.   I was one of those students (I mean I was absolutely terrible) and my teachers were the only good adult figures I had. They literally protected me, helped me beyond what they should have. They cared for me, they still do. I would most likely not be here if it wasn't for one incredible teacher in particular. She ignited such a passion for her subject in me that I now want to study and teach it despite the fact that I majorly failed the subject when I was in her classroom.   I want to give it back to other kids like me. I'm under no delusion about just how difficult it can be. Hearing online about how awful it is and how hard it is to find jobs constantly hasn't swayed me, so hopefully I'm able to get through it ‚ù§Ô∏è ah if I knew you in real life I would probably bother you all day every day with questions üòÜ I'll say it again, you're amazing!

Teaching was a huge motivator for me in both my recoveries. It just gives me something else to think about and obsess over.  I think your current method of meeting your goals  is much better than setting a hard line like ‚ÄúI must be recovered before I do ‚Äúx‚Äù ‚Äú ,  because recovery is a long process and focusing on other passions in life like teaching , and the routine you will develop will hopefully help forward your recovery like it did for me :) once I started teaching i was so busy that I didn‚Äôt have as much time to think about myself , and it‚Äôs hard work so I would make sure to eat my lunch üôÇ.    Easing into recovery is absolutely the way to go in my opinion. Just focus on self sustaining for now, like you said, it‚Äôs a more realistic approach!

But I start my first placement in only a few weeks, and I'm obviously not going to get rid of my ED or thoughts about going back to the pills and whatever else in that time, so I'm trying to go for the more realistic approach - just trying to not die/fail/make sure I'm able to be there if needed and do a good job with the kids.

I am in recovery from addiction also so I just wanted to say hi and offer some support. I am in graduate school and a special educator. I‚Äôm TRYING to stay in recovery from ED as well but it‚Äôs difficult. Protein is your Absolute friend here. It‚Äôs pretty low impact in terms of calories and high impact in terms of results. Collagen can be added to anything , chicken breast has 19 grams of protein for very low calories and almost no fat. You can get premade rotisserie chicken or grilled chicken at almost any grocery. I‚Äôm in love with massive portions of spinach (super filling and healthy) with olive oil and a cheese stick. Even the low cal cheese sticks will get some protein in you.          I have zone perfect carb wise shakes with like... 30g protein to 160 cals that are my absolute safe food when I‚Äôm having a rough go at it.  There are also lots of crackers that are not super scary like ‚Äúgood thins‚Äù or almond thins, or rice cakes , plus a spread and  you could mix the collagen in to the spread in you can‚Äôt stomach chicken.  1 scrambled egg is something I can sometimes eat that will give you brain power, crispy tofu is high protein , hmm I‚Äôm just listing random things because I don‚Äôt know what your fear foods are.   I love ‚Äútwo good ‚Äú yogurt, and i also have enjoyed high protein cereals like ‚Äúmagic spoon‚Äù also, though it‚Äôs insanely expensive.     I get the ‚ÄúIQ bars‚Äù brand of protein bars, since I hate the taste of quest bars.  I basically survive on a bunch of snack that are high protein plus a green salad once a day, so at least I can power my brain and body.  Your brain needs these things for both ED recovery and addiction recovery. You‚Äôre doing the right thing coming here to ask!     I hope I didn‚Äôt over load you with information... send me a message any time, I‚Äôm always here to offer support if you need it. You‚Äôre pushing forward in your life in a way that is admirable and I can tell you‚Äôre going to do amazingly once you get some workable foods figured out ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False

They're filling and they give you energy.   I used to eat some of those snack cans of tuna. Fruit and smoothies are always nice and energizing. Salmon is good too. Eggs.   The other thing I would recommend is foods rich in iron; anemia can make you feel really awful (lethargic/brain fog/etc). Foods like broccoli or spinach.   For the first little while after you get started on this journey, I would recommend also taking a multivitamin. Centrum makes one ""for dietary gaps"" that I try to take every day.
