I feel sick if I eat more than small meals and I *hate* cooking. Like, if there‚Äôs easy food available (piece of bread, pieces of cheese) I‚Äôd rather just nibble on those than cook something. Even ‚Äúreally good‚Äù food is just... food to me. I don‚Äôt understand how some people need food to taste good- food is food for me (unless it tastes bad or is spoiled or something). Bland unseasoned chicken is on the same level as some fancy thing I‚Äôd get from a restaurant so... why bother with all the prep work? Some days I‚Äôm hungry, some I forget to eat all day. No trigger or reason for it as far as I can tell. But I also am very picky with food, and obsessively clean/food safety (I really don‚Äôt think this is an anxiety/OCD thing... I work in a medical field and used to work in a microbiology lab. I know exactly what can grow on uncooked food and exactly what it can do to you, and I hate feeling nauseous and throwing up more than anything else in the world.)  This leads to me eating a lot of very small and simple meals because I cannot be bothered to put forth any more effort.  I think the stress of my grad program is exacerbating this issue because while I‚Äôve always been thin I‚Äôve now lost even more weight. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve changed my diet much, I maybe snack less because I‚Äôm too busy, and I‚Äôm not running or going to the gym as often because again, school. But I‚Äôm losing so much weight I look visibly ill and feel awful. I‚Äôm 22 and weigh less than I did when I graduated high school (and I was borderline underweight then, for context). I‚Äôm tired of being weak, of being cold and tired and sore. My joints hurt, I bruise easily, and I miss the muscles I had a few years back when I was at the gym 3 days a week.  I don‚Äôt have a solution, I‚Äôve been to three doctors, had blood drawn numerous times, thyroid checked, all comes back normal and I‚Äôm just told to eat more. Sorry I couldn‚Äôt help, but your story sounded so similar to mine I had to comment.",False,False

I understand that it can be confusing when you don't know what's going on, but this is where professional help is going to be your friend.

I‚Äôll definitely check out safe_food.  It‚Äôs really confusing to be ticking some of the boxes for an Ed but not all.  Since finding out that my eating habits were abnormal I‚Äôve definitely been obsessed with my appearance. I hate the way I look now. It‚Äôs like I just never noticed it before, never thought it mattered but suddenly someone put a mirror in front of me and all this self hatred came rushing in.  Those last paragraph really helped me, I think a lot of the self-hatred/stress comes from this feeling of failure for not being able to do this stuff properly yet. I guess I just gotta give myself time to adjust.",False,True

The fact that you're currently seeing a therapist is certainly a good start.  To be honest, whilst you definitely have *disordered eating*, it doesn't sound like it's necessarily an *eating disorder*. Particularly that you're excited to gain weight and don't really think about your size; eating disorders are almost always accompanied with some form of body dysmorphia, which would lead to *obsessing* over your appearance rather than being mostly indifferent to it, and for most causes people to WANT to be small. And wanting a curvier/thicker body is also not a characteristic of EDs, which generally cause the sufferer to want the opposite.  However, this isn't to say that your issues surrounding food aren't valid or aren't disordered. Simply that it may be something else causing those disordered habits. For example, your obsessions with safe foods IS something that ED sufferers relate to. And having anxiety surrounding the idea that food you've consumed may be poisonous is certainly not healthy. But it sounds more like a form of severe Toxiphobia (the fear of being poisoned) than an eating disorder.  The stress about affording food is probably related to (if not rooted in) the poverty and lack of food security in your childhood; I'm sure you dealt with plenty of occasions where it was unclear where your next meal was coming from, and now that you're in a situation where that responsibility falls on *you*, it's no wonder that it's causing you anxiety.  Eating normally is VERY new to you. It is going to take time to adjust, and for now you're doing a great job by talking to professionals about it. I'm not going to definitively say ""You have an eating disorder"" or ""You don't have an eating disorder"", because even if I WERE qualified to diagnose, I wouldn't be able to do it over an internet text post. However, your experience, to me, does differ significantly from what the majority of ED sufferers experience. Again, this does not mean that your eating patterns are normal or that your fears around food are invalid - there may just be something else going on OTHER than an eating disorder that is causing the issues you're struggling with.  Going from barely eating at all to eating multiple times a day is a huge adjustment, so don't feel as if you're somehow ""wrong"" for not knowing how to cope with it, especially at first. That being said, regardless of whether you have an ED or not, ED-based communities such as r/safe_food can help you to cope with (and hopefully eventually overcome) your food-based fears.",False,False
