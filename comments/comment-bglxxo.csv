Lost maybe 15 lbs before I got caught. I was kinda the worst...  P.S. Don't do this. I mostly did it out of spite and it just made things worse for me and I almost had to go back to inpatient. Although looking back, I wouldn't have been forced to take such drastic measures if the doctors had been more concerned about treating the disorder than making me gain weight when my weight was perfectly healthy for my age and height. ðŸ™„",False,False
