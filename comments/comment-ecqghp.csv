It seems silly but it’s heart warming.   I need to get it together and not be so defeatist. I filled in some paper work today so that’s something?   I look into those workbooks. If anything it would be nice to have something to consciously work though even if it’s not effective. It really cants hurt.",False,True

For me it's a great big soup of small efforts and time, rather than one silver bullet. The exact recipe is different for everyone, but you've identified a bunch of excellent ingredients here.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Change my diet, exercise, practice mindfulness, rewrite my thought paths  Yup. Change diet = change brain function. Practice mindfulness = change brain function. Rewrite thought paths = change brain function.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;But really I don’t see what that would help?  I so relate to this. I couldn't see any way out of the darkness. But what *is* getting me out is taking positive actions - even when it's uncomfortable, and even when I don't see how a particular thing is really going to help. Having people I trust suggesting what actions to take is really key for me. For me those people include my therapist and a support person who found a way out of her own mental health hell.  &amp;#x200B;  1. Dialectical Behavioral Therapy has legit changed my life. (Like, I'd totally do cheesy late night infomercials for DBT.) It's taking lots of practice but I can manage my thoughts and emotions for the first time ever. I like that it consists of dozens of specific action-based skills. You can get the ""DBT Skills Training Handouts and Worksheets"" from the woman who developed DBT (Marsha Linehan) for about $35 on Amazon. 2. For short-term distraction from intrusive thoughts I keep a list of small activities (Crossword Puzzle, Look at nature pictures, Clean something, etc.) Googling ""coping skills"" gave me ideas. The excellent 'calm harm' app has many suggestions too. 3. Letting go of outcomes and focusing on taking actions that are healthy/healing for me has been huge. (I often need help to identify what actions *are* healthy/healing.) 4. I'm not even sure I understand my small progress here. Pieces have been...allowing myself to feel positive emotions, revealing my honest self to people instead of my selectively edited self, and acting as if I am 'a part of'. 5. Act as if. I ask myself ""What would be the actions of someone who is kind to themselves?"" I can't think my way out, but I can act my way into different thinking. 6. Other than the DBT workbook I mentioned, *The Brain That Changes Itself* by Normal Doige gave me hope. It doesn't directly address depression but it convinced me my brain really could be changed in meaningful ways.",False,False

When I start to spiral into anxiety it helps to do something I enjoy that also feels productive, like baking or reading. Baking bread is something you can do that's cheap, easy to learn, and something to feel proud of, especially if you have someone to feed it to. I like to listen to a podcast (welcome to night vale is my favourite) while kneading the dough. Tbh bread is one of those things that, even if you screw it up, it's still pretty good. I can recommend some recipes if you want!  Also some books I've liked recently: american gods by Neil gaiman, the cormoran strike series by robert Galbraith, the goldfinch by Donna tartt.  I'm struggling too. I hope things change for you ❤",False,False

To be honest, I had an intervention done on me! However, this did help get me to a doctor and on a common antidepressant medication (Escitalopram.) This gave me the energy to enrol in a local polytechnic institute, and I was able to occupy myself with studying art there. Making collages and doodles regardless of quality is really therapeutic for me and I hadn't realized.",False,False
