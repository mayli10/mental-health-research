If you keep going, someday your eating won't feel like a big ""occasion"" and while you may still obsess over it a little, it wont feel like it has such a big control over you. There's a reason average recovery time is 5 years- we train our brains and rewire the thinking processes to be all about food- it takes a long time to change it back to close to normal.  Keep going! This is one of those things that I feel no reservations in saying that if you keep going it will get better!",False,False
