I will look into the plain oatmeal though! for now I'm just sticking to fruit and coffee for breakfast until i can move on to bigger things hopefully,False,True

They have no additives, and only take 5 minutes to make on the stove top (which is probably less time than you spent picking out the sugar). Another redditor made the suggestion of ""safely"" adding flavor by using vanilla extract, cinnamon, and a pinch of salt (and an peeled and chopped apple if you want to add fruit). This is now my go-to for breakfast, as I have found that eating your carbohydrates as your first meal helps give you body some much needed for fuel for the day.   Don't be discouraged, at least you tried to eat breakfast this morning. Keep up the good work!",False,False
