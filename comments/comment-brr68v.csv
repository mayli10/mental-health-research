I struggle to leave the house at the moment to go shopping, and use the small shops two minutes away - which isn't helping the situation. I'll consider the shopping list app when I'm feeling brave :)",False,True

I feel like a lot of ED sufferers probably deal with this sort of anxiety too so maybe it could help you too. Also I've been using Daylio (has a premium version but you don't have to upgrade). It is good for tracking mood in relation to different things that you're doing. I added ""ana"" as an 'activity' that I would check for a given day if I restricted a bunch and it helped me notice that my restriction days were much unhappier than normal days. Anyways, best of luck to you :)",False,False
