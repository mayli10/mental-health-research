She‚Äôs always been my rock and she‚Äôs always been the one to bring me back down to earth. Now that she‚Äôs not here I‚Äôm just totally and utterly lost.  Logically, I know that all these memories aren‚Äôt attached to my house, but attached to my heart. But knowing that I won‚Äôt ever cook in the kitchen that she cooked in, or walk the halls that she walked, or tend to the garden that she planted ever again just guts me. I know her soul isn‚Äôt attached to the house, but it still feels like I‚Äôll be losing her. I‚Äôll be handing over the keys to someone who will change everything that she built and all the love she put into that house will be gone forever.   I know things will get better, and I know that I‚Äôll move forward, and I know that for my own growth i can‚Äôt get stuck in the past, but right now I‚Äôm just trapped in my own version of hell.   I‚Äôm sorry for rambling, I‚Äôm just going through it right now. Thank you for your reply. It really helped me see another side that I needed to see",False,True

Towards the end of the year I felt like I was on my path to healing from my eating. Then this happened and it completely spiraled out of control to the point where I can‚Äôt deny that it‚Äôs a problem anymore. It made me realize that I might never heal. I‚Äôm always going to have to fight the urge to use my eating as a means of control. I‚Äôm so sorry to hear about your mom and your house, too. I hope you can find some peace.

Logically I know it‚Äôll get better eventually, but in my heart I just don‚Äôt feel it. There‚Äôs too much going on and I can‚Äôt handle it anymore.

I know she wants me to take care of myself and is probably yelling at me from beyond the grave right now. But I just don‚Äôt have the energy to fight it. I was finally starting to think that things might be okay and then I got slapped in the face with losing the house and it just feels like everything is spiraling with now way out,False,True

I lost my father when I was 20 and I know how utterly devastating the loss of a parent at such a young age can be.      As other posters have written, your mom would want you to be happy and well. Whenever I feel massively depressed and suicidal, I think of my father and how he would have wanted me to take good care of myself and thrive.  &amp;#x200B;  I would strongly recommend seeing a therapist, perhaps somebody who has expertise both in grief counseling and ED therapy.

I always think of how heartbroken he'd be if he could see what I'm doing to myself and for some reason it just makes it worse.  I know you feel like everything from your childhood is slipping away so quickly, I lost so much after he died and I've lost a lot of friends since and I feel like my entire past no longer exists. It's like every place and everyone there who witnessed it is gone. You need to remember that all those things exist inside of you too. Those memories and places will always exist, a natural disaster couldn't even take that away.  The worst is how soon after your mom passed that this is happening, you haven't even fully dealt with the first blow. Take a deep breath and feel what you're feeling. Have a good cry and feel destroyed, you have every right, and then use this pain as fuel for recovery. I know you don't want that right now but you're at a fork in the road. You can either let this fuel your disorder or fuel your recovery. Your mom would want you to recover and be healthy and for her death to not make you sicker. You are stronger than you think you are, I promise.",False,False

I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre going through this. As hard as it is, have you tried reaching out to a therapist in your area? Having someone objectively outside of the situation to talk as much or as little about what‚Äôs going on to might be helpful right now. And if moneys a problem a lot of them do sliding scale so you only pay what you can (even if it‚Äôs just a few dollars)   Please don‚Äôt hesitate to PM me if you need anything at all.

If you want to talk feel free to message me. When you're feeling like this it feels like you're unable to cope but if you keep pushing you can.

All I can tell you is that your mom would want nothing more than for you to take care of yourself in her absence. She would want you to be as great a woman as she was and even better. Please take care of your mental and physical health and consider talking to a professional to deal with your loss (and possibly your ED, if you're ready).
