Just pity for those who actually believe these things.  In fact, they probably have eating disorders themselves.",False,False

Once again a human demonstrates they lack the understanding that eating disorders are a mental illness.  I'm amusing myself trying to imagine how their ignorance would transfer to other mental health issues... ""Your panic attacks are offensive to people who actually struggle with asthma."" ? I think the word ""offensive"" could use a hiatus in our culture. It seems to amount to an excuse to disengage with empathy and double down on judgment and shaming.",False,False

Honestly I think chubby/fat people are incredibly beautiful. No joke! I love to draw them! I just can’t handle it for MYSELF. And I don’t think anyone’s inherently unhealthy or bad for being fat. Fat is beautiful and fine!   Just not when it’s me. Yknow?,False,False
