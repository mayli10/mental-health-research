Taking separate B12 may also be a good idea if the foods you typically eat limit the amount you can get.  Incorporating nutritional yeast into recipes is a good alternative if you don’t want to purchase a commercial protein powder.   It’s best you take your multivitamins &amp; omega 3 supplements with fluid and some type of food that contains at least a little dietary fat. This is important for ensuring you actually absorb most of nutrients they provide.   The amino acids supplied by the protein is essential for function. Fat is also essential. It helps us absorb certain vitamins/minerals, it’s important for our cells, and fatty acids are crucial molecules that determine our brain's integrity &amp; ability to perform. If you want in your spare time you can look up “gray matter” and how a reduction of its linked to protein&amp;fat malnutrition.   And of course stay hydrated.",False,False
