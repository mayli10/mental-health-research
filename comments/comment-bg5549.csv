Every time I go I just get the little slice of scor type cake and coffee.   No one has ever looked at me weird because it's a treat. No idea what the cals are on that are though.   Salmon is a great choice regardless. It's full of great protein and healthy fats and the kind at IKEA so good. I always buy some frozen to take home.,False,False
