[The phrasing for the CEO in the AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9ld746/you_have_thousands_of_questions_i_have_dozens_of/e75qw4v/?context=3) implies that the old Reddit won't be around for as long as originally speculated.,False,True

I switched primarily to an app (sync) years ago. I would never have gotten into reddit if their ""new and improved"" format had been the original.",False,False

I'll admit it wasn't a good comparison. I'm sure if there is really another banned sub which compares to this one. I suppose I could check the list, but there's probably no point now. The example has already been made.   Also, you say you are comfortable with the Reddit format, does that include the experience found on new.reddit.com or are you just talking about the one everyone knows &amp; loves.",False,True

There was no harm in the sense that nobody really encouraged euthanasia. It was more or less just discussions of why it should be legal &amp; how it affects those around us. I suppose it had memes about the generic stuff people spout to suicidal people, but that was really it.   I get the subs purpose, but what do you people plan to do to actually ensure it doesn't get banned again? And can you pinpoint the reason why the previous one was banned?",False,True

Guys - he's got a point. This sub might not last, I've said it several times because reddit does go after subs that pop back up after a ban. We need to be cognizant of that so we don't feel the same pain of the original sub being ripped away. We should use it and make the most of it while we can, keeping in mind that reddit isn't really the safe space it used to be.  I don't know the answer. There are already sites like mpa, I don't use them because I prefer the reddit format to old school forum style. I hope the admins grant us a reprieve and leave us the fuck alone.",False,False

It always nice to have a place were you can relate to most of the people onboard. What may be considered a ""best interest"" might not actually be in the best interest of the actual person though. Sometimes things are setup are for other people and not the actual person themselves. (e.g. family, workplaces .etc)   Judging from what I've read, the last ED community was pretty positive and helpful, yet Reddit still banned it. I imagine they are more watchful on communities that stemmed from banned ones. It's probably going to tough to keep this one going using Reddit as a platform. ",False,True

As many other mental illness subs on Reddit, the real purpose is harm reduction. Just because I exhibit ED behaviors does not mean I can’t try to manage my health as best as possible given the circumstances. Many people here need support, and the current subs only provide it if you are recovery-oriented.",False,False

Whether it be any mental health issue such as depression, anxiety, ocd, substance use disorders, personality disorders, there always runs the risk of a relapse or cycle of symptoms to appear. Banning a community that was a source of social support is nothing short of biased and not in the best interest of those who are suffering.  If someone in the depression sub sought help for feeling suicidal do we ban them? Or if a person with an addiction post that they relapsed yesterday and are struggling do we turn them away? No. You don’t.   At what point is this an infringement on free speech and at what point are we cherry picking what is “acceptable” mental health issues to share about.  I truly believe if a sub could come up with a strict set of rules and strong moderation a positive and helpful community of those wishing to recover or who are struggling to recover can survive.  You are entitled to your shitty opinion, I guess.  ",False,False
