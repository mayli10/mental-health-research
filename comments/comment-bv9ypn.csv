I learned that the 5x a day people usually snack throughout the day or have like 7 to 8 small meals. But yeah, what sloggington said. Lol",False,False

Rule of 3–anywhere from once every 3 days to 3x a day can be normal, it depends on the person.",False,False

Some mornings I do 3 times like you, but it also is typically soft (not hard and difficult to pass) and in small volumes (maybe the size of a medium-small apple all together). It really depends on how and what you eat. If you're having a difficult time, try drinking more water and see if that helps. Also, yogurt has live cultures in it that help regulate your digestive tract. I personally enjoy Activia because it tastes the best and you get the best results from it. Sorry if this was TMI, but I'm trying to be as professional as possible. Lol I am no stranger to the body from a very medical perspective and I guess that's weird for a lot of people.",False,False

But if it doesn't settle within a week, go to your doctor because if might be a GI tract issue. Taking digestive enzymes/eating yogurt helps me when my body just can't.",False,False
