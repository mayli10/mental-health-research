I’m 93 and an hour of walking with heart rate at 110-130 burns roughly 300 cal. You were doing much more intensive exercise and for a longer period of time as well as with a more elevated heart rate so I don’t think it’s impossible to have burned that much 👌🏻,False,False

That being said before I started restricting more I’d walk the treadmill on 12 incline at about 4-4.3ish speed for about as long as you did and it would say I burned around that much. You can estimate it at 800 to be safe but it’s likely you burned more than that, so somewhere between 800-1000 would be your best bet. Hope it helps",False,False
