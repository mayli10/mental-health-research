I think they definitely are suspect and either care about you and wanna make sure you don‚Äôt starve OR wanna make you fat.   Just head home and wait a while to hit them back up, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna get ready and hit you guys up k? See you in a few!&lt;3‚Äù",False,False

Literally today i had a coke zero and my dad was about to ask for a sip but said ""oh nevermind it's no sugar"". I said it tastes the same and *he agreed* but he just likes the full sugar one better. This is coming from someone who drinks 3-4 iced coffees a day though so i'm not surprised. I checked how much sugar was in one of those iced coffees and they have 50g *each* and he drinks 3-4 of those a day.  I could talk all day about my dads shitty diet but i'll stop myself here.",False,False

Good for you getting the sandwich you wanted to eat and enjoying it!   On another note, if people are judging other for getting diet sodas, I just don't understand. I hate the idea of drinking empty calories and there's no  argument that makes normal soda healthier, so why no choose diet (that is, if the taste doesn't bother you). I actually just don't understand getting normal soda lol  And thanks for the advice! The place is local, so I doubt that it's online, but I can check it out. It's in a nicer part of town so they might have it as part of their aesthetic. If they do go for an actual, I'm just ""going to a potluck later."" I hate lying, but sometimes it's easier to get them off my back.   But, I am super looking forward to the escape room! I love puzzles and the place we're going to is super inventive with the ""stories"".",False,True

The other week i went to the movies with some friends and we got subway before the movie started. I was nervous but saved all my calories for a *footlong* meatball sub with cheese and bbq sauce and it was glorious. Even though it worked out, it was still a pain in the ass and i really would have prefered just to have gone to the movie and not dinner. Luckily they didn't really notice my only get a coke zero at the cinemas (one of my friends also got a coke zero so i didn't get judged!)  Anyway, if you're going to a major ice cream chain then you could try looking up the calories online but i'm not sure how much luck you'll have. You could just also say you're not in the mood for ice cream or something. Maybe suggest going someplace else? Don't let this hold you back from going though. Escape rooms sound like a lot of fun (i've always wanted to do one) and this one problem shouldn't stop you from having a great time.",False,False
