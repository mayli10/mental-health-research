People take a lot of cues from how you say something; if you're joking about it, then clearly it's not that serious (in other people's eyes). ""Intense caloric deficit"" said nonchalantly sounds like maybe you're dieting, at most. Something about saying it so clinically makes it sounds sarcastic (this is one of my favorite ways to joke). Context tells us that you're not just dieting, but how is he supposed to know?   However, if you were saying it seriously and actually in a lot of pain and letting it show, (or maybe if you've told him about your ED) then he should have been concerned. You just mention what you said, not how you said it.",False,False
