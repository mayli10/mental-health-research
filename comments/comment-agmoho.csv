Go every other time you can. I was like you, I gave blood every 56 days or whatever the acceptable period is, starting when I was 17. Within a year I became seriously anemic.   It took me a while with iron supplements to get back to normal, and then I took 6 months off when I got my cartilage pierced, which also helped. Your body will replenish its hemoglobin if you give it a chance, and that way you’re still helping people without hurting yourself. Your heart is in the right place though❤️",False,False

I want to eventually be a nurse so it’s just so nice to be able to see it used while I’m at work in the ER currently as a scribe. I’m just worried about not being able to because of my hemoglobin being low. I do eat high iron type foods though as some of my safe foods. Like spinach or these like 70 calorie beef sticks so hopefully it will be okay. The blood drive doesn’t start until 2 pm though.",False,True

I do pass out a lot of times tbh:-( However, I realize if I lie down while my bloods being taken that I'm less likely to get faint. Take a lot of slow, deep breaths. Also, I understand it sucks a bit but maybe drink a bit of juice (or even like a diet coke if you're worried about calories) and a cookie/crackers! Since you're using to giving blood I think you'll be okay though. ",False,False
