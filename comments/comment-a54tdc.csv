He also loves to exercise and takes an interest in my physical fitness/gym-going. So I totally get this. I do think my boyfriend thinks I'm attractive, but I definitely feel pressured to not gain weight.   He has also told me that he finds my confidence attractive and my negative body-talk a boner-killer (my words, not his). Maybe your boyfriend is picking up on your low self-esteem. I'd bet if you put on a sexy outfit and did a little dance for him, he'd be all over it, ha.",False,False
