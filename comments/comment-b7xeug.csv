I don't think being vegan is suspect at all! you have a great cover tbh and congrats on the willpower!",False,False

However, Iâ€™d never call them out on it ever bc it would inappropriate for me to do so and also kinda unethical. So I wouldnâ€™t worry too much about it! Yes they may have noticed, if you specialize in something youâ€™re better at picking up on it than other people are, but ALSO when you have something like an ED youâ€™re hyper aware and suspect of everything so you could always be over analyzing it, but also trust your gut. Youâ€™re not going to be penalized for it and honestly who eats huge meals at work? Itâ€™s p rare, most people eat their large meals at home! No one knows that thatâ€™s your ONLY breakfast and no one knows what you eat when you get home!!! Also people without EDs can still eat the way we do!! So donâ€™t let your ED brain get you all paranoid and if it makes you paranoid come up w some cover stories of other things you eat throughout out the day lol  Sorry that made you feel anxious though ): ",False,False
