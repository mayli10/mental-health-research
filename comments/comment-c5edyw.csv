It started when I was 17 and 6 years later it's still here. Before this all started, I was naturally one of the skinniest people in my age beaker so I don't even know what got into me lol but i effed up my metabolism in the process. Anyway, I went from starving myself so much that I lost my period for a prolonged period of time, then binging for like 4 months, then having a 800 cal diet, then binging. When I was 21, I decided I'm going to eat a healthy diet, and enough food, so that I don't have to binge. That means, yes I can have  pieces of dark chocolate every day , and I can have pasta for lunch, but no fries, no pizza, no cheese, no cakes, and I have to exercise 6 days a week. Now I have kept to this for a couple of years and I am healthy, i get my period, i don't starve myself but I'm also really skinny, and I love that, and I'm all the time panicking about what will happen if I put on weight, if i suddenly can't exercise, vacations freak me out in that respect, because I know that if I got to a ""normal weight"" like an average person, I hate myself even more than I already do. Goshhh I wish I was normal",False,False

Just the right amount of restriction puts me in a hyper focused &amp; calm demeanour. Like I can hone in on a task completely and clearly. If I restrict too much then I'm just a tired mess lol. But yea everything shifts into focus just right. For me it's addicting to be that open minded....,False,False

Sometimes I feel totally out of it while restricting but I also have those moments where everything just suddenly shifts into focus.,False,False
