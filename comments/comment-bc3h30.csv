I also had a really awful honestly really traumatic experience in treatment ( I think it really just accelerated my ED), and honestly I know I am not going to get better on my own and I know I need to go to a day program or really probably inpatient but omg I just can’t make myself, and yes obviously a huge part of that is because I am terrified of gaining weight but also really because I just don’t want to put myself through that awful experience again.  In reading your post I didn’t get at all that you are just being stubborn, I got that you are trying really really hard, but you are a human being and you just have limits to what you can handle,   I may be way off base, but for me I kind of hate myself for having these thoughts, like I ‘should’ be this perfect person who wants to recover and go on to be a productive member of society, and (for me) I hard core judge myself and sometimes think I must be a terrible person for not wanting to go to a treatment program or having a part of you really really wanting to be that super sick person, which then of course makes me more ashamed which just feeds the ED more.",False,False

In particular the fact that they aren't trans affirming - accessing adequate healthcare is a huge issue in the queer community, and could prove a barrier to your recovery. Not being able to afford it is another legitimate barrier. Ignoring your other mental health issues is another problem, because honestly they are usually related, cannot be fully seperated.  I would really look for other treatment options.",False,False

I was inpatient when I was 17 and they didn’t let me make any medical decisions they called my abusive family members to do medication changes.  They took me off 3 mg of klonopin cold turkey.  I got a horrible sore throat the 3rd day I was there.  They swabbed me for strep and never sent the culture in.  It got worse I got sicker.  Nobody listened to me they thought I was trying to get out of eating.  Had they sent the strep culture they would’ve seen it was negative and realize I had FUCKING MONO.  Confirmed with blood test and then got kicked out for being contagiously sick.  Even though I’d been there over 3 weeks sick with mono.  I fell asleep all the time in group.  Everyone was sad and it sucked.  That place is hell.,False,False

The fact that they’re not trans accepting and the cattiness of the other patients makes me think it’s an extremely toxic environment not conducive to recovery. This is not true of the treatment center I’ve been to. We had trans patients and had to start every group with introductions that included our names and pronouns.,False,False

Some books that were refused: the Hunger Games (cause it had the word “hunger” in the title -_-), somebody’s DBT workbook. My mom brought me a Terry Pratchett book and they said no because...?

I'm actually quite shocked by a lot of these things you listed. I can't believe they kicked you out for suicidal ideation or self-harm since they commonly co-occur. Is it because the program didn't want to bear any sort of responsibility or something? Because I can't wrap my head around that.  Also, if it's not too rude of me to ask, which books did they refuse? Because honestly, that is some bullshit. Even most prisoners are allowed to read quite controversial or shocking books.  I can really relate to your struggle with recovery though. I hate living life like this, but how can I function and who am I without it?  Thank you so much for sharing and I really hope you receive something better soon, because you definitely deserve that.",False,False

When I’m ready I guess I’ll look for an individual therapist when I’m ready, and if they’d rather I go to a program I’ll probably check out this place my girlfriend went to. They were way less strict when it came to certain things (you can go on pass regardless of your dining room level, you can use your own electronics in the evening), and it helped her a lot even though insurance cut her stay short. Plus they’re trans-friendly and have a capacity of only 6 residents compared to 50+ at Renfrew and I feel like a group being that small would cut down on a lot of the nastiness. The only problem is that it’s on the opposite coast from me, but if I really wanna try res again I’ll find a way.  (Excuse my second ramble, writing things down helps me think through them.)",False,True

Obviously the method that treatment center used doesn't vibe with you and that's okay, you can still recover, whatever recovery means to you...or maybe you aren't ready and it is what it is.
