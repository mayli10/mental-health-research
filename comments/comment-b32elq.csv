Don't try to scare people, and don't make people think that full sugar mix is a good fucking idea that won't get them drunk as fast.  You're straight up making shit up, and pretending it's to save people from poisoning themselves. Shhh. ",False,False

I can not find any.  By what mechanism does diet soda effect alcohol absorption? Is it aspartame? Sucrolose? Other sweetner substitutes?  What you are saying is basically   &gt;Having sugar/calories/sustenance in your stomach at the same time as you consume alcohol is safer than consuming alcohol on an empty stomach.   And well, no shit.  You could drink a diet coke &amp; rum with dinner to avoid getting drunk too fast if that is what you are into. Nothing about the diet soda itself is effecting the alcohol absorption (like I said unless you can find me a study?)",False,False

Its similar logic to eating before you drink. Also comes in handy when your friends in a folk punk band and you gotta keep up during their shows, haha.",False,True

Its for the people that think it works the same because they’ve never been told otherwise and don’t realize that they’re making themselves sicker. The point of the post is to hopefully cause/offer a bit of harm reduction for the people who are uninformed.      I personally have gotten sick from drinking alcohol with diet pepsi when I was younger, before I realized how bad alcohol + diet soda is. Pretty sure Ive even had slight alcohol poisoning from it.

And using diet soda in a mixed drink is basically just a shot... which people also take all the time... so what I guess I’m saying is, I don’t really get the point of this post because diet soda won’t get people any more drunk than the alcohol itself.
