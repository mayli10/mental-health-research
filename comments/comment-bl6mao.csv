That way, you only need to weigh once at the beginning and that should set the whole system in motion. If the calculations hold true, your daily maintenance number (TDEE) should be accurate or only off by a negligible amount even if you don't weigh every day.",False,True

So if I don't weigh myself every day (trying to limit that) should I be putting in the last measured weight until my next weigh in?,False,False

At the bottom of the first page I do have a note stating that the function of the tool can not provide or replace professional guidance. Do you think that's enough? Or should I include a statement specifically about the numbers as well?,False,True

Its also important to note that TDEE calculations are a very crude estimate due to the fact that the best way to tell BMR is by using a machine, and diet-induced thermogenesis along with activity level are estimated values. I think the calculator is an interesting idea, but weight loss is complex and won't follow an exact CI/CO pattern.",False,False

Those values update daily based off of your measured weight (because even if it's not the same as your 'true' projected weight, it's still the weight you're carrying around that day).   When you plug in your calories eaten and exercised for the day, it subtracts your calories out (TDEE+exercise if you did any extra) from calories in (eaten) and gives you a projected change (either positive, negative, or stable).
