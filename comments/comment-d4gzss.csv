Lemme tell you- missing high school for treatment sucks but DAMN is it worth it!   I missed more than 60% of my senior year because I was in residential. But when I got home after treatment- the last month of school plus the summer before I went to college was one of the happiest times in my life. It would be the most recovered I would be until probably right about now Iâ€™m my life!   Itâ€™s worth it. YOU are worth it. Congratulations on taking steps towards taking care of yourself,False,False
