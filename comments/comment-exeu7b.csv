I feel like, because my tdee is so small if I'm sedentary, and all I crave is junk food, I don't deserve to eat anything nice.  That I have to eat low cal vegetables.  That I do not deserve high cal food or treats.  Therefore I crave them super bad... And give in and eat them and feel ashamed.",False,False

What I know to do so far is to work to slowly retrain my brain. I trained myself to believe I don't deserve food - that I *should* feel guilty about eating. I reinforced that belief thousands and thousands of times through actions and words. So now I need to gently affirm by new actions and kinder words that my body *does* deserve food. That I do not have to earn the right to eat. That perfection is not the prerequisite to be ok or to have my needs met. (I'm so fortunate to have a really good therapist through all of this who models how to be nonjudgmental and compassionate with myself.)  Changing my actions is like changing the inputs to my brain...and then over time my brain can give changed outputs, i.e. changed thoughts and feelings. Simple but not easy. Simple but sometimes scary. It's like intentionally tilting your world on its axis and trusting that the new tilted version will turn out to be the right-side-up you were always looking for.",False,False
