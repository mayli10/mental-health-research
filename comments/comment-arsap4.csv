But when I tried to talk to her at age 19-20, not about ED stuff but just depression and suspected autism, she just told me to stop being dramatic and just work hard for a while because it would do me good. She desperately just wants me to be ""normal"". Not to _become_ normal through therapy, love and support, no, just ""be normal"", instantly.",False,False

I ended up getting too drunk with my parent over New Years and told them. They tell me that I can come to them with anything, but when I do, I get told I’m being dramatic and this is normal lmao ",False,True

I suppose you have a point there” and then I hit the “purge” part and was like “oh heck no”. That isn’t normal. Normal people don’t obsess over food like this. Normal people diet, sometimes to an unhealthy degree, but once they get to that “obsess over food” part they break. They don’t let themselves do what we do constantly. And what we do, we do all the time. If they diet, it’s for a week or two. If they’re a chronic dieter it’s because they don’t stick to the diet because they hit the “obsess over food” part and normal people don’t stick that out. We do this all day every day.  I’m bourbon drunk so maybe I’m not making any sense but here’s my point- yes, normal people eat less calories when they diet. Yes, normal people binge sometimes and then feel self loathing and normal people hate their bodies. The difference is normal people can hit a healthy weight and maybe not be fond of their bodies but think “at least I’m skinny”. We will never be satisfied. We are never skinny. No weight is good enough. And normal people do dangerous fad diets, but normal people don’t eat under 600 calories regularly. Normal people don’t purge, at all.  You are sick, and that’s okay. All of us think we’re overreacting and are just being dramatic and we aren’t really sick and we’re a fraud until someone like you voices it and we say “no, I’m sorry that’s not healthy” and then we realize we’re exactly like you and if you’re not a fraud neither are we.",False,False

She just laughed and said its puberty, i shouldnt worry so much. THANK YOU MOTHER IM CURED NOW",False,False
