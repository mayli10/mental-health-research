Tasty as heck once you get a taste for it.   You can also go for diet cola and gin but I find that tastes a little wonky. Any other diet soda works well enough with vodka imo. Gin and ginger or root beer is great too if they have diet.   If you want beer a Guinness is 125 calories for 12oz while still having 4.2 percent. Maybe stick to one or two of those to sip instead? Guinness is my go to when I want to go out but only get a buzz/ prevent myself from getting bar food since it's quite filling. ,False,False
