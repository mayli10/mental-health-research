As other people pointed out, it's a mix of genetics and a lot of things.  Stress makes it almost impossible for some people to lose weight. I am on the heavy side and even tho I restricted and starved myself I never managed to look skinny, only bloated, soft and soggy.  Body chemistry is crazy.  By the way, whenever I don't have anxiety for a few days, I deinflate and lose entire inches of waist.",False,False
