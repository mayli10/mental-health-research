Fwb apparently didn‚Äôt know it was my birthday even though he practically lives on fb. I‚Äôve been in a deep depression (not just because of him) the last few days and he seemed genuinely concerned and said he wanted to come over and take care of me (cuddles, massage, make me a drink, let me just cry, whatever). So that was supposed to happen yesterday but then it didn‚Äôt because he supposedly got held up at work.   Which I suppose could be the truth, but considering I have trust issues and a history of people legit fucking with my emotions just for fun (this isn‚Äôt paranoia...two people in my past toyed with me for literally years and I had no idea about it until they bragged about it to people who were decent enough to tell me the truth). So. I don‚Äôt believe him and I think every last bit of it is intentional. I‚Äôm a wounded little bird and he knows it and he‚Äôs just batting me around for fun because he‚Äôs bored and my suffering is apparently a great source of entertainment for some people.  The most pathetic part is that I don‚Äôt even care at this point...if he decides he wants to come over and get his dick sucked and then leave like he always does, I‚Äôll let him and I won‚Äôt say a single word about how full of shit he is. Because I have no self respect whatsoever üôÉüôÉüôÉüôÉ   2. Last night my dad called (video chat) which first of all I was in NO MOOD to speak to anyone in any form but I fucking hate video chatting even when I‚Äôm not in a terrible mood and he knows that yet he insists on doing that instead of just fucking texting me or hell even a normal phone call would be acceptable just stop with the fucking video chats Jesus Christ.  At one point during the conversation he completely out of the blue asked if my ankles are still swollen (I‚Äôve posted here very recently actually about having fat fucking ankles that I hate and am so insecure about). Literally almost A YEAR AGO when we were on vacation they got more swollen than usual prob due to high sodium foods and just travelling in general I‚Äôm pretty sure can cause swelling. So for some reason he chose last night to ask about it out of nowhere and made me show him my ankles so he could see which lol good times trying to angle the camera so he wouldn‚Äôt see the all the cuts I‚Äôve given myself recently. Also was wearing tight leggings which didn‚Äôt really want to cooperate with an impromptu ankle exam.  I told him my ankles are always and have always been swollen and it‚Äôs normal for me. He told me it‚Äôs never normal to have swollen ankles even though mine have been this way since fucking middle school so I think I know better than you do what is normal for me but thanks for reminding me about one of the many many things I hate about myself!!!! Great talk! (And yes I know swollen ankles can be indicative of heart or other issues but considering they‚Äôve been this way for 17+ years and no underlying issue has been detected during any of my countless physicals, lab work, or the two or three EKGs I‚Äôve had I‚Äôm pretty sure my ankles are just fat so if people could stfu about them that would be great.)  Then he asked when the last time I went to the doctor was, which I have told him approximately 5000 times already that I had a physical last May. Then he told me to make sure to go once a year even though dr google says you only need to go every other year so no thanks also I have no insurance right now also I fucking hate the doctor so unless I am actually sick or injured to the point of needing a prescription for something i see no point in going just because I have fat ankles, thanks.  I definitely got snappy with him and he said he‚Äôs just saying all this because he cares and not to upset/annoy me which actually just pissed me off more because I have had obvious severe anxiety issues since fucking elementary school, self harmed since middle school, and anorexia since high school, none of which he cared or did a goddamn thing about. But now all of the sudden when I‚Äôm 31 you care about my swollen ankles?! Ok then.  On the other hand he just bought me a very expensive present which I had only mentioned in passing and didn‚Äôt expect in a million years he would actually buy for me (or at least, I figured it would maybe end up being my Christmas present this year) so I feel bad for being pissed at him considering he just did something nice for me. So I have to bite my tongue and not be a raging bitch when I talk to him.  (Yes I know I‚Äôm a horrible brat.
