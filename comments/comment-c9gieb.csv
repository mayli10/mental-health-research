I used pocket dividers to separated the different categories and put the most recent/relevant/often used papers into the pockets. The rest of the materials I got were clipped into the binder.   Also, don’t be afraid to throw out things you do not find helpful or will not use in the future! It can be overwhelming to have to deal with too many papers or sort through them later.",False,False
