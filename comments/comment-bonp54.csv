Refeeding syndrome can occur after even an isolated, single episode of starvation brief starvation (like the 5-10 days mentioned above). A hiker who'd been stranded for a week consuming nothing but handfuls of berries could just as easily be afflicted by it as an anorexic who ate 500 calories a day for a month. It doesn't take long at all without adequate intake for adequate intake to become potentially dangerous once supplied.   As for the second, I wish I could whip up a specific percent of one's TDEE that would neatly qualify as a low intake, but unfortunately I can't and I'm having some trouble digging up anything straightforward.   I'll get back to you if I do.",False,False

I wonder what technically, scientifically constitutes a period of starvation though? Or what constitutes a small food intake?",False,True
