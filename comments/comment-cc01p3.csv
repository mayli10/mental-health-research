I think my insomnia is too powerful hahaha sometimes I'll take 75mg and still be up for hours! But when I'm asleep I am DEAD ASLEEP so that's cool.     Nothing wrong with having a nice hearty breakfast though! Just be mindful of how much you're eating. For me, Seroquel just kinda obliterated my ability to feel ""full"". So I have to really pay attention to my portions. It's ok to eat just enough to be not hungry anymore, y'know?",False,False

I only started a few days ago but I do not find myself eating much more at all, but I'm used to ignoring cravings. I eat once a day, right at bed time because I noticed once I start eating I don't want to stop lol.      How are you holding up?",False,False
