I think it has something to do with body composition. I look at other girls who are 5'0'' and 105lbs and look AMAZING (or even girls that are 15lbs heavier than me at the same height), and I think it's because they lift and I don't. But in order to build muscle, I need to eat at a surplus and that's a big fat NOPE. So instead I'mma be 80lbs someday because fuck me that's why.",False,False

But I def gain weight in my stomach most easily so I feel like it's more obvious, I can't wear anything that will give me muffin top or show my stomach. I see pear girls and think they are sooo lucky to have a flatter stomach. I've definitely had skinnier girls tell me they wish they had my boobs/curves and I'm like HERE TAKE THEM!

Like at 169cm with a 23"" waist I know that I'm very thin, but I still see how my belly isn't perfectly flat, especially after I've put anything in it, and that makes me feel fat. Reasonably I know that my body fat percentage is about half of the minimum body fat a woman should have and also men are constantly praising me for being attractive and thin, but it doesn't feel that way to me. The issue is entirely in our heads though. You're at a healthy weight. There's objectively speaking nothing wrong with your weight. You're absolutely not fat. Your brain is just dumb and won't let you relax.",False,False
