As a result of this I was obese as a child and teenager. I've never been able to eat normally. I either binge or restrict. No in between. I have no idea what eating normally and intuitively feels like because I've never done it. So I swing between binging or purging and restricting with no concept of normal at all.,False,False

I grew up pretty much the same way- completely, completely sedentary computer nerd who would eat junk food all day. but I was only chubby. if I lived like that now i'd be fat because I'm not still growing haha. so I try to appreciate that I DID take advantage of that crazy TDEE when I was a kid and eat lots of junk food. I liked it after all. but looking back I realize my poor nutrition made me feel like shit. I didn't know it because I had nothing to compare it to. but now I'm healthier. I have to eat less, but at least it's stuff that doesn't make me feel like exhausted teenage death. idk. that's my personal silver lining I guess haha",False,False

I ate a lot of snack foods as a kid and even had pediatricians tell me that I was low key on the road to being obese at 8 years old.  My grandmother always made decadent fat filled southern food and offered me ice cream sundaes and sodas.   My parents bought food from Costco and were both heavily into snacking and making voluminous foods to get more out of their money.  It messed me up. I started restricting at 9 or 10 years old with a food blown diagnosis at 14 and food has been ruined for me. I don't feel hunger really I just have mental cravings that feel like lies. I feel like my body is so broken and disoriented that thermodynamics and nutrition no longer help and that food will always be either an addictive substance or a massive anxiety trigger.   I hope that you find peace soon. ,False,False

It especially sucks because those are all considered ""bad"" foods even by people without EDs, but they've always been my comfort food.  For me, when I've tried to eat normally again, the problem is that I feel *horribly* guilty about eating anything that's not a 100% ""pure"" and safe food. Weight gain aside, I feel like I'm literally poisoning my body and every bite is knocking a year off my lifespan or something.  I relate so hard to this, OP. I'm sorry you're going through it too. The only thing I can offer is that it's pretty normal to not be able to eat like a teenager anymore as you grow up. Whether it makes you gain weight or you just need better nutrition to feel good as an adult, I think this is something everyone loses to a degree. Our EDs just beat us up about it.",False,False
