I do indulge this time of year as I think you'd have to be a monk to refuse *all* sweets and carbs for an entire month, but I was very selective on what I allowed to enter my mouth. I had 5 treats I'd allow myself to eat and that was it. I never gained and felt powerful and in control.   This year? I'm shoving anything and everything in there. Even the cheap chocolate which is something I never touch.   TBH, I've given up until January 1st, 2020. I'm taking the pressure off myself to get it under control because I clearly don't. Hopefully, having an endgame will make things feel more tangible. Any left over treats or junk will be pitched by then.   I'll update you. I've never done this approach before and I usually don't suggest it because it feels like I'm allowing myself to fail, but fuck me I gotta try something different.",False,False

I’m stressed because I have to go to my brothers this Sunday for lunch, then we have a buffet Christmas Eve and obviously big breakfast and dinner Christmas Day. And I want to eat. I love Christmas and the food. But I’m so paranoid about weight gain and not being able to log things because I’m not making any of it. I’ve been obsessively logging every fucking thingy every day since June and now I’m not going to be able to?? Fuck.  I am so so paranoid gaining gaining weight. And then at the start of January I have to go to my doctor and I’ll probably be a fatter fuck because it Christmas and I’ll be so embarrassed.   Anyway I’m sorry I really don’t have any advice, I’m freaking out too lmao. I hope someone has advice for you.",False,False
