I actually told my mum once about my bulimia when I was 15 and she called me stupid and wasteful. I stopped talking after that. I'm now 30 and I still have it and she has no idea.,False,True

(My dad used to told me to choose between to lay on the floor so he could kick me or to get beaten repeatedly by the belt. Made me sleep on the kitchen floor. My mom used to slap me till and not stop once I bled from my nose) My mom also contributed by pointing out my stomach, making fun of me when i hadnt put jeans on for a couple of days because she ""bet they didn't fit anymore"" etc. I am now recovering and she goes on a unhealthy diet and makes my little brother go on one..  I'd say they are the cause I developed an ED and the reason I relapsed multiple times. My aunt also said ""if you were bulimic I'd beat the shit out of you"". Very supportive fam. ",False,False

My ED behavior grew directly out of parental abuse. I remember binging at ages 8-9. I went through horrible cycles of binging and restricting until turning 22 (so 12-13 years), and after that point I surprised myself and actually started to improve.   I do think that the abuse made recovery a lot harder, but by no means has it made it impossible. You can do it!!!",False,False

We were always taught not to show emotion and push things down, so when I used to bring things up to, it was like an annoyance to them that I was still being effected by everything! Needless to say, over the years I have seen less and less of them which I think is a good thing. I was broken as a child and can’t just move on past some of these things y’know?",False,False

Maybe I just really really want someone to give me hope. I don't want to be emotionally crippled forever because my parents were emotionally abusive. It's not fair.,False,False

Sounds very familiar. I think my difficulty is that my family still don't accept everything about what happened and still treat my dad like a saint. When I try to discuss it or angry I'm told to get over it. I feel like I can't recover properly because everything isn't clear. I don't know.  I'm left feeling like what's the point? What is the point of trying so hard? Can't make new what's already broken?,False,True

I’m turning 36 soon, been in therapy several times to ty to “recover” from my childhood, (and through that, my 20+ year ED) but I feel that it has not helped at all. I’ve been working on these issues for so long with not much progress, I feel stuck and trapped.",False,False
