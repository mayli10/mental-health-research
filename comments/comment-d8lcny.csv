I wrote out my calorie intake on a post it before I went in and gave it to her when she asked how I was doing with my food intake. I also thought mine would be mad, but she wasn’t. I just told her I find it difficult to talk about because I am used to trying to avoid the topic at all costs.",False,True

Almost 10 years ago when my disordered eating got really bad I didn't bring it up to my therapist at all until I almost failed out of law school and had to come clean. I was seeing her for depression and self harm. Now I am engaging in all my weird food things again, back in therapy again for my depression and grief counseling and wanting to self harm and I have been beating around the bush about my weight for months. Every week I tell myself, this is the week you come clean and every week I fail. Part of me wants her to just ask, are you restricting? Weighing yourself 100x a day? Taking lax? Obsessed with food and the number on the scale? Bc I wouldn't lie. I have told myself it's bc I am not thin so why would she? But she isn't a mind reader.   I am paying good money for this and know that by not being honest I am not going to get anywhere but it is so hard to give up that facade. I don't want her to get mad at me either, or dump me as a patient, or think I am some lying fat cow bc clearly I am not thin so nothing is wrong and I am just making it up. Why is this shit so complicated?! Maybe this will be the week for both of us.",False,False

Therapist asks how my week went. I say fine. Therapist asks if I have anything that has come up that I want to discuss. I say I can’t think of anything. Then I sit there feeling really awkward thinking there’s really nothing wrong with me if I don’t have anything to dissect, but I really do have things, it’s just impossible to be the one to bring them up directly. And I always feel like we end up discussing minor things that aren’t relevant because I can’t bring up the real issue. It’s the worst.",False,False
