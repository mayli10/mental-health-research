The episodes that I get with those disorders are worlds away from the ED urges I often see being described as ""triggering"". I worry about the word losing it's meaning if applied too liberally.... but when it comes down to it, we cannot know precisely what another person experiences  to appropriately categorize. Our internal experiences can be very different than our external ones, especially if we've had said condition for a long time.  &amp;#x200B;  I know my best friend, whom is so sick from her Anorexia that she's literally on the verge of death, has her ED because of a sexual trauma/abuse, which is scarily common, especially with restrictive eating disorders.

As our technology changes so does our understanding- which is what (IMO) makes living in this day and age so exciting! There will always be more to learn though, which is why I merely go off the research I’ve read - which I largely stay on top of.   “Neurochemical effects in the brain similar to drugs of abuse” is what I was taking about; sugar effects the Venteal Tegmental Area, dopamine, endogenous opioids, etc., much like drugs do in addiction, but not to the same extent at all. So many things cause that area of our brain to fire - hell, taking a shit does. We don’t compare taking a shit to being addicted to drugs though, because it isn’t the same thing.   A way to compare such- a glass of everclear and a glass of wine both do the same thing, but to VERY different extents due to the differences in alcohol content. To describe them as being the same would be incorrect, as a major difference between the two is such. Saying that sugar is the same as addiction - which is what is implied when you call it such - is incorrect. Yes it lights up those pathways in the brain - the same ones as addiction - but not as much, which is what differentiates it (among many things) much like everclear vs wine.   I’m glad that people around you haven’t used “sugar addiction” in that sense! The people I’ve interacted with very much so believe it is akin to heroin addiction and such which is terrifying to me...
