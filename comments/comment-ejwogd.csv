When I starved I calmed down considerably. My anxiety skyrocketed on SSRIs. I woke up once out of a dead sleep having a panic attack when I was on one.   Also, when you’re starving your mind is hyper focused on one thing - in my case it was “not eating” and sort of playing a game as to how I can lie (but not really lie) to others to keep from having to eat around them - so I found that I never had any mental capacity to worry about other issues in my life.
