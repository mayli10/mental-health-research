It theoretically sounds nice to not think about food as much, but it also doesn't sound like something that I would want to live my life according to. I'm not interested in having a social life if my ED gets in the way right now.  However I still don't know if I count has having an ED. I've also made some strides towards harm reduction but I don't think I'm ever going to be ""completely normal"".",False,False

It's extremely difficult for a reason. Even when you're nowhere close to being overweight or are still underweight, or even after your eating normalizes and you no longer feel the strong urges to binge and ""lose control,"" losing that safety net, the ""bubble"" that EDs provide, is incredibly scary. I really don't mind being a normal weight because it was always at a low-normal one, though I definitely understand how antagonistic people can become over the idea of overshooting to overweight during recovery. In a way, it does feel like your body is betraying your mind, emotions, and well-being, even though that fear of being anything but sick was self-created in the first place. I think in terms of physical harm reduction, it's excellent, but the mental aspect is why treatment centers that encourage quick weight gain without any focus on therapy never work",False,False
