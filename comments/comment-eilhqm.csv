You are so spot on about that people really don’t see it as a mental health issue/disorder. More like a diet people choose to go on which could not be farther from the truth. I wish these thoughts would go away and I good have a normal relationship with food and actually SEE myself and what this monster in my head projects.,False,False

There are very few *actions* that are inherently disordered (purging through vomiting and purging through laxatives, I would say.)  It's not an eating disorder to exercise to burn off extra food. It's not an eating disorder to eat less after overeating. It's not an eating disorder to restrict your food intake, or to count calories, or to avoid certain foods, or to skip meals, or even to fast. It's also not an eating disorder to eat a lot at once, or to eat more than other people, or to overeat.   The disorder comes from the attitudes, the beliefs, the rationales, the intentions, the emotional response. The disorder comes from the obsession, and the anxiety, and the guilt and shame, from the unhealthy desires, from the lack of control, from the warped sense of reality, from the self-loathing and the dissociation.   I don't have an eating disorder because I run to burn additional calories after I eat. I have an eating disorder because I'm terrified of not running, because I believe if I don't run I will gain massive amounts of weight even if I have undereaten, because I will run and run and run even if I am fatigued or light-headed or injured or conditions are dangerous, because I will run to dehydrate myself and refuse to drink water.   Eating disorders are not *actions* and I am so tired of hearing (even in this community!) them reduced to that. Someone doesn't have an ED just because they fast. Fasting is not disordered. And people can have an ED even if they are not performing associated behaviors.",False,False

The pop culture explanations are often reductive and judgmental, ignoring that the behaviors and physical symptoms are a manifestation of an intense mental and emotional struggle. They are not themselves the whole picture, and often not even the core issue. I’m not that shocked when ordinary folks make this error but it drives me up the wall when medical professionals make the same errors.",False,False
