They have particular personalities and behaviours. A hot girl can easily find a loving and fulfilling relationship, but a ""hot girl"" may struggle if she doesn't analyse how her own behaviours impact on the people around her. So, in short, being thin is NOT going to stop you from finding true love.  The way these people treat you might not just be because you are thin, but because they know you used to be not-thin. Some people base their self-worth on their body image, and they base their body image on how thin they are, and they measure how thin they are by how thin other people aren't. So bizarrely, you getting smaller makes them feel bigger. But most people who only know you post-WL will not treat you like that.  As for the perception that random people are treating you worse now that you're thinner - this is likely part confirmation bias, and part what u/paperklipp said. I have RBF and I've caught myself staring at people and probably looking really mean/angry when in reality I was thinking how cool they looked. People are bad at registering what kind of neutral expression they have and might not mean to give you the stink-eye.  And for the rest of the people... well, assholes exist. I think it's natural to try and figure out a reason for it, our brains are wired to try and find patterns, and you land on any recent changes as the reason, e.g. weight loss. But people can just be assholes, no matter what.  Therapy is not a bad thing to consider though! You don't need to have a terrible awful specific issue just to want to talk things through with an impartial observer. If you've isolated self-esteem as something you would like to improve then it sounds like a good idea.",False,False

I feel incredibly self conscious when I’m out and about because I notice people (everybody, but especially girls) staring at me, and they often have what I would characterise as nasty or snarky expressions on their faces. I moan about this to my SO and he says people are staring at me because I’m so thin.   I also started paying attention to my own behaviour and I realise that I stare at girls too, and I am NOT paying any attention to my own facial expression when I do it. I could be squinting in the sun, scowling, chewing the inside of my cheek, any number of things that might make somebody think I was making a face at them when I’m not. I’m either jelly at their style or I’m mentally comparing my body to theirs. That’s all.",False,False
