Though when people get into talking (arguing) about hormone info (dogma) regarding weight, I try not to get too worried about the fire and brimstone stuff. The body is a complicated place and is mostly just gonna do its thing. Sleep is valuable for myriad reasons, but worrying about how I’m not getting enough definitely doesn’t help the situation.   There’s all the usual sleep hygiene suggestions, which I’m sorrrrrt of working on. Nutrition or lack thereof can definitely play a roll in my insomnia. I’ve tried a few sleep-related meds too, I’m just not personally a big fan of them at the moment.",False,False
