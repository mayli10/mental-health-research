""who is she kidding? you never stop stuffing your face"" - people's thoughts, probably. once you've experienced that kind of silent but also deafening judgement there may come a moment where you think ... fuck this I'm done.   hello high restricting !! you live in the fat girl's shadow, still paranoid about being judged and so scared all the weight will pile back on with one larger-than-normal meal. it's exhausting. intuitive eating? please. it's not even a possibility at this point, i need to hit some sort of mental reset button because way too much has fucked with me to ever go back to being normal. we never get to win. no matter which side of the mirror we're on.",False,False
