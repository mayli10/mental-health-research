Like under 209 calories. Then I set a timer for 20 mins, and if I'm still hungry I know that I'm actually hungry and not just craving flavor. But if I'm not physically hungry I tell myself, you're just bored. And then find an activity. If you like to read, curl up with a book. If you like art, draw something or continue on a project. Or even, go on a short walk (if you live in a place where it's safe to do so) and dont bring your wallet. Just removing yourself from a place with food can help. A d while walking just remind yourself that you can eat when you're hungry but there isn't a need to I'd you're not.  Also what's been helping is if theres something around that I want and it wouldnt be wasteful to do so, I give myself one bite and really really savor it. Acknowledge the flavor and then put it out of your mind.   It's all easier said than done but I hope at least 1 of those things helps you. Good luck!!",False,False
