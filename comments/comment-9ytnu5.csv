Keep a low profile on this sub, and maybe be diligent about reporting posts to the mods when something particularly concerning pops up. (I once came across a comment chain on the old one where a thirteen year old girl was asking how to purge and someone actually described it to them. Ever since I read that I'd kind of expected the sub to get shut down eventually and I really hope that type of toxicity doesn't end up here).",False,False

We don't need MORE scrutiny and more attention so that people can laugh at our pain and so more creepers can tell us to send them pictures of our bodies. ,False,False

We've lost the old sub but since this one is able to stay I don't think we should attract attention to ourselves, just inform people that we exist",False,False

It would cause too much of a shitstorm of uneducated sjws who don’t get that mentioning and eating disorder doesn’t mean the glorification of it as well. ,False,False
