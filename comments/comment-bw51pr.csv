(if you have amazon prime a lot of kindle books are free and you can read them on desktop--they might be terrible though) or a series you cant stop watching. once im comfy enough, even food wont make me get out of my blanket nook  * take a long walk. or, drive to a nearby park/reservoir/state forest and explore there (be safe though!)  * CLEAN! like, even the things you never think of. baseboards, cobwebs from the ceiling, dust off lamps/lightbulbs/fan blades. Windex everything. wipe down light switches and door handles. seriously, everything is dirty all the time.  * look forward in your calendar for the next month or two: any birthdays or holidays coming up? maybe start planning out presents or browsing for good cards. (i love buying cute greeting cards &amp; stamps)  * make an account on mint.com and organize your budget and spending. categorizing all your recent purchases takes time anyways.  * Empty out your closet, toss old ratty clothes, and reorganize the rest. Same for shoes, jackets, your wardrobe, anything.  * meal prep if you want. if you dont want food ready in your fridge you can mealprep ice coffee or tea by brewing and sweetening it and then keeping it in a big jug in your fridge.  * also if youre up for it, check every expiration label in your fridge/pantry. i bet even if you think its 98% good, theres probably 20 expired things you can toss. and tossing food feels good.  * I like browsing for grocery coupons and planning my grocery list for the week but im also shopping for me than just me, so i gotta do it either way.  * do you have a car? check your tire pressure (if you dont have your own gage/pump, you can usually do this free at a gas station) shake out the matts and vacuum them. Double check if your oil or inspection is due soon and make an appointment for it. Toss out the monster can thats been in your cupholder for a month now (this is for me lol) wipe down your car seat and steering wheel.  * start a journal. even if its a freeform, doodles and stream of thoughts journal where you just write terrible things for an hour and then rip out the page and burn it. Itll feel good.  * Do a favor for your family or friends. I always volunteer if someone needs a ride somewhere or help setting up for a party, moving, anything really. I like helping my friends, they like getting help, keeps me busy and out of the house too.  * Update your resume. you never know. google docs also has some great free templates for resumes that look amazing, so you can paste your info into there or retype it so it looks real nice.  * Browse volunteer listings or charities if you got extra cash (i like donorschoose.org -- you can find classrooms near you that need supplies and the kids might send you cards after to say thanks)  * try out a hobby youre interested in. knitting, origami, coloringbooks--anything fun and relatively cheap that keeps your hands and mind busy.",False,False

TV and movies are not enough. I have found that video games help. You get really mentally invested and your hands are busy. Also probably not a healthy recommendation but vaping helps. The flavor can be a decent substitute and it's hand to mouth just like eating. They do make zero nicotine liquid because I would not recommend a nicotine addiction to anyone.,False,False
