Some people would say ""until you reach your weight set point"" which is probably the most realistic answer. Every time I've gone through a refeeding phase it lasted at least 3-4 months.   I know it sucks :(",False,False

I told her I'd go shopping with her on Friday. She's buying a bunch of stuff because nothing fits her anymore since she lost a bunch of weight. It's honestly making me sick just thinking about watching her pick the smallest sizes and buying clothes I wouldn't fit in.

The first three weeks or so, he kept trying to feed me *so much* while eating really little himself and played it off as forgetting to eat or intermittent fasting. It reached a boiling point where I told him point blank that I have bulimic tendencies, so *please* don't make me eat more than I want to because all it does is make me want to go to the bathroom and purge. I'm trying really hard to move away from b/p and just restrict like a normal person and gradually lose weight. Him, on the other hand, apparently SOMETIMES goes an entire day without eating, or otherwise eats a sub-1000 meal once per day.   Now we're both clearly mulling calories together when we eat out, and we're fuelling each other's bad eating habits. Buy a Starbucks frap to share and literally take three sips each from it before throwing it out. Split a single dish at family style restaurants like we're college kids with only $10 to our names. And I'm a terrible person and he restricts so much better than I do in his day to day life, so I purposefully eat slower so he ends up eating more than half of our split dishes and buy him small boxes of Asian confectionary whenever I come over that he eats because he really likes me and is touched that my broke ass bought gifts with him in mind. I know how agitated I get when people try to fuck with my eating habits, so why am I doing it to someone else? What's wrong with me???",False,False
