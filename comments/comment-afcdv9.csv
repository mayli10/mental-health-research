Zero tolerance for that shit, hence the ban. It's why I asked you and didn't assume - I gave you plenty opportunity to defend yourself without just PM'ing a mod to ask for your ban. You need to calm down a little - your replies are super defensive and that makes people unwilling to engage you and just downvote you instead. ",False,False

Nah. I find very thin people attractive so I don't really judge about that...  &amp;#x200B;  I agree that it requires a lot of effort. I also agree that there is an high expectation for women to look presentable and requires a lot of time, effort and money etc. and that this is both expected and disrespected as ""vanity""...

Or even just gain a little bit of weight, or don’t keep on top of my manscaping routine? I’m dropped. Dead. I mean nothing to them, outside of being a sex object.

It annoys me doubly because I really think it all comes back to men not seeing women as real, living people.

He loved that I was unhealthily thin, but then would get weirded out by me not wanting to eat junk food with him all the time. Like you can’t have both my guy.

I always felt annoyed that guys used to leer over my friends who were overweight.  Mostly they were into their big bewbs, but they definitely preferred a fuller figured girl.  Guys my age (40s) still seem to prefer women with ""more meat on their bones"".  One of my big reasons for developing anorexia was to have an undeveloped, ""undesirable"" body.    Most men have warped ideas about women anyway, so I'm not surprised they have no idea it takes work to be thin.  If they don't have an ED and they're thin (if that's possible), it'd be like expecting every man to be buff when it takes months and months of dedication working out at a gym to get that way.",False,False
