A person can be in any weight and have any size and have an eating disorder. Everyone who has eating disorder deserves life without it,deserves help and feel valid.  I have been normal weight, overweight, obese and underweight. Now i'm in the normal range since coming up in weight as i was recovering. I think my ed was the same as when i was obese (when my ed started) and when i was underweight. Maybe even when it started it was even worse than later on.  You are valid. You deserve help. You deserve love. ‚ô°",False,False

No hair loss (fingers crossed that won‚Äôt happen!) I feel generally good. If I feel bingey I plan a decadent OMAD to satiate that urge with a ‚Äúplanned and controlled binge‚Äù so I haven‚Äôt had an out of control binge in months.   Also, shocker of shockers: I‚Äôm somehow gaining muscle! Not sure if it‚Äôs the boost in HGH they I get from intermittent fasting, or the fact that I‚Äôm pretty strict about meeting a high enough protein macro, or that I do pretty intensive workouts every day but holy crap!

EDs happen at EVERY size. 90% of the disorder is more like what‚Äôs going on in your head rather than your actual size. it‚Äôs a shitty thing for anyone to have to go through, but it‚Äôs even shittier that there‚Äôs a stigma that people who are bigger can‚Äôt have an ED unless it was like BED or something.

My current clothes are 18‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt wear anything that‚Äôs not too big. I bought size 16 jeans in December and they‚Äôre too big now. I‚Äôm still overweight by BMI. Down from 32 to 26.X.

All of you guys deserve support and love, no matter what your size, and I reckon that if you've suffered an ED, most people here will know that it has nothing to do with the weight half the time.
