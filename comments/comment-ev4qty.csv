He had a lot of ups and downs from what I observed. What seemed to help him most was helping the others in group and offering insight as to how life could be if we didn’t take recovery seriously. Seeing someone at his age with an ED was definitely a reality for some of us and it was heartbreaking.",False,False

The cut point I use for when to say a self-hating behavior is an eating disorder is that you are doing harm with how you eat (or in diabetics, the combination of your food with your drugs), and you don't stop despite serious symptoms of harm (such as lack of energy, rotted teeth, Russell's sign, brain fog, nutrient depletion and deficiency, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, neuropathy, loss of interest in things which aren't food, sarcopenia). Someone can be UW and completely fine (note: this is extremely rare), or can be absurdly OB and extremely anorexic (this is ALSO extremely rare), so weight by itself has nothing to do with eating disorders. It's how you view the person controlling the vessel. Ultimately, if you are absurdly obese, but your eating behaviours remain instinct-driven and not based on some irrational desire to lose or gain weight, and you are not hating yourself for your eating behaviors, you are fine. You may be harming yourself, but you are not eating disordered. If you hate your body but you aren't fucking with your diet over it, you are disordered but not eating disordered.  Also reddit is being slow rn",False,True

Whenever someone gets so underweight they have health problems then it’s a problem, but because I grew up with disordered eating as the norm I honestly think that a lot of what people do on this sub is “acceptable” (in my mind at least). Maybe not bulimia since the acid can hurt your throat and whatever (but everything is fine in moderation). Like I’m always trying to justify my own actions and normalize them. I really never would have considered myself to have an eating disorder until I gained back like twenty pounds I had lost and the hatred of myself made me realize how much it was really affecting me. I still wouldn’t really consider myself to have one, because again I saw all that normalized as a kid, and I’ve also never been crazy underweight or lost my period. Just underweight enough to look good, at least to me",False,False

I see a lot of the same self image problems in myself as I do in her, and she's too sweet and wonderful a person to be suffering like that. It's heartbreaking to watch her put herself down like that so I try to build her up every time she does it, and I mean it when I compliment her, too.   I worry the grief of being widowed and depressed could lead to her getting worse someday, be it in the form of an eating disorder or suicide. Our whole family worries.",False,False

I actually feel emaciated while still being a bit OW, because I have thin, muscle-less wrists. The last time someone fat shamed me, it was -30°C, I was on my bike wearing a sweater and two jackets, I asked the guy ""Really dude?"" when he parked jacked halfway up a sidewalk and the fatshaming did get me tilted because it's like ""If only you knew, pensioner...""

He made up his own strict rules, would skip meals, lift weights every night (he bought a bench press we still have), refused to eat certain foods, etc. He lost like a hundred pounds and looked pretty ripped in the photos my mom has from their vacation that year. I never recognized it as abnormal then and, looking back, I think it contributed to me believing that was the most effective way to lose weight and what I should be doing. He’s since gained weight (not all 100!pounds back or anything) after a cancer diagnosis 7 years ago (he’s fine now) and I remember jokingly calling him fat a year or two ago and he actually got really upset about it. I got kind of annoyed that he couldn’t take a joke but, looking back now, his eating habits were really abnormal and he still today sometimes skips meals or cuts out like all carbs for a period of time if he feels fat or whatever",False,False

Yeah, that's a problem.
