Tell her how you feel in the nicest way possible shes a therapist so she should understand and if she dont report her to the freaking association that she belongs too(I'm to upset to remeber off hand) and tell them she need more school they let this one out n she wasnt ready,False,False

Funny enough tho too she pushed me down to every other week when she said we weren’t really making any progress. Since then tho I saw a new psych she recommended, took their meds and am trying but yeah she still kinda sucks. She also told me to text her and let her know how I was doing w my meds which I did early this am and still haven’t heard back from her, it’s 330 PM. Why even tell me to text you then? I feel foolish.",False,True

I wanna make hot chocolate watch some scary movies and snuggle ... blankie burritos. .... itd be awesome,False,False

(If in the US, there can also the whole hoop-jumping with insurance and what they’re willing to cover.)   A question might be...will a period at a more intensive level of care be the activation energy you need to be able to continue forward when you step down to a lower level of care? Will it foster choosing to build habits of action and thought that are just seeming prohibitively difficult to develop with your current treatment plan? (The *choosing* has been essential for me. If I’m just constrained and forced, that falls apart after discharge.) If you’re a list person, writing out what you’d like/need to get out of treatment and comparing how levels of care support those goals could be helpful.   All that said, if your circumstances and insurance make a higher level of care possible, why not? The quicker mental/emotional/physical healing can happen, the better the long-term outlook. As a storytime, I went to multiple residentials for a severe mood disorder because I was just unable to get traction in outpatient or PHP. There was zero (and I mean zero) immediate improvement, but I absorbed things, I learned things, and who knows how those experiences contributed to my later improvement (which happened on an outpatient basis).",False,False

Idk if I’m bad enough to need it. That’s kind of why I posted, just trying to figure out *how* to figure out a higher level of care is warranted :)",False,True

I could never focus on that as much as I would love to!  I don’t disagree about therapy being bumped up buuuut she was the one who suggested we drop it down to every other week randomly. Although I did see her last week and she scheduled me again for this week so maybe the every other week thing is over idk. I just feel awkward asking about it lol,False,True

For me there’s been an important distinction between accessing help because it’s what I’m supposed to do versus accessing forms of help that are effective for me and in which I’m at least willing to be willing to be invested. Increasing frequency/level of care has mostly helped me when it was the right help for me and I was open to implementing their suggestions in daily life. That said, finding the form of therapy that works for me (DBT) has been huge, and having providers I trust is essential. When those things were missing, changing things up was a solid choice.   I think your a, b, c questions are important questions and sound like really good things to discuss honestly and openly with your providers at your next appointments. You can be pretty confident nothing you disclose will be shocking to them. It’s normal to have conflicted and confused feelings about pursuing recovery! Wishing you well &lt;3",False,False

Not medication but meditation,False,False
