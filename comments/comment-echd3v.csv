It also made me feel very numb and i was more likely to seek outside stimuli. Also low libido. Basically i hated it.,False,False

It could very well be that the therapist did say all of that but once she said P*rozac, anti-depressant* I got stuck on that. You're absolutely right that taking meds doesn't make you a bad person, it's a stigma I need to get over. You've definitely helped.",False,True

Prozac is a medication that’ll prevent your body from absorbing the serotonin that it’s missing. imo, it was rly helpful in stopping the b/p cycle so I was able to do the work in therapy and I felt like less of a slave to my urges. the way i see it, meds don’t give me an advantage or make me dependent on something I don’t need, they simply put me on the same playing field as everyone else who’s brain is balanced normally. as for nausea, it’s different for everyone but i only rly get nauseous when I  take them first thing in the morning without eating first. hope this helped a little bit at least, and at the end of the day it’s your body and your choice - taking meds doesn’t make you a bad person, neither does not taking them!",False,False
