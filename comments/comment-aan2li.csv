She’s amazing and she doesn’t have any mental illness.  Her parents were alcoholics.  She remembers having to go to hotels on school nights bc her father was drunk and apparently a bit abusive.  She married my dad, a wonderful man, and he died of cancer at 53.  Her son killed him self and my other brother has the bad mental illness.  I stumbled upon this forum bc I was researching binge eating for my brother and I saw many similarities which is why I asked the OQ.  I really feel for my mom bc she’s just a wonderful mother and person and she wonders how she ended up with so much tragedy.   I hope I can have kids and they turn out to be happy and healthy!  Don’t let the last talk you out of having a family if that’s what you want one day.  You never know, in twenty years they may have successful treatments for everyone !  ",False,True

Your kids might turn out fine though, plus nowadays we have a better understanding of the brain than we did 50 years ago.

It’s weird because I honestly had the perfect childhood.  My dad would only drink occasionally socially, no alcohol in the house, no one smoked, no abuse or trauma.  But my brother ended up being an alcoholic and my other brother has severe depression, anxiety, sometimes hears voices.  My cousin had bulimia and turns out my grandparents on my mom’s side were both alcoholics and so was her brother.  The thing is my brothers didn’t have problems till after I was 18 and my grandparents were dead and so was my uncle so none of it whatsoever affected me growing up.  Not sure how my brothers had these problems either since they had nice childhoods also.  So it must be definitely genetic at least partially.  That makes me think Adopting might be ok but then you don’t really know what the baby comes from either.  Sigh.",False,True

The issue with families like mine is most likely a combination of traumatic experiences and chemical imbalances (which nobody ever got treated for, thus generating new traumatic experiences and so the cycle repeats itself with the next generation of kids).
