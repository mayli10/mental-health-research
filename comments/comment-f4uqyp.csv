There are people for example with a narrow torso but wider limbs or vice versa.

Never found anything to help me get a unanimous result tho so idk. I have the thing where I can wrap my fingers around my wrist and the fingers overlap tho at any weight including obese so I think my hands might just be weird shaped skdkkdlsldks",False,False
