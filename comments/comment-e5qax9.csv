It‚Äôs really hard to have a noticeable deformity that you can‚Äôt do anything about. Just bc you were lucky to have really good care, doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt still have a problem that effects you and is hard to deal with. I often feel guilty for being upset ab my problems, bc in general I live a very good life and I‚Äôm lucky to have what I do. My mom always reminds me that just bc other people have it worse than I do, it doesn‚Äôt mean my feelings aren‚Äôt valid.",False,False

In a sense I wouldn't mind gaining if it covered up my weird shape. Currently my arms are tiny and they look ridiculous next to my broad (yet bony) torso. I guess all we have left is learning to love ourselves but if that was easy none of us would be here. :''))",False,True

It‚Äôs so hard to express how it makes me feel, but it definitely makes it easier for me to hate my body bc I can point at it and have proof that something is wrong",False,False

I feel you so hard. I have scoliosis too and  lumbar lordosis(sway back). My hips roll under my body, which gives me the big butt too, and even worse it makes my stomach look round and bigger. One of my sides is kind of hour glass shaped and then the other one is straight up and down. Also I have a huge love handle on only one side, that will never go away. And, according to my doctor I have a ‚Äúpigeon rib cage‚Äù which means my ribs show more easily, but it‚Äôs not in a good way bc they also come out too far and are really broad. Sometimes I try to walk with my hips tucked under, but I can‚Äôt make it a habit. It all makes me have even worse mixed emotions about losing weight, because the skinnier I am, the more obvious they all are",False,False

I think that might be a normal reaction though, since most people like to look pretty/attractive, so it would make sense why we‚Äôre unhappy with the way our bodies look, especially if it‚Äôs something that can‚Äôt be fixed that‚Äôs affecting the way we look.  I got okay care for mine, not exceptional or anything (because my mom is one of those anti-doctor, conspiracy-theory-type people but that‚Äôs a different essay for a different class lol) but it was kept track of one way or another, at the very least. I still wish I looked normal, though. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre a spoiled brat for wanting some sense of normalcy/confidence in how your body looks.   It‚Äôs hard to fight back that feeling about yourself, though. I feel guilty for wishing my body looked symmetrical, even though there‚Äôs really nothing anybody could do. I mean, why should I expend all this energy on hating something that can‚Äôt be changed anyway? But I can‚Äôt stop focusing on it and I feel like a piece of shit for it. It just sucks that we got stuck with something like this.",False,False

I've literally had dysmorphia about this before I had ED behaviours. I also feel guilty because my dad works in scoliosis treatment with children and my uncle is famous in the field. They both gave me the absolute best care but I'm still a spoiled brat wishing I had a prettier body line.",False,True

My shoulders, waist, hips, and legs are all pretty uneven. One of my shoulders is higher than the other, same with my hips, which means one of my legs is longer than the other and one side of my waist is very hourglass-y while the other side is completely straight up and down. One of my shoulder blades sticks out similar to how you described, and my butt sticks out too. It‚Äôs all been a big source of my dysmorphia for a long time, especially since it started getting really noticeable around puberty. I got really insecure about it and I still hate it.  My doctor recently said my body did a pretty good job of adapting to the curves &amp; twists in my spine, so nothing‚Äôs too out of place or anything like that. But that also means that it‚Äôll never get fixed because it never got debilitatingly bad, more so just a constant ache in my back and an asymmetrical body. (Probably unrelated to my ED but that‚Äôs where my obsession with symmetry came from, I think.)  Anyway, it‚Äôs been a huge source of animosity within myself. I hate that my shoulder blade sticks out and makes it look like I have extra back fat on one side of my body. I hate that my waist looks small and pretty on one side, but on the other side, I look like I‚Äôm built like a fridge.  I used to think I just had weird fat distribution and so if I lost weight then I would look normal. No matter how much I lose, it all looked the same. Anyway, as I got older, and even when I saw the most recent x-ray of my spine, I know that logically, it‚Äôs my spine that‚Äôs thrown everything off and that I can‚Äôt do anything to fully fix it. But that doesn‚Äôt stop me from obsessing over it. Even though I know all that, and it makes logical sense, I can‚Äôt stop. I‚Äôm still convinced if I lose enough then I‚Äôll look normal, finally. It never happens, my logical brain knows I‚Äôll never look normal, but my ED brain tells me the opposite. Maybe one day, I won‚Äôt hate myself so much for something I can‚Äôt fix, but for now, my scoliosis plays into my ED/dysmorphia a lot so ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",False,False
