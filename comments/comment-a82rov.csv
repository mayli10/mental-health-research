We do deserve happiness, I hope we both find it in 2019 ♥️  And thank you for your comment, I really do feel a little bit less alone ♥️",False,True

I get what you’re going through, based on my own experience. ♥️ All I can say is let’s try to survive this horrible year together, and make next year our bishhh. I’m going to work on being healthy for me- starting January 1st. I have zero desire to even try to make something good of this remaining year (because it’s the most cursed ****show of a year ever, so screw it). Buuut you and I both deserve happiness, even if that means starting from ground zero. I’m sorry for what you’re going through, because it’s heartbreaking; I understand your pain. Here’s to us in 2019.  Here’s to health. (Screw starvation or bingeing or anything like that- Screw self hatred) Here’s to us. 2019 is our bishhh 😈♥️",False,False
