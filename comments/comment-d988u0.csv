I never realized it was a thing until I came across the sub for it! The version of me in my head plays bass guitar and has long mermaid-y hair (and is obv very thin) among other things. It still kind of is ‘me’ but, you know, good at things, and being the hottest version of myself, haaaaa. I imagine all kinds of scenarios of myself just succeeding I guess, impressing people, knowing what to say at the right times, and basically not being a totally introverted sad sack. I spend like SO MUCH of my time doing this. Especially at night when I’m lying in bed trying to fall asleep. It calms me and my crazy racing mind. But probably a huge part of my eating disorder is trying to reach this goal of becoming this person. When I could maybe just, not restrict, and take bass guitar lessons or something a little more healthy and good for me.... ugh.",False,False
