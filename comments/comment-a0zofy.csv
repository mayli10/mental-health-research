Anyway I had taken laxatives and planned it so I'd have the day off of work. They kicked in sometime in the middle of the night and then I ended up getting called into work early in the morning. Because there wasn't any water in the toilet I left...a bit of a mess. It was NBD, I'd clean it when I got home from work, right?
