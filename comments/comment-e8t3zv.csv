Your body needs energy consistently throughout the day - not in one go. When you restrict and only eat once a day, it’s easier to overdo it and make yourself sick. It also opens the door for EDs in people who maybe wouldn’t have “gotten that bad” because skipping the OMAD is skipping food for a day all together.   Really it’s just disordered all-over - like most diets - and the more rigid people are in it, the more unhealthy it is.",False,False
