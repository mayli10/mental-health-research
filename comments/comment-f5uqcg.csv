It’s so much less work and honestly I’m way less hungry when I fast. The only problem is that my one meal makes me feel nauseous and sick bc my tummy is like wtf :/,False,False

I love “diet” foods like plain rice cakes and pickles. For me it’s so enjoyable. If only it actually made me full then it’d be perfect.
