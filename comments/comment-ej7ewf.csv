I think that if you didn't eat over your cals there isn't any significant fat gain, don't worry. maybe you have a bit of water retention but that will go away. like I said I indulged a lot and the gain still isn't significant, at least for my standards.  however holidays are now over and we need to get back on track, whatever it means for you. I restrict again but yeah the working out is pretty hard to get back into. what about you start out slow? try to go on a walk or maybe hit your step limit. try to get in the mood :) once I start I wanna continue so you can try it this way  I wish you the best with all going on. stay safe my dear",False,False
