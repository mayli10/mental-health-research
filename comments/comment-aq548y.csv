Binges are the worst. and don’t worry, lots of people on here have had binges way over 2000 cal. I had one a few months back that was 5000 cal. Honestly my only advice is to take it easy and get some rest, in about a week or so it’ll be like it didn’t even happen. Also definitely drink lots of water once you feel up to it! ",False,False

You're not alone, and everyone else is right, it couldn't be more than 2lbs actual weight gain. ❤",False,False

But, and I hope this isn't rude, that all sounds really good lol was it the kind of binge where you didn't really get to enjoy the food and it was more about the compulsion?",False,False

Even if you’re a few thousand calories over maintenance it will really only translate to 1-2 pounds of weight gain and you will lose it in a few days without binging (in my experience.) Sadly restring calories is a major trigger for binge eating so i’d recommend some light exercise (walking, yoga), lots of water, and doing something you enjoy to take your mind off of food. &lt;3 ",False,False
