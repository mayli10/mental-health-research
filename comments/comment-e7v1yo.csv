I think...I think I started hating myself to protect myself? That if I hated myself first, and hated myself the most, nobody else’s anger or scorn or disappointment could touch me. I was bulletproof! “Hate me if you want. It doesn’t matter, cuz I already hate myself more.”   And the hate became such a maelstrom that somewhere along the way I just shut down my emotion processing. I was terribly angry and anxious all the time and genuinely didn’t know it. But in numbing the unpleasant emotions, I in consequence numbed all the nicer ones too.   So, not feeling love, or gratitude, or contentment...it doesn’t mean it’s not in there still. The seeds are there, waiting for a safe time to grow. To love other people scares me. To love myself makes me nauseous. But I can love my doggo. I love nature. I love the children’s books that make me cry (because, as my therapist notes, they’re at the emotional level I can process). I view it almost like a muscle. It’s atrophied so now I practice finding it, naming it, letting it in. Even the smallest beginning is a beginning &lt;3",False,False
