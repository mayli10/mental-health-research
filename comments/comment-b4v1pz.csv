Non-food related hobbies are reading (I LOVE books of all kinds), yoga, podcasts, and music. I try to walk everywhere listening to podcasts and music. In the summer, I keep a garden, mostly flowers and some herbs. I have some house plants as well.   Yoga is problematic sometimes though, as it triggers my BDD and can make me feel bad about myself, even while making my physical body feel good. It‚Äôs absolute madness.   I‚Äôm a journalist by trade, so I also spend a significant amount of time per day reading and listening to the news. News is a double-edged sword‚Äî it‚Äôs always ongoing and being updated but can also make you feel like the world is ending 24/7.   My boyfriend has gotten me into video games, and I‚Äôm getting better at those too.   All this to say, I 100% feel that hobby struggle (and also need to get better at French too). ",False,False
