Btw im feeling less anxious now,but i will still try to fast and see how it goes... I feel like i need it so I can feel like i ""corrected"" my binge,and reading about all of the health benefits of fasting and it being the fastest way for weight loss does not help lol. Also I never really worked out more than once or twice a week in the past,so it could have been because of that too:( Healthy weight loss at my weight is hard because every calculator says that i have to restrict + work out a lot in order to lose 0.5 kg a week(im very skinnyfat,in the summer breaks i can sit at home for almost a week doing literally nothing),but im actually trying to eat healthy meals 3x times a day,with lot of protein &amp; salad which i actually like,i just have a very sweeth tooth:( In those 900 calories around 200 is from chocolate/other snack .-. I eat a lot of fruits too,but they can very rarely replace my chocolate cravings",False,True

Your bingeing is a result of desperation for energy. As hard as it is, eating regular meals and snacks is the only way to get out of this vicious cycle. By fasting after a binge you are just setting yourself up for another binge. You can do this! Start small and slowly work up to more calories and the bingeing may very well stop completely.",False,False
