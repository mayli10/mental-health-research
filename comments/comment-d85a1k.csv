I got some canola oil in a cooking spray bottle and I really spray that stuff on them and it's still not enough. I do also follow a tip my brother gave me for a softer inside by microwaving the sweet potato fries before cooking them. He does that with white potatoes which are a lot different (*since sweet potatoes aren't even actually potatoes*), but the tip works here too. Sweet potatoes are very tough if they're not thoroughly cooked.",False,True

The other two meals in my meal plan have to be made when I want them though. Well, I'm not sure if they even count as meals. I have a smoothie for one meal and I make sweet potato home fries for another. ^(Or at least I try, sweet potatoes do not fry easy.)  I do also have a meal replacement shake. Each meal on it's own does account for about 50% of my nutritional needs, but due to overlap I need all of them to get enough of everything. It's not like any meal provides a substantial amount of *every* nutrient. They're all really high in vitamin A as an example. The smoothie I make is a carrot cup smoothie and I add spinach to the pasta. Carrots, sweet potatoes, and spinach are all high in beta carotene which is converted to vitamin A by the body.  Even when I don't follow my meal plan I do try to eat healthy still though. Like today I have 12 hours of class and a one hour commute each way between my apartment and my college, so I don't exactly have time to cook for myself. I did have a shake in the morning, but otherwise won't be eating anything else from my meal plan. So far for breakfast I had these egg things that are sort of omelettes (*they had peppers and stuff in them*), but shaped different and for lunch I just got a 6"" chicken breast sub with cheese, spinach, green pepper, and cucumbers from Subway. They're not as great choices as what I usually eat, but still not bad.",False,True
