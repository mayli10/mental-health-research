Luckily, and thank god (even through i do wish he would reveal) he says he won’t tell what ate/did to lose the weight for safety reasons. He definitely knew people out there would use it if he were to say how he lost the weight, good for him that way people might be less likely to go to extreme measures to have control.",False,True

(no offense to him! he looks great!) i know i shouldn't praise disordered behavior but damn, i admire his dedication.",False,False
