I just thought I'd mention them because when I read the other comment about abdominal migraines, iirc cyclic vomiting syndrome was considered to be a form of them.  &amp;#x200B;  fwiw, I never experienced symptoms for more than 6, maybe 8 hours max. 1-2 weeks really sounds extreme. but like you, I went to the ER twice, did blood work and abdomen scans, and they found nothing indicating any problem.",False,False

They didn‚Äôt fucking see anything and thought I was being a pussy lol!) and my mom had made some really, really good fettuccini alfredo the night before, which I ate and threw up the night before, of course. The next day, the day we were headed to the hospital, I was actually feeling a lot less painful, so, feeling super optimistic, I had a whole plate of the leftover alfredo because I was understandably starving from not having any food in me. I finished eating like....less than a minute before we stepped out the door, I‚Äôm talking RIGHT before we left I decided to try and eat. IMMEDIATELY before we left.  Well, it took about 40 seconds to get from the door to the passenger side of my mom‚Äôs car, and in that time, that alfredo was rejected by my insides and I threw it all up right outside the car. Like I had just put my hand on the handle and it was like I pressed a vomit button on the door or something, it was completely unexpected, I didn‚Äôt feel it coming at all, no pain came with it, it was just food in, and 48 seconds later ALL of the food right back out lmfao. Like imagine just eating and then leaving your house to walk 50 feet to your car and suddenly vomiting for no reason..like?? It was incredible, I remember even cracking up about it because I thought I could keep something down that day and sure enough, it was literally less than 60 seconds after my last bite and it was all right back up omg.  Meanwhile my mom was about to have a panic attack because this was before I discovered I could keep pickles down, so I was in the process of d y i n g, but....according to the doctors nothing was wrong w me lmaooo",False,False

It sucked. And then I got to do the ""cut fuckin eeeeverything out of your diet and then slowly add stuff back"" thing (while I could barely eat anyway).  Haha I didn't even know what they were officially called til last year (mostly the doctor had just explained what they were doing) so it made it like 10x harder to explain to other people. 12 year old me thought I was getting migraines somewhere specific in my brain that affected my stomach or something???

Eventually they prescribed me elavil and I didn't have any episodes again. Been off it for a couple years and I still haven't, thank god. Apparently a decent chunk of adolescents grow out of them?

And I had them too as a kid and occasionally as I get older, but much less frequent.  Anyway, basically it‚Äôs the worst pain I can possibly describe. I have chronic migraines as well (in my head obv) and even that every day doesn‚Äôt compare to abdominal migraines. However, there‚Äôs no other way to explain the pain other than it‚Äôs like your organs are failing...?? Like you feel like you‚Äôre dying. My freshman year in college my dorm was a 5 minute walk to the little university hospital, and if I could‚Äôve walked during my worst episode I would‚Äôve for sure gone to the ER for this, but alas, I couldn‚Äôt move, so I figured I‚Äôd just lie there and die lol üò≠  My worst episode of ALL time was the summer before I started 4th grade. The entire summer. The pain was so bad that I couldn‚Äôt keep any food or liquid down, not even W A T E R LOL. I lost so much weight that summer and was so dehydrated and weak from throwing every single thing up that I‚Äôd have died if I hadn‚Äôt gone to the hospital to be hooked up to some fluids until this shit just went away on its own. That‚Äôs how my dad nearly passed as well, dehydration and malnutrition, basically unintentionally starving to death. This was the ‚Äò90s and for him they had no idea what to do, but it eventually stopped. When I had the same like 4-month-long episode that he did it was like 2004, and they still had no idea what to do, because you can‚Äôt SEE abdominal migraines on any sorts of scans, so you just hope they go away lol.  Ever since then I‚Äôve only had them short, like minimum 30 minutes long and max 2 hours, and maybe once every couple months in frequency when I was in college, and now none for the longest time. I think it‚Äôs probably been a year or so since I‚Äôve had one.  I am not sure what induces them, probably nothing?? I would say stress if anything, since I had them most frequently in college, and maybe physical stress since the worst episode I ever had as an adult in college was when my ED was the worst (until now anyway) and I was on zero food and working out to death, right after hours on the treadmill my organs felt like they were failing (abdominal migraine but the worst I‚Äôd felt in years so I thought I was dying) and I panicked and called my bf and then passed out from the pain lol. But truly I think they‚Äôre just random. I don‚Äôt think anything causes them, physical or emotional, I think they are just random. And painful.  From what I‚Äôve read, there‚Äôs ONE study that‚Äôs been done, way back in 2008. Two girls came into the ER entirely separately, one was rocking back and forth on the floor groaning and was in too much pain to speak, the other was screaming bloody murder, but both managed to describe the same pain. They did scans, saw nothing of course, but figured it was a stomach issue, and the girls were in so much pain that they had to do something, so they gave them a couple drops if this super strong acid to offset the acid in their stomach, and the girls felt better.  I‚Äôve seen literally nothing else about cure or a treatment, my dad was on some sort of tablet to prevent more from coming, but AS they‚Äôre happening, the only thing I know is acid. Like I said, I couldn‚Äôt even keep water down, BUT I love pickles and since I was throwing everything up anyway I decided to inhale some pickles one day, and I didn‚Äôt throw them up. That is the only thing I ever kept down that summer, pickles and pickle juice. Until I went to the hospital, that is what literally saved my life lol. And I think it worked because pickles are acidic. But idk.  I‚Äôm not sure if this is exactly what you have, but it sounds like it. It‚Äôs super rare, it just was coincidence that two girls came to the same hospital on the same day for the same thing in 2008, but if this is what you have, citrus/acid should make you feel better in an episode. That‚Äôs all I can give you, there‚Äôs literally nothing else lol üòï",False,False
