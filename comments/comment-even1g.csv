It’s frustrating, but i stopped all the exercise, because i still don’t know how to do it in a light way... I don’t know if that makes any sense, but I have an “all or nothing” mentality to everything in my life... Not very healthy, but what can I do, right?! 🤷🏻‍♀️ I hope you’ll fell better knowing that you’re not alone. Stay strong and keep fighting 💪🏻💪🏻",False,False

Every day I have this battle of triggering an immune response from eating, or just continuing to starve because either way they are both damaging to my health. Part of me thinks oh at least if i starve, I don't have painful inflammation, but the extra stress on my body causes inflammation.    I think it is so important that you mentioned your desire to take care of your body first because you should. Most days with a chronic illness are already hard enough. Half of the habits Ive developed while ""managing"" my illness ended up feeding my disorder and making things worse. Prioritize your health and do what makes handling this trashcan fire of life easier.",False,False

It all just became too overwhelming— my psych issues are debilitating enough without having to throw migraines into the mix, and vice versa.  Luckily they’re at least mostly separate issues, although dairy and gluten can be migraine triggers for me but I can’t avoid them as much as I should because ED food 🙃",False,False

I'm actually supposed to be getting daily (tolerable..) exercise, and walking the line of what is therapeutic and what is disordered is really tricky for me. I can't imagine not being allowed to exercise at all.",False,True

I tend to get pretty bad nausea, and on top of that eating will often give my tachycardia and/or low blood pressure, so it's really an easy excuse just sitting there..",False,True

My illness stopped me from exercise and my ed brain suffers with that... It’s a mess, my constant internal battles became even worst. But that’s life, right?!",False,False

My chronic illness means I need even more protein that people who don't have it. Which ED brain hates. But my chronic illness also means I often physically can't feed myself. Which ED brain loves. So i let the disordered eating worsen, and i know i'm fucking myself up and making my chronic illness worse and i hate myself for that, but disordered eating is just so tempting and i don't know how to navigate it all 🙃",False,False
