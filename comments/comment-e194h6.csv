It was *totally* wrong (scale read like 76g). Got an OXO brand one (the 5lb capacity with the pull out display) and it read 99g for the 100g weight, which I figure is as good as it’s gonna get without buying laboratory grade equipment. It also gave the same reading regardless of the weight’s position on the scale, which made me happy. The OXO one is more expensive...$30 I think and $50-ish for a model with higher max capacity but the peace of mind I have in trusting its readouts is worth every penny.",False,False
