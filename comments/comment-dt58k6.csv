And nothing wrong with that.   For me, pretty much every fast is a liquid fast in the way that I allow non-water drinks like Red Bull, coffee, Diet Pepsi, broth, etc. but if I’m fasting for a much longer period time and/or am working out, I’ll allow low calorie protein shakes or smoothies or non-chunky soup (ie, a thick butternut squash soup or something) as well to make it easier on my poor turd body.",False,False
