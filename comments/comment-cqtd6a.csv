I didnt really know about depression or suicide at the time, it's just how I felt, honestly. It was completely unprompted, too, I just kind of blurted it out as we were driving somewhere. She pulled the car over and struck me hard enough my vision went blurry. She told me that I was so lucky for all the things I had in life, and told me never to say anything that ungrateful again. I associated opening up = disgraceful selfishness, so it was about 10 years until I told anyone about my depression and my struggles with, not quite suicidal thoughts, but just... apathy towards my own existence.  I have carefully curated how I appear and act to people, even those I'm really close to. I'm never really my ""real self"" until I'm alone. Outwardly I'm constantly told how bubbly and cheerful I am. My boss commends me on my energetic and pleasing nature. But I'm a very moody, volatile, and at times, uncomfortably dark person. Every time I've tried being my ""real self"" around people, they get very uncomfortable. So I just don't anymore.   I consider my eating disorder under the umbrella of my ""real self."" If I were to tell someone they would ask ""but you seem so happy and confident!"" And through explaining the all of the ""whys,"" slowly the rug would be tugged from beneath me, and they would probably be apalled at the fact I've been lying to them for so long. I probably will never tell anyone about it, and I'll either commit to self-recovery and no one will ever know, or I'll waste away so much and be involuntarily committed that I won't have to explain and I can write if off as something else, or, the most likely, I'll keep my secret and struggle with this silently for a long, long, time.",False,False

I'm eating more, because I have the accountability factor of regular check ups, so that's good. I'm also more anxious about all kinds of things that either I was suppressing before by retreating to food-related escape, or that are a direct result of people knowing (i.e. do I force myself to eat when I'm really not hungry but I really want to make my calorie goal for the day; feeling self-conscious eating around people who know simply because they know and I'm afraid they're watching/judging).  At my last check up, when my weight still hadn't stabilized, the doctor asked my thoughts on upping the calorie goal. And then he kind of paused and asked ""Or is it easier if I give you a number?"" And I laughed because - yes. It is easier. Is my anxiety sometimes in overdrive, yes. But to put that decision/control in someone else's hands after all this time is such a weird relief.",False,False
