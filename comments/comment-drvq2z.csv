I haven't experienced sexual assault, but sadly lots of my close friends have. I've also suffered from depression.  I know that feeling of being completely alone. It's truly shit.  If you have any way of reaching out to closer friends for support I hope you do. If not it would be good to see a professional.  I find that sometimes buying some new sheets, lighting candles and/or incense can help you room feel ""new"". As well as a big clean. Also don't do anything but sleep in there, that helped me. No phone time either.  Most importantly know that you are loved and worthy of love. What happened to you is not your fault.   I also had a SO with an ED and I loved her dearly and although it ended we are still close. You'll find love again.   Mixed bag I know, but hope it helps.",False,False
