However, disordered eating and eating disorders usually aren’t only about type/amount of foods eaten. There’s usually a significant emotional component. So with binging what I’ve heard people describe is feelings of compulsion, feeling sort of need to eat and eat even past being quite full. Hopefully some folks with more insight will chime in. In the meantime, here is a link to some information from the National Eating Disorders Association on [binge eating disorder](https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/learn/by-eating-disorder/bed) . And here’s info from them written for [family/friends](https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/learn/help/caregivers)",False,False

I do cook his meals for him with lots of veggies and protein on week nights and it hurts that he eats it and then fries maybe 4000 calories of freezer food after that + dessert, even when I bake for him.  Since I'm not familiar with bingeing I thought someone here might recognize this.   Thank you :)",False,True

It’s usually good to speak from the “I” (so those classic “I feel (...) / when (...) / because (...), and avoid starting sentences with “you”.   So just calmly expressing concern that it seems like his eating pattern has suddenly changed, and that you’re worried whether there could he a physical cause or whether it could be coming out of stress or other emotional upheaval. If it feels appropriate you could even mention that you’ve had your own challenges with food and that you are trying not to project that but that it also maybe makes you extra concerned because you’ve seen firsthand how it can impact daily life.   An open discussion about food costs can be good too. If it’s a situation where he really does require a ton of calories there are ways to accomplish that on a tighter budget (and foods with better nutrition than what you listed, but that’s probably not something you want to bring up right now since it can put someone on the defensive).   If the conversation gets heated, it’s ok to say you need a break. I try to express that I care about the person and that I want to hear them and that I need a break to regroup so that I can do that effectively.",False,False
