I'm a college prof with my own grad student advisees. We often have to reject students because we just don't have spots open - I only have so much time for advising, for instance, and we only have so much grant money to support our grad students. So, it is probably not about YOU. ",False,False

I am in my second round of the application process. I got a few acceptances last time but no money, so I didn‚Äôt go, and now it might be an across-the-board shutout. I want to die. But also sometimes I do want to buy things and bake cookies and just never leave the house or show my face to the world again. With each rejection I vacillate between stages of deep horror and ambivalence. Not good!!!",False,False

I even tried retaking my exam to get a competitive score and realized 1 month wasn‚Äôt enough. I got severely depressed (but I didn‚Äôt quite realize it at the time) and I gained 30 lbs. It really sucked and basically I didn‚Äôt handle it well at the time.  But I did finally reapply the following year with a much better score. Looking back, one year wasn‚Äôt a major set back but I did a major toll on my body and mental health that I wish I could have done a better job of handling.   Grad school is no joke. Many classmates I have now said they had to reapply as well so really your situation is very common. You‚Äôre not a failure. Of course you should give yourself time to wallow because it still sucks to be rejected, but remember you will need to pick yourself up and not turn this event into a year long turmoil like I did. üòî",False,False
