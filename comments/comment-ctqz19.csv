Are there closets? Maybe between folded jeans or sweaters? If thereâ€™s a fabric liner attached to to box springs of the bed, you could detach a few stables and put it inside the box springs if itâ€™s made out of light material like plastic - I think a glass scale may rip it. You could put it between your mattress and box springs, but Iâ€™d recommend a non-battery powered one if you do that since youâ€™ll be putting pressure on it every time you lie down.",False,False
