(Not sure if that‚Äôs bc I restrict and was just really hungry but we won‚Äôt get into that üòè)  Anyways when I finished my meal I was so full and happy which, as we know with ED‚Äôs, can be sooo rare but I was so thrilled thinking no animals were harmed in order for me to enjoy my meal tonight and that made eating so much more pleasant for me!!! I wanted to brag about that!",False,True

Btw it warms my heart to see another person consider veganism because of the animals, and not just the potential health benefits. :) Good luck",False,False

It‚Äôs kind of hard to tell right now if this is an ED thing, but then again I also truly do think about reducing animal suffering overall and meat / dairy disgusts me at this point anyways üòÇ   I appreciate all you had to say and these changes aren‚Äôt even that difficult or different from what I do currently! Most of these things I already have in my kitchen :)",False,True

I don‚Äôt drink alcohol and I already found a couple good plant-based proteins I enjoy (olly and a pea-based one) so yay.

Assuming you already have a lot of ‚Äúunsafe‚Äù foods, this just creates more. For me, I‚Äôm already scared of starchy, sugary, and high fat foods, so cross out eggs and dairy as well and suddenly it‚Äôs much harder to get sufficient protein. Anyways that said, it‚Äôs possible that eating ethically will make you feel more okay with eating in general which would be ideal! My favourite swaps are using applesauce or mashed banana in place of butter in baked goods, and using orange juice as a rising agent in pancakes rather than milk! Also gelled flax or chia subbed for eggs. I also drink way more ‚Äúmilk‚Äù now that I‚Äôve switched to almond milk cause it‚Äôs so much lower cal, so finally I can have nonblack coffee and creamy oatmeal again :)",False,False

Their chickenless mandarin chicken is my Americanized Chinese savior.  Also at Kroger look at Amy's stuff - the soups and burritos are really good easy foods. Just make sure it's vegan - some of Amy's stuff is vegetarian.  When most recipes call for milk, you probably can just add water (ex: bisquick mix). I use apple sauce to replace eggs in most of my baked goods and boxed mixes as well.  Some alcohol isn't vegan, I use barnivore.com for that, but it's the hardest thing to get facts on so I'm more focused on food products.  Gelatin isn't vegan, so things like marshmallows. TJs has vegan marshmallows though.  Fuck whey protein and everything that it's added to for no reason.",False,False

For proteins I eat pretty generic stuff.  Tofu, beans, quinoa, tempeh, etc.  Lately I‚Äôve been really liking seitan.  Veganism allows for a lot of food volume with less caloric density, in my experience.  I make a lot of soups and giant salads.  PM me if you want some recipes or more suggestions!!",False,False

Trader Joe‚Äôs also has a lot of vegan options. Their vegan korma is one of my favorite dishes. They also have some healthier pre-made meals in the produce area. At the holidays they come out with holiday roasts that are really good too.   Both companies clearly label which products are vegan on the package so that should make things really simple for you.,False,False
