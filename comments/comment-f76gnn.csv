Still, 10 years of almost worry free contraceptive is worth it to me.",False,False

However, insertion and the ~24 hours after was painful, though the one I use (Mirena) only needs to be reinserted every 5 years.",False,False

LOTS of people love their IUD’s and swear by them. They DID stop my period, helped me lose water weight the pill was retaining and were easy (5 years of no pills!), but they had some downsides. I stopped it personally because I could no longer enjoy sex in some of my favorite positions, as it was hurting and I got HORRIBLE acne on it (and am STILL dealing with the scars). Honestly though, if it didn’t create acne I wouldn’t have switched back.    Everyone is different, so if you don’t want periods and aren’t prone to acne (as IUD’s are progesterone producing, which is what causes acne) I’d look into it, as SO MANY of my friends have them and love them :)",False,False
