I eat (things that seem) junky and high calorie when I’m around other people so I can be like “look, I totally eat” or, when I’m in a worse place “look how much junk I can eat and stay skinny!”  But then I also feel like nobody would take me seriously if I told them I have an ED because they see me eat “regular” food.

We had a small lunch party at work yesterday for my team of around 30 people (company was paying) because we were celebrating a bunch of things.   I don’t usually eat lunch at work so it’s rare for people to see me eat. But I was feeling festive so I decided to spend my own money on a low carb/sugar free cake to share so I can actually have a safe food to eat. Of course the damn thing had a nutritional facts label so people were curious and it was 176 cals per slice. Then one guy says something like “ooooh isn’t that so many calories” like bitch y’all eating a bunch of fried food and rice and noodles. Don’t tell me my 1 slice of cake is a lot of calories - I just wanted to join the festivities ffs - I already spent my money on this overpriced cake and had a two hour internal debate the night before on if I should even bring the cake and break my fast early for it. I literally put my food down and almost cried - I had to walk out and compose myself. I swear people always note how many calories the food I eat has. ,False,False

But one thing to remember is that you're all there to spend a good time together and talk, not look at each other's food.   Since food takes so much place in our mind we think it's the same for everyone but it's most likely that your friends don't care about what you're eating. But even if they do and say something about your food intake, tell them it's none of their business because it really isn't. ",False,False
