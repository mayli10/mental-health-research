I constantly have to repeat to myself that there is a difference between and ED and disordered eating. Sometimes I start freaking and thinking omg everyone is disordered WE'RE DOOMED, but just cuz someone eats in a messed up way doesn't mean they have an ED.",False,True

That being said, the line between these two is blurred in physique-based competitions, and as a person who used to/does currently lift(s) for aesthetic purposes, I've experienced both. I think it's safe to say that there is NO way that an ED can be sustainable and reasonably maintained in life, while being balanced with other aspects of life (that is, eventually one thing or another falls out of control). On the other hand, I think a good portion of the BBing and physique-competitors fall into the disordered eating category since they eat 6 times a day, or don't consume food or drink for a specific purpose, etc; most normal people don't do this. However, the BBing and  group is different in that it (binges, dieting) is often planned (around ACTUAL, REAL goals, with the intention and ability to stop upon reaching said goal), and a fairly measurable sense of control, whether perceived or real. Tl;dr, I would say all BBs and physique-competitors have disordered eating habits to some degree, but some (I would estimate it to be maybe, with a completely arbitrary number I pulled out of my ass, 25-40%) are actually ""eating-disordered.""",False,False

I know someone irl who did a body building competition. She posted a photo on Instagram in leggings and said something like ""usually I hate leggings because you can see my cellulite, but these ones are really nice!"" And it's like.... Girl.

It's not a 'normal' way of life, but that's their choice if it makes them happy. Whether or not the individuals suffer from the mental component of a clinical eating disorder varies. If doing it makes them miserable and results in long-term negative impacts on their ability to function, then yeah they need help.",False,False

I saw pictures of one competitor taking food scales with her when she ate out so she could accurately track her macros??? IDK, maybe it's just because I have an eating disorder but it seems like disordered eating behaviours falling under the disguise of ""health and fitness"".",False,False
