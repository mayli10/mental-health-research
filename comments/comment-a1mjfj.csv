In my experience, this is relatively common and is not necessarily of concern - but if youâ€™re worried, always ask a healthcare professional!  Situations that are very serious are when you have large amounts of blood in your vomit or if your vomit is black/brown and looks like coffee grounds. Both are a sign of active (red) or previously active (black/brown) gastrointestinal bleeding. This is a medical emergency, and warranted me a trip to the ER.   Be careful, be kind to yourself ðŸ’•",False,False
