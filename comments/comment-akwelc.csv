My boobs, unfortunately, are too big to fit into them. I'm at a normal weight now, and though my boobs have definitely gotten smaller, they're still way too fxcking big for bralettes.

Id cry about it a lot and fantasize about just cutting my boobs away. However, since maybe this October or so, Iâ€™ve started wearing my nice bras and actually gone out with a sheer bra and top to party and I felt so fucking free! People complimented me and it really helped me see that maybe Iâ€™m not totally hideous. I still struggle with my boobs and my body image A LOT and think about getting my boobs done, but itâ€™s baby steps :)     Speaking of which, I ordered some bras and undies from Rihannaâ€™s line and I canâ€™t wait to try them on later!

Bralettes are so fucking cute and way more comfortable than normal bras.
