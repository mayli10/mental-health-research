I have been freaked out by the same thing.  How can I possibly gain 1.5 pounds after only eating 900 calories in a day?  It can't be actual weight.,False,False

Just blend whatever you want and then heat it up. Awesome for tomato soups.,False,False

So if I had ice cream one day or extra salt or trail mix or something outside of my restricted meal plans, my weight would just jump. I gained 8 lbs in one day even. But I‚Äôd eat ‚Äúnormal‚Äùand a few days later, my weight would just go back to what it was.   When I stopped restricting and actually started eating regularly, my weight stopped jumping as much. Everyday I think omg I‚Äôm gonna weight 5 more lbs tomorrow and it‚Äôs going to be the end of the world. I step on the scale and it‚Äôs maybe 1 or 2 lbs and it just goes away within a couple of days.   Eating disorders have a way of messing up our bodies. My fear of the weight gain was real bc it would actually happen. The cause wasn‚Äôt what I thought it was though. I thought not restricting was the cause of weight gain when it actually was restricting that caused it.",False,False

Closer to 10 is possible if you are female, lift weights, have a high TDEE relative to your size (more food in your body= more weight) have food sensitivities, are taller, etc.",False,False

It'll drop back off in not too much time because it's just water weight.",False,False

That's 10,000 calories. the only reason I point this out is because I've done it before lol but yeah you're just retaining water from the sodium",False,False

I‚Äôm the worst about staying hydrated, for instance, so on the days I drink what I probably should be drinking it definitely shows on the scale for a bit.   Doesn‚Äôt change the fact that I get irritated about it as if it was actual fat when it comes up, though. üòï   Baby steps, work in progress, right?",False,False
