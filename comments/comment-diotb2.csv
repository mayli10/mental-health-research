Your body is definitely so grateful for the nutrition youâ€™re giving it! Itâ€™s terrifying not to weigh yourself and to feel bloated- and Iâ€™m sorry youâ€™re going through this. I donâ€™t believe anyone would notice the difference in how you look after a couple days of eating, but I understand the feeling completely.   Even if youâ€™re not sure if you want to change your behaviors, a therapist and/or dietitian can help you cope with your feelings and set up an eating pattern that works for you! My therapist doesnâ€™t force me to stop exercising, restricting, or purging- but she helps me look for healthier alternatives and to understand why Iâ€™m doing them.   Weâ€™re all here for you, you deserve a healthy relationship with food and your body ðŸ’–",False,False
