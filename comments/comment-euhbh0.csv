I am terrified of aging, wrinkles, etc. and looking older too. I mourn my wasted youth. And while I resent society's expectations and the notion that being/looking young is inherently valuable, it still gnaws at me. Of course, like you've said, there is nothing wrong with being or looking older but I am still terrified of it and pretend it isn't happening to me lol It's complicated but definitely plays a role in my eating disorder.",False,False

I swear the wrinkles on my forehead are less defined now. If nothing else, it's like a massage for my face! I keep it in the fridge for extra soothing coolness. And I totally feel that. I feel as though I'm more worthy of love if I'm young and pretty (even though I'm really not pretty, I feel I'll only get uglier with age), and I'm terrified of the day I know I'm old.",False,False

My constant mantra is ‚Äúdon‚Äôt move your face more than necessary‚Äù bc I‚Äôm so scared of wrinkles. Like I only make facial expressions if something is so funny I can‚Äôt help but laugh or if I talk, that‚Äôs it. I see so many Ana peeps getting excited about their cheekbones sticking out with weightloss and I‚Äôm terrified. I want to keep my soft, firm baby cheeks ala Stephanie Soo!!!!   By the way, do you like jade rolling?? Do you feel like it makes a difference? I‚Äôve heard mixed reviews but I think I want to get one anyway!  I think our EDs deffo play a role in our fears of aging. At least for me, being thinner is a way to feel younger so I‚Äôm scared to not look young anymore. I want to be a child forever and wrinkles are a reminder that I won‚Äôt be :/ but I‚Äôm 26 so I also hate this part of myself bc I see all my friends growing and maturing into beautiful young mature women and I‚Äôm over here still trying to be 13. I had a rough pre-teen phase so I think I‚Äôm trying to relive it/ make up for it, idk.",False,False
