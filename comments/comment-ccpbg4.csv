It's not all he does but it's all I remember. Sometimes he adds hair and shit but either way, they're all really detailed. I'm vaguely wishing I could get someone to do that to me so I could literally look at myself.",False,False

I just got my hair done and I was mentioning how I was still working on getting the last of the baby weight off. ( it's off, I just want to lose another 15 lbs) My hairdresser just looked at me like ""What? You're so thin, you look great""  No, not yet. All I can think of is how square, (yes, I look like a cube) I looked in all the photos from our family reunion. I thought I was looking good, then I saw those godamed photos. I feel mental because I feel like I've been walking around thinking I'm not bad and then it I actually saw how I really look. Honestly, who the hell would think I'm thin!?! I would love to see myself the way others see me because I think I look like a squat troll.

I know it’s common with eating disorders to compare ourselves to other people, but I do it just to try to figure out what I look like. All the time I look at other girls to try to find someone that is the same size as me and I literally can’t. Sometimes I want to ask my friends like “hey if you ever see someone the same size as me can you please point them out” but that’d be weird lol.",False,False

Having been almost overweight to underweight I have no clue how I actually look. I refuse to weigh myself at the moment so I can only judge my weight from the way my clothes fit. I wear size 0 jeans but when I look in the mirror, I see the same thighs from when i was a size 8.

I made my own dress form once by wrapping myself in cling wrap from under my arms to under my butt, then covering that with duct tape.
