I clean the fridge and freezer twice a week, combine packaging of things that I have 2+ of (like cereal or crackers), constantly downsizing and re-stacking leftover containers as soon as a serving is eaten from it, constantly moving things between the fridge and freezer thawing but forgetting to eat it, checking food for expiration dates twice a week, organizing things so every item is visible while staring into the fridge/pantry.   It's endless. I just want to not think about food but it's literally all I think about, which makes me feel like I'm just a gluttonous fat fuck.",False,False
