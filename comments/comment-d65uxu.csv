Ready?   here it comes:  Massage that kale with lemon. Set aside. Mix some raw tahini with cayenne, salt, pepper, more lemon and water until smooth. Soak some chia seeds, add that to the tahini. Now get some olives, tomatoes, cucumber, bell pepper, lettuce, avocado, grated beets and carrots, and put it ALL together.   Ahhh. That's something I miss.",False,False

I don't use dressings anymore since I started putting fruit in my salad and since it's sweeter, it tastes better to me and I don't need any dressing anymore.   Most of the time I use some lettuce (lollo rosso, romano, or whatever), with cucumber, fresh spinach, pak choi, sometimes peppers, carrots, zucchini, just to fill the bowl a little more. Then I use fruits like apples, nashi, grapes, blueberries, oranges... and that's basically it.  But I also don't eat plain salads because I'd be hungry again within 5 minutes after eating. I use salads to reduce my portions of my meal and ""fill the rest up"" with the salad. But  I also just mix all the ingredients above (not the fruit!) with rice or bulgur or coucous or pasta for some ""salads"" and eat this to my chicken or fish.",False,False

The fewer ingredients you put on it the easier it is to measure in public (if that‚Äôs a concern for you) and it also just tastes good. Not super exciting but it‚Äôs reliable and it‚Äôs hard to screw up,False,False

My go to salad is:   * Mixed greens or spinach or rocket * Tomato (if you can eat that) * Cucumber * Some kind of protein, usually chunky tuna * Avocado * ""Topping"" options, like beetroot/baked sweet potato/pumpkin * Seasoning: Lemon juice and/or ACV, drizzle of olive oil, little bit of pink salt/black pepper, sriracha (optional) * If I'm feeling fancy: Hemp seeds or feta or tahini  My salad recipes usually follow the same components: Greens + veg + protein + fat + carb. Add seasoning for flavour. Have fun experimenting!",False,False
