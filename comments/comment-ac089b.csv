I have ptsd from my 'treatment' those assholes are still controlling me in my nightmares and ugh I felt like such a puppet blah im ranting,False,True

I also suffered legit abuse in a treatment center, from one of the staff members. The others were just either assholes or confused- that one was a fucking predator. Those people are in positions of major authority and it seems like they always either don't know what to do with it or take advantage of it. I'm sorry for anyone who's had to deal with it. ""Treatment"" shouldn't be something we have to cope with- it should supply us with ways to cope with the shit that got us there. ",False,False

They tell us to do something and if we don't, instead of figuring out why and helping us work through it, they punish us like a spray bottle at a cat. It's really disgusting and a lot of why many people are worse off after treatment.   Unfortunately EDs aren't all that common so most people aren't exposed to the cruelty we often encounter.   I have a lot of fantasies about becoming a journalist and going undercover to expose how awful treatment centers are and demand the changes we deserve tbh. ",False,False

But I think it’s a catch 22 for therapists to treat patients that aren’t medically endangered from those that are.  That almost triggers patients with a 17 BMI to get down lower, you know?

If you dont improve by gaining weight they probably view it as you cant currently afford to lose any more weight without health complications if you get time away from treatment. This is going to sound harsh fyi: Gain the weight, see your family, then destroy yourself however you see fit once you're 18. You said you're not *that* underweight but the fact is you're still underweight. You also need a little (again, I know I'm being super harsh and this come from a place of kindness I swear) reality check. You are underweight. If you lose any more weight you could die. If you do not gain weight you could die. Your therapist doesnt want you to make no improvements in your weight, go out of town, lose more, and be at greater risk of dealth.  They are not doing this to you to be mean or unfair. They are just trying to keep you alive. If someone with depression attempted suicide two days ago, and this isnt their first attempt in the hospital or out of the hospital, they would not be released from treatment to see family, even under extreme circumstances either. However, if that person makes great strides in their depression over 2 months and are no longer at immediate risk of attempting again, their docs would probably feel safe in releasing them to see family.
