From your other posts it sounds like your parents heard you purging and are concerned and suspicious. I might be totally wrong because I don't know your life, but to me it sounds like they're just worried about you, not that they're necessarily trying to make you feel bad or call you out.  I understand feeling like no one gets it or that no one takes it seriously, and it sucks. But that doesn't mean your parents don't care, or that they're not just trying, albeit clumsily, to figure out what's going on with you. There's nothing wrong with asking for help from your parents, even if they don't really understand what you're going through.  Again, I could be wrong and of course you don't have to listen to me, but my advice to you here is to tell your mom the truth. Don't bend over backwards trying to clean the drain to hide the purging she already knows about. Ask for her help cleaning it, because you probably don't want to leave that in the drain, but the important thing is you ask for help, because there are people who want to help you, and you need it.",False,False
