I think I have to be honest with myself that nothing will ever be good enough for me because even if I'm making progress how I intended, I think about all these other areas and measuring methods to convince me that I'm not good enough.",False,True

I'm a size 2, xs, people call me tiny etc but my BMI can go as high as 21.5. So I have no clue. And my size doesn't really get much smaller if I lose weight, I just get bonier. So is skinny just bony?",False,False

I've always been soft/round, on the edge of overweight. I lost a bunch but was still soft, then started working out a lot. I stayed the same smaller size but my weight got back to my original weight. I'm now restricting hard and the fat is melting and I'm seeing muscle (and actually kinda starting to like what I see), but I'm so far from my low weight. I'm worried I'm gonna be small, muscular, and look like I always wanted when I was almost overweight.... And it's not gonna be enough. If I try to get below my low weight I may lose the muscle and the whole wobbly house of ""liking what I see"" will collapse with no muscle and very little space to keep going down....",False,False
