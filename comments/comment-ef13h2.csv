I've been up for only a few hours and I've already eaten several hundred calories of chocolate. This is the lowest weight I've been in a very long time, but I promised myself I'd let myself eat whatever I wanted for Christmas because fasting or restricting right now would absolutely out me. I fasted and restricted carefully all month, if I eat as much as I want I will still be at a deficit.   Even still, I feel so huge and disgusting. My belly is almost flat (which is a huge deal for diastasis recti), but I still feel like I'm 200 lbs again! What the hell!",False,False
