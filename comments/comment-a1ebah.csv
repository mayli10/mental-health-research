If you're really, truly ready to recover then there's no reason why you can't recover successfully.  It's difficult (understatement), but that's normal.  It's also a slow process so have patience.  I'm excited for you that you're starting with therapy (and even feel nervous for you).  ED life is no life.  Sending you lots of love and really, really wish this is the start of a better life.  Keep us updated how it went.  You know you've got loads of people here for support as well as the professional support you'll be getting  x",False,False

The funny thing is, I probably eat between 800-1,200 calories a day (some days more like 2-300 but those aren’t too often). What I wouldn’t give to eat 1,200 NORMAL calories most days... I am so tired of going to the grocery store and bawling my eyes out over calories. I could eat a normal breakfast, small lunch, healthy dinner for 1200 calories but instead I make myself miserable and eat nothing then binge on skinny pop or cans of soup in the middle of the night.   I haven’t been able to see a therapist but I have heard of people having a lot of success with therapy. I hope you do, too ❤️❤️❤️",False,False
