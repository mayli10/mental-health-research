She has an ED as well, although hers isn't quite the same as mine, but it's something that we managed to bond over since that was pretty much how we met each other initially. It's liberating, in a way, because there really aren't many bounds in conversation points between us to avoid when the both of us just *get it* either way. Whether that's with self deprecating humor or deep talks about the societal stereotyping imbedded upon those with eating disorders and how hard it is to circumvent them.   That said, it's still lonely because no one else really knows. I did tell one other person, someone close to me, but I regret it to this day and wish with every fiber of my being that I hadn't. I suppose that that is the sort of thing that coincides with the *why* of the matter; the ""why"" of why I don't tell others. Others either don't care or they care too much. I want to be understood and not coddled, met with understanding and not force. I am, in maybe an excessive way, afraid that those who I choose to tell will try to force me into recovery instead of me going on my own terms when I'm ready. And I'm also moreso afraid of telling people because I don't like opening up and I just don't want someone to have something like that over my head, I guess.  I think it's a pitiable way to live, nonetheless, and getting out of these chains that the eating disorder binds us in is difficult. But the optimist in me tries to ignore the pessimist that is me and believes (or, rather, hopes) that things will be different one day. There is still tomorrow so long as I can live through today, I suppose.",False,False

The only person I've ever told was my ex boyfriend, and I gave very little detail beyond ""I'm weird about food and sometimes I throw up"". We rarely spoke about it.   Partly it's about shame. I'm slim, but I'm clearly at a healthy BMI, and I'm aware most people don't really understand what eating disorders actually entail aside from anorexia. I don't fit the image of what a girl with an eating disorder is supposed to look like - I look normal despite having massive issues with food. In a way, that's embarrassing to me. I almost want to look as sick as I feel - I hate the idea of people knowing I'm disordered but thinking to themselves 'well she doesn't look like she is'. I know that's fucked up, but it's how I feel.  The other major part of it for me is that if my family in particular knew, they would want to do something about it. I hate the idea of being told what to do, or having my food choices be constantly scrutinised and picked apart. I just want to be left alone. Feeling constantly watched or judged would make me feel much worse, and being forced to gain weight would be incredibly traumatising for me.  It's not exactly conducive to seeking help, but I prefer it this way. It's my problem to deal with, and I will not be forced into treatment or change that I do not want and cannot accept. I'm working to get better on my own, and if I seek professional help it will be privately and without my family/friends knowing.",False,False
