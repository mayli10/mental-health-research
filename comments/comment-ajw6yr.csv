There’s a difference between “promoting anorexia” and minimising harm- this community’s about the latter. The battery post was clearly cautioning against batteries, warning *both* that it can cause burns AND/OR it may fall out.   Please be open minded when seeing posts in this community. Even in this post, without knowing which sub it was posted in, it could very well be seen in other non-disordered health/weight loss subs and you likely wouldn’t have thought twice about it. We don’t know OP’s background or story. The post does not violate any of the sub’s rules. Thanks for understanding.",False,False

If I was on a suicide aubreddit and saw someone promoting best ways to kill themselves Id say the exact same things. I'm all for mental illness support but not self harm support. Seems there's more young girls coming here for tips on how to purge than for mental support. I think it's moderation issue tbh they shouldn't let these posts through under the guise of mental help which it isn't.,False,False

Also this is an ED sub which is all inclusive. Who are you to say this individual doesn’t have BED? Maybe this is their victory post. Either way, They need a friend, man. They want to celebrate. This is a support sub. We support whatever that accomplishment is they got up today and they feel good. And when they don’t, we try to minimize danger both mentally and physically both equally valid. Sometimes letting someone know they aren’t alone and giving them a space to speak/celebrate/cry/just be themself leads to them seeking out recovery of their own free will... You’re entitled to your feelings of course but keep in mind the ED spectrum isn’t one sided and involves a lot more than just the physical manifestations. ",False,False
