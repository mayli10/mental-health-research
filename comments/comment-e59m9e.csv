Iâ€™ve lost 99 lbs in 7 months and everyone keeps telling me great job. I use the compliments to validate my terrible behavior. Iâ€™m on the lower end of normal now and I donâ€™t know how to stop.,False,False

Starving changes brain chemistry and for some people, this calms them down. I know this was me at my lowest about a year ago. I would get this intense rush of calm when my stomach first started to growl or when I first felt hungry.   On the flip side, when I first started feeling cravings (which were the antithesis to hunger), my anxiety would spike. Eating triggered cravings, so the very act of being hungry/starving meant that I would not have to deal with anxiety-producing cravings. All in all, both biologically and emotionally (and financially!), going hungry calmed me down at a point in my life when I felt I was losing control of everything.   But yes, starving is a drug and works on the brain in a similar way.",False,False

I am not currently underweight so I donâ€™t think I will go IP- I canâ€™t do that ever again 2 times is enough.  I can say that my choice to call was driven because I am failing. I hope and pray you call well before you fail like I have-,False,False
