Yes, you want to help her, but try not to make her feel that your love and support is conditional upon her getting better. I hope that makes sense? You can be firm but gentle at the same time, because chances are she might already feel guilty / like a burden and you don't want that. You don't want her to feel like *she's* the problem to be solved, you know?   Malnutrition can really affect cognition, so she may not be capable of thinking rationally. FWIW, I've been told that most outpatient therapists will not undertake the liability of working with someone under a BMI of like 15-16 not only because of the potential medical risks, but also because talk therapy alone is not very effective on an undernourished brain. This is one reason why actual weight restoration and nutritional stability is considered so important to recovery.  Kind of related to this is that she'll need support if/when she does start to get better... not just when it's a crisis situation. You don't want her to have to get to a really bad point before someone swoops in to offer help. It's a really long road ahead, but it seems like you know that.  You sound like an amazing sibling and I wish I'd had someone like you in my life before. I really wish you and your sister both the best.",False,False

But she’s talked about jumping in front of a train if she can’t get thinner... it’s very serious :( statistics show that people who have already attempted suicide are way more likely to succeed the second time because they choose more violent ways to go.   But I will be seeing my therapist tonight so who knows. I already have ptsd so I wouldn’t be completely unreasonable to assume this ",False,True

Thank you so much for updating us.  &amp;#x200B;  I have to admit, I am very concerned for how much this is stressing you, and I caution you to consider the topic of codependency . I know this is kind of an alarming thing to say and maybe even rude but I didn't feel right not saying.",False,False

I had no idea medication could make it feel worse at first. I’m just so scared for her :( I can’t lose her.   Im not even sure if this question makes sense, but was there any way someone you loved could have gently pushed you to get help faster? Without being forceful or sounding judgmental?  I keep reading the statistics and they are not in our favor. i’m trying so hard to be chill and supportive and positive, but inside I feel this insane sense on urgency. Deep down I know she’s not ready to get better, even tho she is practically screaming for help. I made an appointment with my therapist tonight so I can get my shit together before I see her, so hopefully that will help keep me cool",False,True

That being said, psychiatrist appointments can take a while to get and most antidepressants aren’t fully functional for about 6 weeks. It can also be overwhelming to try to do everything at once, and with disordered eating/eds medicine management can be much more difficult because a lot of medications have weight gain as a side effect. For now, therapy seems like it’s the most important. It offers support now and just having someone to talk to can start to lift some of the weight from the first appointment, unlike meds. Offer her support, but don’t push it. Medication also really shouldn’t be taken without therapy because it doesn’t do anything to change the issue or teach new coping skills. Plus, most antidepressants have a peak in suicide risk when first taking them, mainly because the energy boost comes before the mood change and could give individuals who are suicidal but also extremely depressed the energy required for an attempt. That’s another reason it’s a good idea to have a therapist when starting medications, because there’s someone to check in with weekly instead of having to wait for the month or 6 week follow up with a psychiatrist. Remember, as worried as you are about your sister, she had to decide this. It’s not going to get better if she’s not wanting it to, no matter how much you want her to. Offer her unconditional support and don’t try to force her into anything. She needs your care and love and acceptance, not guilt or being made to do something. You’re a great sister to travel to be with her!",False,False
