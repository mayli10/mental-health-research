Ketchup has the calories it has because of the sugar, but you'd have to have four and a half servings of ketchup to make up one exchange, and they're not going to be like ""Yea, your fruit exchange for this meal is 5 tablespoons of ketchup"" because that's... a lot of ketchup.   So it's not like. ""It doesn't count as calories"" so much as ""You'd need a lot of this to make up one exchange if we did count it, so go ahead and put some on your burger because it's really not going to make that much of a difference.""",False,True
