I don't look in the mirror when I take off my clothes or put on my towel. I only look at the parts I shave, so I avoid my worse problem area (stomach). I'm a bath taker, so I actually set up my laptop on top of my toilet and watch Youtube or Netflix while I get ready. I don't do this specifically for ED reasons, but I like to have my mind occupied. It's hard for me to sit with myself. When I was younger, I would put my washcloth over my stomach while I sat in the tub. ",False,False

I have started to HATE showering but I'm an adult with a real job and I have to be not only around people but IN FRONT OF THEM all day long so not showering is out of the question.  Luckily I'm basically blind without contacts so I shower without them in and with the lights off so I couldn't even see my body if I tried. ,False,False
