Then a few months ago it hit me that I was just really, really, really fed up with having an unhealthy relationship with food and my body, like I couldn't spend another decade being controlled by my ED, so I bit the bullet and emailed a therapist that specialised in eating disorders.   I've only been going a month or so but so far it's been weirdly validating? Talking about my disordered eating out loud made me realise how not normal it is. You don't have to be severely underweight for your eating habits to be damaging to your physical and mental health.   My advice is to get in touch with a therapist (ideally an ED specialist). There's no 'bad enough', if anything it's better to seek help earlier than later.",False,False

And, you do run the risk of spiraling into something much more severe.  I think that if you have any sort of desire within you to get help, you should chase after that and get your problems sorted out now before it becomes worse. ",False,False

Spending a lot of time cooking something healthy helps to hide my behaviors and actually get protein and other nutrients.,False,False

Maybe there are deeper issues maybe not. Either way it's an opportunity to possibly better your life and mental health.  Good luckðŸ˜‰",False,False
