Trauma can make the lizard react more so after a decade or 2 of trauma the lizard is fighting harder.,False,False

I could have anything in the house and not binge. Also, I wasn't restricting too hard- never under 800/day. Damnit, lizard brain!",False,True

Last year in college, all I would consume was peanut butter. I would go throw JARS of that shit in a few days, and I would even steal some from my roommates. I think my body was constantly craving something fatty. Thank God I lost the taste for it, bc it made me gain a bunch of weight, especially in my face. Ever since I stopped, I lost a bunch.",False,False

Your body wants energy and your lizard brain will hijack your conscious mind to get what it needs for survival. Kind of like someone having a panic attack isnt having any real conscious thoughts that sent them into panic mode. Their lizard brain just saw a situation that reminded it of trauma and hijacks the body because there is an emergency. Your lizard brain sees severe calorie restriction and hunger as an emergency and will try to hijack your body.,False,False
