You can only drink so much at a time because of stomach space and a lot of it will just run right through you. I think the recommendation is like 250mls (1 cup) of water every hour or something. Or maybe every half hour.  &amp;#x200B;  Honestly the best way is probably to just carry a bottle of water with you everywhere. I have a 750ml bottle which I always carry and that reminds me to drink from it. If I drink 3 full bottles each day that's just over 2L. ,False,False

Idk about you but where I am it's super popular to cover everything in stickers, especially laptops and water bottles.

I find having them ready to grab out of the fridge is so convenient and leaving them around reminds me to just take a few more sips.  &amp;#x200B;  I am very good at hydrating myself and I am a ""naturally-thirsty"" kinda person who loves cold really cold water. so... anyones milage may vary with this technique. But I do feel like it helps a bit especially if I know I may be at risk of dehydration or if I want to up my water intake- I'll just convince myself to take another bottle out of the fridge and before I know it, I had some to drink  &amp;#x200B;  Also I make tea ",False,False

I am just so good at misplacing my water bottle. I need one I can keep clipped to my bag aha. Also I typically drink water when I eat so since i don’t eat regularly, I’m not drinking enough water lol.    Also I use the app tally. I use it to track my habits and I have it set to remind me every couple hours to drink water. ",False,True
