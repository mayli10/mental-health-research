But he has one major failing: his virulent fatphobia. He admits he's fatphobic, and frankly has understandable reasons for being fatphobic, but he doesn't even try to curb his disgust. It was hard to grow up in a house where the adults made a sport of criticizing random people's weights...for crimes as petty as even slight chubbiness.  My dad is also obsessed with food bc he grew up in a dysfunctional home where unless you fought for your share, your siblings would eat it all and leave you with like, a container of ground beef and some crackers. So he obsessively catalogues food. How much was in the box, how much is left, how much he's eating. He speculates and complains out loud about who probably ate what, and when. He always narrates who's eating what at dinner and in what amount. This made me very self-conscious about eating.  Aaand then not long after my ED got bad, he went on a diet (despite being a normal weight). It quickly turned into a borderline or actual ED. He weighed himself five times a day, and could not. stop. talking. about numbers, carbs, and fat-burning exercises. This made my ED even worse.  He's better now, not that he's ever acknowledged he had a problem, but he's still triggering to be around. Food is a wedge between us, not a point of communion. Which is sad.",False,False
