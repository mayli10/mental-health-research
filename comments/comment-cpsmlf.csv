If we go out and eat something I feel so guilty about he distracts me, he talks and tries to make sure I don't focus on what I'm eating.  He always tries his best, he wants to see me eating healthy and with him I don't fear that much about food, but when I am with my family I actually do, so I think he is my safe place.",False,False

If i'm having a really bad day, we'll watch something dumb like family feud, and he'll sit next to me, and hold my hand if i want, and eat too cause it makes me feel less alone, and he'll draw hearts on my hands, and not touch my stomach, and when i'm done, even if i haven't finished, he'll tell me how proud he is that i ate even though i felt like garbage. i requested most of these things, cause i like distractions, and i hate eating when i'm the only one and others are around, but, i'd say, ask for what would make you more comfortable, and try things out if you don't know.",False,False

I usually fast all day until I see him so I can eat ""normally"" around him because I know he worries when I say I'm not hungry or I pick at my food.  When we do spend an entire day together, I kinda suck it up and ignore the feelings of disgust. I can also convince him most times to go for walks or do something physical throughout the day so I can get some exercise in and burn off the calories.  I know this is going to change once we move in together but we can burn that bridge when we get to it.",False,False

My SO and I have totally different diets, because Iâ€™m vegan/vegetarian and heâ€™s not; I have fear foods and he doesnâ€™t; I prefer to eat outside and he prefers to eat inside, etc  So we have a system and I fucking love it so much. Itâ€™s a ritual at this point and we are both really happy with it.   First we go to his restaurant and once his food arrives I read to him while he eats: news articles, books, Op Eds, longform, Reddit posts, whatever.   Then we go pick up my food and go to the park and he reads to me while I eat.   This is my absolute f a v o u r i t e thing. I love getting to eat with him without anybody looking at me and being read to means I can *savour and enjoy* my food *without thinking about it* (so no anxiety) which is borderline impossible with an eating disorder.",False,False

My husband is increasingly judgmental about restriction and it does not help at all. I feel like Iâ€™m an adult he needs to leave me the fuck alone with this. But then I feel bad because I know it is from concern, but it in no way helps for him to comment.",False,False
