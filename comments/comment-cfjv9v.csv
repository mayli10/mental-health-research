I was impressed that he took the time to ask that lady what he should and shouldn’t say...unfortunately he ended up making triggering comments anyway.   I also wish he’d really taken the time to create interview questions for her and practiced saying them kindly. A lot of his questions came out like “...can I ask you this?? I don’t wanna be offensive?!” And it came across as him being very “wtf” about the situation instead of empathetic and caring. Even though I know he went in there with the best intentions and not wanting to hurt her and I’m sure Eugenia could see that  And then there’s the whole story from her friend that makes the situation so much more concerning. Shane definitely knew about that since he talked to the Kati in the beginning and there’s no way she didn’t warn him. I think he went in there knowing he wouldn’t get the full story but just wanted to help her in any way he could and send love her way through his following. Which I think she really needs if she’s back in a bad situation,False,False

I feel like it could be a case of “I’m going to make fun of myself before anyone else, so that if anyone else makes fun of me, it’s already invalid and meaningless.”  But even still, it was surprising that after talking with Katie (?) at the beginning of the video about what comments may or may not be triggering, he didn’t make the connection that even comments about his weight might potentially trigger Eugenia or someone watching the video who has an ED.",False,False

I haven't watched the video because for me--like many other people on here--eating disorders are a particularly sensitive subject. I may drum up the courage to watch it later At first glance though, I think it would have been a lot more appropriate and respectful to just reach out in private. There's no reason to film and she can address everything on her own channel.    The big exception to this is if Eugenia was explicitly okay with it and wanted him to film, but considering Shane is a multimillionaire whose entire thing is producing videos that are, well, pretty sensationalized, I have a bad feeling it was his idea.    As for the other YouTube drama channels, they should have no voice in her or anyone's recovery. Even if they are made with the best of intentions. Even if they are knowledgeable. Even if they convey a supportive message.    Regardless, nothing but support for Eugenia and her courageous attempt to recover.",False,False

I don't follow Shane, didn't watch his video, might never do. But I would like to watch hers anyway at some point, when I'm in a better place mentally.  So, I'm not talking about those videos specifically, I'm talking about the whole YouTube community reaction to her situation.  And, about that, the one thing I would like to add, that I think you were already implying anyway, is that if any of these people really are concerned about her and wish her well, they shouldn't be putting out content about her.  Not even positive content. Not now, or anytime soon anyway. Recovery is a hard, needs a lot of work and can be *very* fragile, sometimes even for people who are months and years into it. Any comment about her appearance that she can read can be potentially detrimental to her recovery. Multiply that by youtube numbers. Not good.   Of course, she probably shouldn't be watching those videos or reading those comments in the first place nut you never know. And free speech obviously exists and they can say and write whatever they want but they should be aware that that makes it about them, their feelings, their impressions etc. They're making it about themselves, not her. Cause, again, if they had her best interest in mind 99% of those people — who don't really know her — should just shut the fuck up, gossip about her in the privacy of their group chats or whatever, and leave her alone.  If you're a fan, were genuinely concerned, are happy she's back etc. a short private message of well wishes without MENTIONING HER CURRENT OR PAST APPEARANCE is enough to let her know she is loved and appreciated.  Not only she doesn't owe anything to anyone, but if you claim to care about Eugenia you owe it to her to be very mindful of what you say about her and her story.",False,False

It’s good to support people where they are at but to pretend like recovery is a discrete “event” is really misguided and I feel that’s how this has been treated.

The video portrays her very favourably: as a really nice girl who is kinda funny and quirky, who was bullied in school and held onto that pain both in a very negative way (unhealthy coping mechanisms) and a less negative way (or at least an admirable way that has positive and negative sides in her absolute avoidance of confrontation, people-pleasing attitude and genuinely never wanting to cause pain or discomfort to others)  &amp;#x200B;  I don't think it was a great video and Shane's attempts to lighten the tone and crack jokes were often inappropriate or outright misguided, and she was clearly not ready to discuss the reality of her ED and still is a degree of denial about it, but I don't think it was a total mess. She's been painted as this heartless anorexic who posts her body checks online and doesn't care about triggering her young audience for years.

And yeah Shane is very naive and made multiple off the wall comments. Kati specifically said it wasn’t a good idea to ask her how she was able to do so much, and he pretty much did anyway. He asked her if the people in the inpatient program were surprised by her energy level and everything. No one is perfect, and he was probably a little nervous and slipped up. But saying it was “iconic” for him to be in her room (basically joking that they are extreme opposites as he thinks of himself as large and she was very thin) and then saying he is the big hero 6 character, that was all ridiculous. I think Shane messed up a few times, but I don’t expect him to be a professional interviewer or anything. He isn’t. He’s a YouTuber and all the people he does these documentaries on are also youtubers so it just seems to me like they get it. Especially since Shane and Eugenia has prior contact even before her getting help, even if it wasn’t much.  As for her being disordered, she has an eating disorder but that doesn’t mean she is completely incapable of consenting to anything. If that were the case, I’d assume her mother would be there because that would mean Eugenia is thought to not be capable of making any medical or legal decisions for herself. And Eugenia’s lawyer was there. We also don’t know if she is still seeing a therapist regularly, which I assume she is, who discussed this with her.

Combine Shane and Eugenia’s huge followings and that’s a huge number of viewers, many of whom might be struggling with an ED or their body image.  Outside of whether or not they were making a video, Shane’s potentially triggering comments on his appearance to someone recovering from an ED were really lacking some basic situational and self-awareness...especially after an in-depth conversation beforehand to ensure he didn’t trigger Eugenia.

I think she would have been overwhelmed by a million comments if she just made a video about some clothes and didn’t address it at all. Her “I’m back” video was short and people still would have asked. I think Shane’s video was helpful because you had Kati in the beginning telling him not to say she looks good.

Shane kind of annoyed me because he really made a lot of the video about himself BUT I do appreciate that he didn't push her and asked if any questions were off limits.

From the outside this whole thing gives me vertigo because I feel like I wouldn't be ready to come back if I were her but I sincerely don't know what's going on inside her head and maybe she's ready to come back and leave this ED behind, maybe her recovery is still fragile. Bottom line is we have no idea and she has no obligation to tell us. It's cool that Shane gave her an opportunity to say what she wanted to say, even if she didn't say everything. But it still makes you wonder whether she did it for herself and others who may be suffering, or to appease the mass of people who think they have a right to know the details about her private life.
