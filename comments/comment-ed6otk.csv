Addiction is defined as compulsive engagement in rewarding stimuli despite adverse consequences. It's very common for it to be used as a coping mechanism. All addictions are much more prevalent in people with other mental disorders.  Food addiction is a bit of a misnomer, I think. It's not all foods, only hyperpalatable ones. Binge eaters do often binge on whatever they can get their hands on, from frozen fish to raw flour, but that's more out of desperation when they don't have anything better around, and those binges feel more like ""WTF, this doesn't work"" rather than rewarding stimuli.   It's so hard to untangle yourself from it because so many factors are intertwined and when you pull on one string, the others start choking you even harder.   As for advice, I don't know, all I've personally managed is to refocus the food addiction and BED behaviours into the opposite direction. I've heard people finding success with Overeaters Anonymous, it's free and you get a support group. Heard good things about the Brain Over Binge book, too. There's some self-help CBT workbooks, too. I've done CBT and the mindfullness/coping skills part is nice.",False,False
