After swimming today I realised I feel worse now than I used to even though Iâ€™ve lost 55lbs. Iâ€™m officially only class I obese now ðŸ˜† But the hatred I have for my stomach is so much greater than before.   I feel like this is going to continue. The smaller I get, the more unhappy I will be that Iâ€™m still not small enough. I acknowledge that I have disordered eating but I only articulated this thought about an hour ago and it freaks me out.   I also used to mostly have BED behaviours and now have a whole mix of things. Canâ€™t access any help because losing weight is a good thing, obvs.",False,False
