Hopefully we'll be able to get a point where we won't need restriction of any kind. :3,False,False

My rate of binging increased and I was trapped in a cycle of restricting, counting, not giving a shit, then restricting again. Weight loss plateaued and I was stuck. My running began to suffer and as a marathoner I had to make a choice. If i wanted to keep running I had to change. I wasnt ready to stop restricting so I made small steps that kept me in control but I was much happier. Because of this i was able to learn all about the foods I was eating, their calories, nutrition info, etc. I did well at first with intuitive eating but gained a few lbs back and freaked. I noticed my times getting slightly slower and that sent me back to restriction. This time around though i feel smarter about it? Like, I literally have zero reason to track calories because I know everything I did wrong last time and have improved upon my methods.  I also see you're older as well (I'm almost 26). I think there's a different level of maturity (?) I noticed amongst older ED peeps. And maturity as in having been in this cycle/lifestyle for so long, we are able to learn from what has and hasnt worked over the many years. If that makes sense?   TLDR: learned from past restricting mistakes to make better restricting decisions in the future ðŸ™ƒ",False,False

Very few safe foods, but I know the cals in all of them, so I know what I ""need to eat"" to stay in my limit without actually counting. I'm trying to add in unsafe food without looking at the cal count tho. Scary as hell but necessary, esp since all the carrots are turning my hands orange. Lol xD",False,False

I used to be meticulous about it and then I found that it just lead to more binging in the long run. Now I know how much everything is and I stick to pretty much the same foods. Its never difficult for me to have a general idea in my head because my diet is limited lol. But yea I deleted MFP a while back. Now instead of being meticulous I'm just methodical.,False,False
