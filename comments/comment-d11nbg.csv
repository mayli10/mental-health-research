If I were in her position, I would want to know the truth: I would want you to say (if it were true) ""you haven't, and I'm sorry it feels that way to you. Do you want to talk about it?""or ""yes, you have. Do you want to talk about it?"" The WORST thing you can do is lie. Other bad things are to tell her she ""looks good"" or ""looks healthier."" I personally am fine with ""cute outfit"" or ""cute hair"" or ""nice nail color"". I had someone tell me once (via email) ""you look like my father did before he died"" and for me, that didn't hurt or make me feel good - I was sort of numb at that point I guess - and I wrote back that I was trying. I'd also avoid telling her she's too thin. Leave ""judgements"" like that to the medical professionals. Does that help?",False,False

You could try to write a note, leave it for her in the middle of the day so she can respond verbally or in writing at a time that feels ok for her. If she says the only thing that would make her feel better is losing weight you could just ask ""do you want to talk about it?"" and go from there. The people I value most are the ones who LISTEN and don't try to solve problems for me or intervene or get me to change stuff. People who do that, I stop being vulnerable with. The good thing about conversations with people who Just.Listen. is that often it helps me take positive steps, even when they don't suggest them. Anyway, keep us updated as to how you and she are doing. EDs are hard for EVERYONE involved.",False,False

Yep, that makes a lot of sense, and I do realize that the best things to help will vary depending on the person.   The issue is that I usually think about asking what I could do to help when she is feeling especially unwell, and when in that state, she is very negative, doesn't see any hope and can't give me an answer (or she says that the only thing that would make her feel better would be to lose weight right now... which makes sense but I can't make it happen and don't want to anyway). I should ask when she is feeling quite alright, but then I don't feel like bringing up the topic because I just want both of us to enjoy the moment. I realize while writing it that it's a pretty silly reason though. I'll definitely try to address the topic sometime in the future :)  Thank you so much, again :)",False,True

I think I may print it and carry it around with me for when I'm at loss with what to do :)    May I ask a specific and maybe sensitive question (and if you don't feel like answering, no problem ofc :) ): my sister tends to tell us when she feels like she has gained weight. Most of the time she hasn't btw, it is just her dysmorphia speaking, but she is desperate anyway. Is telling her that she hasn't gained anything (i.e. the truth) the best move in your opinion? She never seems to believe us and sometimes accuses us of lying to her, which leads to fights... Or is any discussion about her weight, her body, her shape, etc. not a good idea? Or any other suggestion?  Anyway, you sound like such an awesome person, very sweet and empathetic! I hope you are feeling well at the moment, and wish you luck and strength :)  Thanks again and have a wonderful day!",False,True

Not trying to excuse them, just to explain that they have only good intentions.   The thing is, most people are under the impression that AN is just about the weight and the eating. They tend to believe that if you don't eat, you are unwell and if you eat (even compelled and forced), you are automatically doing better. They don't realize that it's a tad more complicated and that just one meal might make you feel guilty and awful for days afterward. So they force you to eat and think that they've helped, and they might have -temporarily- from a physical point of view, but definitely not from a mental point of view.  If you have a few close friends that you trust, maybe try to explain that. If that is how you feel, tell them that you would benefit more overall from eating what you can at the moment, without judgment from their part :)   And also, you're not disgusting, you're beautiful and that salad is not going to make any difference, I swear, so don't beat yourself about it ;) Be safe and have a wonderful day!",False,True

I know it will not make you feel better for being ""forced"" to eat, but please know that they are not doing it to make you feel bad, on the contrary. They are trying to help in a very awkward way, having probably no idea of you are reasoning/functioning when struggling with an ED. They are being insensitive, but have no malicious intent.   And I guess it would be very draining to try to explain that to all of your friends (and you might not be comfortable doing so anyway), but maybe there are a few very close friends who would understand? If you explained it to them, you would have at least a few people you can be fully comfortable around to eat (or just go out and have fun) :) And hopefully, they can also support you when you are with other friends that try to force you to eat :) Do not be scared to reach out to the people you love. We want to help, we just have no idea how and therefore mess up sometimes... Have a wonderful day!",False,True

Include her/invite her in all activities as she wants, and don't push food. Example - my family always asked if I wanted to go for an evening walk on the beach one summer when we were renting a cottage, even though at that point (all of 7 pm...) I was already in bed because my body was so exhausted from not eating. I still remember that they attempted to include me, every. single. night. 2. Find ways to make participating in stuff easier for her. Example - my gradparents' 60th anniversary party was going to go way late, and rather than have me curl up on a bench at 7 pm (See previous), my dad brought me home then went back to the party. 3. Sit with her while she eats if that helps her. My mom played four million games of scrabble with me one summer. Or if it's easier for her to not have you in the kitchen while she's eating, get out of the damn kitchen. 4. Don't tell her she's not trying. She's trying. Sometimes just considering eating something is trying. It can take our minds quite awhile to get used to the idea of eating something. 5. Don't tell her to ""just eat."" Don't tell her she looks ""better"" or ""healthier."" 6. Make jokes. Humor is a great diffuser. 7. Buy presents for no particular reason at all. If she likes to knit, get yarn - if she likes to read, diagnose the type of book (thriller? romance?) and get her a book.",False,False

I have an incredibly supportive mum and one of the things I value most is being able to tell her absolutely anything and know that she won’t judge me. She always listens and offers advice or reassurance where she can. I really value having someone I can go to to talk to without  feeling judged. I used to have so many fights with her though when my anorexia was at its worst. She was hawk eyed about watching every morsel I ate and while it probably kept me alive, it was in direct conflict with my disorder so my anorexia hated it and hence we used to fight all the time. It’s not easy, I think everybody is different and it’s a difficult disorder to know how to handle. Just being there for her to offer support without judgement is the best I can suggest. Good luck :)",False,False
