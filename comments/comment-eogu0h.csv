I’ve gotten pretty good at finding people over the years, I’ve matched a lot of friends with mental health professionals that match their specialty/financial needs. Ironically, I randomly came across mine on social media when someone else I followed post about pain psychologists that my  many now current therapist was mentioned in, so I reached out with questions and pain psychologists and found out that she was also in my area, and it all worked out with that! I’m hoping I can try to convince my insurance company to pay for even a little bit of it though, it’s unfortunately quite expensive for me to continue to not say full truths, so maybe that’ll be an incentive too lol",False,True

But she also knew about me  being medically abused and blacklisted, especially by non mental health doctors about mental health, so I think she sensed that it would help. And she uses mobility devices sometimes so that makes it hard to hide disability status. But she is absolutely the best mental health professional I’ve ever worked with and I’ve had well over two decades of them",False,True

I'm sometimes tempted to share with my patients, but I was taught that it's inappropriate. It's interesting to hear that it's helpful.",False,False

I think she knows that it helps people open up, especially because of the stigma in the medical community that comes with patients having both physical health issues and mental health issues who try to seek treatment for both",False,True

If that's an area of specialty for her, she may have had an ED at some point. Think about this when you open up to her; she can probably listen to all of it and you shouldn't be afraid to share. :)",False,False

I did mention one thing about buying weight loss and appetite suppressant supplements and the weird interaction that went down when I did it, I just changed the dates of when it happened from two hours ago to six months ago lol. But yeah I think if I slowly chip away it’ll get easier. I think it’s also that I’m not used to being able to legitimately trust a mental health professional at all, much less completely like I should be able to with her. She’s amazing and has personal experience with ED, and with her other specialties which are chronic pain and complex illness which I also have, so I’m just still a little scared from the shitty ones who on top of being shitty had no real frame of reference and essentially punished me for being mentally ill. I’ll get to the full truth someday, hopefully",False,True

Wayyyyy easier than saying it out loud imo,False,False

Or, you know, just tell her you might have an ED. I mean, it's not like she's gonna judge...",False,False
