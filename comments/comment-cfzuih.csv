Jeans, t-shirt, converse (never outta style yo). By the time I got an adult job I was overweight and had no clue how to dress my body. I had a mishmash wardrobe that didn't look good on me. Then I got offered a work from home position in my conpany and I went right back to my jeans.   Now I have no clue what I will want to wear once I reach my goal. I need one of those weightloss makeover shows to come teach me what will look good in.  Side note: I have a large box of clothes from the last time I was my gw for reference because my brain gets so fucked when I look in the mirror. Sooooo once I am back at my gw I will donate the clothes....and someone who really loved colored skinny jeans is gonna be PUMPED.",False,False

Pale and skinny go so well with the look, being fat and wearing alternative clothes just makes me feel like I’m wearing a costume lmao",False,False

So everyday I try to be focused and finish my chapters around 4-6pm so I would have a full evening of free time  to tidy up  my room and get my phone done (I need to backup the fotos and then delete everything to use the sd-card on a new phone, because mine is... horrible). And then I would download all the different apps like myfitnesspal and some other stuff, and when my room is clean, I can start doing yoga everyday again... And when it's more of a routine for me again, I won't think about food all day and I'll be more productive for university and when I'm more focused, I'll have more free time for exercising and diary and reading and everything!...

I'd feel happy and in the evening, I'll do some more **yoga** in my super cute room, and then I'll be writing into my **diary** while sitting in my bed with the fairy lights in super cute **pyjamas**, organize my calender and **read** a few chapters before going to bed and waking up the next day, feeling skinny and GREAT!     Now... I'm 24, in my 10th semester, almost finished. I am still not at my goalweight, always **tired** as fuck (no matter if I sleep 4 hours, 8h hours or 12 hours...), I am only studying, having a **headache** almost everyday, no free time at all, because I am too **unfocused** to finish my university-stuff before midnight... I can't concentrate on anything other than food and calories, I am **hungry** all day...I could **binge** all day. My room is a **mess**. I don't feel comfortable in it anymore, but I also have no time to tidy up, because I have to finish my chapters for uni first. I haven't done any yoga for... weeks.. months? Same for my diary... Same for the book that's right next to my bed.      **That's not what I've signed up for!**",False,False
