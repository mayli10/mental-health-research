I am so all or nothing. &amp; omg if I take a bite of my fianc√©‚Äôs food, I am DONE lol.

I feel like this is as good a time as any to come out of the woodwork. Those subs made me feel so welcomed and less like a lunatic because I had so many little quirks and behaviors that I thought only I had/did. But then I‚Äôd read about other people doing the same things as me and it was the best feeling. The memes would make me legit ugly laugh-cry and I would show my fianc√© them and he would laugh too because he SEES the shit irl every day and he knows how it is. He really is the most incredible supporter   I just hope we can all reconvene somewhere, whether it be here or r/halotophoes or wherever. ",False,True
