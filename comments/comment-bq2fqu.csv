I haven't had the energy or willpower to do my morning routine for 2 days now. I feel guilty.   I went to the gym yesterday, finished starving and feeling like I burned all the bread I binged, only to have my mum invite me to a dinner that I can't decline for social etiquette.  God, I'm pretty sure I can't scream in front of them ""I DONT WANT TO EAT LEAVE ME ALONE STOP NEEDING ME TO EAT WITH YOU BC IF SOCIAL NORMS. IM SUFFERING ENOUGH WITH MYSELF.""",False,True

Back when she didn't understand, my mum would suggest I exercise instead of purging by vomiting... great. Now not only do I feel bad about binging, I feel bad about not having the willpower to exercise.",False,False
