This is me struggling between binging and restricting..   A big black fat monster, with a huge mouth and teeth, who towers over me constantly. He only gets fed via me, and forces me to eat huge amounts until he's satisfied (yay BED). Then, once he's satisfied, he goes to sleep. That's when restriction kicks in. But I picture that side of things as being in me, as in, I'm choosing to starve and overexercise because I've convinced myself once I'm skinny the monster will lose interest and leave me alone. When he's awake he's constantly towering over me, telling me to eat, and his arms are constantly around me so I can't escape and I can't go workout or go do something useful, go to school or go meet with friends, because he's holding me back and I'm convinced everyone will be able to see him and that's shameful. So I do what he says. Then he goes back to sleep /hibernate for a few days and I go back to restricting.  ",False,False
