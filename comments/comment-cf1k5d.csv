When normal people call someone malnourished and anorexic looking, they are basically putting them down. Your boyfriend was honestly trying to make you feel better, I think. (Unless, again, we're missing some critical context.)   Stay safe, and I'm sorry you had such a challenging day.",False,False

I think she genuinely is not interested in food.  We were talking about how we both like casual dresses with short sleeves, but they're rare to find and she said to me ""Yeah but you don't really need them because you look good in sleeveless dresses. You have such full shoulders, I look like a boney little twig in them.""  The fact that it was meant as a compliment almost made it worse.",False,False

Really sorry that happened..  I have had this happen too BUT IT HAS A GOOD ENDING!!  TL;DR: Had a friend with anorexia a few years back- saw her again this year and she looked so much healthier!  Okey so i was friends with this girl when i was a child, we lived in the same neighbourhood, she has always been tiny and thin. Shes a few yeara younger than me so when we got to our teenage years we didnt hang out anymore. Fast forward a few years and we started hanging at the same youth group. She looked, excuse my phrasing, so sick.. She looked like a walking skelleton with dead eyes. This made me feel like a fucking pig and she fueled my ED. She told me about stuff that had happened and her struggles. I felt so sorry for her and tried to make her happy when i could. When i stopped going there i didnt see her for more than 3 years then one day we saw each other on a bus and she sat next to me with a big smile. I almost didnt recognize her at all. She looked so much healthier and her face was beaming. She looked alive again! She had gained weight and i was just so so happy seeing her. Then it took a few months until I saw her again. I think she had gained a bit more and she just- looked and sounded so much better.  Altough-im afraid her anorexia have turned into a binging disorder instead. But she just looked so much healthier in every way and seemed so be happy for real, so im really hoping shes alright. This gave me hope - things do get better",False,False
