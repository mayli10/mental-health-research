I do believe thatâ€™s me, especially when you mentioned things other than weight/restricting/the body. Itâ€™s really like, **being good isnâ€™t good enough, I have to *never* be bad**. (Funnily, thatâ€™s what my piano teacher used to drill into me: being able to play a piece well isnâ€™t good enough, you have to get it so right that you never have a bad run.) Maybe thatâ€™s what fucked me up. Haha. But really, thanks for untangling this with me. From one obsessive perfectionist to another, take care. ðŸ’›",False,True

I definitely relate to the fixation on numbers, and my restriction has frequently been driven by things other than weight. For me it can be about feeling powerful, feeling clean, doing something perfectly/right, self-punishment or â€˜you donâ€™t deserveâ€™, and probably five other things I havenâ€™t identified yet. The â€˜moving goalpostsâ€™ isnâ€™t about weight for me either...itâ€™s more about what feels â€˜good enoughâ€™. What is enough to leave me feeling like Iâ€™m ok. Like, when I got straight As, now only straight As was acceptable and barely even made me feel good anymore because thatâ€™s the minimum acceptable. My â€˜enoughâ€™ is â€˜a little better, a little more, than now,â€™ so I never feel like enough. Thatâ€™s just me, and of course your experience might be different, but thought Iâ€™d expand a little that I wasnâ€™t speaking exclusively to weight. &lt;3",False,False

I think I relate, except to the moving goalposts part. I legit donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m restricting. I donâ€™t particularly think Iâ€™m doing it to lose weight, so thereâ€™s not really a â€˜thingâ€™ Iâ€™m working towards. I just *need* to not eat over a certain amount every day. Maybe itâ€™s a numbers game? And if I beat the game each day Iâ€™m good. Sorry if it doesnâ€™t make sense, but I totally agree with your definitions.",False,True

They almost seem like cousins, or two sides of the same painful coin.   Hate wants to destroy me. Itâ€™s clear and in your face - you are not ok.   Conditional love is sneakier. It plays a long game. Reeling me in with the promise that I *could* be loved, *could* be enough, and then setting up its moving goalposts so that I never get there. It tells me I could be ok, and then ensures I live a life where I rarely actually feel ok.",False,False
