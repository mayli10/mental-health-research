I wake up early to make him breakfast every day. Usually it's just eggs and toast but sometimes I love going crazy and making him hashbrowns and peanut butter toast and bacon and an omelet and orange juice... and I just sit there and watch him eat it while I drink coffee. I do not eat breakfast ever as a rule.  &amp;#x200B;  He's actually been wanting to lose a few pounds lately and he probably would pretty quickly if I didn't cook so much rich stuff for him and so I've started to feel guilty about it but I loooooove doing it. It's like all the joy of preparing for the perfect binge without being sick and guilty afterwards because someone else is doing the actual consuming.,False,False
