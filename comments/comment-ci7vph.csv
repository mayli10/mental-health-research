I can’t tell from the packing list if they give us blankets and we have the option to bring an extra or if they only provide the sheets and we hve to bring a blanket. I’m going to hope for the former cuz I don’t think I can fit a blanket in my backpack :-(,False,True

I brought pictures of friends, family, and my boyfriend at the time. They would let us keep the pictures with us at mealtime (if they weren’t triggering of course), which helped.",False,False
