However I used to binge like crazy after smoking, and subsequently purge and the mental turmoil it caused is so great, so I get it. I‚Äôd recommend any of the following. A) if you smoke cigs, have 1 or a couple after you get high, it curbs the appetite B) drink plenty of water AND something like a diet soda, the carbonation will help fill you up. C) gum of course is also helpful, and D) the most effective for me is to just make a promise to myself: ‚Äúokay, if I‚Äôm still hungry AFTER I sober up,  THEN I‚Äôll get myself something to eat‚Äù. For me there‚Äôs a 95% chance the hunger will disappear with the high, and I won‚Äôt even be hungry after that, ergo saving myself an entire binge just by waiting (you‚Äôll also be less likely to binge in a sober mindset, or eat significantly less!)",False,False
