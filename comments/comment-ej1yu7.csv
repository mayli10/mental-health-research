Sounds like rehab! except that was more like ED the bachelor and also a terrible experience/idea haha. I'll look into group therapy. The state i currently reside in (nc/sc area) has limited resources though.,False,True

I'm on the low end of average right now and people already don't take me seriously... Mostly because i'm male but also because i don't currently look like i'm dying.   The whole thing just fucks with the way you view the world so much.   Just know that I, and many other people on this sub, want to support you, and each other in general. Shits rough but it's not actually as 'alone' as we can make it out to be.",False,True

Like many other mental illness, but ED is particularly kind of a bitch. Ever tried group therapy? I wish there could be a community to find people near you with an eating disorder... kind like a tinder of ED? I dunno, sounds dumb maybe.  We should definitely come up with our town, maybe someone who's on this sub is nearby you.",False,False

I sleep all god damn day, and I have no energy for anything (caffeine doesn’t help so that’s why I started taking prescription drugs).    I wish I had friends but not having friends is my fault. I have no friends now due to my insecurities of being overweight. Now I just have no social skills but I blame me not having friends on not being beautiful (in my eyes aka thin) enough.   I’m so lonely I wish I had friends :( and my eating disorder just makes my emotions 100x worse",False,False
