It's very easy to eat because it's soft, warm, kinda bland (but still super comforting), and low calorie. Light soups also can be helpful but they usually made me kinda nauseated when I was extremely hungry.",False,False

I know how you feel and it's so desperate. But you feel like you just can't let yourself.  I wish I could help you feel better.  I'm sorry you're suffering right now.  Please try drinking water.  If your ED won't let you eat you should definitely keep hydrated.  If you can manage food at all, then I recommend some fruit or vegetables - they won't feel 'as bad' I hope.",False,False

Real hunger is so much worse than most people think.",False,False
