Seems like it'd be messy unless you had a dropper. An easy way to do it without getting it all over your hands is to press the open capsules into a piece of bread to hold them steady while you drop it in. I read it's a stimulant laxative though? So maybe don't make it a regular thing. Probably  best to take a fiber capsule/tablet, they sell them at most stores and a lot of them are safe enough for daily use. It should say so somewhere on the packaging if it is.",False,False
