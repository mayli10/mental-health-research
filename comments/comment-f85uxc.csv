But to be honest, we can't really say unless you state your height/weight and general activity level.   As a general rule though, regardless of height and weight etc. I wouldn't go below 1100 calories ***non-purged***. I know that sounds like a lot right now, but this is what you need to be working towards for basic nutrition.",False,False

If you’re severely underweight, anything under your TDEE is unsafe.  Conversely, if someone is very overweight, they could hypothetically not eat anything for days or weeks (or even in some cases, over a year) without being in imminent danger.  Generally, 1200 calories is given as a guideline because going under that makes it more difficult to get a nutritionally complete diet and puts you at an increased risk for malnutrition. I’m not sure if that’s helpful to you at all, but I hope it’s at least a little bit of an answer.",False,False
