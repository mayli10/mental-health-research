Almost everything has policies and procedures. One thing you could do beforehand is to try to find them for this sort of thing - it would give you more of an idea of what the process and possible outcomes are. If you need help finding that stuff, DM me - but there's probably a whoooolllle list of policies and procedures for almost all things School on the website.",False,False

I‚Äôm not trying to convince you to do anything you don‚Äôt want to do, but I do want to share my experience. A year and a half ago, I got really high and went to a concert with my bff from out of state and she asked how I was. She said she was concerned about the weight loss and that I looked sick. I came clean to her, we cried, she told me she loved me, I said I would try to eat. The next day she called my parents and expressed her concern.   I was livid. My parents basically made me go to treatment, and I hated her for a long time. However, treatment truly ended up being the best thing for me. I was terrified I‚Äôd gain weight. I did (to be fair, I wasn‚Äôt very UW, and gained to just about a 19 BMI), but then lost it again while in recovery. I still have relapses (right now lmao) but I try every day, and it doesn‚Äôt take up all of my thoughts 24/7. It‚Äôs much quieter. I hate myself a lot less.    Whatever you decide to do, sending you love and support ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False

I was livid bc I'd been sexually assaulted and that was why I was drinking/acting depressed, and like, I'm not saying any of that's good, but it's also not something I was ever going to talk to a random man about in a tiny office all alone.   I just feel like there really has to be a better way to handle these reporting issues than sending someone a letter or email out of the blue, and then giving them an appointment to dread. I'm sorry you're dealing with this.   (I'd give you more info on what went down in the meeting, but when I went to the office, the dude just wasn't there? And his secretary was like, ""idk he's out sick,"" so I just left and never came back and nobody followed up. Go school.)",False,False

Not useful if you're not ready for recovery though, counseling will only help if your mind is in it.  My advice would be to take it easy and just reassure that everything is fine. Admitting you're a bit stressed would be perceived as being open and honest - if you just say everything is fine then maybe they will suspect you of withholding. Good luck!",False,False

But it was actually my MOM that reported me and my roommate. Me, for self harm and ‚Äòpossible food issues‚Äô and my roommate for ‚Äòabusing Benadryl‚Äô. üôÑ  It was ridiculous.  I had to meet with a counselor and just was like ‚ÄúI have no idea what she‚Äôs talking about! Yeah, I‚Äôm stressed but aren‚Äôt we all. LOL.

I would go in very prepared and with a very stable and positive mindset. Add a bit of surprise at the fact that someone was concerned - after all, sure, you may deal with stress, but you do your best to handle it in healthy ways. The concern is appreciated, but unfounded.   They'll probably ask the basic questions about stress and body image and eating habits and whatnot, but it should be fairly easy to simply answer them directly and lie out your ass but make sure it's convincing and not over the top, lol.",False,False
