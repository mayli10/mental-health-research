I’m not sure if starving also lowers my metabolism but I sure feel like a dumpster whenever I eat nothing or very little",False,False

I've had my thyroid checked too and it's actually on the lower end! so I don't get it.",False,True

I relate too, honestly if I restrict too much I get a myriad of unpleasant symptoms that make it 100% impossible to function, I genuinely don't understand how some people claim to eat so little for months/years on end, it goes to show everyone really is different. it confuses me too because I seem to lose weight even slower when I eat too little, maybe because I have zero energy to exercise or even move",False,True

I feel like i need a huge amount of calories too, like 2500ish to maintain when being moderately active. i'm a lowish healthy weight (so not underweight like you) but really really short, all the online calculators put me at like 1700-1800ish to maintain i think but i'd definitely lose on that. i have no explanation for it other than metabolism and genetics, my dad has a really fast metabolism sooooo idk maybe it's that?",False,False

I maintain an 18.6 BMI (not quite underweight) even if I eat 2500-2800 a day and I'm quite literally sedentary (under 1000 steps a day, most days). Also I'm only 5'3 - my doctor thought I had an overactive thyroid, but no, I just have a lightning fast metabolism. I start dropping weight the second I start walking a little. I'm ALWAYS extremely hungry.  &amp;#x200B;  I usually hit 10000 steps a day while on a cruise, for example. When I do this, I will lose weight even if I eat 4000 calories a day.
