Walking up an incline on the treadmill can be a good booty shaper, and I find it easier to commit to than running (running feels like more work to me so I always poop out early ðŸ˜“). Best of luck on your journey, I promise the whoosh will come!",False,False

If you do high reps at a low weight, you wont build muscle and will kinda elongate/ slim the muscle and tone it while reducing fat. Also, walking or jogging (as you already are) will continue to help. But theres only so much you can do to combat genetics, and the most important thing is learning to love your body. Easier said than done (lmao dont we all know it) but again, only so much can be done.  I wish you the best!!!",False,False
