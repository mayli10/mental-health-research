On top of that, laxatives have been proven to NOT reduce calorie absorption.  Why do we put ourselves through this pain when it doesn't even help cut calories?",False,False

Severe dehydration, which may result in tremors, weakness, blurry vision, fainting, kidney damage, and death.  Laxative dependency where the colon does not function normally and may require larger and larger doses of laxatives to produce bowel movements.  Internal organ damage including a stretched or “lazy” colon, colon infection, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, and liver damage.  A possible increased risk for colon cancer.",False,False

I find that laxitives have made it so much harder for me to poop in the first place, contrary to what they're used for. It causes bloating and really harsh cramps, like when you really have to poop, but then you just literally can't poop despite taking laxitives. They really worked at first and I told myself I would only use them every now and again, maybe like once a week. But once you use them once, you really can't stop, because you see it work the first time, then all the sudden you start taking them more often, taking more, and you feel really sick, headaches, fever, cramps, and just wonder why you can't poop. I don't know if this is a common problem, but it's something that's been problematic for me.",False,False

You’ll depend on laxatives and you’ll need more and more of them for the same effect.   I got to the stage where I was taking entire packets at a time for them to work. And oh my fucking god, the PAIN I was in was excruciating. I’m not joking. My entire abdomen and pelvis would feel like they were being stabbed simultaneously while on fire. There were times I’d end up dehydrated. My electrolytes would be messed up. I’d get chest pain so severe that I would think I was dying.   When I stopped taking them, it took about 6 months to be able to go to the bathroom naturally again, and now it’s been years and I still only go once a week and it’s so difficult. I think it’s because of the laxative abuse.   It’s not worth it. The weight loss isn’t even real weight loss.",False,False
