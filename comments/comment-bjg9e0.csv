There are days where I can eat “normally” and not panic, but there are more days where I do panic and overexercise and fast the next day to make up for it.   And I get it, that little voice telling you you needa gain weight anyway, and then thinking you might lose self control at any given moment and go back to ur starting weight. But being at a healthy weight and eating “normally” and being healthy in general is so so much better than crying over going over ur budget by 100 calories, turning down sweets that you want so badly, and torturing yourself by watching mukbangs while you’re 25 hours into ur fast.   I’m losing my period, which leads to osteoporosis and infertility and I really want a baby but it’s not enough to stop me from continuing to hurt my body, my hair is falling out and that’s my favorite thing, I get chest pains and I don’t wanna die.      Please..don’t let those thoughts win. Stay healthy, overcome this. But if you relapse anyway, it’s okay. You are still worth it. Keep fighting",False,False
