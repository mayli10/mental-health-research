(Don’t want to stop AND can’t stop.) The latter is just hidden until stopping is actually attempted. Similar to a driver only discovering malfunctioning brakes when they actually try to slow down.   One revealing experiment is to try stopping and observe yourself. (And the inability or intense disinclination to try that experiment is itself an indication of maybe not being in the driver’s seat anymore.)   I think ED’s favorite lie is “you can stop when you want to”. At a certain point it can even become comforting to believe I’m choosing this hell, this pain - at least that indicates control and agency. But that doesn’t mean it’s actually true.",False,False

I have another:  I think I could stop if I wanted to, it's not so hard, I should just start to eat like a normal person. But I guess I don't want to, so I won't. Am I really sick?",False,False
