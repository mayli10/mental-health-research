Just remember that they literally have under-developed brains so they say and do things that are like whaaaaaaat??? I'm sorry that happened to you. You're not alone.  &amp;#x200B;  When I was in fifth grade I was already well into puberty and gained a lot of weight and this little kindergartner or something came up to me and said I was fat and ugly and had a greasy pizza face. Outta nowhere just going off on me like... lol  &amp;#x200B;  It was so surreal there were a few years where I thought it was a dream lol.,False,False
