I feel like it helps to keep me accountable. If Iâ€™m giving in to some cravings and have a little too much of something or donâ€™t stay super strict I always gain water weight that I donâ€™t want to see. Helps me to train myself.

I know that I can lose anywhere from 0.5-1kg of water weight in the span of 2-3 days so honestly Iâ€™ve just stopped really weighing myself because for those first 2 weeks I can never tell whether itâ€™s fat or water weight that Iâ€™ve lost. Iâ€™m weighing in every 1-1.5weeks but not counting it as an offical weight until Iâ€™ve been consistently eating under TDEE everyday for a month.,False,False

Weighing daily is the death of me because the normal fluctuations are hard to rationalize when you have an ED. Sometimes I'll maintain for two solid WEEKS despite exercise and restriction every day, only to have dropped seven pounds the next week I weigh myself. If I weighed myself every day for that, it would be fourteen days of 'evidenced' hopelessness instead of two!  When I give myself that space in between, I can give myself the breathing room of knowing that I don't have to deal with a million tiny ups and downs influencing my emotional state, and, in turn, my intake. Monthly is probably even smarter (numbers can feel extremely definitive with disordered thinking, so the fewer you have to deal with, the better), but I like seeing the patterns a little closer up.  Good luck with whatever you decide!",False,False
