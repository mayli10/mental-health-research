Protein is harder to break down and so it keeps you fuller longer. Carbs break down super quickly as does sugar. Knowing how everything breaks down and what it does after it is eaten has helped me so much!! Mentally I imagine what the food is doing. Plus having dealt with bulimia for so long.... my teeth are fucked. Not the front ones. Lucky me. But I have to stop! So like when I eat gummy candy and throw it up it looks exactly like it did in the package and that grossed me out too. Just knowing it’s sitting there made of who the hell knows.,False,False
