Some men are so rude about female body hair and hold this mean double standard in a time where mens' facial hair is considered sexy - it makes me so angry!   I especially can relate to your female identity issues. It's hard with all the hair. Even removed you KNOW it's there and wonder what's wrong. I wish I had a body with soft female curves and soft skin. It just isn't in my genetics, I guess. I rather look like a ruler, dependent on my weight like thinner or fatter one. My facial side profile is ruined by a big nose which doesn't contribute to my female identity in the slightest haha üòè  And yeah I'm familiar with pale skin + dark hair and horrible ingrown hairs despite regular peelings, however they get there fml üòÖ",False,True

I have long, dark, thick hair on almost every surface of my body. It doesn't help that my body shape is so masculine as well. I've had kids ask me why I have a mustache when I'm a girl. I‚Äôve been mistaken as a boy multiple times, partly because I used to hide my body under oversized unisex clothing. I feel like I'm a woman stuck in a man's body even though I was born female.¬†  I definitely comiserate with you. When you have so much body hair, it takes a lot of effort to remove. Shaving takes me over an hour. Waxing and plucking takes me two or more. I've struggled so much with accepting my body hair while accepting myself as a woman. It's worse with my SO constantly criticizing me for it, calling my body disgusting in jest but with a hint of sincerity.  My mother has never had to shave her body hair. She wouldn't let me shave when I was younger, only letting me wax once in a while in high school‚Äînot nearly enough for my hair growth. In middle school, I was so ashamed of it that I began ripping it off with my bare hands and duct tape. I still have have scars from it. I remember the first time I secretly shaved my legs with one of my dad's disposable razors. My friends teased me for having little dark spots all over.¬†  Even when I wax, I eventually get the dark spots after a couple of days. It's really noticeable because I'm very pale. I also get ingrown hairs which are even more difficult to remove even with consistent exfoliating. Honestly, even just talking about this makes me want to die. I guess I'm ""triggered‚Äù lmaooo  Sorry for getting personal, but this post really resonated with me. Feeling like I was less of a woman definitely contributed to my eating disorder, and it was largely due to my excessive body hair.",False,False

I came from a family of chubby brown folk who couldn't understand why I was skipping meals or hated my body hair. They still don't.  Any time I felt like I was trying to improve myself, it would make me a target. Kids would try to rip out my arm hair, point out my peach fuzz, tell me to remove everything and then laugh when I did. I wore jeans and a hoodie everyday in central texas heat from the 3rd grade until my sophomore year. My disordered eating manifested in kindergarten and started to become an issue in 3rd grade as well.   Now I let everything grow besides my underarms. I've done a lot of reflecting on my gender and it has definitely lifted a 100lb weight off my shoulders. Has is improved my ED?
