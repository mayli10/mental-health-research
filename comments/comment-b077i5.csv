I think there have been cases of parents feeding their babies skim milk because of the ""low fat"" craze in the 80s/90s and it leads to malnutrition.   And the ""added sugar"" comes from the lactose that they put back in, which is the part that I mainly misunderstood from your original comment.

I grew up in the country around many dairy farms. I get annoyed when misinformation is spread. Sorry if I came off aggressive. No milk is bad, but full fat milk is definitely better for people aged around mid twenties and under for development, also for the elderly.  Milk solids aren't counted as other ingredients as they are milk, but the milk solids have a higher percentage of lactose compared to standard milk, which increases the overall amount of sugar in the end product.

And modern milk is seperated in a centrifuge. I also want to say I miss read your inital comment and thought you were saying they added sugar in the form of cane sugar or ""added sugar"" because I've seen that claimed in bad articles. I've actually had this discussion in real life, so I do apologize for the misread.   I also said they don't *add* things which isnt totally ture as the USDA requires milk to be fortified with certain vitamins.  Adding powdered milk is not really adding anything. Powdered milk is milk. Processing food is not inherently bad. They break it down and then put it back together. I understand that this might be arguing semantics though.  https://www.thekitchn.com/how-is-skim-milk-made-ingredient-intelligence-215893  Thats a good article that avoids making ""good"" vs ""bad"" or moralizing/emotional reasoning.  A lot of articles that I found try to make it seem like its more fattening or causes weight gain. Calories cause weight gain, not macros. And while there is data to show that a keto like diet can help with things like water weight that carbs cause, a high carb low fat is also a type of diet many people practice.    I found a couple articles with your claim; that because it is powdered milk solids that is bad.  But most of them also had other wild claims. Their claim is something about the oxidized cholesterol that occurs durring the processing of the milk powder, however I need to read more about this. It mentions nitrates as well, which is a buzz word/topic I see a lot. From my research in the past I don't believe all the hype with nitrates, but I agree they should be limited to moderation.  Wow, I am apparently really passionate about milk.  Some people like to drink whole milk, I drink 2% personally. I am supposed to practice a lower fat diet due to gastrointestinal issues, but I like a little more fat in my milk. I use 2% fage yogurt instead of fat free as well. There is no 1 size fits all diet.   I feel like a crazy person ranting about milk. ",False,False
