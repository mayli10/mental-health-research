We were planning to have slow cooked carnitas for dinner and I could smell them all the way to the parking. I was pumped and dug in .... but the flavor wasn’t there at all, our nice slow cooked carnitas were all delicious smell and no flavor. Yet I kept eating, and felt absolutely ROBBED afterwards.",False,False

Had four nuggets after four days of egg white fast, and they were shit. Now I wish I didn't, but it's too late to purge, as it's been hours already.",False,False

So if realistically I ate half, I’ll count for calories of 3/4 and then I can still eat, even if it’s less than what I would have allowed if I was “honest” about the calories. Sending love and support!!",False,False

AND THEN the bowl was truuuuuuly awful. Literally just a broth soup with barely any quinoa at all. Word to the wise, avoid at all costs.   Since I didn’t finish the “bowl” I’m starving but since I now don’t know how many calories I actually consumed I’m too afraid to eat anything! This is truly hell!!!! 🙃🙃🙃",False,False
