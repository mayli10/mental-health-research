Food has a powerful chemical effect on our bodies and brains. And it can get more powerful over time as we teach our brains “this is what we do when we feel bad”. Fortunately, science is learning that our brains are amazingly good at rewiring themselves. Give em new inputs and the adage “neurons that fire together, wire together” comes true over time. Often not even a lot of time.   So try some new inputs! There’s tons of ideas out there for self-soothing and expressing emotions. It might take a few experiments but the odds are good you can find some you like. A lot of my emotions turn out to be like waves...they crash in...and in under an hour they’ve receded if I can let them.   Ones I like:  - wrapping up tight in a blanket (tells the limbic system to take a chill pill iirc) - putting face in cool water (initiates the dive response...can slow the heart) - focusing on intense smells that I like (candles or essential oils) - art or journaling to express how I feel - any distraction I can come up with (everything from planning an Iceland trip to counting backward from 283 by sevens)",False,False

I have video games and I recently got a ‘paint by numbers’ kit.   I know it’s hard when all you can think about is food, but ik that I’ll feel 1000% worse if I binge",False,False
