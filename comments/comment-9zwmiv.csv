I go through 'cycles' where I slowly start upping my consumption, realize I'm drinking way to much, wean myself down, rinse and repeat. Here's what I find works for me to reduce my diet soda intake:  *Only buy the off-brand cola (or something else if you don't want the caffeine), which is flat and doesn't taste as good as the brand-name. *Drink at least one glass of water before I have any soda, and then another glass alongside the soda (bonus: better for your teeth) *Hardcore version: don't buy any soda at all so it's not in the house to tempt you *Drink Crystal Light or similar instead - I make mine with tea to make it 'healthier' too lol.

One year, I was moving out of my college dorm at the end of a *really* bad year. (I went into treatment again that fall.) I'd been depressed for the whole spring semester, barely passed my classes, hadn't been eating, and had been subsisting entirely on coke zero. It goes without saying that I hadn't really been taking my trash out, either.  I filled up *three* huge black trash bags, just with coke zero detritus - cans, bottles, cardboard boxes for twelve-packs. Not the little black bags for your kitchen trash cans - the big ones you use for lawn work. And that's just the coke zero I consumed in my dorm room.
