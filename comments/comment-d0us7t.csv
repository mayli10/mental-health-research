I've always got to find fault with myself. I feel stupid and like I have no idea what I'm doing when I'm on a recovery tangent. I usually eat alone. The people in my life have irregular schedules and eat at irregular times. My relationships are fragmented, so is my self-concept.   When I'm eating at meal times and it's so awkward. Mr Nobody must be so proud of me :/ I keep feeling this ""who gives a shit"" narrative running through the whole thing. Like I've got to give myself reasons to do it. Appetite and reactive eating leave you without a choice. You can't fight it. You've just got to accept it.   It's like fruit/veg that comes in and out of season. Sometimes it's ripe and everything is set up around me so it's rELaPsE tImE wOoO. Other times when my body says ""no"" and it won't let me restrict or lose any weight, it's like when fruit or veg is not in season.",False,False

The only time I feel happy is when I'm succeeding at eating very little and constantly working out while the only time I feel negatively is when the thoughts of binging start creeping in.,False,False

Yes, the world is evil, yes people can be cruel, yes things won‚Äôt always work out and I‚Äôll have bad days, but I‚Äôm too sensitive to deal with these things alone.

I was reading Crazy Like Us (about how America is unintentionally exporting mental health issues overseas) and there was a bit about how social expectations shape mental health.

Like do you have a thing you're trying to distract yourself from or something bothering you? I notice there's the kind of person doing it for a goal, they like how they look or how it makes them feel in control or whatever so they're tracking and counting and there's a sort of joy in it.  Then there's the kind of person that doesn't even want to eat. They don't even think they're fat or whatever, they just don't have an appetite. There's no pleasure in restriction, but it's worse not restricting if that makes any sense.  Does that describe you more?",False,False
