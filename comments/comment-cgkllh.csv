When I started gaining weight i literally was never satisfied, I had days where i ate 5k cals and was still hungry at the end of the day but this phase didn't last forever, for me it was around 6 or 7 months. i gained a fair bit above my pre ed weight but now, a year later my weight has gone down to my pre ED weight again even though I still binge a shit ton and just overall eat a lot lol so yeah, try to give your body some time to adjust and don't give up on recovery, EDs suck and i'm sure your life will be a million times more fulfilled without that mf",False,False

I remember in my final admission to hospital for ED, being told that there is no cure, you just learn to live with it once it gets to a certain stage. I thought, no, fuck THAT! I am not going to live my life like that. I don’t care what they say but I’m going to beat this. And I did. But it took years and you have to work very hard for a while. So, once you are eating 3 normal meals, you literally keep doing that, never ever deviate from it and eventually your brain structure and your hormones and levels of neurotransmitters re-balance. It takes two years for the brain of a drug addict to come back towards normality, same for alcoholics, same for all addictions. This is an addiction wrapped up in OCD. So for me the trick was just keep to the plan, no matter what and eventually you get there. Can I ask how long you ate at healthy levels for, after recovery of weight? I remember that feeling of being ravenous, it eventually goes away, I promise. Give yourself 3 really normal meals, like not Anorexic bullshit normal, actually normal. Add as much fruit and veg as you want and just keep doing that for a year or two solidly, accept the hunger in the mean time because your brains signals are out of wack. Use your executive function, your decision making capacities and think: I’m hungry, but I know I’ve had enough food, there will be another meal in a few hours and another after that etc, The food won’t stop coming. I feel like it’s our bodies way to combat starvation, Once I really, fully recovered and I was very, very sick, I vowed I would never feel hunger like that again and I never have. Incidentally, it takes a minimum of a year for weight to redistribute properly if you’ve been severely underweight. Goes to the major organs first (which we forget also get starved) and so it all settles around the stomach first before settling more evenly. That can be tough to deal with but it passes too. It all does. If you are really, really serious about getting well, you can message me here. I’m sorry to be harsh but I can’t deal with anyone still fucking around with that decision, I’m not going to risk my recovery. Good luck, you CAN  do it.",False,False

Nothing fully satisfies me. I feel like my choices are either letting my hunger loose and become infinitely obese as a result, or restricting forever and constantly being the weirdo who embarasses himself by pretending he doesn't like that food and is into healthy/diet stuff. "" that hit me hard its like i think that all the time. I just want to eat what i want and not care if i get fat cuz its just FAT ITS not going to kill me cuz i know once your body gets to a weight that it can maintain it will maintain it, or i'm like ill just not enjoy food and restrict forever to have my dream. BUt at the same time i know i can have my dream and still look like how i want to look its just my ed that's stopping me. because i cant lose my belly fat because my body is holding on to it and its a real pain. like i enjoy exercise a lot so i really don't care for it you know its just really annoying that as much exercise i just i don't get any result because my body is holding on to fat",False,False
