On days when I know I'll be out in the cold, I'll wear knee-high or thigh-high socks under my jeans, a tank top under my sweater, and then a hoodie with a jacket on top of that. Notice which parts feel the coldest and add layers there. You might need two pairs of socks, tall boots, leggings under your pants, thicker gloves, etc.   And if it's not cold enough to warrant bundling up so much, thick tights under jeans will still look just like jeans, and you can always wear a short sleeve shirt with a thick hoodie or just go for warm, less-breathable fabrics in general! Combat boots with thick tights and shorts can look summery or like an early fall outfit but still be semi warm?",False,False

There are a few options on Amazon for heated clothing that look light sweaters or light jackets. Those would help you blend in more. Good luck!,False,False

It got down to -30. It is not an easy adjustment.   Obviously layers, but you know that. I would usually wear 2 shirts, a hoodie, and a coat. Leggings under thick jeans. Fuzzy socks under knee high socks. Double layered beanies. I sometimes put my clothes in the dryer a bit before leaving the house. Always carry around hot tea or coffee. I ate oatmeal, soup, and more soup. I have 3 heated blankets. A large one for the bed, one for the couch, and one for work. Also, they make heated gloves that you can plug into a USB. I don't have them yet, but I bet they are awesome. I've seen a heated coat on amazon too, but the reviews weren't very good and it was pricy.",False,False
