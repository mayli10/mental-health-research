Well yeah you can use portion control or dietary restrictions like low carb without cico. Actually low carb is a really good way to feel satisfied and not have to track calories. I lost quite a lot on it but being mostly vegetarian it didn‚Äôt fit in with my lifestyle. Lucky I wish I was tall enough to not have to be as strict with calories. My main point is that a lot of people where I‚Äôm from (Florida) lack the willpower and dedication to even do basic dieting strategies. Very restrictive diets can be hard so I usually don‚Äôt recommend them. I‚Äôve seen people gain weight while vegan or keto. Usually they eat too much or don‚Äôt follow it 100%.,False,False

I don't count calories and haven't needed to to get from being morbidly obese to merely overweight. All it took was having constructively all of my non-protein calorie as fat. I don't want to get skinny - that would be stupid if I were to, say, run into hard times.  It's not that I'm too lazy to count calorie or macros. It's that counting macros messed with me a bit (weighing is hard, and although I could do it, it was starting to feel like a DEB that had replaced the DEB of bingeing on carbs), and so I ended up kind of autopiloting it. I'm doing everything no-numbers style still. The only downside is that I need to salt everything not to get disastrously lightheaded.",False,False

I'm not joking.  I had an addiction to carbohydrate and I would suspect that a grand majority of people with a weight problem have the same problem. When I broke that, my relationship with food turned from addiction (I would literally bike ride to the shops and spend my entire allowance on croissants, then just binge eat them over the course of a day or two) to a more mutually loving one. I counted macros (not directly calories) the first few days, and then I just went by feel. I'm not thin by any means, and don't want to be (still want to be able to survive a famine, you see), but I am a lot less fat than a year ago and I feel okay. I should probably get some water and then put lunch down the hatch, but food isn't really what I'd class as an urgent requirement. I can get it now or I can get it later.  The slightly increased exercise came naturally with the improved physiological and mental relationship to food.  Counting calories to within like a ninth of a gram of fat always seemed like a neurosis to me, nevermind that estimates for a pound of adipose tissue's calorie-as-fat content range from as low as (to the nearest 50) 2850 calories (using the lowest caloric fatty acids and the lowest density) to as high as 3600 calories. I guess I'm lucky in that, even though it's broken if I'm on carbs, my appetite homeostat can regulate my intake and expenditure without me needing to count anything if all I eat is protein and fat. Some people have completely broken appe-stats with any macro balance and those are the people who need to engage in the DEB of counting.",False,False
