I know we all have this instinct to assume that if something goes wrong/someone doesn't like something about us/etc. then it must be our fault and a reflection of us. That's not true, that's your messed up ED brain talking. You're not responsible for the way you are perceived and you can't control it.  Take for example everyone you've ever looked at and thought ""I don't wanna talk to them"". Maybe it was a giant scary dude with a million tattoos or a homeless person yelling at no one on the sidewalk or maybe it was a nice looking woman with slightly too perfect hair. Whatever the reason, you would never say that your initial perception of them is actually a reflection of their character--you recognize that that was you acting on a bias but it's not really a big deal because that person was a total stranger. The same thing happens to you every day and you're unaware of it, stranger s passing weird judgements that you did nothing to incite. I know that's a little anxiety inducing, but it's the facts.  So his parents (or he himself) passed a weird, unfounded judgement about you and acted on it. It's got absolutely nothing to do with you and it's not your fault. This doesn't reflect on you at all.
