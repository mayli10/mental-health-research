That‚Äôs really it in terms of cardio, unless I eat more than intended and I‚Äôll either walk even more or run.   For muscles, I do high reps / low-body weight. Goofy as it is I use Callanetics and it actually works really well! I also do ballet beautiful and John Benton fitness guide occasionally.   Idc what anyone says, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 and anytime I‚Äôve done any weight lifting routine consistently I look like a stocky phys-Ed teacher. I don‚Äôt have a curvy physique and I‚Äôm not willing to ‚Äúbuild‚Äù my shoulders to make it look like I do. So I work with what I‚Äôve got and aspire to a ballet shortie curveless physique.",False,False

And my class / work schedule is only open wednesday, thursday, and friday so that's when I work out. I usually get on a treadmill and run on a slight incline and run for a full 30 minutes. And afterwards I do some weights on whatever machines are open, or I'll go upstairs and do planks and ab exercises for 20 more minutes. I've learned running is way easier after eating well the days I run, so I try my best to eat more than 1000 on tuesdays-thursdays. I'm up to 2.7 miles in \~32 minutes, which is really exciting!! Makes me finally proud of myself for something :)",False,False

I do lower body and abs, occasionally upper body bc I worry about getting bigger shoulders (lol).

I did dance, colorguard, and winterguard and was a reasonably athletic teenager, even if I thought I wasn't because in my mind an 'athletic person' was running sub 6 minute miles or playing on a sports team. I used to be really flexible but then I had a problem with my hamstring that I never got checked out and I also started going to college, so I stopped stretching and I can barely touch my toes now. I wish I could dance at home and self-learn choreography but the floors are noisy and it would bother my neighbors.",False,False

Squats focus on the legs (my PT recommended always flexing the glutes during every exercise to combat this) but body squats (going aaaaaaall the way down) are all ass. Glute bridges are good too as well as hip abductors and side planks with leg lifts. I can text her and ask for all the exercises she had me doing but she always allotted 15 minutes to just the butt. I guess that was her specialty.  I gain in my butt first (muscle and fat alike *sigh*) so I saw results there pretty quickly. I like squats because they tone my thighs (I try to avoid weights unless I‚Äôm deadlifting). If you wanna focus on glutes, though, def do deep squats imo. Hardest thing on my glutes.",False,False

And yeah I kind of have a love/hate relationship with squats so now I just do a lot of glute bridges. Also read somewhere that squats mostly target legs other than your butt. Have you seen much diffrence since doing this? I want to have a big booty but not legs, but I know that‚Äôs impossible to achive.",False,True

You only really need them for a few weeks to learn the right techniques imo.  Forgot to say: do squats and planks every single day. The *rmy told me to start doing that (200 squats a day and 2 minute planks) and it reeeeeally boosts your endurance.,False,False

It‚Äôs some variation of 20 minutes boxing, 20 minutes kickboxing, and 20 minutes of abs. I do this three times a week.  One day of week, I go to a boot camp with the *rmy. Usually means lots of running, body squats, wall sits, burpees, deadlifts, and pushups as well as modified sports.  I used to have a personal trainer on the fifth day. We‚Äôd usually do squats, rows, Russian twists, suicides, chest presses, deadlifts, and crunches. Now that I don‚Äôt see her anymore, I do my own an routine + boxing + ballet beautiful workouts.  Once every two weeks, I add a day of hot vinyasa yoga. I would do it more, but the instructor herself only has the class twice a month. :( I try to replicate her classes before the jiu jitsu workouts because they make my kicks higher.  So far, I went from deadlifting a pitiful 65 lbs to 130 lbs, being able to do 0 push-ups to 10, and legs and stomach smaller than when I was 20 lbs lighter so I really like this routine. I‚Äôve also found loosening up on my diet helps? Like I eat a banana and 283 g of watermelon before a workout and drink a protein shake after and it‚Äôs the best combination.",False,False
