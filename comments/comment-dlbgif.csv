I had my appointment with my psychiatrist today and she heard me. I emphasised that I've actually put on 20kg, which was a third of my previous total body weight before starting seroquel. So we're trying an older style anti-psychotic called Largactil. Hopefully, it will go well, and I can stay on a low enough dose that I don't end up with movement disorders. But, interestingly, I checked out the weight gain profile for that drug and it's still medium to high, so I don't know how this going to go.  I'm praying for a positive outcome.",False,True

But the vast majority of people I’ve talked to who have been on the common atypical antipsychotics have had struggles with weight. (And that’s not just folks dealing with disordered eating.) It’s a super common side effect, and one that I’m pretty sure is well documented because every doc I’ve mentioned my experience to has been like “Oh, yeah, that tends to happen.” So, your psych seems like the unreasonable one to me. Your concerns are valid! Especially if it’s going to lead to poor med compliance or trying to taper yourself off - cuz what’s the point in taking a med that causes mental distress equal to the possible benefits, right? Side note is that the one antipsychotic I personally did experience as weight neutral was Latuda (my current insurance won’t cover it but I think some plans will). And good on you for voicing your concerns. I’m sorry the doc isn’t listening. That’s not cool. I know self-advocacy can get exhausting but I hope you’ll keep asking for what you need &lt;3",False,False

(I feel ya there...was on zyprexa for awhile and yikes.) It seems like a really reasonable and understandable concern to me, and sometimes there are other more weight-neutral meds that can be tried. If the doc doesn’t listen or dismisses your concerns I’d consider trying to find another provider. I had a psychiatrist that wasn’t listening to what I was trying to tell them, and it ended up putting my life in serious jeopardy. Now if I don’t feel listened to I find a new provider if at all possible. Best of luck! (I want to offer encouragement on trying to find mentally and physically healthy ways to lose the med weight but...that would be a very pot-kettle situation. I know it *can* be done, I just haven’t figured out how.)",False,False
