I also love to do really fun makeup that I’d never wear anywhere but have fun doing, and take a looong luxurious bath with candles, sugar scrubs, moisturizing... the whole nine yards.

Even if I have to do it in the dark. I have put a lot of effort in my hair so I go through this process of shampoo, condition, leave in, whole body clean, rinse. Then I get out, take my time drying off, then I comb out my hair and comb it dry. Takes forever but I always feel better!",False,False

I like doing facials and mud masques and grape seed peel masques. I love being able to feel a little fresher after feeling horrible for whatever reason(s). Drinking a fuck ton of water with maybe some lemon slices or green tea to maximize all the antioxidants. Cleaning my environment is good too, I really love making things clean and being able to walk into a room and be like ah, no stress. I like the smell of fresh laundry and clean counters.
