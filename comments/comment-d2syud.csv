Joy came from results, falling in love and getting away with it - then it turned into this white hot hatred for what I saw. I hated my body. I used it to punish myself for being so gluttonous on the weekends. I just ended up maintaining, playing ping pong with the same 15lbs.  - I was so sick of what I saw I decided to “go hard” for a month and a half, just so I could hate myself less. It worked. I saw my clothes getting baggy and how my hands wrapped closer around my legs and wrists but I couldn’t see it. I knew I was skinnier but I couldn’t comprehend that I was actually taking up less space - I don’t hate what I see anymore in that white hot way. it’s just this kind of obligatory thing. I feel better about myself when I dont eat but now it doesn’t quite consume me. I want so desperately to be skinny, to have that discipline, for people to beg me for secrets on how I’m so effortlessly perfect, I’ll do whatever that little voice says.",False,False
