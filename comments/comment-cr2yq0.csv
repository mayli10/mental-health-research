I gained a lot when I recovered but then I lost it. Most of weight is cico so if you eat less you lose weight. Metabolism differences is less than 10% so about 50-150 cals. Starvation mode is mostly a scare tactic. As you eat less you are usually less active. Not just working out less but less fidgeting and moving, which causes you to burn less. And as you lose weight your tdee decreases. Try not to lose muscle bc when you do you’ll burn less. But if you eat less than 1200 you’ll lose weight period.",False,False

I could not find anything from a reputable scientific source that demonstrated any metabolic slowdown long-term, however I *did* find a whole bunch of documentation of *hyper*metabolism in the early stages of eating disorder treatment.  The more research I do on the topic, the more resolute I become in the conviction that it's a scare tactic, just like the ""purging only rids half your calories"" nonsense.",False,False

This is just because your body requires less energy to function though. If you burn 1600 calories at a healthy weight and then lose weight and only need 1400 calories to maintain your new weight then of course eating 1600 would make you gain. Perhaps there is some physiological validity to ""starvation mode"" but what people think starvation mode is doesn't exist. There are people who think that eating less makes you gain weight. Some people genuinely believe that if you're not totally stuffing yourself at every meal your body will think it's starving and start holding onto fat like you're in the middle of a famine and need it. That's simply not true in the slightest. As long as you eat healthy foods and in healthy amounts (*at least more than the minimum your body needs for basic function*) your body will continue to operate as expected and reducing your calorie intake will cause you to lose weight.",False,False

The longer you're starving, the slower your metabolism will get, but it'll never stop until you die (sorry if that's too abrupt).  When people enter recovery, especially when they need to be weight restored, they need to eat well over their BMR. This is because your metabolism will kick start again into overdrive so that it can utilise that energy for repairing the body. When the repairs are done, it'll ease up a bit, but to back to its normal setting.  If you gain a shit tonne of weight, it's because your body needs it, and since it's just come out of famine, it may hold onto more in case it's plunged back into that situation. But your body is a smart machine. Everyone has a set point in regards to their weight, abs if you go above or before this, your body will speed or slow the metabolism as required. But the metabolism can only go do fast/slow, which is why not everyone stays at a healthy weight.  Regardless of whether your therapist was trying to scare you or not, and I should hope that isn't the case, recovery is worth it. Not because your metabolism will return to normal, but there is unseen damage being done to all your organs, which will be irreversible (to a point, some damage can be undone) if you keep up your restriction.",False,False
