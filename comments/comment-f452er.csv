I think if we go too low the food kind of gets stuck in the body ?",False,False

I feel like when I eat a lot after restricting super hard I instantly put on so much weight rip... but when I eat in a surplus after being at maintenance for a while my body seems to just... deal with it? and not gain a ton,False,False
