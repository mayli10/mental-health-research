I used to want kids. I don’t anymore because of this disorder. I don’t want my potential children to have to have a mother with this disease. I don’t feel I would be a fit mother and that breaks my heart.,False,False

I had tried to recover on my own before and kept quitting but this time feels like a real commitment. I keep a list of reasons to recover in my phone to remind myself of the ways that life will get better if keep trying. Recovery isn’t linear. There might be slip ups and bad days but keeping the reasons in focus helps me stay on track.,False,False

A huge issue for me is that over the past year my personal definition of ""fat"" has changed (for me only - I do not apply this to any one else.) I used to be totally fine at a BMI of 19-21 or so, and now I want to stay at 18.5 or under. I did stop weighing myself in late October which is a huge a step, but now I freak out if I can't see my upper ribcage through the skin on my chest. I couldn't afford counseling if I wanted to at the moment due to unemployment - I luckily still have health insurance but my deductible is insurmountably high.",False,False

I know sometimes a healthy weight seems fat. But you wont be close to death. You wont be obsessing. You will be able to engage in life not distracted by food.   There's an elderly lady at my oa meetings who is visibly underweight. She talked about gaining 3 lbs while in the hospital after a car accident and how she felt confident she'd lose it by going back on her dietitian approved food plan. When you are 79 and underweight do you really still want to be obsessing about 3lbs? (Shes one of those fake recovered ppl). I mean, I can see the bones on her face and her knees are knobby. It's just not attractive on someone that old (not just the weight, the whole attitude). ",False,False

I'm almost 30 and still just as fucked up. I posted something similar on proED and someone said that Jane Fonda finally recovered in old age. Do I have to wait that long?!  I hope not, but I know I have many, many years like this ahead of me, especially if I have children (ie, the weight gain from carrying a child will probably trigger me again, even if I recover now). I  think society encourages EDs because of how much thin people are rewarded \*just\* for being thin, and tbh that is what keeps me doing it. :(",False,False

Yet I’m pretty sure I spent much more time thinking about calories and food than „normal“ people and I think it  has been such a massive part of my life that I’ll never truly get rid of it. I’m an anxious person and I worry about too many things and I stopped thinking I’ll wake up one day and all of that will be gone.  I do however think I - and most of us - have the ability to moderate their ED to a certain extent. Therapy might never work 100% but I truly believe it’s possible to be somewhat healthy and functioning while still dealing with moderately disordered thoughts and behaviour.  It was such a relief for me to come to that conclusion because I stopped defining recovery as „100% back to normal“ but „as healthy and proactive as I can be“ which eased my anxiety a lot!",False,False
