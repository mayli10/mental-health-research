After I broke up with my rapist I struggled a LOT with healthy sex and went months sleeping around with anybody who’d pay me attention. I was then raped three more times by three different men within about a six month period and stopped having sex altogether until I met my current bf. We have sex maybe twice a month now, and although he’s incredibly understanding I still struggle a lot with feeling like I’m hurting our relationship somehow.  I find having a body very difficult. It’s hard for me to trust it, or feel like it deserves good things.",False,False

Back when I was OW, self-hatred held me back from pursuing sex with anyone because I felt undeserving and didn't want anyone to see my body.  At my LW, I literally ran away when my date kissed me after dinner (guess who lovingly prepared a salad? this domestic goddess!) at his place and haven't spoken with him since.  *ha ha*   *ha*  *haaaaaah!*",False,False

Confide in your SO about your body image issues it could help him help you get those thoughts away atleast temporarily. Maybe focus on foreplay a bit before doing muchh else it might boost ur confidence?,False,False
