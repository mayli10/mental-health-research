IE is pretty wild. If you let yourself have unlimited cookies every day, after a few days you're just like...yeah I'm good. And then you wake up and you're a person who can keep cookies in the house without bingeing.   If you decide to start IE, my best tip for when you start eating ""fear foods"" is to keep A LOT of them in the house. IMO it makes you less likely to binge because you know there's more left so no one can ""take it away from you"". So I'd recommend buying multiple pints of ice cream and multiple bags of chips at first. I also sometimes find it helpful to keep a food diary with no amounts/macros/ingredients -- just a list and then some thoughts about how it made me feel physically and mentally and how the experience was. It helped me practice being more mindful during an eating experience and realize ""hey, this food doesn't really make me feel great"" or ""wow, i have a lot of emotions attached to this particular food"" or ""yup, i was definitely wanting to use restriction/bingeing as a coping mechanism because of XYZ""",False,False
