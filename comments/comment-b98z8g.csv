The reason why I participate in athletics is to work on myself, but I'm a bad athlete. Every day I'm surrounded by people more attractive than I'll ever be who are also in better shape than I am. Every day I show up and participate in a sport to better myself, and it only makes me feel worse about myself.   When I got home, I registered for the SAT. I have no idea what college I want to go to or what I want to do in life, and filling out my registration made me reflect on my future and how directionless I am.  I had my dad take my picture so I could upload a photo for my admission ticket. Seeing an objective front-facing photo of myself with full lighting made me realize how ugly I am.  Also, I have no friends or social circle.  Also, I've gained weight because I didn't have enough energy before to perform well during practices.  So yeah. I feel fat, unattractive, not good enough, directionless and worthless to society, and no one who cares and have no one to care about because I don't have friends.  I wonder what the point of my efforts is. ",False,False

I feel like a failure unless my Google fit app registers 10k to 12k steps and has a calories burned above a certain amount even though it doesnt feel accurate at all.

I have tried to calculate my basic metabolic rate or how many calories I need and ultimately dismiss it because it doesnt seem right. My body can't possible need above 1200 calories and definately not this universally recomended 2000.  I just gotta wonder how accurate my pedometer app is.
