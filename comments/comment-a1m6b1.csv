Always critisized and never praised when growing up. Add in alcoholism and extreme anger issues there's a recipe for a fucking train wreck throughout my young adult years. Getting diagnosed with BPD from neglect and emotional abuse, being obsessed with older ""daddy like"" men. Having anger issues myself as well. And of course a constant battle with ED because of numerous weight remarks growing up as a child.   He's supposedly a changed man these days. He always tells me I look great when I come around. I always hear his voice saying those nasty things in my head instead. ",False,False

I wouldn't blame my ed 100% on him (having a bad emotional reaction to puberty was definitely a factor) but being verbally abused by an alcoholic on a regular basis definitely gave me an inferiority complex and a love affair with unhealthy coping mechanisms. ,False,False
