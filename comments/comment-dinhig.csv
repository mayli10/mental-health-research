But yeah, I 100% agree with this. Most of the treatment I got in the states as a teenager was very much punishment based if you were struggling or had a slip up... everyone ended up resorting to lying and covering it all up instead of being honest because of the harsh consequences which isn't going to help anyone.",False,False

I guess that means if you overdo it you can just eat salty foods, but I don't actually think I over did it.
