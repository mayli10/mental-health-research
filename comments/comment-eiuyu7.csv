( cue my ass in  an 11 year binge restrict cycle) I don't judge them, I don't comment unless someone brings it up.   In all honesty, I purposely hang around some skinner friends just to trigger myself bc im a horrible person.   I don't think you are being ridiculous, i think that your  mental health is affecting you like it affects every other person including myself.  I do not believe they hate you because you are thinner.   If you are able, try bringing it up or slipping it into conversation, maybe something like ' I'm one of those people that doesnt eat when im upset', or open a doorway into talking about mental health and the different ways it manifests in people.  If you try and explain it, it may relieve your anxieties, and your friends can learn to not comment, or realise it upsets you.   Hope you can sort something out",False,False
