Speaking of frozen fruit, smoothie bowls are pretty awesome, especially this time of year.   If you have or could find any safe salad dressings you could also have some lettuce, chickpeas, etc as a salad (or add them into a grain bowl. You could also try to incorporate some nuts into your diet or all-natural nut butter to your oatmeals.  I totally understand where you're at in your journey, it can be really hard to find the motivation to change because what you're doing seems so healthy and natural and *right.*  The key is making it sustainable for you if you plan on continuing like this. Having a preoccupation with food for your whole life is definitely not fun, so you need to make this work for you and your body. I'm not sure if you're underweight or malnourished, but it sounds like you're headed in that direction if you continue fasting for days at a time. Try to think about the role someone's healthy eating would ideally play in their life and strive for that. Obsession puts a lot of stress on your mind and body, and that can be more unhealthy than the foods you're avoiding!",False,False

I’ll try out the greek yogurt thing too! I didn’t realize you could eat it with carrots and stuff; I thought it only tasted good with fruit.  Thank you! Intervention is scary to think about.. I don’t want any processed foods in my diet :(,False,True

I’ll talk to him more about it so I can get this figured out :( thank you for the suggestion!,False,True

Also certain kinds of fish. Instant of rolled oatmeal comes in a large container and should last for for at least a week. Oatmeal is definitely a ""stick to your ribs"" kind of meal and keeps you full for a while. Rice comes in a large bag and should also last you all week if that's a safe food for you. If not, you can also buy quinoa for some variety. Plain Greek yogurt is also healthy and tastes like sour cream to me. It can be eaten with carrots or those healthy crackers you were talking about to make it more filling since it's high in protein.   I suffered for Orthorexia for a year before I was admitted in a refeeding program where I reintegrated processed foods into my diet. I don't know how the fuck it happened but I'm on the other side of this. So proud of myself, there is hope! Early intervention is key.",False,False

My mum lets me take my own trolley when we go shopping and I pick up the things I’d like to eat that week and then we pay together.,False,False
