Like, I normally have no ass, so I thought it wasn‚Äôt a big deal, but my butt literally looked like bone.  No wonder my ex boyfriend was so worried.  I‚Äôm so mad that even though he cried to me that he was afraid he was going to break me/snap me...I didn‚Äôt believe him.  And now here I am :‚Äô) 25 pounds heavier from bingeing and fat af.

I have a hamstring injury that is limiting my workouts right now and I am anxious and depressed and cranky as a result. Also the physical therapist can't get me in until Sept 10. On the upside of things, yesterday was day 20 w.o bingeing. Sort of.  I started doing the emotional eating thing last night, wanted to binge, but I stopped myself. The emotional eating was 2 personal sized bags of potato chips and some sour cream, and 2 cups of whole milk yogurt with some jam. So overall not really terrible, and I'm super proud of myself for STOPPING when my mind was doing the ""you already messed up so you might as well go buy donuts and candy."" I reminded myself that wouldn't make anything better (except a very fleeting donuts and candy taste good),and  I didn't want to waste money. I think I felt really upset about it because I don't want to fall back into a binge cycle and I felt like I had a mini binge. Thanks for listening... kinda struggling emotionally right now. Also I need a friend in real life that I could talk about my ED with and not be judged or have someone intervene (not sure such a person exists. Need a dog... LOL). I was just thinking today that like I walked by people eating lunch (am on a college campus), saw a girl eating a chocolate muffin, other girls eating two slices of pizza and I just thought how nice it would be to say aloud ""WTF are they thinking?"" and have someone understand...",False,False
