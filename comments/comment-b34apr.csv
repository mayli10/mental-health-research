I hate that youtube and social media normalized taking/sharing pictures and videos of everyday people (often) without their consent, it's really not okay and you deserve to go about your day without having your privacy violated like that. if I was there and saw that going down I totally wold have told them to cut it out. I hope as time goes by the hurt from that happening gets replaced by better, happier memories. your future holds much better days than this one, I promise. :)",False,False
