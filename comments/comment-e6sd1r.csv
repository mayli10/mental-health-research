I’m so sorry, it’s so hard. And diet culture is loud when you’re planning a wedding. You don’t have to listen to your ED - you’re allowed to just be yourself and feel beautiful and to enjoy your wedding.",False,False

The thing is, though, that you absolutely *can* get married at this weight - this wedding is a celebration of your love for your spouse-to-be and their love for you, *just as you are* (dare I make a ""through thick and thin"" pun?) You are allowed to exist and to feel happy no matter what your body looks like, and you are allowed to feel present and joyful on your wedding day - - simply put, you are enough. It's okay to feel vulnerable right now, and it's okay to mourn the body you used to have, because we all know that recovery is tough as nails and often gruelling. In the long run, however, recovery will allow you to live a long and hopefully happy life with your fiancé, whereas your eating disorder will gradually chip away at you until there's nothing left.  I sincerely hope you'll have an amazing wedding and that, one day, you'll be able to look at those pictures with much kinder eyes than you are currently anticipating. Hang in there, and be gentle with yourself if you can.",False,False
