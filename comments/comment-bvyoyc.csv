I’m having a moment. I am a Christian, I try so hard to be patient, but I don’t understand how constant suffering is God’s plan for me. It’s been nonstop since I was like 9.  My mom thinks mental illness is only something my older sister can have, she’s autistic with some other things that I don’t really know the diagnosis of, so it’s been all about her my entire life. My SO doesn’t understand. He’s balanced as hell and I envy him so much for it. I guess he’s trying to make me not focus on it so much, but what this sort of thing filters your entire world and your thoughts, it becomes your life. Thank you for your kind words. It’s nice to feel validated every once in awhile.",False,True

I’m not sure if you’re looking for feedback, but I just wanted to acknowledge I read your post. Please don’t be afraid to reach out for help. If your support system “doesn’t understand” then look for a different support system. I heard a quote yesterday that I really liked. “Champions don’t rest because they never think they’re good enough. They keep striving to be the best. But they don’t get there alone. They need coaches, trainers, nutritionists, etc.” I’m not sure if you’re religious but that’s helped me a lot in my life— might be worth looking into. But certainly look for help in the right places. Here’s wishing the best for you!",False,False
