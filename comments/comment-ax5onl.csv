Until I can fully transition mentally from the types of foods I eat now versus the foods I’ll have to eat to get to 100g? Do you think that’s like, a positive difference for maintaining muscle at all? ",False,False

Eating more protein will prevent muscle loss when youre losing weight, but without exercising you wont be adding any muscle mass either, but maintaining it is good.   the only thing that will stop your weightloss is if you eat more calories than you need, as you know.",False,False

I don’t exercise and am really sedentary though and for some reason I’ve been scared of this stopping my weight loss? lol that is probably silly because I’ve actually heard that high protein can prevent muscle loss and be safer while in a caloric deficit. Can I ask what you would aim for if you were in my position? I’m 109 right now but I’m also underweight at this point and I have also read that too much protein can cause added stress on the kidneys, which worries me because of the UW status right now. Do you know anything about that? ",False,False
