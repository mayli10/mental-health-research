There is no greater than having a cheat food and it tasting like dirty ass. Fuck. Or when I try a boozy drink and it taste scummy ughh.,False,False

Especially if it's been a long or stressful day, and there's something you were looking forward to *all fucking day.* That moment of pure disappointment if it doesn't live up to what you wanted... (it tastes bad, or is too greasy, or whatever) it kills my appetite and makes it difficult to eat a substantial amount even if it's not really that bad at all. And it's not specifically being ""picky,"" because I do eat and like many different foods even when restricting... it's like a lowkey emotional tantrum my brain throws because it's not *exactly perfect.*",False,False

Food HAS to be ‘worth it’ for me, whether that’s taste or nutrients. I’ve had full-blown meltdowns over it (last one was sugar free jelly - not even 10 kcal but still, the *waste* of them...)",False,False

I was so excited to try this new protein bar and was so mad when it turned out to be the chalkiest thing I've ever tasted in my entire life. I haven't purged in nearly 7 years but that made me want to rage-purge, if that's even a thing.",False,False

It's so disappointing when the food doesn't taste as good as you built it up to be, but it gets me SO heated when I know the food is good but it's lukewarm/old/made wrong if I order. I so get you with that. Like fuck man I haven't eaten for 3 days, I really needed this to be good. Although I'm so conflict avoidant I'll never say anything.",False,False

Anytime I get fast food, even if I specify that I want it fresh, it comes out lukewarm. Do you know how many times I want to specify to people at restaurants “hey, I have an eating disorder and this is the first hot meal I’ve had and will have for days”? Like goddamn it folks.",False,False
