I actually thought about that so I went through the sub a little more to see what language others were using and it was a mixed bag.

I get jealous of their body and proportions. It makes me feel guilty about my own body because I feel like I'm somehow bad at having an eating disorder for not being at their weight and for not looking like they do.  But at the same time I try to remind myself and correct my jealousy. Because I know that mentally and physically, it's draining so they're not doing okay. Their ED causing them a lot of distress they may not show. I feel sympathetic towards them, but I don't like treating anyone with EDs like they're pitiful. It makes me uncomfortable when people do that to me, so I won't do that for others.  But also, you shouldn't really be using the labels ""fat"" or ""skinny"" to describe someones weight in this sub because it can be triggering/harmful to some people.  I do get that you're asking a genuine question, and that you didn't mean that in a harmful way.
