As a student, I was incredibly shy and insecure and I was always sure that that would ruin my chances of ever becoming a lecturer, so I know how you feel.  But the truth is: Everybody, even the most socially anxious person, can become a lecturer, if that is what they are passionate about. Practice does make perfect.  I was always very unhappy with my performance as a student. My grades for papers and exams were always perfect, but I could never speak up in class in a discussion because I was always waiting for the perfect moment, always arranging words and sentences in my head, and by the time I was ready, the discussion had moved to another topic. In my case, the solution was simply to subject myself to a kind of exposure therapy: At the time when I signed up for my first lecturing job, I had no idea how on earth I would do this, but I knew I had to, it had become an obligation and I had a responsibility. And then I just did it. I was mortified during the first couple of sessions and would lie awake for days after each session obsessing over something stupid I said. The beginning was horrible, but in the end what everybody told me would happen really happened: It got a little easier every single time. For the first couple of sessions, the sound of my own voice filling a seminar room full of students was utterly bizarre to me and I felt incredibly embarrassed. But I got used to that too.  And when half of the semester was over, I actually started enjoying it. If you are passionate about your academic subject, being a lecturer is wonderful, because you get to discuss what you love and care about with people who care about the same things.  Here is what I found out:  1) Everybody can do it. Yes, it comes more easily to some people who are naturally extroverts and love attention and spotlight, but being socially anxious doesn't mean you can't be a professor. In fact, several colleagues, some of which have been professors for decades and are internationally renowned, have told me that after 20 years they still get super-nervous before lectures and sometimes feel like everything they do is worthless.  But they just do it anyway and they do a great job!  2) A lot of ED sufferers are perfectionists and that makes it difficult for us to live up to our own high standards and keep us from speaking up etc. The truth is that NOBODY knows everything, not even the most renowned Professor knows the answer to every question. It is not humanly possible. It is ok to admit to one's own limitations. I was so afraid that it would be the end of the world if I couldn't answer a question asked by a student and I prayed that it would never happen. Well, it did, of course it did. But it was not the end of the world. I told the student that I would look it up and come back to the question next time or something like that. And that was just fine. In the feedback I got for my teaching, the students still rated me as very knowledgeable and well prepared, although there were numerous situations I felt I came across as a completely incompetent moron and failure.   3) There is never a ""perfect time"" to speak up in a discussion. If you wait too long, the opportunity will pass. Of course you shouldn't speak without thinking about what you're going to say first, but once the thought has completely formed in your head, just go for it!   4) Most people are absorbed in their own thoughts most of the time.  I always thought that everyone was constantly watching and judging me and that I had to be super-careful not to embarrass myself any minute. In reality, most people spend most of their time preoccupied with their own thoughts, thinking about how they come across in a social situation etc. They are not constantly monitoring you and waiting for you to make a mistake.   5) According to my psychotherapist (who practices psychotherapy half of the time and is a psychology researcher and professor the other half of the time), people with social anxiety often make excellent teachers, because they tend to work very hard and go to great lengths to do a good job, have a lot of empathy and are very receptive for their students interests and needs.   TLDR: Do not let your social anxiety discourage you from pursuing an academic career. With practice and patience, you can overcome any obstacle.",False,False
