I just try to consolidate what my ED wants me to do with what I have to do for school, if that makes sense. Like I have to spend more time studying, so I can't binge because that's time I should be studying, and if I'm always studying then I'll be too distracted to binge. Also I realized that when I stress-binged, it made it so much harder to do well in school because I would feel so shitty, and my need to do well in school outweighed my desire to binge.  But on the other hand, if I'm like super stressed before a final or something and I just want a comfort grilled cheese, then I'll go for it, and try not to beat myself up over it. School is hard, sometimes eating is just a kindness I can do for myself when I need it.",False,False

Consider maybe adding more high volume foods into your diet? Also try to not restrict your carbs too much, carbs fuel the brain! Stick to whole starches, research has found that potatoes are the most satiating food. ",False,False
