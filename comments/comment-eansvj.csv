I'm the living proof. The loose skin is still there especially when you try to be a sexy kitten and crawl over on all fours to your partner lmao,False,False

I want to exercise but also I canâ€™t control myself at the gym ðŸ˜© so I avoid getting a gym membership or starting an exercise routine because I know that Iâ€™ll do great the first few days and then get obsessive instantly and I honestly donâ€™t want to hurt myself (lol I mean not more than I already have?)  My ED is a lying bitch how do I unsubscribe ðŸ˜­,False,True

Despite never being overweight in my life, I have flabby skin on my stomach and ass from weight loss. I feel like I should do some exercises to try to get rid of it, but I despise anything except jogging.",False,False

I recently realized that basically the only differences between the body I have and the body I expected/wanted at this weight is just the loose skin. Guess that's what happens when you gain and lose 70 fucking pounds hahaha kill me. But I've read that a lot of times loose skin only stays loose because there's still subcutaneous fat underneath it and if you lose more weight it'll tighten up so guess I gotta keep losing even though I might have been fine if I'd never binged myself fat in the first place ðŸ¤¡,False,False
