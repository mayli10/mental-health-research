Even if it's healthy food :')",False,True

It's nice to have days where you aren't focusing on the nutritional value or calories in food, kinda like how a kid eats. But since I prepare most of my own food it's hard not to think about whether I'm nourishing my body or overindulging. Eating what you crave is peak level of enlightenment lol",False,True
