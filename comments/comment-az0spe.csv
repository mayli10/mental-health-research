That's giving up, like rolling over and dying.  I feel the same way about my partner,  that he cares about me but just doesn't get it, and just now you've helped me to realize why I don't want to clue him in on the extent of my food issues.   But i find that my guy is pretty good at doing what I tell him to so long as I am explicit and very blunt.
