Iâ€™m sorry friend. I know exactly what youâ€™re going through. I graduated college recently and am currently in the greatest shape / weight of my life, but oh boy, did I have to go through what youâ€™re going though first.   Honestly, most people gain weight this first year. You arenâ€™t alone â€” itâ€™s a weird and exciting time. Try to enjoy it. Youâ€™re learning to socialize and that includes learning to work your  body / food issues with and around your new life.   I spent the first two years of college drinking and eating way too much. I spent the third and fourth year of college overwhelmed with guilt and remorse, and exercise purging like a mother fucker. All in all, I think I wasted my four years.   I guess Iâ€™m saying, just try to enjoy the first year, but take care of yourself. Itâ€™s ok to gain a moderate amount of weight, everyone does! Freshmen 15, am I right? truth is, if you wanna have the best experience you can get out of this year, youâ€™re probably gonna gain a little weight. Just donâ€™t do what I did and gain like crazy before you notice, and then have to spend your upperclass years stressing out and compensating. A little weight gain isnâ€™t so bad, this is a period of adjustment. One you should enjoy! Iâ€™m sorry youâ€™re sad though, hugs ðŸ’•",False,False
