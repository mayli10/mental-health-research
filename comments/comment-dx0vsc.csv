Although I don't know what it would be like to read it now, whether it would be a trigger or not - but I did already have mental health issues at the time, and already had disordered eating, and possibly BDD? But I mainly read it at the time because a lot of my friends were fans of Ellen, and Portia De Rossi grew up basically in the same place as I did.",False,False

Iâ€™m interested in exploring who media like this is intended for, because at times I felt like she might have been aiming it to shock people who donâ€™t understand, but it also felt like she described some things that only people with similar issues would find noteworthy. Most ed media tries to walk that line, and itâ€™s a hard one for sure!",False,True
