I do want to recover, absolutely, but everything that comes along with it is just so scary, and I’m not just talking about the weight gain. I’m scared of hospitals, inpatient and even residential bc of how hard it is to leave, even though I’m a legal adult and no one can force me to stay. It’s not so much that I think I would leave, esp after spending a lot of money on it, but just having that option mitigates a LOT of the anxiety. I don’t feel as trapped. Like I’m making this decision for myself instead of being FORCED into it. Ultimately, I think that would be best for me in my recovery, and I’d be less likely to walk away from it, and I think I’d work harder at it. I’m looking into PHP, but I’d like even that to be a last resort. Thank you for the advice, though, in the mean time. I’ll try and build myself up a support team (dietician, therapist, psychiatrist, support group) and see if that doesn’t help :)",False,False

It can be scary to think about going to treatment.  Honestly I also didn’t want to be hospitalized but I was, and it was probably the best decision (for me at least) I was sent to residential treatment, I can understand why you wouldn’t want to go to any type of residential treatment because it seems like it will be a horrible experience but from the treatment centers that I know of, they are usually really good and even if higher management sucks the people working with you are usually some of the nicest people. But if you don’t want to go to any place like that to get treatment then I highly suggest at least going to a therapist, preferably one that specializes in ED. Also go and talk to a nutritionist, and ask questions about nutrition and learn about what you need. Recovery is really up to you, you can only recover if you want to, and having people support you and your  recovery is why I suggest talking to professional.   Sorry if this is a little confusing,  I hope that your can start recovering  And whatever you decide to do regarding recovery I hope that it will be the best for you.",False,False
