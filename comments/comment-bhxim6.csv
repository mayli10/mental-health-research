My fifth grade teacher \*insisted\* that I was ADHD and campaigned \*hard\* for me to get extra support, extra time on tests/etc. The school psychologist said maybe and told my parents to get me tested but they refused. I would space out in class even when I tried really hard not to, I'd get distracted in the mornings and almost miss the school bus every damn day, turn in assignments late, forget my books/pencils/whatever. As I grew up I learned the tricks to work around/adapt to it just like you described and I function pretty normally (I'm not as chronically late or forgetful as I used to be) but I've always wondered what would have happened if we had pursued a diagnosis.  I haven't got any wisdom about talking to your doctor, as I've never talked to mine. But I hope you do! You don't need to bring up medication right away if you think she'll be suspicious. You could talk about your experience in your early teens and say you think your impulse control/disorganization plays a role in your relationship with food behaviors, and see what she thinks about that. You'll never know until you try bringing it up!",False,False

If you got a maybe on your pre-assessment you should have been sent to a psychiatrist for further testing. It was irresponsible of your doctor to say you're probably fine.,False,False
