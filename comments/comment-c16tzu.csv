I don't count calories any more, I don't binge and purge, but if I don't meal prep for the week I feel just overwhelmingly anxious.   I don't like to not know what I'm eating for breakfast or lunch. I don't want to have to decide that when im hungry and in a hurry bc I tend not to make very healthy decisions. When I meal prep I don't portion out my quantities but I generally have a good idea of how much I need and I can adjust that if I notice I'm still hungry. I eat really good food: food that tastes good, and usually is really healthy and interesting.  I'll be fine this week even though I didn't prep: but it's just a reminder that even beneficial habits can be really self limiting if you're unable to function without them.",False,False

My parents were terrible parents, this is not up for debate with my relatives and I (which says a lot because my relatives love my dysfunctional parents to pieces). I was 10 when I started having an eating disorder. At 10 years old I severely restricted and was always lightheaded. Passing out a couple times at school was what got my school involved, but my parents didn't do shit. They were so self-blaming of me and my attempts at recovery over the years. They said unforgivable things about how I was putting my health at risk when come to find out many of my symptoms were from an undiagnosed hereditary condition. They only found out last month that I had an eat disorder for most of my teens, I cannot tell them how much I am struggling now. Even though, I have told them they just don't get it. Now, I don't want to hear a word from my family about what they think is best for my health. They offered me apathy when I needed empathy. They were so spiteful when I was most vulnerable. Being around their presence just makes me want to restrict more even though that just makes everything worse.",False,False

I woke up four pounds heavier.   I’m kinda proud of myself for being able to do that, but also why the fuck did I do that? The snacks did not add to my enjoyment of the concert, nor did the food I had at the end. (Dehydration was necessary because there were no bathrooms).   I’m incredibly sad now, because why can’t I have one good day without feeling like a fucking cow the next, being super bloated and having none of my clothes fit???   If that wasn’t enough, I’m ridiculously sleep deprived. My best friend stayed over and she snores and kicks. So that’s great. Oh and did I mention we’re having breakfast at IHOP?  I’m going to go have coffee now. Hopefully that will help me with the water/food weight.
