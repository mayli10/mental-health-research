It's kind of a necessity for life. Like, there are people who are deathly scared of water but I've never seen a content warning on a picture of the ocean. Food is necessary for life. Putting a content warning on food only works to enable people with eating disorders to avoid it even easier. Nobody should try to help people with EDs get worse.",False,False

I think it is important for blatant things, like rape scenes in movies/tv shows, or talking/showing images about war zones, or images of a car crash. Stuff like that. Those are just a few examples I can think of. But even as someone with a HUGE amount of triggers for different aspects of trauma in my life, I still think people are getting a little overboard. You can't have trigger warnings for every single subset of specific problems people may have. I get that the intentions are good, but it just isn't realistic.   Just because I struggle with weeks of heavy restriction and then weeks of compulsive binging and horrible body dysmorphia doesn't mean that it is the media's fault because they had an ad for the local gym, and an ad for olive garden, and then an ad for some tv show where the actresses are cute and adorable and smol.  Trigger warnings were/are supposed to be about things that trigger severe, intense reactions. Talking about the gory details of an ED, or self harm, or suicide attempts, or molestation, etc.  People make fun of the term ""triggered"" these days because of the people who think trigger warnings need to be on everything that *might* *potentially* make someone feel *kinda* bad.",False,False
