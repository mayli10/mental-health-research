He even went as far as demanding I video chat him while eating meals and if I didnt eat enough he'd throw away his food. Didnt work out in his favor. I got away with eating so little because I was thinking about it 24/7 and it put a massive strain on our relationship at the time. Its absolutely bonkers how people seem to think ""oh yeah, this will work for sure! Manipulation? Perfect."" Fuck that. I'm sorry you had to deal with this.",False,False

I guess I see now how it's thoughtless.  If my mum would say the same to me during my restriction period then I'd probably just have to be honest with her. ""I don't want to eat right now, because I know I'll feel worse if I do. But I will eat something eventually and there's other ways to support me""  This of course depends on if you're trying to recover or not. Maybe you'll eventually take care of yourself, or maybe you don't want to take care of yourself and don't see a future where you can do so.  Either way, I'm sure you love her, so consider letting her know that her heart is in the right place but her words cause you more anxiety. It's okay to have food issues, there's more to you than food issues.  I'm wishing you luck and sorry for the unasked for advice üíñ",False,False
