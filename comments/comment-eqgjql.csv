We went to Stanâ€™s  donuts and at first I was scared but I ended up getting two donuts and a milkshake. The place was so cute and the donuts were amazing. I hadnâ€™t had donuts or milkshakes in YEARS! I never regretted it one bit. It was a fun experience and when I got home even after eating all that food surprisingly I had dropped 2 pounds! So I would say to you just try to enjoy it and donâ€™t regret anyway. You can always fast for a couple days after if you want. Enjoy that pie! Eat as much as you want of it ðŸ˜ŠðŸ’«,False,False
