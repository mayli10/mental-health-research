It was recommended to me by my therapist and it does a really good job of explaining everything and how you can work to stop binges. I actually prefer it to brain over binge, because I found that it gave me more tools rather than just “ignore the urge”. It’s been a while since I’ve read BOB (lol) though, so maybe I’ve misremembered parts of it. ",False,False
