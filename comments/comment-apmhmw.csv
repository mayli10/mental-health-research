And I feel like I'm in a worse place now than last year  I have to use a journal and lists to communicate with doctors too.   We should definitely chat more since we're basically in the same boat",False,True

Last time my dietitian was out and shit hit the fan, I'm very scared of a repeat. I'm at the point where I can't even eat there, I started hiding food and refusing. I don't know what I need, but I'm terrified this is going to kill me. I understand it being traumatic and horrifying, but you and I are both at the point that we'll be better off not making our own decisions for a while. Just try to stay strong, and be honest about what's going through your head. I found that I couldn't bring myself to say any of the truth when the doctors were there, so I wrote things down as I was feeling them and then gave them my notebook to read. There are no easy answers, and it will suck. Just try to remember they are there to help you. And I'll be right here alongside you, message me anytime. I don't know how many times this will make for me, but I have to hold onto the hope that maybe it can finally be the last, maybe I'll come out stronger. Hopefully you will, too. &lt;3",False,False

Mine is around that too, I wish I could go in sooner tbh. But yeah, I'm obsessed with wanting to be the sickest as well. Now that I know I'll probably be going in soon I'm determined to get as sick as possible before I go in",False,False
