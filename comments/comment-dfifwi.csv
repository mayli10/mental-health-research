Actually I started my anorexic behaviour bc I used to be harassed for being too skinny even by teachers (but I felt so so fat even when my bmi has never been over 17 at my fattest moment) so I felt like skinny was everything that I could be, like the only thing about me that was worth keeping.

I love your name btw   I feel like I can really relate to you. I know it's messed up, but when I was bulimic and not underweight, I'd be jealous of people with anorexia too. I'm also Asian so I understand how frustrating it can be when relatives think it's okay to just point out your weight. I had always felt the same feelings you described, like I was worthless, everything was my fault, and I just manipulate everyone around me. I also had severe abandonment issues too and felt like my friends all secretly hated me or going to leave me one day if I didn't do everything to please them. Recently, I've learned the importance of putting myself first sometimes. It's okay to be selfish. When I feel like I'm disappointing people around me, what really helps me is asking myself how I'd feel if someone did the same thing to me. Most of the time, I'd realize I wouldn't care and would understand where they're coming from.   I'm sorry to hear that your family is so harsh on you. It sounds like you've been through too much and no one deserves to be in an environment like that. Everyone deserves to be loved.   I don't want this to sound like I'm telling you what to do or anything, but from what you've written, I think I came from a mental place very similar and just want to share what helped me start appreciating myself. Working hard to develop true confidence was critical. It's important to be nice to yourself. Everybody has bad characteristics and everyone has good characteristics. Because I was overly insecure and highlighted my bad characteristics, I had to force myself to focus on my good traits and really tried to develop them to become the best I can be before putting focus on bettering my bad characteristics. I found that this really helped me start to develop confidence because I wasn't talking down to myself all day. I know it can be really, really difficult when you hate everything about yourself, but try to reflect on the parts of your personality you can be proud of. Once I learned to appreciate myself a bit more, my life started going uphill. I started to value my friendships because I stopped being scared that they were going to leave me. I realized that my friendships weren't working out because I'd decide in my head that they hated me which caused me to withdrawal from them. I think it's important to become a better version of yourself for you and not just to please anyone else.   Even though I'm only 20, I can tell you that you do have a whole life ahead of you and A LOT changes after you graduate high school. I just started my third year of college, but I feel like a completely different person than I was in high school. I used to be severely depressed and wanted to end my life so I'd never though I'd ever in a million years say this but, life is exciting! I know it may not seem like it now, but life does get better. Hope this gives you something to look forward too (:",False,True

I suck at knowing what would be good to say to be of any comfort but believe it or not you are valuable and beautiful.   I don't want to encourage under-eating but your mindset that if you consume less calories than what you use, you'll lose weight is correct, it's just that there's a lot of factors that can make it seem slower or not happening even if it actually is, even in people dieting the healthy way. You have a whole life ahead of you and you could still be growing and developing too so I hope that you don't feel bad about eating the foods you are comfortable with.

I just ate so much like wtf. Lots of people pitied me, even the teachers because I was involved with social services and constantly had to go to the head‚Äôs office to talk to her and see the social worker. They always had to ‚Äúkeep a close eye‚Äù on me. People would always ask me where I‚Äôd go each week and it was so embarrassing. I wasn‚Äôt even smart because my biological dad was rarely home (always out drinking) and my mum could barely speak English. All the teachers knew about what i was going through, my family, my home,  trauma, they knew everything  And GUESS FUCKING WHAT?  I STILL GO TO THIS STUPID SCHOOL BECAUSE IT GOES UP TO COLLEGE Everyday i feel so raw and exposed. I hate the people in this school, i hate the teachers. I‚Äôve been wanting to leave since i was 10 but I‚Äôm not allowed to. I feel like the teachers treat me like i have special needs or something. They all know my name  and pay reaaally close attention to me.  Fuck, because my home environment was so bad,  i had to actually live in the school boarding house for a few months, then i went to live with my grandma and now i live with my auntie and uncle. But the thing is, when i look in the mirror i still see that fat, stubby, ugly little girl. Even if my face and personality changes drastically, I‚Äôll still see myself as that 8 year old and it haunts me. I hate myself and who i am, Even my personality is disgusting. I‚Äôm broken I‚Äôm not normal  I‚Äôm ugly I‚Äôm fat I do things that aren‚Äôt normal No one understands me I‚Äôm a monster And i hate myself for it  I feel all these horrible emotions because of what i went through (can‚Äôt talk to people, feel overwhelmed ect.)  yet i act like the most confident person, happy person ever. Isn‚Äôt that so fucked up? What did i do so badly in my past life to get this? Not only this but i act so manipulative and use people. I actually destroy people‚Äôs lives and mental state.I wish i could change, I‚Äôve tried and tried but i can‚Äôt I‚Äôm just a ‚Äústupid fucking sociopath who fucks up everyone‚Äôs lives, uses people and drops them‚Äù when I‚Äôm ‚Äúbored of them‚Äù or they are no longer ‚Äúuseful‚Äù to me. This acting is so painful and exhausting I‚Äôm so mentally exhausted but my past keeps following me and karma keeps slapping me in the face I want to be positive, i want to redeem myself, i want to have good karma But i can‚Äôt, I just can‚Äôt. I can be surrounded by friends and family yet still feel so incredibly alone Why am i broken? Why can‚Äôt i think and feel like others? Why do i feel like i have no one? Why am i so fucking empty? I just want want to be loved. I have such a big heart but i won‚Äôt ever be able to use it because it‚Äôs broken. I‚Äôm scared to trust people, to fall in love when i know people are just going to leave me in the end.  Sry this is getting all pitiful and disgusting, I‚Äôll stop.  I don‚Äôt think  anyone will read this but if you do then i just want to say thank you, thank you for not just ignoring  me and listening to me, thank you for not getting bored because you don‚Äôt want to listen to my pathetic rant This is so, ew, cringey but i just hope that someone will help me because each day is a struggle. Oh and also  my grandad was accused of sexual assault by his own niece, my other auntie had a mental breakdown, drugged her child and attempted suicide my uncle used to be married to this woman but found out she was lesbian and so they divorced and the woman dated her own sister‚Äôs best friend and then did all this horrible stuff to her sister so that the sister  ended up committing suicide my other uncle is a schizophrenic and has been in and out of mental hospital‚Äôs and my grandma spent her whole life trying to kill herself. This is all my white family by the way.  It goes: My grandma and grandad (who are divorced)   had my dad, my auntie that i live with, my divorced uncle who has now remarried, my schizophrenic uncle and my uncle who is married to the auntie that tried to kill herself and drugged her child when he was a baby. This is so overwhelming and confusing, right?   My whole family on the outside are an average middle class white family (apart from my dad and schizophrenic uncle) but on the inside there are so many dark secrets. Like, There are loads that I‚Äôm not even allowed to find out till I‚Äôm 18. My family is so fucked up. God i can‚Äôt believe i just unleashed a lot of my secrets online what the fuck. I‚Äôm sorry i just needed to let that all out.  (I haven‚Äôt proof read this lmao and I‚Äôve spent more than two hours writing something that isn‚Äôt even correct English - I cba with grammar.)

The reply: yeah i think i get you. when I‚Äôm at school and it‚Äôs lunch i physically can‚Äôt eat because of the environment and the shape the tables are (circular). I feel like people are watching me and judging me so i don‚Äôt eat very much. If i eat everything on my plate they will think I‚Äôm a fat bitch but if i eat some food then I‚Äôll be hungry, so i just pick the stuff on my plate. When i go through days where i barely eat and haven‚Äôt had any sugar or carbs, i feel really proud of myself but when i take something as stupid as a small bite of a muffin or something like that, i feel so disgusting, i feel so fat and I‚Äôm so disappointed in myself so i then go for even longer without food.  (Yes, i use too many commas and incorrect grammar but idgaf) What goes in my head: If i eat a bit then I‚Äôll be hungry  If i don‚Äôt then i won‚Äôt feel any hunger ‚úÖ If i eat everything i will be seen as the fat girl  If i have loads of food today (3 full meals with snacks and lots of sugar and fatty food inbetween)  Then I‚Äôm not going to eat sugar or carbs for as long as i can go and i will eat under 500 calories per day at the most. What makes matters worse is that i am actually overweight myself and it really pisses me off when my skinny, underweight friends complain that they‚Äôre ‚Äútoo fat‚Äù and ‚Äúneed to go on a diet‚Äù Like, You don‚Äôt have the right to fucking say that you attention whore  Two of my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù even have eating disorders and I‚Äôm so ficking jealous because they‚Äôre so skinny Why can‚Äôt i be anorexic? (God I‚Äôm such an awful person please don‚Äôt hate me) People are gonna hate me for saying stuff like this and thinking like this because this ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù  is meant to understand each other, help each other and be respectful. But at school or home i HATE it when people mention food, eating or weight. It makes me feel so guilty. It‚Äôs not fair .They have flat stomachs, Thigh gaps, stick legs, skinny wrists.  God, if i was skinny I‚Äôd be so happy.  Why am i so fat? Why can all my friends eat whatever they want and not gain a single pound?  How come they never do any exercise but they‚Äôre sticks and can run so far?  - stop now if you don‚Äôt wanna hear about my issues -   A bit of background - I‚Äôm half white half asian but i don‚Äôt live with my parents anymore and I‚Äôm basically adopted by my auntie and uncle but not officially i just live with them. My biological dad lives near my school and my mother lives up north so i rarely see her.  I have had (and sometimes still experience) a traumatic past. I go to a private school in England but  my biological parents are lower class and get benefits from the government and illegal shit. I have a massive bursary. Also, when i was younger I‚Äôd always get clothes from primark and stationary from the 99p store when all the people in my class had massive ass houses in expensive top notch areas, shopped in all these expensive places, got their stationary from WHS Smith (ik, I‚Äôm so tragic, right?) But now coz my auntie has a really good heart (she  helped my mum when she was struggling with just general life even before i was born) and my dad has sorted a lot of his shit out, they pay for my clothes, train fares, and anything else i need. Now, this doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm rich and can afford designer shit  It means that at least a small small part of me can be normal. Like, i can shop at WHS Smith (lmao) i can take the train everyday to and from school, i can shop at trendy places, i can go shopping with my friends. You know, be a normal teenager. (Don‚Äôt get me wrong they‚Äôre still overprotective as fuck) My asian family always reminded  me that I‚Äôm fat Throughout my whole childhood. (They live in Thailand so they‚Äôre all sticks coz they don‚Äôt have enough food to get by) My auntie always tells me how unfit i am (she doesn‚Äôt mean to insult me) but because of what I‚Äôve been through, what people say to me is so extreme that it actually physically hurts me to the point where i feel the need to take my own life because the pain is so bad.I feel like my pathetic fat body has just been kicked, beaten and left to die Like i absolutely hate cross country in school because i always come last and people are just sitting on the grass, waiting for hours and staring at me running. The whole year group is sitting there is a fat bundle saying‚ÄúWooh, come on Kiki‚ÄùWhen they probably think ‚ÄúLmao that fat ass can‚Äôt run omg I‚Äôm dying look at her‚ÄùThe thing is that i realise how my past has affected me. I‚Äôm too disciplined, quiet, fragile, i always think everything‚Äôs my fault, I‚Äôm overwhelmed when I‚Äôm surrounded by people (most of the time), i find it extremely difficult to talk, i feel worthless. But now, i just feel nothing, i just feel numb.  It‚Äôs like i don‚Äôt care anymore. Because i live with my white younger cousin as well (blond hair, blue eyes, super smart, sporty, musical, all rounder, skinny ect.), I‚Äôm constantly being compared and I‚Äôm never good enough. My family have all these high expectations of me. At home, i have to act like this, i have to speak like this, i have to do this and that and it‚Äôs so demanding. My cousins only like 8 and she already says things to me like ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt belong in this family‚Äù ‚Äúyou shouldn‚Äôt even be here‚Äù ‚Äúmy mum and dad will always love me and not you‚Äù ect ect, I know it‚Äôs stupid to be affected by this but it just makes me go  :(  To make matters worse, my auntie always says how much weight she‚Äôs lost and how skinny she‚Äôs looking and how she barely has anything to eat at work  which makes me feel absolutely awful. Just awful. Last year i used to eat so so much and i feel so disgusting, No wonder I‚Äôm so fat  I used to eat like this: Two pieces of pita bread for breakfast with lots of butter and some orange juice  Before school, some coke or sugary Starbucks drink from Sainsbury‚Äôs or Lucozade  And a sleeve of Oreos  For break, a chocolate bar, crisps and a cupcake. For lunch, a full meal with extra food added on E.g  a massive white wrap (no kidding it‚Äôs actually massive it‚Äôs like the size of 4 wraps put together) Then I‚Äôd have two desserts and a piece of bread  After school, I‚Äôd eat whatever i could get my hands on in the supermarket   This could be Some duck wraps, coke, biscuits, chocolate, crisps, cake ect  I‚Äôd buy a LOT of food to eat in one massive binge  At home Id have loads of snacks and food  I‚Äôd have a massive bowl of mama pot noodles (it‚Äôs a brand) with all the flavouring  A sugary bar (like an oat bar or nut bar with hidden calories)  Lots of salty peanuts  Chocolate milk  Then I‚Äôd eat a massive dinner and have loads of fruit afterwards  I don‚Äôt know why i ate like that because my ‚Äúadoptive‚Äù family are absolute health and exercise freaks  Also i used to just eat my feelings away and feel so bad about myself but i just kept eating and eating because it tasted so good. Now i eat like this: Breakfast: A glass of Roasted Almond milk for  Lunch: 1 egg yolk from a boiled egg and a couple of pieces of cucumber  Dinner: try to eat little  I do realise this is unhealthy and i probably end up gaining  even more weight but i just, idk i feel that maybe, just maybe it might work? In my mind i feel that If i eat under the amount of calories you are meant to have per day then I‚Äôd lose weight but i know this isn‚Äôt necessarily true. Furthermore, if i take the bus instead of walking i make sure i don‚Äôt do it again unless i absolutely have to.",False,False
