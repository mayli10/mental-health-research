I’ve been doing a lot of research into it, and as it turns out weight is actually kind of related to RSI, but mostly with overweight/obese, due to the inflammation. Carpel tunnel on the other hand is more common with lower body weights since indeed the padding is gone. These are two different kind of things though, RSI is due to muscle problems (mostly too much muscle tension), while carpel tunnel has to do with pinched nerves. For RSI there is not really a solution other than resting, decreasing muscle use and tension and decreasing stress. For carpal tunnel they often recommend a brace for sleeping, or you can get an operation to remove the nerve or part of it so that it doesn’t bother you anymore. There are also a lot of other wrist disorders, but if you are in pain please get it looked at!! Your hands are soooo important and truly priceless. Long story but I hope it helps you!",False,False

What helped was taking Tylenol around the clock for a few days to reduce inflammation and letting the area rest whenever possible (ex: avoiding excessive phone use, lifting heavy things). I also kept a wrap on my wrist to redistribute the strain when I was typing, which helped to reduce flare-ups. If it pain gets really bad and lasts for several hours after activity, icing it can help. ",False,False

It could just be that you've been using your wrist so much it's started to feel the effects. I don't think weight correlated to those issues, unless live developed osteoporosis and suffered a stress fracture perhaps? ",False,False
