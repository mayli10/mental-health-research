But that's untrue, and we are also worth so more than that. When we forget our worth, when we have been taught to fear our strength and our light, we need to find the people who will help us remember that our lives our precious and our bodies are our own. This new guy does not sound like someone who is interested in helping you remember that you are strong, and worthy, and do not crawl before anyone. Walk tall through this life my lovely.

I have no idea what happened, and assault isn’t something I’ve personally lived through, but I hope you’ll access any help that would be helpful for you - be it medical, therapeutic, legal, or anything else.
