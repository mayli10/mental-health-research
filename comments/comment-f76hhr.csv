And from what I HAVE read I’ve seen that there’s a high comorbidity between alcoholism and eating disorders. And alcoholism is an addiction and can be genetic. Like for example, alcohol addiction runs in my family. I’m not an alcoholic but I’ve had some kind of eating disorder my whole life.",False,False

Seems like everyone responds differently to the same stimuli. No history of addiction in my family but definitely history of obsessive thinking, which plays in heavily to disordered eating.",False,True

Traumas of varying sorts tend to be passed down families until someone breaks the cycle. A lot of my issues certainly stem from the dining table being an unsafe place where most arguments that snowballed into violence or being chucked out were sort of incubated and crystilised as we were forced to sit together without distraction. In families with dysfunctional power dynamics its easy to see how food becomes a place of control and fear.,False,False

My grandmother have anorexia and my dad had some kind of Ed in his younger years. My mom is addicted to exercise and dieting my little sister is overweight and my mom puts her on a diet all the time. My parents where athletes so I think there disordered eating comes from that tho.,False,False

Everyone has their bodies put under a microscope at some point in their lives. But not everyone will develop an eating disorder. Even people that are constantly barraged about their weight don’t all develop a disorder.  I think a lot of it is having a predisposition to eating disorders. I don’t have the science on it and haven’t researched it but it makes sense to me that if someone has addiction in their family, it may make them more likely to have an ED since eating disorders in general are pretty addicting.",False,False
