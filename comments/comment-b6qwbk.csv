DO IT ",False,False

Also, I applied to 14 high tier colleges and 1 safety, and got accepted to the safety and one (1) of the great colleges, but that doesn't matter in the end bc I'm still at a great college.  You only need one, try to focus on that if you can.",False,False

I know the process feels very personal bc they have so much of your info but itâ€™s totally a crapshoot when it comes to who gets admitted and a lot of it has to do with legacy/other factors unrelated to you.  I didnâ€™t get into what I thought was my dream school, but I realize now that the image they present to prospective students really is just the glamorized version...the lived experience attending is not necessarily so great. Iâ€™m sure you will find a school that suits you!",False,False

Iâ€™m a senior in high school as well and I wonâ€™t be able to go to my dream university. Looks like Iâ€™ll be staying with my parents and going to the one 30 min away from home nowðŸ™ƒ  And Iâ€™ve been binging much harder than before since I found this out a month ago,False,False
