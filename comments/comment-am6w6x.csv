I think that's what's missed by intuitive eating philosophy sometimes, or at least it's a subtlety: I don't have super strong preferences for what I eat most of the time. I know I'm hungry, and I might have a preference for salty or savory, but I can play with the composition of more veggies/protein vs more starch, and that helps me be satiated with fewer cals (whether or not I'm counting them). Also, if you've been putting a lot of effort into restricting to maintain a weight or lose weight, and then you relax that effort, your behavior has likely changed, which results in some weight gain or the cessation of loss. How long has it been? You might be weight stable for your current habits, or you might still be adjusting. I don't think of my body as having a set point, I think of my eating habits as having a set point. There are some real hormonal things that happen if you have a significant weight change (think 10%); a significant loss will result in more hunger signals as your brain tries to regain that lost emergency energy, whether or not you ""needed"" it (your body is fine with you being a bit overweight, it doesn't know about bikini season). For that reason, I know I need to focus on high satiation foods if I want to maintain a new weight, at least for a while. I'm a person who has lost a significant amount of weight (about 40 lbs) and I've maintained the lower weight for years now, both intuitively and not.
