Are you okay with being in a relationship with someone who watches porn? If you aren't, leave him. I'm personally not. That's a perfectly fine boundary to have. Also, he sounds like he will lie about it just to save the relationship. They always do. Don't believe him",False,False

Most couples are okay with porn as long as it's kept private to the individuals (I know that was the case for me in the past), but do you really think that the difference in making something right vs wrong is simply ignorance of the act? No. Porn completely violates monogamy.  I'm really sorry, OP. I'm sorry our society sucks. ",False,False
