We have to feed our dogs additional food in the winter, because just being cold burns more calories than normal. So we have to feed them more or else they‚Äôll get too thin.   We burn more calories being cold, more energy is used to keep you warm. It‚Äôs OK to eat more, your body actually needs it! A low calorie vegetable soup will do wonders for your energy level, warmth, and it feels wonderful. Don‚Äôt feel guilty for eating something a little heavier than you normally would. Cold is really hard on the body, and when your body is running on fumes, it can use a little extra boost. It‚Äôs not indulgence, it‚Äôs more of a nourishment.",False,False
