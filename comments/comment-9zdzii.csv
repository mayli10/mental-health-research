Get away from a toilet. Call someone to chat and wish them a happy Thanksgiving. Watch pimple popping videos on YouTube. Remind yourself your body needs food to live. Ya a binge is bad, but purgingis worse.   Put it off. Say I can purge but first I have to sweep the floors, put a load of laundry in, call someone. The more often I do these things the urge lasts a shorter time. I've been where the urge last for hours but sometime now it's only 15 minutes I have to get through. ",False,False
