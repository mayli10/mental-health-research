This shows phenomenal introspection and knowledge of self. I hope you can hold onto it and come back if and when there are harder times in the future.  You're definitely not wrong in that these subs have as much potential to set an individual back as to help them. People come to these subs for different purposes and at different stages in their experiences with disordered eating. Maybe people do mean to be catty because that's where they're at right now with their problems. Maybe they don't mean to be catty but they can't see the world in any other way than that because that's where they are.  Where *you* are is to lift up and out of here.  Make a new Reddit account and start posting like crazy on some hobby/fandom subs!,False,False
