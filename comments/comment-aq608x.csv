I’m at a lower BMI than your proposed cutoff weight and yet I look so completely normal that I can’t justify making the effort to get help all on my own. It’s not a secret that I’m struggling, but it’s like the few people in my life who might care (parents, doctors) see me holding it together and don’t realize how underweight I am and what a bad place I’m in both mentally and physically. Don’t know about you, but I’m 30 and can’t afford to disrupt my life at all for treatment.  I’m afraid you’ll get to your goal weight and feel silly  for making this decision, because you’ll hit 110 and it won’t be like you expected. I’m afraid you’ll decide it’s not a big deal and alter your limits accordingly. 105, 100, 95. You might never reach those weights, but if you do, it may not be enough. Ever.  If you have even an inkling of an idea that you might be open to recovery, I’d suggest not wasting any time in taking life by the reins and making it happen to minimize whatever damage is being done. It is physically miserable to recover, more so the lower your weight gets. Don’t put yourself through that.",False,False
