Vaping will do it. Nicotine kills appetite when you get hooked on it.  I have to eat about 2 meals a day or else I start acting crazy and ED panic. He sometimes doesn't eat at all.  Or when we do he only wants burger king. and burger king. and more burger king.  Lately though after holidays, we both are getting better at eating more set amounts.",False,False
