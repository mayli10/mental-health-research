Pushing people away so you can fully destruct yourself is a symptom of a lot of mental disorders.   You need to talk to your bf and explain him what you're going through. ",False,False

I'm in my 20s. This shit makes us act irrationally sometimes. The important thing is recognizing, apologizing, and minimizing. You've already done steps one and two. Next up is figuring out how to minimize the behavior in the future. In my situation, I only made it to step one, and now so much time has passed I cant really apologize without it being weird. Hopefully, I can still do step three and head off a future blow up when I recognize the warning signs of irrational behavior.",False,False

I'm sorry. I know it's horrible you flipped out...I have a hard time facing the monstrous parts of myself so I'm sure you arn't feeling at all great about this. It was brave to post about it. I'm sure you can move on from this. Maybe he means it when he says it is fine. I guess you could look into resources about shifting away from engaging in behaviour that could cause harm to others. Let me know if you'd be interesting in any I could share.,False,False
