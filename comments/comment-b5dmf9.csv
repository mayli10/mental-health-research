Yes body checking and fear of weight gain can be ED behaviors. They can also be indicative of entirely normal stress and insecurity. I hope you talk to someone if you feel you need to, and get the help you need to stay on track being healthy and managing behaviors if they seem compulsive or harmful. But please don't feel like the fact that you do these things and have these thoughts means that you're broken or disordered or necessarily in trouble already. You have strength in you that you probably aren't feeling right now:) ",False,False

Maybe it's because your body has changed, and once you get used to your new shape you'll be more confident it's not going to suddenly disappear on you or change back? Like obviously you know that intellectually, but the feeling is real. ",False,False
