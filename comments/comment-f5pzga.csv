Instead I'm walking back and forth in my room to get steps in.  I actually lowkey missed this walking.  Had a 5 day weekend and barely moved except for working out 30 to 50 min a day and was super busy since the beginning of february that I usually maxed out at 10000 steps.,False,False

The diagnosis meant I was able to get my IEP in high school, and I was able to get the accommodations I needed to succeed like smaller class sizes and slowed down versions of classes I struggled with. I was able to take advantage of other things like a voc rehab program that gave me the skills I needed for the workplace, and even a class where they teach you life skills like cooking and personal finance.  Thanks to all of that, I was able to move out on my own without need for any other services at 19 (though I still have a case manager just in case), and with the exception of transportation help I live independently.  If you think you've got it, do what you gotta do to get tested because my diagnosis changed my life. Seriously.",False,False

They had to rule so many things out before they tested me officially. The rigidity, tendency to withdraw, so many symptoms overlap with other diagnosis that it didn't feel like anyone really knew where to start.",False,False

I genuinely love it and panic when I don't have room to pace.  It's not related to my ED though, strangely. I've been a frantic, neurotic pacer since I was a kid. I'd scope out a long, obstacle-free path both inside and outside (if possible) at every place I've ever lived. It's convenient in my ED's case though.",False,False
