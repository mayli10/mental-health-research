Tends to be calcium, D3, iron and B12. Those are things they give to bariatric surgery patients when they are on a very low cal diet. You can get them without a prescription. For example vitamin D3 dose in a standard multivitamin is 1000 IU, in separate supplements it can be 3000-5000 IU, but it only *maybe* becomes *slightly* toxic in *some* individuals at 20 000 IU, so there's no real risk of overdosing. B12 can't even be overdosed at all. Calcium and iron can be overdosed, but you're still pretty safe if you take the ""high"" doses as sold over the counter, because the actual toxicity level is many times that over a long time.   Yeah, I understand about protein. What do you think about getting BCAAs in a pill/powder form? It's like concentrated goodies of essential amino acids that you would get from protein, but without the extras. Not a full replacement, but at least something.",False,False

They are formulated for people who already eat a standard 2000 kcal diet of presumably healthy varied foods.  Hair loss can be due to general stress and low calories, not just vitamin deficiency. Being in a large deficit changes all your hormones, thyroid function, everything.   Your best bet is to get a blood test for deficiencies and take high doses of the specific things you are missing. Deficiency-correcting doses are sometimes hundreds or thousands times higher than what you get in a multivitamin. So yeah it's not surprising that a multivitamin doesn't do much. Not every deficiency can be seen in a blood test, though. And taking a multivitamin is still better than nothing.  Also protein is just as important, it's basically an essential vitamin with calories. I would make sure to eat at least 1g/kg of your weight (or what your weight would be at a healthy BMI) as a first measure, then look into vitamin deficiencies.",False,False
