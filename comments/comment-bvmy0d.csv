But whenever I get a fever, I feel like food digests in my tummy more easily and I don't really have an appetite. My weight stays down too, probably due to medicine (drinking medicine makes me go pee a lot, I guess it's all water weight). However from what I recall from my last fever, my weight went up by a few, but less than how I weighed before getting a fever, so in technical terms, I still lost weight (sorry if it doesn't make sense, I don't know how to explain in english)  &amp;#x200B;  Please take care always!",False,False
