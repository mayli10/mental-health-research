Those first few weeks of adjustment hit like tequila but then you start feeling better and the Eds grip lessens. The voice never goes away. You just have to realize that it holds no power over you,False,False

It can be so small- reading for instance is a really good distraction from yourself and you don't have to leave the house! Plant some flowers. Learn a language, take up drawing. You don't even have to get good at it. Lol you could even play a video game or watch a different movie every day if it gets you away from your ED brain. You'll start to feel like a kid in those moments, when you weren't hyperaware of yourself and your body and you just lived. Don't put too much pressure on yourself. Just do little things- one thing at a time. If you ""fail""- just start again the next day. You can do it, read about neuroplasticity.  Also, you're allowed to feel shitty and guilty, and you're allowed to fear other people. Doing things regardless of those feelings is incredibly brave.",False,False

Just a heads up, I was most at my most suicidal during recovery because it was my whole identity and I didn't know what I would be without it. You need to pursue something that has nothing to do with your body and you need to pursue it hard. Find new friends, read new books, get a new job, new hobbies. You will always want to lose weight but the desire won't consume you like it did, and you can develop a sense of pride about your new identity. Trying new things will be difficult because EDs protect you from really being vulnerable and open to failure, but you have to find joy in something outside of your body. You are worthy of a happiness that doesn't try to eat you alive like AN. Imagine coming to the end of your life and realising you wasted it trying to train yourself not to be hungry. You're a human being, the world is so complex and there's so much more to explore than an eating disorder (that will ultimately kill you).",False,False
