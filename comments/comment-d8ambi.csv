I wouldn't say it's ""just as harmful"" to be naturally underweight as it is to be underweight due to an ED, but that's because people with eating disorders are usually stacking _actively harmful activities on top,_ (fasting, b/p, c/s, over-exercising, eating foods that specifically contain little to no nutritional value, over-consuming coffee/diet soda/energy drinks, abusing medications, etcetera etcetera).   It varies from situation to situation, but being underweight can be a life-threatening issue and should be taken seriously by medical professionals regardless of whether an ED is present or not.",False,False

And yes, even people who tend to undereat without being disordered will experience or be at risk of experienceing underweight-related health issues.  Decreased fertilitity, decreased bone density, lowered immune resistance, and nutrient deficiencies are all health consequences that a person can be experiencing while ostensibly seeming ""perfectly healthy"".",False,False
