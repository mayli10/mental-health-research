I've always been an extremely physical person who lives in my body, so to speak. Very fidgety, very tactile, etc. If something's up in my body, I find it really hard to ignore it, and it can really affect my mental state. So, physiological hunger is something I find fairly hard to withstand.   Many of my friends are the opposite of this. They live in their heads, learn better by listening rather than doing, aren't very touchy feely, etc. They're also the type who'll legitimately forget to eat. I imagine that getting down to a sketchy weight would be easier for them than it was for me. (But I hope they never feel the need to try)",False,False

My BMI is \~19 and I honestly feel so awful eating at a 500 calorie deficit. I can't even comprehend how some people function on 500 cals/day when I can barely think straight and stay upright eating 1500.  ,False,False

How much I restrict depends on how much I exercise. But my very lightest days are about 1500. Most days when restricting are closer to 2000. ",False,False

You can stay at the gym for the same amount of time (I obsessed over time during my exercise phase) and your body will honestly probably burn around the same-ish calories, as doing the same movements will likely require more effort while restricting. It will just help keep you from hurting yourself. Every time you want to push yourself further than you should, remember that if you go to hard, you might make it impossible to exercise at all due to injury. Stay safe...",False,False

Partly because I love lifting but I’m constantly exercising trying to burn as many calories as possible. I used to be much more restrictive but my body seriously can’t take it anymore, I can’t believe I was once able to workout twice a day on &lt;1000 calories. Now I have to eat more or I’ll collapse. This made me feel like I didn’t even have an eating disorder anymore because I used to restrict more. That’s definitely not the case. I still obsess over food and deprive my body of what it needs. I’ve learned it’s not the number that makes your disorder ",False,False

I totally understand this feeling because I only care about net intake, and subtract any excercise calories from my total. So it feels like shit when I see someone post ""just ate 700 calories today and went for a 6 mile run on top of that :)"" when I feel proud of a day where I ate 1200 and burned 300 running or whatever (at least it keeps me from binging...). Even ""healthy"" subs like r 1200 do this all the time and it drives me insane.   Anyway, the point is that at your level you're at a 1000 calorie deficit at the end of the day, which is absolutely enough to lose weight by any measure. I'm going to guess your bmr is no higher than 1500 so you're getting as much energy as anyone who eats 500 cals and doesn't leave the house. Which is absolutely not trivial. ",False,False
efcwias,t3_alclj8,t3_alclj8,_Pulltab_,1,2019-01-30 08:08:22,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/alclj8/anyone_here_lift_weights_active_life_higher/efcwias/,"I have been actively working on recovery for the past few months after going through a really bad restrictive cycle last year. At my lowest point, I was unable to do much of anything except sit around and be sad because of my intake which was well under 1000 calories.  I started going back to the gym in the fall and tried to maintain about 1000 calories and although I was able to do it, I'm not sure how much I actually got out of it. I had a DEXA scan at the end of the year and discovered that despite lifting weights I had lost a significant amount of muscle mass as compared to the year before when I was overweight (before my most recent stint of restriction). This is what ultimately scared me into trying to recover.  After an initial period of binge/restrict where I think my body was pretty freaked out, I've landed somewhere around 1700-2000 calories with a TDEE of 2300 or so. I lift pretty heavy (I'm doing the TLS program) and found that once I started that, if I didn't get at least 1700 calories I was a mess. Lightheaded, nauseous, unable to complete my workouts.  Everyone is different, though. I'd wager that you might be able to maintain for a while, but it will eventually catch up with you. In the meantime, you could be doing a lot of damage to your body, so try your best to take care of your body. ",False,False
