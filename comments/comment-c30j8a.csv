I've spent my life in and around the entertainment industry, and the reality is that lipo is p easy and quick now if you have the $$$. Thigh/knee/arm/everything lipo is common in Hollywood and presumably among rich people in general.   There's also CoolSculpting and Sculptsure, which are noninvasive (altho Sculptsure can really hurt) but those take longer to show results and are not usually as predictable/complete. However, once those fat cells are dead, they really are dead, and if you gain weight after these procedures, it distributes evenly. With lipo, if you gain weight after the procedure, the fat likes to go right back to the area you fixed, and in this lumpy and gross looking way. A lot of people who start doing lipo just...keep doing lipo. Because next to no one can maintain a perfect diet forever, and then when the fat comes back you REALLY want it gone bc it looks ugly now.  I'm not saying these surgeries are a good idea, but I think people should be aware that most Hollywood bodies are not made entirely with trainers and diet specialists (which are enough of an advantage to begin with).",False,False
