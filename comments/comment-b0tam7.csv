Say exactly that. You can even frame it in a less alarming way. Like, say how much you exercise rather than using the word over-exercise. Just list the number of times you've self-induced vomiting in the last 6months (or whatever time frame they want), rather than using the word ""purge."" You can expect some pushback, depending on what the issue is and what the treatment for it is. If they push you to seek treatment, you can say no. You're an adult and they can't force you. They may insist on a psych eval or a dietician appointment before pursuing further treatment. In that case, just do it. One visit won't be a big deal. You don't have to schedule any more visits if you don't want to.   But, I want to point out that this may be a good opportunity to consider recovery. Malnutrition will make recovery from whatever treatment you're receiving much, much harder. ",False,False
