The weather is also terrible here and I have seasonable depression every fucking year...  I've tried doing it for others. That's what I've been doing for almost 2 decades and it's just too much. I don't have it with me to fake it anymore. I'm not a quitter, but I think this is the end of my resilience there.   I am really not looking to kill myself or die from a fortunate accident. I just feel empty and I think it's worse sometimes. Its even worse when I see all the things I should be happy about but I just can't.   Thank you for taking the time to answer, that really means a lot ðŸ’•",False,True

This winter is harsh where I live and I'm having trouble fighting off both regular and seasonal depression.  Its tough, but the only way out is hard work. Really make an effort in finding positive things, even though you don't feel like doing so.  Everyday I wake up I read this note on my phone where I listed everything in my life I should be happy about, and it makes me more motivated to get out of bed and go to work. If not for me, I do it for the people I care about.",False,False
