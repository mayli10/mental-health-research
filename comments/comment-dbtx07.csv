The negative emotions/reactions you have around these binges is only fueling more of them. Whereas if you have a more neutral approach, taking a step back and saying, okay. I binged. What fueled this binge? Nothing I can do about it now, etc, it will help.  Sadly this is definitely not recovery, though. Thereâ€™s still a lot of internal judgment over what binging means for your weight, and mindset is the biggest part of having an ed. Call back the treatment center and emphasize how much you need help now and canâ€™t wait until your appt, often they will move you up because of this or at least try to! In the meantime, treat yourself kindly ðŸ’–",False,False
