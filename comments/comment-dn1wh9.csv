But the thought: ""They just make everything sexual and I feel like it makes me look fat and old?"" was literally my biggest issue with having boobs. I didn't understand why other people didn't think boobs looked fat and old. To me that's just what they were. I guess I naturally feel sorta androgynous so anything big and curvy is a no for me.  I'm not sure how big your boobs are but light binders can help a lot. They're literally made for this problem! Esp if you're not trying to be flat they shouldn't be too uncomfortable. At some point maybe you can get a reduction.",False,False

A lot of the resources about finding a good binder are written for trans men and non binary folks, but the general idea of not having boobs is still there.",False,False

I used to have panic attacks and try to literally pull them off in dressing rooms, like a crazy person. Now, I double up on a sports bra and a regular bra, and that seems to lessen the....impact.
