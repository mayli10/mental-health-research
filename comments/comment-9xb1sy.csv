I'm so sorry that you've been through all of these things. I hope that you are safe from your abusers and have found some outside support. I know what you mean about proed being understanding. It was a place that was so free of judgment, and everyone was always so loving.   I totally understand feeling robbed and sad. Proed was everything to me some days when things were really bad. For what it's worth, if you need someone to talk to, you can feel free to pm me. I'm willing to listen, and I'm sure that there are a lot of other former members that are willing to listen too. Stay safe! &lt;3 ",False,False
