I think maybe the panic itself makes us nauseated, in my case it's also sometimes that I eat something sweet. but the feeling of fullness is the worst",False,False

I have been terrified I was going to retch in the middle of dinner at times. I think stress is just being a major bitch.,False,True

When I do decide to eat - I do want to digest it. It's not like it's ever a ""normal"" meal size.   Part of me wonders if my stomach capacity just shrank so much that anything more than like... a healthy choice steamer bowl like, wont fit in my stomach? My body just seems to push it out. Maybe its mental like you said - I just dont know.   It sucks tho. My friend is coming into town soon and she wants to grab dinner. Then I'm driving her to another town to save her a cab fare.... which means, I'll probably have to pull over. Already, nearly a week away and the anxiety is hitting me.   Glad I'm not alone in this. It blows for sure.",False,False

I just don't know WHY. I think ED brain is trying to work up my anxiety, making me nauseated, so I don't eat much because I anticipate getting nauseated at meals. Does that even make sense? I guess if I get nauseous at meals, I won't want to eat, and if I don't want to eat, I get thinner. But it isn't anything I can necessarily control.",False,True

I try to eat very slowly, something small and then 30-60 minutes later will eat the meal I intended. This is pretty impossible at restaurants though where it affects me most.",False,False
