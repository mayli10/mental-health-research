You're going to be so active that you REALLY need those calories to just be able to hike and kayak. It seems like a lot of food but your output will be high.  It's dangerous to restrict in the wild like that, so maybe just dont snack as much as they will? Listen to your body and if you start to get shakey or irritable or light headed you NEED to eat.",False,False

A big ass watermelon to eat or a bunch of strawberries. So if you’re feeling faint or weak you have something to bring your blood sugar back up that you’ll feel comfortable eating.   My advice is to try your hardest to manage food anxiety and try to eat. You’ll be working out a lot by being outdoors and doing camping stuff, so you’ll probably burn off the majority of what you eat. (Also you will most likely gain water weight from using your muscles/eating food your body isn’t used to so don’t freak out if you come back and your weight is up for a day or so)   It’s all a trade off! You probably wouldn’t eat s’mores if you were just chilling at home. But if you hike and swim and kayak you’re allowing your body to earn it!",False,False

I know it’s hard m, but you’re only young once and when you look back on it, it would be better to remember having a good time vs. worrying about food.",False,False
