Something I do to ease the period dysmorphia is make sure I exercise as it helps with bloating and makes my ED brain feel like I contributed to weight loss, perhaps you might find that helpful if you don't do it already x I know it might not be exactly what you want but if it helps, when I have been to the doctor for hormonal birth control before now, I wasn't weighed or inspected. I was just asked about my symptoms and why I wanted the pills. This was in the UK. I hope this can ease your mind a little if you wanted to look into birth control as a period regulator/disappearer.  You're strong. If you ever wanted someone to talk to, just dm me.",False,True

I have had hormonal issues lately where I have two periods in a month, sometimes lasting over a week with a few days of break in between. Not only do I get pain and heavy bleeding, I also get bloated which triggers my dysmorphia further. I think I need the doctor but I am scared to go and be diagnosed or weighed. In my twisted mind I am hoping to get a lot skinnier and lose the period. I am sorry you are going through this and sending good thoughts your way.",False,False
