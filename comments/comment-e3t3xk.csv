Everyone is so eating disordered.  I helped my friend cook dinner for friends- he had to change his whole menu around for 1 person who was gluten and lactose intolerant.  The food system is out of whack. There should be no way to get e.coli from romaine. Yet here we are. How is it possible to be so morbidly obese yet nutritionally deficient at the same time. What the hell are they doing to our food???????????  They have turned corn and soy into crack cocaine.  So immoral.  So wrong. Our system is broken  End rant.,False,False

The obesity epidemic is evidence of this. Obviously it's more complicated than one single factor, but at the end of the day, nutrition and activity is something that needs to be habitually managed in most people. Managing it in a non-disordered way probably doesn't come naturally, because neither does living in a world where we can drive to a drive through and buy a day's worth of calories that can be consumed in a few bites, or even drank out of a coffee cup.",False,False

I also come from a culture where literally everyone and their mother diets, but it doesn't mean that all of them are disordered. I know a person who has a ""dieting phase"" at least once per month but she is very casual about it and even though she might eat below 1200 calories some days and says that she wants to lose weight, she says that she loves herself in her current size anyways and it's no biggie if she fails her diet. She thinks it's fun to diet and work out and see how she can improve herself.   But if your whole life becomes centered around food and calories and weight and your appearance, and it's not fun at all and you're just miserable the entire time, then it's disordered. If it affects your social life, your performance at school/work, you moods - it's disordered. Also, if you feel like you're not in control at any given time - then it's disordered. I can't control when I fast. I can't control when I decide to only eat 500 calories for a week. I can't control when I decide to binge and eat b&amp;j ice cream 7 days a week. That's disordered. When normal people start a diet, they can end it whenever they want and say ""okay I can't be bothered with this anymore"" or ""yeah I'm losing weight but I'm tired all the time and I feel lethargic so it's time to end it"" but someone who is disordered won't do that. Because we don't have a say in that.   This is just my own thoughts about this whole issue and my personal experience with all of this though, so it's likely that not everyone experiences the same things.",False,False

When does a diet/fasting/maintenance cross the line from normal into disordered? Is everything but intuitive eating disordered?,False,False

I am very white - it’s very insightful to hear about other cultures (I’m so going to go down the Kpop diet rabbit hole. Haha)  I’m quite lucky in the sense that I know one person at least without disordered eating: my boyfriend. He is round, has a belly, loves his food, is great at cooking and I love him for all of that.",False,False
