He would call me fat and chubby, grabbing at me while my parents laughed. Sad thing is, I was never overweight. Just wasn’t as thin as he was.   I have felt hatred and shame towards my body since around the age of six. I always snuck food out of the kitchen and would quietly binge on it in my room. I’m not sure what prompted that, tbh. Just can remember doing it. Became depressed in the 8th grade and started bingeing on a regular basis.   I joined a dance group, summer before my freshman year of high school. They placed an especially high emphasis on weight and appearance. I lost weight from the increased physical activity and was absolutely terrified to gain any of it back. I began tracking calories and eating low cal foods, obsessively. That turned into Ana, as a result of a number of stressors and problems in my life. After that, it became about need for perfection and control. Losing weight felt like the only thing I was good at.   Been stuck in a cycle of recovery and relapse for 15 years now. I tend to gravitate towards narcissistic people who put me down because that’s what I experienced growing up within my own family. The ED always resurfaces when things in my personal or professional life are difficult and spinning out of control from. I guess my ED is a way to feel like I have control over something again. I don’t know. For how long I’ve had it, I still don’t fully understand what caused it or what I continue to struggle with it. I hate it but it’s hard to imagine a life without it.",False,False

Then it was years of binging and restricting with a sprinkle of compulsive exercise. Purging began in my late 20s when I was at my highest weight.   I've had depression since 6th grade and desperate for comfort when I had none. I was tormented at school and then at home i had no one to reach out to for support bc of codependency issues. I had to protect my parents from being upset about me having a hard time. It was 6th grade also when my brother was having a rough go of his teenage years and my parents found out he was doing drugs. It was chaos at home and generalized peer rejection at school. I was just a kid so I didnt turn to drugs. I turned to what was available to me which was food.,False,False
