I recently decided to start upping my intake to maintenance as well after the fog started really getting to me. It is way harder than it should be and I feel your pain when it comes to bloating and feeling guilt. We have to hold ourselves accountable though, because we know even though it is hard, it is worth it. From what I am told, the only way to make maintenance not suck is to stick to it. Like you said, we both know maintenance won't hurt in terms of weight gain. Your weight will change due to increased water retention and food weight, your digestive system may whine for an extended period (hell, mine is annoying as fuck right now), but it *will* go away. And you *will* get better. Hope your day improves.",False,False
