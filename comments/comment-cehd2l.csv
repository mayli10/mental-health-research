The girl he is with is more than just her body... the same way you are.   Next time you want to go for someone, remember you are more than your body and so is everyone else. You are worthy of love, and your body isn’t some kind of prerequisite that has to be perfect before someone notices all the other amazing things about you.   As women we have got to stop reinforcing that guys are with girls solely because of their bodies, &amp; the guys that do act that way don’t deserve attention from any of us anyway.    Stay strong and try to give yourself more credit next time someone catches your eye (as much as I know EDs make all of this insanely easier said than done).",False,False
