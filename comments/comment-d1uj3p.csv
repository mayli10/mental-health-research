Having no distractions (tv, youtube etc...) is important to be mindful and be in the moment.  If you are talking about after eating your unsafe foods try your best to remind yourself to not be so hard on yourself and to tell yourself it is not a big deal. It is ok to feel guilty, let yourself feel what you feel. But remember this will be a long process as it needs to be a habit.  If you have trying even 2 minutes of meditation can help you aware of knowing when you are full and studies have shown you have less appetite and be more aware of your feelings.   Don’t know if this would help but this seemed to work for me. Hope you the best :)",False,False
