But as someone who's suffered medical problems related to low water intake, I just have to beg you to please, please stay hydrated. Not drinking enough can get dangerous fast.   Also, keep in mind that the less you drink, the more your body is going to hold onto the water it does get. So you end up more bloated than you'd be if you were consistently well hydrated.  Personally, I lessen bloating panic by drinking hot herbal tea more than water. The temperature of the tea stops me from drinking too fast, so I freak out less about the volume of liquid I'm ingesting.",False,False
