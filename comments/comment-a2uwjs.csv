Yesterday I sort of had the terrible realization on my way home from class that I‚Äôm doing all the things I said I would never do. I said my ED would never effect my schooling, but I haven‚Äôt studied once this week and have gone to bed almost as soon as I got home and had some serious 10 hour depression sleeps. I said my ED would never effect my job, but honestly I was a wreck yesterday and it was so hard for me to remember simple things, and not get extremely agitated with every inconvenience. I don‚Äôt even have the energy to maintain any friendships or relationships right now, so those are falling apart as well.      I used to be convinced that fasting and restricting helped me more than anything else when it came to focusing, and it was when I functioned the best. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm getting older now, or because I have more responsibilities these days, but I‚Äôm starting to realize that‚Äôs a load of bullshit.      But hey I‚Äôm losing weight so none of that other stuff matters, right üôÉ?",False,False

It‚Äôs also my birthday tomorrow and I‚Äôm trying so hard to just give myself a break....stop thinking about calories and do something good for your brain and body...but it feels so damn impossible. Why was it so hard to get down to 95 (like a week of fasting) but takes one day of eating a meal to skyrocket back to 100? Fml ,False,False

Thank you :) Now that I'm graduating and looking back on my transcript I can see exactly how my tendency to restrict when stressed affected my school performance (LW correlating with lowest drops in GPA, and same with HW, recovery attempts, and increases in GPA). Sleep too. I really regret not taking care of myself even if only just for those crucial exam periods. ",False,False
