I think a huge part of ED’s is feeling like you don’t actually have a problem. I struggle with feeling the same way. Particularly as I’m at a normal (although at the low end of healthy) bmi and it feels like you need to be underweight to ‘prove’ you have an actual issue.    What helped me was a comment on here (or proED?) that told you to picture it like this: if a child (or family member/friend) told you they were experiencing the same issues as yourself, would you think they were a faker? Or not sick? Or dismiss them? I don’t think I would. It helped me to realise I actually have a serious problem- not something I can just brush off as ‘not a big deal’.   I hope this helped a bit!
