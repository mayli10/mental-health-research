But then she’ll ask me my opinions on stuff and I’m like no! Then i get overwhelmed because so many things i dont want to eat are going in the cart and right now i feel obligated to eat some of the dinner she makes! Then I feel like she’s watching me check the calories on a box of food! Its such a deer in the headlight moment sometimes!,False,False
