Someone else mentioned tuna and that’s good, too. If you have space you could also bring some counter safe and low calorie veggies/fruits like tomatoes, cucumbers (they’re ok out of the fridge as long as they’re not sliced and they’re dry), and bell peppers. I like canned artichokes (they have a tab lid sometimes) and I can also eat a whole jar of pickles or palm hearts in a day, so those are good too.   Beef jerky, quest chips",False,False
