But even when I'm eating enough, I hate working out.  Running is the goddamn worst. Exercise fanatics always reference a ""running high"" or an ""exercise high"" and even when they don't, they'll make statements like ""I always hate exercise (relate) but I feel so much better when I'm done!"" (don't relate)  I never get that shit. I hate moving. I'm not crazy either, I study biology, and it makes goddamn sense that a creature would want to conserve its energy. Humans are weirdos who waste energy on purpose. Wild!  But I do love walking. Actually I really love walking lol I guess that's the one exercise I do get enjoyment out of. None of those feelings seem to translate to any other exercise though.",False,False
