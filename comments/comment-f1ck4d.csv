Definitely sounds worth exploring; I’m sorry you’re dealing with that. I am not familiar with the Canadian healthcare system, but the people on r/ADHD ought to be. I would suggest searching and asking there - there have got to be people who were in your situation who were able to receive a diagnosis :)  FWIW - at least in the US, previous diagnoses don’t at all preclude you from an ADHD diagnosis, and I don’t see why they would do so anywhere. I’ve gone through legitimate periods of depression, but I believe the chronic depression I was diagnosed with from ages 13-22 was honestly unchecked ADHD. This part of my narrative helped the social worker diagnose me, and is a common one amongst those diagnosed in adulthood. So hopefully all okay there.",False,False

School I performed fine, and I’m not hyperactive, but it’s the inattention and focus issues. Either lack of focus or hyperfocussing on stuff, there’s no happy medium. I definitely think it factors into my ed because I hyper fixate on it as a distraction when things are bad. But I’ve been diagnosed with depression so I’m not sure if that would affect an adhd diagnosis. I remember looking up adhd in women and I checked off most symptoms.",False,False

I’ve believed forever that my depression/anxiety, which have been very real things on their own, largely started due to my ADHD. I went to a private psychologist who did NOT diagnose with ADHD, in part because I didn’t have parent info, but I knew that felt wrong.  PCP referred me to a social worker. We had two 45-minute interviews. Lots of screenings to rule out major depression, GAD (which I believe I do have), etc. I basically gave her a narrative of my life and that sufficed instead of parental questionnaires. It was hard to be 100% honest but she did diagnose ADHD.  Where do you live?",False,False

I honestly didn't give much thought to the possible repercussions, but I have an amazing psychologist and GP and my record already includes a bipolar I diagnosis - in for a penny, in for a pound.",False,False

I wanted to look into it but I couldn’t secure a diagnosis because they diagnose here based on school records and performance. Because my parents didn’t keep report cards and they never got me checked for anything, so don’t have medical records stating it, they can’t diagnose me with adult ADHD because I didn’t have any symptoms written down from childhood.",False,False

My psych as a teen never diagnosed me with bulimia, despite my very clear-cut bulimia that resulted (at the time) in multiple health issues. She instead dx’d depression, which was true, and adjustment disorder with anxiety, which made me so mad. She told me at the time that having an ED diagnosis would make things a lot harder for me down the road, and that I had a responsibility to her to disclose my history of purging and restricting to future health professionals.   Jump to now - I’m 23 and was recently diagnosed with ADHD-combined. Have been with this doctor for three years and it was she who suggested the ADHD testing. She was able to prescribe Concerta and Wellbutrin because I don’t have a BN diagnosis. I have been working so hard on quitting purging because of how much better I feel on the meds.   I’m with you - isn’t it crazy how many maladaptive behaviors are affected (if not caused) by ADHD? I don’t believe I’d be bulimic without it.",False,False
