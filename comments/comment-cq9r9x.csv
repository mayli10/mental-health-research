Also, while we're at it, fuck bathing suits.   I just got back from trying to shop for one. Spent more time crying in the dressing room than actually shopping for anything. Gave up and came home empty handed.   I fucking hate all this shit right now.",False,False

I adore lulu, but they are SO expensive and Iâ€™m on a teacherâ€™s budget ðŸ˜‚. I love the lulu shorts because they have that piece of fabric in the shorts that covers the inside of the thigh and makes the whole look so much better imo",False,True

Might be worth checking out!  ALSO (and I'm sorry if I am getting too into this - I just spend a lot of time devising how I can get away with not wearing shorts), I really like the lululemon on the fly pants for summer because they are really light and airy, but still *pants*.",False,False

I have always been so self-conscious about my legs (thighs and also because I have really dark hair and it grows back / becomes visible again like 4 hrs after shaving).   The only two pairs of shorts I wear are both slightly oversized on me and I wear them with a belt (they look kind of like [this](https://images.app.goo.gl/JocXXnu72krPpMueA), but even looser and a bit longer). Those two are the only pairs I don't feel wildly self-conscious and gross in. Especially because the oversized fit makes it harder for me to compare my body / weight changes to the shorts size.",False,False
