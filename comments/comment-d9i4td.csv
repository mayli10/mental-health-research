Can you still properly bend your knee at a 25 degree angle? I'm 4'11 and would get knee pain when I was on the top of my seat height.   Also cycling even sitting down can be hard on anyone's knees. I'll feel it if I haven't gone on a long ride in a while too.   I wish you the best. I enjoy going out and biking more and it helps me build more functional strength (I hate that word lol)   I'm not the best at explaining things. If you have any other questions feel free to dm me and I can try to help.,False,False
