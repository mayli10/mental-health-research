BUT if you search the main 1200 sub (this is a positive endorsement) for ""brownies"" you'll find a bunch of recipes because they got really popular a few months back. Like the sub was nothing but brownie recipes and photos and people got annoyed but honestly? I was living. My favourite was the OG banana recipe but I think using pureed pumpkin or even beetroot would probably be lower-cal. Also I think the OG recipe uses real sugar but I use artificial sweetener and drizzle sugar-free maple syrup on top before I bake it. I do use real sugar choc chips though. I like my brownies fudgy and the fruit/veggie puree makes them exactly that, but if you like cakey brownies they probably won't be your thing.  I should make some now...",False,False

Idk why but whenever I look up how many cals are in one calorie and I see 30 I feel like it's a huge shock, like there's just no way there should be that many calories in a bland raw veggie, even though I know they're starchy and have sugar. So for a long time I wouldn't eat them even if it meant I ate something MORE calorific ðŸ™„ But I've come around on them lately because of how long they take me to eat. I can go to town on one like a horse and it keeps me occupied/satisfied for a lil while.  I also love oatmeal and cereal but they're kind of a fear food bc I have to binge on them to feel satisfied. Like a reasonable portion doesn't feel like ""enough"" so it just makes me anxious but if I had what I felt was a good portion it would be like 700cals or something lmao. Weirdly enough overnight oats don't trigger my food anxiety (I guess I need big portions of hot oatmeal because I have nostalgic memories of eating heaping bowls of it) and I can happily eat like 1/4 cup of oats.  Nuts, even though they're so good for you. It just feels like I'd try and add two almonds to a salad and MFP would be like ""that's another 120 calories"". I'm scared to eat even just one. Same for sesame seeds. Once I found out they were so calorie-dense (makes sense, bc they're basically just tiny nuts) I stopped throwing them in as a garnish so liberally...",False,False

I have it in my head that they're just as calorie-dense as processed carbs like rice or pasta but then I actually check and you can have a totally decent amount of potato for a very reasonable amount of cals if you don't drown it in oil. Still lowkey a fear food tho,False,False

I do not understand the appeal behind protein bars. I mean, I can if people are eating them BECAUSE you get a lot of calories for not-very-much food, because I know some people just genuinely don't enjoy eating very much so they want more bang for their buck... but like. I don't think a protein bar has ever replaced a proper dessert for me except maybe once, but still nothing that I don't feel I would be more satisfied by from something else  Like I enjoy them just fine but if I'm gonna eat 150\~ cals in one go I would rather make some sugarfree pumpkin brownies or something for a similar amount of calories at twice the size",False,False
