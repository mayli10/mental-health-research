The bloating could just be part of the eating disorder. When I was underweight and actively restricting or binge purging, I'd eat half an apple or drink a few sips of water and look pregnant. I'm recovered now and even after eating large meals my stomach stays pretty flat. ",False,False

I've posted about this before — it gives me massive anxiety to have these random symptoms without any apparent cause, but I've come to suspect that it has something to do with fluctuating hormone levels... despite any observable signs of a period.   Definitely sucks to feel like even starving your cycle away doesn't necessarily spare you from ""PMS"" issues, but at least I don't have to deal with actual bleeding or cramps.",False,False
