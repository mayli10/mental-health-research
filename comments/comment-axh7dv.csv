Eat around that and you will lose weight. Depending on your GW and CW fast or slow.  Like, i am 66 kg. Thats 66*24= 1584 cals to keep this body while being sedentary. But i want to be 55, so 55*24=1320 cals. On sedentary days i try to eat around 1300 but not above 1500. When i am active i eat around 1500 - 1800. I am losing very slowly, but i am losing. Without being hungry. I think i can call myself a ED faker now. Sigh   I hope this helps. ",False,False
