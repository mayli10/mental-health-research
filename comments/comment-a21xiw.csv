Iâ€™ve had a pretty decent experience with McCafe coffee myself but thereâ€™s always going to be someone who makes a mistake sometime somewhere. Which I understand to a point.   However, what is definitely not okay is not giving milk alternatives when asked. What if you are lactose intolerant? And even so, it does cost extra thus they should be making sure they give the correct milk. ",False,False
