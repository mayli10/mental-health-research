I didnâ€™t do full spectrum though. Apparently vaping instead of drops can have a more instant effect but Iâ€™m not into that. ,False,False

I've taken a little and I've taken full doses.  I feel absolutely nothing, except sometimes I think it's taken the edge off a migraine.  It tastes disgusting, leaves your breath smelling foul (have mints on hand!), and the good stuff is expensive. There's enough anecdotal evidence here and elsewhere to suggest it's worth a try, but there's also enough to suggest not getting your hopes up or buying more than a small sample to start.

I have to say, sleep has also improved. It gives you a calm, relaxed feeling so I can see why people take it for anxiety.  If you decide to try it, go for a full spectrum oil.",False,False

I think I took too much for a first timer (four drops). My SO takes it regularly and has six drops so we thought that would be ok. I did not feel stoned but I had similar physical effects (extreme lethargy and a little nausea) that lasted hours. It had the intended painkilling effect though. I would start with just one or two drops ðŸ˜‰,False,False
