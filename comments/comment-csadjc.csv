Im smack dab in the middle of a healthy weight for my height, and I eat three meals a day. I can't be sick.",False,False

I thought there was no way I had an ED. I don't look sick enough. I'm too fat. There's no way I'd be taken seriously. Never mind the fact that I went through periods of heavy restriction through the years. And now my ED is at its worst. I finally came to terms after seeing my best friend struggle with the same things I do.,False,False
