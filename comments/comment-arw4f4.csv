If not, they'll change their approach to help you.  NOT SAYING YOU'RE EXAGGERATING but even if you were, your therapist has handled this all wrong. They don't sound like a good therapist. You need to find one with more tact and objectivity that will listen to your problems and work with you instead of lobbing doubt at you.  My mom is a therapist and she would never tell a client she thinks they're making things up. No good therapist would. ",False,False

Eating disorders are not related to your actual body weight. And there is even an eating disorder called orthorexia which is an obsession with eating extremely healthy.   If YOU are struggling with feelings of guilt and shame and severe body hate and compulsions to restrict or purge or body check, etc etc then that is an eating disorder.   I mean, I can eat totally normal for a few days too and sometimes do. I actually food-load right before I work out which has a tendency to make me appear as though I'm totally normal. ",False,False

Definitely see someone else. If youâ€™re wanting to work towards recovery or at least harm reduction you shouldnâ€™t feel the need to make those disordered behaviors worse just to feel valid :( ",False,False
