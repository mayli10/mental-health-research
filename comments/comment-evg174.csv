Instead try and eat good portions of things and not feel bad about it,  I want to make this clear- try to not feel bad about the regular portion that you ate because then the only thing that you would wanna do is to binge, of course you can treat yourself sometimes but don‚Äôt let these times turn into a binge.  You are perfectly fine, just try to eat as normally as you can and the most important point don‚Äôt freak out if you ate more then you planned, it happens to everyone and it‚Äôs not as bad as it seems to you after you did it, I promise! Eventually you‚Äôll maintain your weight.   Good luck, I‚Äôm here for any questionüôÉ",False,False

I went a year of hard restriction then got a bf and was happy and started eating pretty normally. But then I fucked my life up and went into a rly dark place and just started binging. That was this last fall. At the start of this year I managed to chill with the binging and now I‚Äôm returning to hard restriction and fasting lol can‚Äôt be normal can I ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  What made me start to stop binging was just seeing how my body changed. I know that‚Äôs not good advice and I wish I could help more but that‚Äôs what slowed me down. Just remember it‚Äôs a process, I binged this last Sunday after a few weeks of not binging. It takes time but if you put effort in I‚Äôm sure you can do it.  Also one of my binge triggers was being bored or alone so maybe try to distract yourself or find things to do if that‚Äôs one of your triggers too :/   Best of luck friend üíï",False,False

I have never experienced delayed/uncontrollable hunger for a long period of time after a restricting phase. But tbh that's one of my biggest fear.,False,False

You're not alone :) I was anorexic and then a binge eater, right now I am recovering. I can't say it's been easy because I have to carry the burden of remnants of both ED's, but I've gotten better at recognizing the symptoms and dealing with them. Both disorders suck, I want a healthy relationship with food and myself.  What has helped me is having a meal plan (went to a dietitian), having a routine (working out, eating schedules), changing my language (using kinder words to myself, trying to be optimistic and accepting of myself, etc), learning to see myself in a different light (not beating myself up for not being UW like I used to be), using strategies like mint gum or any other flavor to placate the urge to binge, not weighing myself as often but also not avoiding the scale at all cost, and most importantly, having the will to change.    Working out has been very important, not only for my weight loss but for my mental health, and I got to admit I don't hate seeing my body now even if I'm not sickly thin like I was when anorexic/like I wanted to be when I was OW due to BED. I now enjoy very much seeing muscle definition, I have even started accepting my stubborn fat, and I love being in good physical condition and challenging myself.   Another important thing has been seeing a therapist, it has helped me a lot. My ED's messed with my life, I'm so done with them. Of course I'm not 'cured' yet, I have horrible days, but I have progressed a lot. It is not impossible to get better. I'm getting better, slowly but getting there :) right now I'm terrified of starting my semester at uni but I now have many tools to deal with my ED.",False,False

In 2016, I was like eating 1/5 of a Boca Veggie Patty and two leafs of kale every day. There were some days I would just not eat and would then proceed to count many curds or cottage cheese I would break my fast with. I ate pickles when I was mostly feeling crazy / hangry.    I walked 10 miles a day for FUN. On the weekends, I ran 5 miles. I didn‚Äôt go to sleep until achieved I reached my mile count on my phone.   I was on r/ProED one night and this redditor who was a bulimic thst I always ignored her videos posted. This time I watched it because it was a slow night. Anyways she was just eating massive amount of food in her car. Like a whole bag of chips, a 2 liter coke, a gallon of ice cream, Taco Bell... like I was fucking DISGUSTED. I was like 1) who the fuck eats that much shit in your car 2) how can you even fucking do that to yourself. She proceeds to go to a KFC restroom to throw everything up. I think anas and mias were definitely a big divide back on that subreddit so sorry for the hate on that redditor. But I thought about that video for a couple of days and I happened to be at the grocery store... and I thought, wtf I haven‚Äôt had ice cream in months... or chips... so I thought I could binge like that girl and throw it all up. BOY WAS I WRONG.   I couldn‚Äôt throw up for shit. But there was something so freeing about just buying anything you wanted from grocery store and eating it. I continued to go on these shopping sprees and kept eating everything once I got home. I always tried to throw up but it would work... so I always told myself, maybe tomorrow I‚Äôll just go back to being Ana. This never happened. I blew up 20lbs fairly easily.   I have never gone to a therapist for Ana, but I decided to go so I could treat my new blown eating disorder, which was BED. That was the most embarrassing. I was set up with a dietician as well.   Some times, I look back to how I was during my Ana stage... maybe if I were never to see that video... maybe my life would be completely different right now.   I‚Äôm currently not happy with my body but I definitely have gotten rid of my impulsive eating habits. I lost that binge eating weight in 2018. However I was so close to my UGW in 2016, I just had a couple of more months to go.    ANA was so easy yet so dangerous. So was BED.   I‚Äôm kinda happy I snapped out of BED after therapy but there are many times my ANA ass has triggered me now :(  What has definitely helped with BED is talk therapy and multi vitamins for some reason.",False,False

The only thing I‚Äôve had luck with is, if I have the mental clarity for it, starting to eat at maintenance the second I feel myself slipping into the ‚Äòbinge‚Äô part of the ‚Äòbinge-restrict cycle‚Äô. Unfortunately it‚Äôs easier said than done.",False,False
