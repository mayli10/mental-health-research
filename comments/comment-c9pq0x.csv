Like seeing progress pics I am so happy for people but it’s so saddening for me because I try so hard and the only way I feel like can lose is if I go back to rly bad old habits :(    I hope we can both get that confidence one day and be happier w our bodies!!,False,True

I also think it can be triggering seeing people who are so proud of their bodies, knowing that you probably never will feel that way about yours.   Like even women with lots of curves flaunting their bodies with so much confidence gets me. I could have the 'perfect' body and never seem as happy and confident as them :/",False,False

The tone I was trying to convey is hard to see through just text :(  It’s more me being sad/bitter bc I know these posts they make are supposed to be helpful in easing people’s anxieties about their weight, and help them work towards health and strength instead of a lower weight, but it doesn’t help me just because, me at my higher weight, I don’t feel that same sense of confidence and happiness w my body.  But I do know it helps other people!! It just sucks that usually these pictures kind of trigger me because they look so much better at a higher weight than I would even if I lost the weight??  And I definitely know it’s not their fault that I feel that way but I was mostly just wondering if anyone else got sad or upset when they saw these posts because of that same reason.   But I 100% understand your point! And definitely don’t want to reinforce that these people with “good” bodies in my eyes can’t experience body dysmorphia!! Sorry if I sounded like I was doing that in any way!",False,True

So many times I've seen people retaliate against women wanting tall men by saying they only want women under 130 lbs. Like you have complete control over your weight despite both height and body composition also contributing to your weight.   I think the idea is to burst the bubble that only women with low weights are thin and that weight looks different with different body composition. And, yes women can be muscular.   But also,  just because they can accept having a higher weight doesn't mean they have don't have any body image issues anymore.   I mean, no one would be surprised if they posted a picture of them gaining fat and being at a higher weight.    I do enjoy pictures of ED recovery or someone who reached a healthier and higher weight or unknown weight and looking much more healthy, happy, and glowing. But, a fitness account isn't free of body dysmorphia, they're just unlinking weight from smaller body.",False,False

Weight = mass x acceleration due to gravity (sound familiar? F = ma, thanks Newton). So for example, 1kg of fat on the moon would weigh less than on earth, but would take up the same amount of space, i.e. have the same mass (1kg) but a lower moon weight. This may be where the misconception is coming in.  As we all know, people like to measure themselves in kilograms in a lot of places, which is - technically - a measure of mass, not weight. Of course, we all say ""I weigh X kg"", though, not ""I have a mass of X kg"", and in fact, because gravity is *fairly* consistent in normal Earth everyday life (unless you're going to space or travelling to the centre of the Earth or whatever), it's generally good enough to assume this for weighing oneself. The ""mass"" you see measured by your scale is actually an approximation of mass based on the force you're exerting on the scale, i.e. your *weight*.  Jump on your scale. Did you change size? No. Did the value on the scale get briefly higher? Yes, because you're exerting more force on the scale when you jump on it. So your mass stayed the same, but your weight briefly read higher. So when we weigh ourselves, we use a bunch of colloquial language. What we're measuring is the downward force we're exerting on the scale, though, which increases as our mass increases, but which isn't the same thing as mass.  I think I got a bit away from fat vs muscle here but yeah, no, muscle weighs more than fat per unit mass.",False,False
