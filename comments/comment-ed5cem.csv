Just make little steps, the hardest is to choose to make them. Its going to be a new decade lets change for the fucking better, for our bodies and mind. our cells die and reborn every 28 days, so you're a new person every month, if you want, that new person won't have an eating disorder.",False,False

I am going to stop today because due to the laxatives, i now bloat and am in extreme pain every time i consume food. Due to continuously going on fasts, i just realized about an hour ago, fine hairs are starting to grow and cover my body to maintain heat, I HAVE HAIRS ALL OVER MY BOOBS. I did all this because i also have a thing in a week, a food trip to be exact, now because of my digestion i doubt i will be able to consume much. I can't tell you what to do, or how to get better, because i am here looking for answers too. but plz be careful, i used to just regret bingeing, now i regret fasting too, and its miserable to doubt all of your own basic living functions.",False,False
