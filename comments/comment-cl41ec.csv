Mostly the reason I use Twitter is because I have friends on there and I want to keep up with them, and it‚Äôs easier for me to vent/rant on there.   Other people who are commenting that people respond with ‚Äústay safe!!!1!1!!1!‚Äù when someone posts that they‚Äôve been fasting for like two years are sooo right lmfao",False,False

I don't really use twitter or tumblr so I don't know what those comms are like, but when the original sub got banhammered I went to take a glance at MPA. Mostly just to see if anyone else had flocked there from reddit. WOW. It was really eye-opening. It was a completely different vibe to anything I'd ever experienced here on Reddit. Here, we might struggle and even compete sometimes, but the overall attitude and atmosphere was one of genuine support and wanting everyone to get better. MPA is a total crab bucket.  That's what made me so mad that the original sub got shut down without any warning, and why this one has to hold its breath in case the same thing happens again. The oblivious admins have NO idea how bad every other support network for EDs is, and how helpful this one is by comparison. It felt like every second day there was a post in the old sub talking about how they were leaving to seek treatment with comments full of people supporting them. Not the vibe at all on other websites, except for a shallow ""stay safe!!!"" disclaimer.  also EDs being rampant on wlw twitter makes me sad :( I feel more comfortable being sexual with women than I do with men because I feel like they know what to expect.",False,False

I can't really explain it, but it kind of felt like digging my own grave in unison with other people, and at the same time each of us helping the other with the shovels.   That sounds super melodramatic and maybe it was just because it was 2 am and I was having a bad week and wanted to trigger myself to (not) deal with it, but yeah those places are Bad. Ngl I still open up those tabs sometimes while listening to my Dark ED Playlist, with every knowledge and intention of hurting myself doing it.",False,False
