Everything else needs to be prepared (I pretty much only eat vegetables and chicken).   I allow myself one cheat meal a week because all week I know I get to eat as much as I want for one meal. (I stick to a relatively safe meal that would normally be an indulgence of calories). Usually I start to get insane, increasing cravings Thursday-Saturday and then Sunday I get my meal.   More and more the meal is becoming a fear, but it helps me cope with how starving and deprived I feel all week. ",False,False

I learned about ""flow"" (that feeling when you get really in the zone focusing on a task to the point where time seems to get away from you) in one of my psychology classes and it's definitely a legit thing. For me it's just all about burning as much time as possible from the time I wake up to the time I can go to sleep doing anything other than eating.",False,False
