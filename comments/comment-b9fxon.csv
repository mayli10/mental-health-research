A similar thing happened to me, I'd recommend recording your co-worker harrasing you. That way if your company tried to fire you to ""sweep things under the rug"" you have evidence of a hostile work environment (be sure to make copies since they could take the originals).

Report it, report it NOW. Do not wait, do not think about it or tell yourself it was just this once. Do it now.   Source: I’m a manager. Myself, along with most of us out there would work ourselves tired and silly if it meant not having a toxic, sexually harassing, POS employee around fucking over the operation of the business, and making people feel victimized. Besides the fact that it’s just wrong and disgusting, the consequences of a sexual harassment lawsuit to a company FAR outweigh the problems with being temporarily “short handed.” Report it.

Definitely talk to her about it and go together to HR if she's had any bad experiences like yours. Strength in numbers!   Also it's total hell being harassed at the place you're obligated to be every single day. I'm sorry youre going through it, I really hope you don't have to deal with him after you've reported this and that you can be comfortable at work. Good luck and stay strong! ...

If you can, talk fully about the impact it is having on you. I know that’s not easy.   A colleague sexually harassed me in my second job. I was 16. He did it to all female colleagues, although mostly the younger girls because he knew we wouldn’t do anything. I eventually left and so did he, but we bumped into each other a few years later. He was working, I was a customer. He immediately started with the same behaviour.   Please do what you can to stop this man from hurting people.
