So I‚Äôm hoping my heart comes through and fucks up so it‚Äôs not one of those situations where you do something and you go to show someone and you can‚Äôt do it again so then you look like an idiot.,False,True

Doctors really can be insensitive sometimes and I'm sorry you seem to have gotten one of the bad ones. I know I'm no medical professional, but from one sufferer to another - your Eating Disorder is no less valid because one ignorant doctor kept calling it a ""diet,"" or whether or not you fit the ""stereotype.""   I really hope you can get some assistance for your heart if it's a concern, and hopefully a better doctor.  Sending good vibes for the rest of your day, take care, friend... ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False

I mean, I hate that you're going through this, too but I'm glad it's not just me. I asked my psychiatrist how I should bring it up and he explained that I wouldn't have to just outright say it immediately. And that I could naturally bring it up in conversation when asks about what's been going on. I kinda have a plan but I'm just so nervous he'll think I'm making it up and they won't find anything. I'm still trying to stop talking myself out of the fact that I'm not making it up since I really don't think it's that bad.   I mean I never had this issue before I recovered and I was restricting for 9 months. I only relapsed halfway through November so I don't see why this issue would come up now.  My appointment is early tomorrow morning so I'll report back on how it went.",False,True

About to. No one knows about my ED except two friends, my family (and this whole sub) but I've always kept it from my doctor because I was invalidated af by my old GP... But my heart rate is the same as yours, high 30's low 40's, and I have a cardiologist appointment at the end of this month after waiting a few months after a bad ECG...   I can't offer any advice without being a hypocrite to say that it's probably worth mentioning your ED if you can, even if you have to do it via journal again, it could really help, and they'll likely understand it's a difficult topic. ""Just skipping a few meals"" wouldn't have an effect so severe on your heart, it takes time and strain, I think.. But either way, you're not alone in this ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False
