There's a reason why most diets fail, they go back to their old habits which lead them to being that weight in the first place.   Its not true in the sense that, its not (usually, exceptions exist.) 100% genetic and unchangable.",False,False

The way to change your set point is to stay at a certain weight for \~5 months,False,False

I think most people maintain whatever weight corresponds to the calorie intake from their hunger cues. These hunger cues are partially natural, partially because of how they were raised and partially because of their current environment.   However, it's totally possible to gain/lose weight intentionally and then maintain that weight unintentionally. I went from the high end of a normal BMI to the low end in less than six months somewhat intentionally a few years ago and was able to maintain that weight without thinking about it. Similarly, people may gain weight as their environment changes but they may not lose it again.",False,False

Especially in normal people who don’t change weight as much they will naturally maintain their weight if gaining a little when they age,False,False
