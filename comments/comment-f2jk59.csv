Even something small like a yogurt or hardboiled egg gets me in the right mindset for making better food choices all day. If I skip breakfast,  or have something higher in carbs, I always end up binging my dinner",False,False

If I ended up below 1200 I would actively force myself to eat more to get over that limit. It completely removed my urge to binge, but it was hard for me to even consider doing it because I kept trying to low restrict or fast to ‚Äúmake up for‚Äù the binge, which only made me binge again fml",False,False

Professional help is usually the ideal, but not always feasible due to financial reasons.   There are a few good free resources you can use alongside therapy that can help you kick the behavior for good.   One of your free options to augment your support and accountability in any case is SMART Recovery, an international non-profit that offers evidence-based peer support education on the self-management of addictive behaviors including binge eating. I am a volunteer facilitator (never a paid position) for SMART and would love to ""see"" you on my FREE Wednesday night online meeting from 7-9PM CST with msandoval at www.smartrecovery.org. If my style doesn't click there are over 40 other online meetings each week.   Check out The FREE Unofficial SMART Recovery Handbook for Disordered Eating, a grassroots project we are working on to make SMART more accessible for people with eating disorders: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vPk9JbgWrGCL4LbjAmVbVW-g2fD5DFBP_P-8ov2F4sY/edit?usp=sharing  YouTube motivation, meditation, and education on ED recovery: https://youtu.be/2iwOKjwCt4A  I'd love to see you on our private, recovery-focused Facebook group at www.facebook.com/groups/rec0veryistheway where we post guided meditations, books, and articles about the process of recovery.   Other free options include 12-step and Recovery Dharma although I do not know as much about those communities as I do SMART. Take care and I hope you find the support you need. Recovery is possible.",False,False

You have to really wanna beat the crap out of whatever disorder you have. First eat enough, without restriction. Nothing will stop you from binging if you are starving. Avoid trigger foods like high sugar or high salt. If you really crave them tho, have them in moderation. Ignoring cravings will lead to binging later on. Eat with friends or family if possible, to imitate their healthy patterns. Brush your teeth right after eating. Try and stick to a regular eating schedule ie. three meals a day at regular hours.  Drink plenty of water.   Take care, you can do this.",False,False

It took me awhile to get used to it but its sososo worth it just to feel like you can eat normal again. I still wasn't eating anywhere near normal sized portions, but for me it was about what I ate and not how much so I allowed myself chocolate and such.",False,False

It puts your body in a famine state which forces you to eat anything you see. I know this is much, much harder than it sounds, but treating your body with care and feeding it plenty of healthy foods when it's hungry is really the only way to quit binging long-term. Health is all about balance. Load up on healthy calories when your body needs it and little treats and sweets in moderation when your heart wants it. You've got this üí™",False,False
