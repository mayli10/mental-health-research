I'm 22 now and I'd been hiding this since I was 17 and it wrecked my relationship with my parents. The best thing I ever did was finally tell my parents. They didnt judge me, they just supported me and check I'm okay. They take care to make sure I feel comfortable around whatever food and situations. I finally feel able to hug them without worrying they'll feel my bones or commenting on my weight loss. It was such a scary step and it's like this big weight is gone from my chest",False,False
