I wonder if she isn‚Äôt completely honest because it‚Äôs hard, but I would respect her so much if she just admitted having a problem. I think it would make a lot of people feel less alone - myself included. It just kind of makes me sad. I do agree that she hides behind her PhD, but honestly I probably would too if I were in her shoes.   I honestly didn‚Äôt realize that watching those videos was a result of my ED, but I love them.",False,False

No girl, it's your years of having a restrictive ED and being at unhealthy BFP. No non-disordered short woman ""naturally"" wants to eat that much food.",False,False

Does she actually say that her eating is disordered in the video?  I think she left a comment on another ED youtuber‚Äôs reaction vid to her ‚Äúall in vid‚Äù which suggested that ‚Äúall in‚Äù was basically code for recovery from restriction.  I feel for her because I guess on one hand she‚Äôd feel pressure to not admit her disordered eating given her fanbase and reputation, but on the other hand it‚Äôs disingenuous esp when she could use her platform for good and raise awareness.",False,False
