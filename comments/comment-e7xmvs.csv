Especially being a male with an ED.  And of course it‚Äôs so easy to look back in hindsight and think DUH but all that matters is that you can be supportive...but if he‚Äôs not vocal about it (I don‚Äôt blame him) that‚Äôs also an awkward situation of ... like not knowing for sure?  He probably feels so out of place and anxious, similar to you.  But CLEARLY these family dynamics are not good for those who aren‚Äôt over the age of 40 lol and have really taken their toll on the younger ppl, you and your cousin.  And it‚Äôs not your job or position to teach your family (who should be loving and supportive) how EDs are a MENTAL illness ... like you don‚Äôt have to be sickly thin.

Out of all the beauty standards, I‚Äôve always felt like Asian females have it worst (not trying to demean other cultures or be problematic).

And do you have the option to sit the holidays out, or arrive separate and not stay as long?    I‚Äôm a white female, and my extended family on my mom‚Äôs side is the traditional white, heterosexual midwestern family - most are slightly overweight.  Which is a lil triggering, but the issue for me is rather ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be anywhere close to their size‚Äù which kind of triggers some body dysmorphia, and I want them to look at me like I‚Äôm a skinny lil betch.
