Recovering from this ED without losing weight first  \&gt;  you can get there by eating healthier and more weight loss appropriate foods day in and day out  Sure, \*theoretically\*. That's what most people do. But the way my ED has been working is that I can't seem to work towards any goal of weight loss without sabotaging myself and falling back into heavy restriction. Or obsessing over how to always eat at exactly my calorie minimum  for the day and no more than that. Or becoming obsessed with health and nutritional value to the point where eating is some kind of science experiment chore that I have to drudge through every day. All of those things lead to me eventually snapping and binging until I've gained back the weight I've lost.  I guess the analogy that comes to mind is recovery from alcoholism. Most people can go into a bar as a designated driver, be surrounded by alcohol, maybe even be tempted to drink, but in the end they'll still order a coke and be fine. For a decent number of people who are new to sobriety and recovering from alcoholism, when they try to go to a bar and order a coke they snap. They know the right thing to do but the temptation is too strong. Right now I just need to stay out of bars.",False,True

I'm not really sure I understood your question, but I imagine it must be really tough going through that. You really don't need to starve or even diet to get down to a healthy BMI, it's all about food ""swaps"" and smart choices, like changing long term habits. They will not make you lose weight as fast, and there's where patience comes in (I am seriously lacking...). But I just want you to know, that even if you can't eat junk food and be in the healthy weight range, you can get there by eating healthier and more weight loss approperiate foods day in and day out. It's boring in the beginning but works. You definitely don't have to restrict or starve.  I know this is an ED sub, not a weight loss one, and feel totally free to disregard this message if you don't think it's helping!",False,False
