Like I see people whose legs I know are realistically bigger than mine but??? I always think they look way smaller?? I think it may be because we see our legs from a higher point of view and so they always seem huge. Or maybe because it is the one thing we're fixated on. Like when I see pictures of myself, my eyes go straight to my legs but I wouldn't even think of looking at my upper body because in my mind ""it's skinny enough"". I don't know but ugh it's frustrating",False,False
