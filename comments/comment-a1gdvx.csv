I don't think these are actual manic episodes (though of course only a professional could tell), since I'm still a tired sad little baby as usual. But I have been getting more wrapped up in my ED because I feel so insecure about everything in my life :/",False,True

I don't want this to come across as a diagnosis, but EDs often show up comorbid with other mental illness. Some of this sounds an awful lot like a manic episode. I realize that you seem to know some of these ideas are far fetched (making 15000 on etsy; I've totally been there)  and its good that you are able to recognize that on some level.   I really don't want you to feel like I'm trying to diagnose you, but the more you understand about different symptoms the better you can control them so your ED doesn't have as easy of a time controlling you-if that makes any sense.",False,False
