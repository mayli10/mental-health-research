I have literally dislocated my knee and kept my cool the whole time and joked with the ambulance while I was getting medical attention, but the moment I try and fast forget it. My body suddenly acts like I am the most emaciated malnourished individual in the history of life. No food? Body wants to pass out and shake like a leaf! Any other pain? MORE PLS. HIT ME HARDER. I digress.",False,False

The first time I broke a bone my mom didn't believe me because of how calm I was. It was a small bone, just a finger, but the doctor did say that it was one of the worst breaks she has seen on a finger. I was only in grade 8 at the time. I don't imagine most people would be crying over a broken finger by that age, but I can't imagine they would be calm either. I do often do the dishes with water that's a bit too hot. Even if it hurts as long as I know it isn't hot enough to damage my skin it doesn't bother me.  I have to agree with you. Pain is much easier to ignore than being hungry. It makes sense too. Pain is just your body's way of identifying danger. If you know that you're not in danger it's easy to ignore. Hunger is different because it identifies a need. You're psychologically wired to deal with your needs as soon as possible when they reach a point where starvation, dehydration, tiredness, et cetera become too much and not dealing with them will soon have consequences. Sure, maybe losing weight won't actually be bad, butnthat's because we live in a society with plentiful resources that are easy to obtain. If you lived in the wild it would be bad to lose weight. Wild animals don't get overweight. Weight loss in the wild puts animals at risk of becoming emaciated. The human body hasn't really evolved for post-industrial life yet. Maybe if we eventually get resource-sharing right and society flourishes we can see changes in a few hundred or a few thousand years, but for our lifetime our bodies will continue to behave in this way.",False,False
