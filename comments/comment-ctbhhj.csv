I was actually thinking this the other day - that yes I can try to fix the ED behaviour but actually I need to resolve the root of it and what started the spiral into disordered eating into the first place, otherwise I'll never actually be able to 100% recover.  Do the same people in your ED treatment team (e.g. psychiatrist) be the same person that helps regarding the ADHD, stress and anxiety root part of the ED? Or do you require separate teams? Jw how I should go about reaching out for help.",False,False

Thank you for the tips! I'll try implementing some of them! I like the idea of keeping a mood dairy as I feel like I'm a completely different person before and after a binge/purge session,False,False

That being said i had adhd which contributed to my ED by causing a ton of stress so once I was medicated and learned strategies for that it was easier. Even when I go off my meds (sometimes I take breaks if I’m not in school or work) I have formed new habits that i follow.  I think the key thing is to keep reenforcing positive new habits and thoughts. What you think is very important because if you think negative things positive habits will not stick.,False,True

I always new my bulimia was heavily linked to stress/anxiety but i struggled to find the main cause of that stress. I was diagnosed with adhd young but never received treatment because i did well in school so I thought I didn’t need it.  Well, boy was I ever wrong. My adhd made me suck at time management, focus, organization, and made me really impulsive. This contributed to high levels of stress and anxiety. I would be stressed 24/7 and act on Ed behaviours through impulse and habit.  Once I recieved treatment for ADHD I found it a lot easier to focus on recovering from my ED.   Some tips:  -keep a food diary and a mood/feelings diary (being aware of your thought process before / after an Ed behaviour is key) -try to follow a meal plan -get support from family to distract you, because your body will crave it at first -keep busy (this could mean taking u new hobby, going back to school part time, taking a part time job, spending more time with family) If you are busy you will have less time to use Ed behaviours  -work on saying positive things about yourself / your body",False,True

I had treatment for my ED (therapy, nutritionist, doctor, psychiatrist) but it wasn’t until I finally received treatment for my other underlying issues did i really start to change. I realized that my adhd was a huge factor in my ED because it caused me so much stress. There is some research saying adhd and bulimia are linked. After I received treatment for that, I found recovery a lot easier.   I would recommend figuring out what is a root cause of you using unhealthy ED behaviours to cope. Maybe it’s depression, anxiety, abuse, sexual assault, etc. NGL it took me 5 years to figure out adhd was a major reason I was failing to recover. But once I learned how to deal with that I had much less stress, almost no anxiety, and it was much easier to focus on recovery from my ED",False,True

My doctor used that term with me because I had been suffering for over 3 years.   Honestly, the way the brain works, the longer you have an ED the harder it will be to recover. But that being said it is possible with treatment and hard work. You need to form new habits and learn new ways to cope. This will create new pathways in your brain.",False,True

I'm trying to take advantage of the increased neuroplasticity but am actually struggling a ton.. Then I get worried that I'm reinforcing negative neural pathways. For you was it just a matter of keeping on going and trying until it gradually got easier?,False,False
