I have an obsessive tendency to need to be told I look sickly skinny in order for me to somewhat believe it. I don't want to be told I'm skinny, especially in a positive way. I just want to live my life and feel like I'm not being watched and that if I gain any weight- the number one thing I DON'T want to hear is ""you look healthier!"" like NOPE. Just don't comment on how I look, kthnx.",False,False
