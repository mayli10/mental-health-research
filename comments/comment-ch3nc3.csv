At the -very least- try to get in a lot more salt and electrolytes!  I've also passed out in the shower. I woke up laying down in the shower with the curtain pulled down around me and I totally thought I had just fallen asleep in a bath. I was really irritated I fell asleep until I finally realized the curtain was pulled down and the shower was so, so clearly i had been standing before.",False,False

I remember before it happened a really weird sound, almost like buzzing - I think the closest thing I could compare it to was like one note of dial up internet just super friggin loud lol  It‚Äôs scary but it was kind of validating :/",False,False
