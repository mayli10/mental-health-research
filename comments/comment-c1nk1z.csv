And I hope you feel better soon :(  If it helps at all, objectively speaking the butter on a piece of toast isn't going to really affect your body at all, especially in the grand scheme of things. And butter does have nutritional value! And the scrambled egg and wholewheat toast sound really healthy and good for you, and I hope you got to enjoy that at least a little.   I know things are hared :( But it's going to be okay. It really is. Stay strong love.",False,False
