I straight up told my mother, sister, and sister in law that I used to restrict to 300 calories a day and if I went over, I’d immediately purge it and even dropped out of college because I was skipping class to go to the gym. They just went “oh” and went back to looking at their phones. Now this time around after relapsing, I know not to tell them so I don’t feel disappointed. But I suppose it’s good encouragement to continue since if I told them that I haven’t eaten in 3 days, they’d probably just say “good for you! I wish I could do  that!” But if I LOOKED like I had an eating disorder, it would be different.",False,False
