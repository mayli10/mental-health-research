If I eat enough to stop my hunger, for some reason it's likely to trigger a binge. I think because of BED, I only really register two feelings - hungry or full. So if I'm not hungry, but I'm also not full, it's like I get this frenzied urge to keep going until I AM full, because If I'm eating then I'm eating until I'm bursting and THAT'S when I know to stop! I still have room that needs to be filled! Hunger is way easier for me to ignore than that impulse.  But on the other hand, if I eat just enough that I'm still a bit hungry, it makes the hunger feel so much worse than before. IDK if it's all in my head (I mentally want to eat more and it makes me think I'm hungrier to try and make me) or if there's an actual phsyical component to it (maybe the digestion?). But in my mind I call this the 24 hour effect, because if I can ride it out for the rest of the day then as soon as I wake up, it's like it's way easier to deal with. I still feel hungry but it's just another sensation as opposed to an urge.",False,False
