Sorry I broke a rule.",False,True

Even if you don't name the subreddit, we need to skirt away from that drama to avoid this subreddit being banned again.",False,False

Everything you said is true.   &gt; It also seems to push the oh you're overweight and you lose weight despite the measures being extreme? Good for you! agenda.  ""Seems"" isn't even necessary here. They sure fucking do.  You can't save people from themselves. Aren't we living proof of that?  Recognize them for what they are, then just...let them make their own mistakes.  Don't take their existence too personally and start wondering whether the standards for disorder are too strict; there are online communities that drink pee because they think it's medicinal. Not satire. Not one random person with a terrible idea. Pee medicine. I shit you not. People will do some dangerous, gross shit online if there's a group of people willing to applaud it.  I used to be extremely squicked by pro-anorexia shit, but man, at least it *admitted* what it was.",False,False

Either they will rebound, switch to healthy measures to maintain, or fall into the same steaming pile of shit we call home.  And the people with active EDs putting a positive spin on their warped relationships with food and body? You know no amount of positive reinforcement, denial, or public validation will cure this kind of self-hatred.   I do feel sorry when their denial and engagement likely encourages ED behaviors in non-ED communities tho. I wish the mods would wise up, call that shit out for what it is, and remove comments/ban users who do that.",False,False
