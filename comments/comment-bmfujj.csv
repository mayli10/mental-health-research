Almost? And also totally isolating lmao.... idk my feelings about it are definitely fucked up so I understand,False,False
emwz3xf,t3_bmfujj,t3_bmfujj,thatwasprettydumb,1,2019-05-09 07:47:44,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/bmfujj/odd/emwz3xf/,"This is one of the things I hate most about my ed!! I'll be walking around (after just thinking about how gross and fat I am while getting dressed) and then see people who are objectively bigger or eating a big/unhealthy lunch, just minding their own business, probably great people enjoying their lives, and get this weird sense of superiority.  But they say it's your second thought that counts, and I'll immediately realize and kind of have to say in my head 'no, they're being normal, you're being a bitch rn' to sort of try and correct my thoughts.",False,False
emwsarr,t3_bmfujj,t3_bmfujj,zioioio,1,2019-05-09 06:22:35,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/bmfujj/odd/emwsarr/,Lol yeah I feel better when I see others eating and I calculate the calories they ate and make myself feel better,False,False

I was really ashamed admitting it, and they ended up sending me to a higher level center after that.",False,False

In some sense, I feel like Im better than people because all the 'normal' people HAVE to eat. They get hangry (angry when hungry) and I just scoff.   ""lol, you're upset you havent eaten all day.. I haven't eaten all week.""  even though I spent last night crying about how fat my legs are, I also am arrogant about how much skinnier my legs are than all the girls I walk past by.  But I am bulimic now, so its the complete opposite. I feel like everyone else; weak, because I can't moderate my portion control. as well as, a cheater, because rather than gaining weight from the calories, I purge it all so I don't face the consequences of overeating.",False,False
