I felt a bit of frisson reading this coz it reminded me a bit of myself and the way I deal with shit and supposed ‚Äúsetbacks‚Äù in my life. Anyway, it‚Äôs obvs you‚Äôre gonna be just fine, stay conquering üòÅüî•",False,False

It hurts so fucking bad.  I've been doing a terrible job of following my own advice, but stumbling upon this on accident has made me realize this is what I need to do. If MissNietzsche yesterday morning was strong enough to know this, MissNietzsche tonight is too.  I'm going to actually get some sleep tonight. Scrub off this sweaty grime in the shower tomorrow. Clean my room. Study and cram for o-chem. And try to get three meals in.  ""That which does not kill us makes us stronger."" -Nietzsche  If I can get over my biggest fear that I've had for the past half a decade or so, I'm going to be fucking invincible. My only weak point was for my SO, and I wanted to keep it that way, but I realize now that I must carry many masculine traits if I am to be happy now. It sucks living in a female's biological body, but I guess that must mean that I must conquer both the feminine and masculine dichotomies then.  I must be strong. I've learned a lot the past couple years. Pain is temporary. I'll live, and I will make this the most meaningful fucking life that even cosmic nihilism will have to cede to me.",False,False

I don't mean in an unhealthy way. I don't mean creating cognitive distortions and trying to cope with the pain with food or lack of food and drowning out the feelings. I mean allowing your body and mind to experience pure loss and grief, and after that, allowing yourself to process and accept those feelings by doing healthy things you genuinely enjoy.",False,False

I‚Äôm really sorry you‚Äôre in this rut right now, but there‚Äôs no magic step that will suddenly cure you. It‚Äôs something you have to do for yourself. A strong support system in your daily life will help, but that requires you to put faith and trust into people and yourself. You are capable of doing this, but if you can‚Äôt do it on your own (which is okay), you really should seek out professional help. If it sounds condescending, I‚Äôm sorry, but it really is the answer you‚Äôre looking for. ",False,False

This just happened to me a week ago and the only thing I could really do was make sure I wasn‚Äôt alone, you have to hit people up constantly and figure out for yourself that you‚Äôre worth more than what your boyfriend thinks of you.
