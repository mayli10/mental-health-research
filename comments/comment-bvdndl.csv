You're absolutely right, this isn't fair, and she doesn't deserve to go through something so devastating.  It sounds like you're doing your best to help and to support your sisters.  I hope you find time to take care of yourself while taking care of them &lt;3 I also hope you aren't too hard on yourself for gaining some weight while with your family. It sounds like they're trying to look out for you, too, even if it doesn't translate well.",False,False

There’s really no right way to grieve I think - so whatever and however you feel today and in the days to come really is ok. &lt;3 We just ride the waves of emotion and try to be present as best we can for the people we love.,False,False
