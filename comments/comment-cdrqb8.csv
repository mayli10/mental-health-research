I've probably been averaging somewhere between 1400-1800 this past week? And it'll probably be different this upcoming week, ED voice is very worked up with me over ""letting myself go"" the past few days. It's given me so much more life and creative energy to have more calories, though. I kind of want to fight to keep my calories up around maintenance (which for me is 1500-1700) just so I can enjoy life like this and see the world with fresh eyes the way I only can when I have a decent amount of food backing me. Best of luck to you fighting to up your average as well!",False,True

Iâ€™ve tried with 1,900 but I canâ€™t maintain that (or anything higher or power than 1,400calories) I feel like my body will only allow myself to sustain of my current average. I just canâ€™t handle anything out of that range.  What have you been averaging? (If you know)",False,False
