And yeah I agree that there are genetic factors that play into how dominant the hedonic system is in the eating process and perception of ""appetite"" which ultimately affects body weight way more than the biological factors (leptin sensitivity, etc) and the obesity epidemic is evidence of this (IMO).",False,False

But that also means that the part where you don't retain the weight will look skinny, try and wear clothes that make those features stand out while hiding the ones you don't like. E.g. being a more pear shape myself i hide my legs in loose pants but try to show my upperbody a little more. For you doing the opposite would probably help you feel a little better about yourself maybe? Like stuff away all that you hate under lots of layers and look at the part that you find ok. This of course on days where you're feeling somewhat up for it.  &amp;#x200B;  Not that this is super sane advice the obvious should be telling you that you can flaunt your body all day every day in any way because you look great but I think a lot of us are indeed very uncomfortable with how we look like so maybe giving you some advice that's actually manageable and that might actually make you feel a little better about your body can help.",False,False

It's not that apples can't be light because that's bs, it more that even when I was underweight I didn't \*look\* skinny because of my wide hips, ribcage and 'compressed' torso.  Do I think people with this shape can be skinny? Yes, of course we can! Even if it is only to an extent I'll bloody take it. It's taken me around six years to admit to myself I'll never have the body of an overworked ballet dancer. I have to do so much cardio and tone work to see anything worthwhile on my stomach (RIP) and no matter what my bone structure will always be the same so at best I can look like a 'skinny' hourglass instead of a barrel.

My cousin and her family are all overweight and their lives revolve around food (so does mine but I'm not as large because I have to make a conscious effort to deprive myself) and their eating habits aren't great. I think it has to do with their reward systems (?). I remember running my raw ancestrydna data through promethease and finding a gene that suggested higher risk for binge eating due to a decreased pleasure response to food.
