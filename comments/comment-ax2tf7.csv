How I fill my plate, what is left when I'm done.  * I hate feeling like I have to prove something when I eat around other people. Like I have to match their pace or they'll think I'm anorexic. * I hate it when people check me out. Professors, friends, my therapist, a Rabbi. It's not sexual but it makes me *uncomfortable*. Running their eyes up and down my body. Commenting about it to me or behind my back. It happens so often. * I don't enjoy it when people try to start a conversation about calories around me when they never did before. ""This drink has 5 calories, you should try some."" ""This cookie probably has so many calories."" They don't have to prove anything to me. * I hate that eating above my TDEE means that I'm going to gain weight and *everyone* is going to notice the change. It's my private struggle.  * Most people have an opinion about my body type. I'm ""too skinny"" and I look unhealthy, they wish they looked like me. My body is not a comment on yours!",False,False

You're taking the process is steps that you can handle, and that is a lot more manageable and less prone to relapses. In time, you'll be able to tackle more. I like your method :) ",False,False

Having given ~full recovery~ my all many times over and repeatedly failing, I'm having some success with shifting my perspective away from that and towards ""how do I make this minimally intrusive in my life,"" which is often quite different.   If I decide it will be less of a hassle to not eat rather than expend the mental energy required to feed myself, I don't. If I need the energy more than I need the lower anxiety, I eat. I don't challenge fear foods and a lot of my grocery shopping is a game of what foods have the most calories by volume so that I can get enough while consuming the smallest physical amount of food possible.   I don't think any of this is what recovering looks like, but minimizing the space this takes up so I can focus on other things has felt a hell of a lot more freeing than treatment centers and Maudsley and group therapy for body image ever has.

I like the mind set of managing vs recovering. Managing makes it a daily process vs recovering seems like some magic barrier you have to burst through and everything will be ok.   ,False,False

Like you'll go from counting every calorie to just eating whatever. I'm sure some people can do that somehow but most won't.   Then people see you are attempting to 'recover' and expect it to happen overnight too.... Expect your weight to go to 'normal' quickly. What they don't get is that you need a lot of time and  self love and that shit is hard.,False,False

The hyper fixation on weight / ed related things is too intense and I think I’m able to manage it but no one seems to want to understand that ,False,False
