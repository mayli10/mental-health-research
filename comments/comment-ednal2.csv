How heavy it is. I started recovery on my own a few weeks ago and this was the first thing I wanted to try out. So I've been binging a lot and then eating normally. What I found out after a lot of experimenting is that one day of binging won't ruin you progress. You don't even have to restrict heavy to come back to your normal weight. If you just pretend like the binge never happened and continue to eat like you always do your body will go back on track extremely fast without gaining weight. Often I actually lost a lot of weight two to three days after a binge. Idk.",False,False
