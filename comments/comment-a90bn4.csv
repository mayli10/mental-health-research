However, with most mental health conditions, many people are really unaware of the realities of struggling with them. They don‚Äôt know that they can be debilitating and take ages to work through (and some people never do). Some people think EDs are choices (even some people with EDs). In such cases I turn my irritation into a teachable moment to educate someone about eating disorders and mental health in general.   When it‚Äôs someone who should know better I rage though. 100%  You‚Äôre so strong for telling your aunt! Hope the holiday season is going well for you x",False,False
