The disorder makes you think differently, it's part of how it perpetuates itself. Please, can't stress enough, see a therapist if you aren't already. I also opted to see a dietitian that specializes in eating disorders. Both were very helpful. I also watched lots and lots of Youtube videos every single day from Erik the Electric (he has anorexia recovery videos on his main channel and podcasts on his second channel, Electric Talks), Alice Olivia, What Mia Did Next, Follow the Intuition, and many others. I had to hammer it into my head. And then I really needed those resources even more during recovery which is the hardest part of the process, or at least it was for me due to the weight regain and extreme hunger. It was all worth it though, I can say that with certainty.",False,False

It goes to show how incomprehensible it all is to someone who is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù in these areas. I REALLY relate to the fact that you lost a large amount of weight. (Warning, I am going to mention numbers.) I have gone from 235 to 111 @ 5‚Äô7 and my experiences with an ED are just so different than a lot of other people because of that. It‚Äôs hard to find people to relate to because not everyone has this crazy high starting number, and now deals with the weight they‚Äôre at now. Our experiences are different, our family members reactions are different, the physical changes are different (idk if you deal with loose skin at all but there‚Äôs one main area I feel separated from everyone on), etc. ",False,True

I guess everyone does adjust to what you look like no matter how shocking of a change it initially is, which sucks for us because that‚Äôs what the ED part of our minds want. Like in a way, I want everyone to leave me alone again and quit showing concern so I can keep doing this for however long I want to. ",False,True

You do not need to look a certain way or be a certain weight to have an eating disorder. I was diagnosed with AN at a normal BMI.  &amp;#x200B;  Lots of people had no clue I was struggling even while I was at my worst. Once I put clothes on, other than my neck looking thin and my face looking a little gaunt, you couldn't tell anything was wrong. The only people who ever commented on my weight were people that saw me in fitness gear working out like my trainers, my mom, or a few other people who knew me well. Really, it's only now that I've put on weight that I can look back and see very clearly that I was far from physically healthy. Remember, this is a mental illness. Even though I seemed outwardly healthy (""he eats salads and exercises all the time! he must be healthy!""), inside, there were days I wished I was dead. 1 in 5 who die from AN die from suicide. I can definitely understand why this is. At my worst, I wasn't even thinking about hunger or food anymore, I was thinking about how much I hated my body and myself, how little my life meant, and how much I wished I was dead.  &amp;#x200B;  So my message to you is this: Get help. Run. Run away from this illness like your life depends on it, because you won't truly live again until you decide to. I was lucky, I reached a fork in the road, God enabled me to make the right decision, and now I'm in a place I never could have dreamed of being. Even though I still struggle every day, I am more ""alive"" now that I have been in years.",False,False

I‚Äôm still in a healthy weight range despite losing almost 60 pounds in a very short period of time. My best friend, who I told because I wanted to try to get a handle on it before it got worse said (when I told her how obsessive I was about food/tracking) ‚Äú just stop thinking about it‚Äù.

My doctor condoned my shit at a 17.4 BMI because I told him I wasn‚Äôt trying to lose weight [lie]. My husband told me this week that I‚Äôm looking better, ‚Äòfit as hell‚Äô and just fine even though I‚Äôm maintaining at 16.9 BMI the last several months. He used to have mild concern. It wears off, I guess. We all get used to the body as it appears. My heart palps and edema disagree, I‚Äôm sure. Nobody knows shit. You take care of yourself‚Äîthat‚Äôs your job.
