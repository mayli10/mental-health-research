Currently a lot of very unhealthy people actually believe they are being healthy because of a false narrative being pushed by silent sufferers of eating disorders who happen to have a platform where people are always asking them how they stay so thin and beautiful. There are also people suffering who don't have that and they want to get better, but they can't do so without everybody looking down on them and to those people it's worse to be pitied or disrespected than it is to suffer with an eating disorder.",False,False

So much of what is lacking in treatment for EDs is due to the backwards stereotypes and overall reduction/oversimplification of people who suffer from EDs.   So many of us want to get help, but our loved ones (and unfortunately so many doctors) fail to see us for who we are and what we're going through. Instead they try to treat the stereotypical and inaccurate version of an eating-disordered person, which is built by years of taboos and failure to authentically discuss the topic.  I personally believe that taboos around EDs are the reason so many of us relapse or give up on seeking treatment in the first place. I really hope someday we can move past that.",False,False
