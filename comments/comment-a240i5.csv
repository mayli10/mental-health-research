I was on 40mg of prozac but didnt help much after a certain point with the depression. Just kept me from being suicidal. Now I take 150 of effexor (used to take 300) and 5mg of abilify which my doc says is more like 2mg for me.   Prozac did nothing to stop my bingeing. ,False,False

I've always struggled with psychiatric dosing as someone who gets all the weird side effects even before reaching conventional therapeutic doses of meds and it's such a bummer.  I've gotten everything from lactation to muscle spasms to urine retention at starting doses of medications and it's made treating my depression really difficult. I think if I was a true undermetabolizer I'd feel some therapeutic effects at low doses but I tend to just feel side effects so I think my body is just weird.",False,False

The dose for b/p is 3x the dose as for treating depression. I found it very heavy and it made me sleepy all the time, so for that reason I cut down, but I didnâ€™t completely stop. Hope it works for you though, good luck!",False,False

I have taken between 80 and 120mg. At 120mg, all urges disappear.  For other medications metabolized the via the same pathway, I frequently need higher than the FDA approved amounts (off-label) so YMMV.   On the other hand, you might undermetabolize so you feel the effects stronger and don't even need 40mg. It really depends on the person. I guess I shouldn't have mentioned needing a high dose since it might not be universal experience.",False,False
