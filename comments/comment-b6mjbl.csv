Like, I literally want to get back up to a healthy weight and people are out there pretending they would be happy struggling like I do. It doesn't seem to matter that when I do eat enough to gain I just get horrible abdominal cramps, super bloated, and then take days or weeks to fully recover. I don't even gain weight from it. My body just gets rid of any excess food. I was weighed recently while wearing clothes that were kind of heavy and I was only two pounds heavier than I was last time I measured my weight without anything on. I had literally been overeating for weeks up until that point trying to gain hoping I could just go back to eating less after and feel healthier, but I went through all that and it was just a wasted effort. Wasted money too. It just made me sick. If I tried talking about it anywhere else people would just say they wish they could eat whatever they want and not gain anything like I do. But that's not the point. I can't eat at all without getting physically sick and yet I need to eat more to avoid being physically sick because I'm underweight. I basically have to choose between horrible migraines and lethargy or intense pain that makes it impossible to stand for more than a few minutes, but nobody else cares about that. And that's not even everything. Either way I also have to put up with immune suppression which means I get sick a lot and I can't even take one of my medications sometimes because it's an intramuscular injection which means without enough muscle on my body it's extremely painful to take (which I say as somebody with a high pain tolerance) and the medication sometimes just ends up oozing out of the injection site before I can even cover it up with a band-aid. It's like if you're thin none of your problems matter. Or that if you're thin it's somehow okay to mock you for your body ""*because you have it so much easier*"". Like, fuck all that noise. It's not okay to mock anybody and our problems are just as real as anybody else's.",False,False

They do know that I'm fat (not even gonna dress it up) and I have a handful of girlfriends that range from extra-plus to (naturally) extra-petite. A friend of mine from early high school is positively tiny and is constantly shit on for existing.  I am so loud and so quick to defend her, you'd think she was my lover. I adore her because she's am amazing person with the biggest heart of gold, and I hate when people nag at her because of her body under the banner of being ""body positive"" and claim their words don't hurt because her body is ""the ideal"".  The other day she posted that she's going to wear what she wants this summer, *just like everyone else has the right to*, and the rest of the world can kick rocks and keep their opinions to themselves.  Automatically, one of her bigger friends (not someone I know personally) started in on her about how she's not allowed to claim that space because she's thin, nobody's nagging at her, etc. Like her experiences are invalid because she's petite.  Fuck outta here with that.",False,False

You're entitled to want a specific look and to work on getting there.     The issue is celebrating getting there via an unhealthy means. It's not okay to binge or starve, and glorifying an eating disorder is absolutely going to draw criticisms, especially when you do it in a public setting.  You go out there and get your dream body. Just do it in a healthy way! ",False,False

Some of them will keep quiet and move along, while others will state their opinions aggressively as facts.   Controlling what other people do or think is impossible. The people who try either get frustrated and quit, or head to an extreme like declaring a national emergency to build a border wall.   I recommend relaxing about it. Remember that you are the most qualified person for deciding what is best for you. Take the nuggets of info people spout and see if it holds true for your worldview and don’t be afraid to adapt and change if they are saying truth, or to completely disregard their opinion if it’s poison.
