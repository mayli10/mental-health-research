Normally I wouldn’t be horribly terrified, but my parents are doing a kitchen reno, which means we have a rinky dink makeshift kitchen where you can’t really cook family meals. Which means we’re going to be ordering takeout and going out for dinners like every single day and it’s fucking terrifying. I already purged the first meal I had last night :(  Here’s to the struggle of surviving family life with a secret ED",False,False

My plan: to set rules for myself before I even set foot in the house.       Like not even touching the peanut butter (which I don't allow in my own apt) so that I don't get the ""taste"" for it and eat it all. My thinking is that if I never even allow myself one bite, I'll be safe for the week home.      Another is to only eat under or at maintenance since I won't have access to my gym. No extra snacks, regular meal which I will make since I'm vegan so I can make my safe meals. ",False,False

Break is the reason my weight has bounced around the 130s for the past 2 years ugh :( this year I’m trying to be more mindful when I eat, trying to think about how the food will make me feel after I eat it. Also I have a job so that helps w the boredom eating. Good luck to us both! ",False,False

I'm going home in two days and I have no fucking idea how I'm going to handle all the food. I'm mentally preparing for a two week b/p marathon even though I *really* don't want that to happen. I just have no idea what to do  Here's to hoping we'll get through the holidays! ,False,False
