My last binge was on protein bars and I couldn’t purge much of them either; they’re so dense! :(   That could be a LOt of fiber in addition to all the protein, so be sure to drink as much as possible—and if you can, maybe don’t weigh yourself until after you’ve pooped and stuff and can be sure you’re not retaining water and all that. Remember that u need to eat ~3500 cals above your TDEE to gain a single whole lb of actual fat, which I doubt happened with those protein bars!!! It’s gonna be okay 💛💛",False,False

I don’t purge and those little bastards are like tiny little calorific candy bars. I’ve always favored Luna bars. I could eat ten of those back to back and then I’d feel the need to restrict for days. Good luck! ☹️💕,False,False
