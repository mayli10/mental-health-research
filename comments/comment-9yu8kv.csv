So not all bad.,False,False

To be fair, that's more than normal, which is concerning. BUT, for the first time I've been keeping track of when I binge and try to figure out why. I think a combination of work stress and dealing with a delusional ex-partner has left me feeling emotionally fatigued.  I had a very good date yesterday, so here hoping that keeps me eating like a normal person.",False,False
