Lost over the winter and that summer everyone noticed. It sucked and idk if I was just immature at the time but I felt really hurt because there were a bunch of other girls in my cross country friends group that were way skinnier that just seemed to be feigning concern because they had ""always been that skinny naturally"" and I had lost weight. I was only like a 20 bmi. I was livid and it made me end those friendships because I felt like they just were angry at losing the chubby girl in the friend group and didn't have someone to make make them look skinny.   That being said I think it's the weight change that freaks people out. If you maintain for a while, they will just get used to it. I'm sorry you gave to go through this and I feel for you.",False,False

Unless you lose more weight, that is. But also, remember that they’re concerned and this is coming from a place of care. Likely, they asked your friend to talk to you so they wouldn’t have to ambush you :)   Good luck!",False,False

Honestly you're not a nutcase. They just care about you, which is really sweet. If you stick by what you said to your friend and just get your head down and focus on your work, they'll soon do the same.",False,False

It’s like I want people to see me as skinny, but I don’t want them to notice the change.  Honestly I preferred when people were concerned. The positive feedback I got from others felt really invalidating because of all the pain I’d put myself through.",False,False
