It wasn’t even that good, so it wasn’t worth it and there’s no need to have a binge like that ever again.” But then a few days later, bam! a binge thought will pop up and here we go again",False,False

I’ll get an idea for a binge that sounds so incredibly good and I make/get all this food but when I start eating it, it doesn’t hit the spot/live up to the fantasy. (But I still usually end up eating all of it because it’s there.)",False,False

That most of the dopamine you get from eating is on anticipation of the food, not from actually eating it. Whenever I'm fantasizing about food I remember it and have it this point sort of accepted that it's (usually) more satisfying to fantasize than binge, which helps me fight binge urges.",False,False

Like it's all released in the anticipation stage (planning, going to store, buying) and then it's done once you have it and are actively engaged in the behavior.    Idk if that helps you at all. I always think about it and tell myself I'll be able to rationalize the situation and throw the food out because it's done giving me dopamine by the time I take the first bite, but I never do 🙃",False,False
