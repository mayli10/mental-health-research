This was years ago and I fought with them because when I was put on the unit I was 17 and it was a locked unit so I couldn't just leave. I got the bill when I was 18 and had switched to my own insurance. I gave them fucking hell for that, I was a goddamn minor and on a locked unit, what was I supposed to do? They eventually paid some of it, but I still got stuck with a huge bill, but I was able to pay it off.",False,False

I want the kind for dark circles and ""bags"" (tear trough filler) so I'll want the whole hollow under my eye filled and then my cheekbone area built up so my face doesn't look ""flat"" and I'd want it done with the longest lasting filler for that area that will work with my extra pale skin (some fillers leave a grey look on pale skin) so it would come to about $2000-ish. Regular old filler with regular botox can be as cheap at $400, you can also get the tear trough filler done cheaper if you don't need as much building up and/or use a cheaper type of filler, I've heard people get it done with good stuff for $700.   You basically need to research the fuck out of doctors and figure out what kind of procedure and filler you need. I'm just oh so lucky and will have to spend $2k haha!",False,False
