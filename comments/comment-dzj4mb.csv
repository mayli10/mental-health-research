I don’t really suffer with dysmorphia. I’m currently a very overweight BMI so I put this in then played around a bit with the sliding scale. Cool.   Then I decided to slide down to what I thought looked like a good healthy body and check the BMI. I landed on something severely underweight according to this tool.   This is not a good way to judge what your body looks like now or would look like at a different weight. Everyone is different. Please stay away from it.,False,False
