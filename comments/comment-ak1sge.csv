Diagnostic criteria exist because we need to draw the line somewhere in order to determine best treatment practices, but those things are culturally determined (in the case of mental health ‚Äî attitudes towards grief, for example... socially acceptable expressions of sadness in other cultures might be considered pathological in the Western world) and malleable to change (which is why they are constantly reassessing and updating the DSM).  That does make it hard when talking about mental illness, particularly mood disorders and EDs, because people naturally want to empathize and we have all experienced the full spectrum of emotions to some degree. Diagnostic criteria raise the possibility of ""gatekeeping,"" which isn't helpful since not everyone who's suffering has access to evaluation/diagnosis. But at the same time, blurring the lines too much risks downplaying the seriousness of true EDs.  I personally hate it when people equate the restrictive phases of EDNOS to actual anorexia. I hate it particularly because I used to do the same thing when I was younger. Until you've literally starved over a long period of time, or vomited your food, you can't actually understand through imagination or empathy what it's like to be in that place.",False,False

Just as there are many people who drink huge amounts per days but aren't an ""alcoholic"" because it doesn't match their view of what a ""real"" alcoholic looks/acts like, I think there are a huge number of people with disordered eating whether binging or restricting that wouldn't consider themselves to have an eating disorder.",False,False
