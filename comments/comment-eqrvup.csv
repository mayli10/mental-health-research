But I've never purged before and it really scares me that I get addicted to it. But I still think about it, everytime. I even have dreams where I purge when I eat in my dream. Definitely weird but don't let it consume you. Please stay in control, so far I've been able to. Also stay away from laxatives, even if my own brain keeps telling me I should go buy some , I always resist. You set your own boundaries. And yes, this thought will be a recurring one, but you got this!   Stay safe and feel free to message me if you do ever end up purging, we can talk about it :))",False,False
