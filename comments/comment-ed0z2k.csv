You say you usually do it twice a week but this time you made it almost 3 weeks not binging. That shows so much improvement. Christmas is a horribly triggering time and to do that is incredible. Don't be too harsh on yourself it's really hard this time of year to stay on track. Everytime you go binge free the days between each binge will get longer. Its really hard to break such a long habit.  Try to go back to eating normally tomorrow. Accept that it happened, reflect on the triggers to try and avoid in future and then move on like it didn't happen. You've totally got this, good luck üòä",False,False
