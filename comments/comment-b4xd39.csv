Sounds like this place isn't doing it. You are your size not a label. If you have a 28 inch waist it's a 28 inch waist (or whatever) and a tag doesn't change that. I don't even look at tag sizes bc they are bullshit! I love brands like AA who just have their jeans by inches. Makes way more sense!,False,False
