Not exactly the same, but I know a lot of guys frustrated by their height. A lot of girls will refuse to date below 6'0ft....even though the American average height for men is 5'9.

Anchoring is a cognitive bias in which we have a tendency to rely too heavily one trait or piece of information, usually the first piece of information.  Someone's attractiveness is that first piece of information. She looks good, I feel good looking at her, she makes me happy.  That isn't to say that those initial pieces of information can't be overturned over time. Men break up with beautiful women who they are incompatible with. Men realize their attraction to a woman's traits is greater than another's beauty.  It is also important to remember that different people have different priorities. Some men may want a life partner, in that circumstance they will place more value in compatibility. Some men just want to have some fun, in which case compatibility is not as important to them as physical attraction.

That isn’t always the case nowadays due to the safer nature of the modern world, but it’s still been heavily carried over from the early days.  They’re looking for as perfectly symmetrical faces as possible, child-bearing hips, strong bodies, medium to low body fat percentage, large but not encumbering breasts, breast-waist-hip ratio, stuff like that.  Women do go for looks at first too most of the time, looking for stronger men who would be able to protect them and their offspring. Again, that has changed somewhat with current society, but the standard still stands.  But women also look for someone who they connect with and who is kind, someone who is inclined to take care of them and be willing to provide what we need while taking care of offspring.  That’s the biological reasons, which are sort of ingrained in all of us to some extent. We usually end up pairing off with people around the same arbitrary attractiveness level as us as a result. It’s not an exact science, but people will try and reach for the highest quality mate, and so the “attractive” people pair off and then it sorta goes down the chain. But in such an international society, that isn’t always the case, especially with brain anomalies that deviate from being attracted to the standard.

The situation you describe from a TV show is a very exaggerated version of how things play out (or rather, don't, for most men) in reality. Yes, men are extremely visually driven, /u/sugafreedreams put it very well in his post. However, we are also very cognizant of this fact, and mindful that this instinct often does not serve our purposes. In the real world, men who are slaves to their visual instincts inevitably suffer from poor quality, shallow, and oftentimes very short relationships, because they are seeking something that can never be truly satisfied, something that barely scratches the surface of what makes a human being. Looks are a roll of the genetic dice, and old age overtakes and destroys even the most prized physique.  &amp;#x200B;  What you say is correct. You have a limited ability to change where your looks stack up in the attractiveness hierarchy through exercise/weight loss manipulation alone. I would ask, why do you care? If you woke up tomorrow, and you were a 10/10, how would that improve your life? Would your chances of attracting someone capable of a lasting, quality relationship go up, or down?  &amp;#x200B;  For me, an essential aspect of my recovering from my ED is accepting myself for who I am. That means rejecting any idea that I need to change or manipulate myself (outside what enables me to be physically and mentally healthy) to reach an ideal in my head that I know fundamentally is a moving target that doesn't actually exist. For this reason, I have pretty much stopped putting any effort into thinking about relationships or my prospects of entering one for now while I work on laying the foundations of a better version of myself.

A little something in sociology, people initially connect because of two things, physical appearance and ease of access. Most of the time, if they choose to pursue a relationship and realize they don't have much in common, it dies out. Likewise, if they do have a lot in common, the relationship blossoms. At least, that's my take on everything. You'll find someone. A 6 is plenty attractive enough to get past the initial connection.",False,False

If you’re talking to an okay looking guy and a gorgeous dude walks in, you’re going to look at him. That being said, I think it’s possible that the infatuation is temporary- we may be drawn to stare at someone we think is hot but when we’re emotionally committed to someone, we won’t abandon them for someone solely on the basis of physical appearance ",False,False

Pictures of a girl wearing a bikini are much more eye-catching for men than pictures of shirtless men are for women. This of course varies person by person, some men are not as sensitive to visuals as others, but in general the attractiveness of a person is more important to a guy than how well their personalities match. Obviously this only applies very short-term, like when a guy has the chance to talk to either a very attractive or a mediocre looking person. Longer term relationships only work with matching personalities.  The same definitely applies to me as a gay guy. Even though I am attracted to men like straight women are, it's much more visual-driven than I'd imagine attraction to be for most women. I pay a lot more attention and subconsciously feel a drive to talk with those who I find attractive, even if my personality is the complete opposite of them. If my personality matches with a guy who I don't find attractive, it's nice to talk to them and I might slowly build feelings towards them, but there isn't that instant spark there pulling me towards them.  My ED also links into this because I know that other gay people tend to be visual-driven in the same way. I'm only okay with my body when I know that I would feel that spark towards myself if I was another person.",False,False
