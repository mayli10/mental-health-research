The hunger never gets too intense as you are not fasting for long periods. Having coffee, tea or diet soda was a must for me though as it's quite difficult just living off water. Be prepared to eat larger meals than you normally would on your eating days though as you will feel like eating a bit more. So budget that in if you do go with the alternate day fasting plan.",False,False
