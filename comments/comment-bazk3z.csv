Imagine having to not only hit your calorie target, but ALSO within those calories, there is an exact number of grams of protein, carbs and fat as well.     I did this for about 2 years and it was TERRIBLE (I had calorie counted for about 6 years before that, so I've got a lot of comparisons.)  Say you're at the end of the day and you have 200 calories left.  Sweet, I can eat a big bowl of popcorn!  But wait....I only have 10g of carbs left, and the rest is all protein and fat.  Looks like I'm eating....egg whites with avocado?  YUM",False,False

There’s this one girl I follow that eats a big bowl of spinach and/or broccoli topped with maybe 200 calories of substantiative nutrients on top (avocado, hummus, typical “health foods”) for every meal. No sauces, ever.   I’m sure it looks like a super healthy diet to most, but it can’t possibly clock to more than 900 calories a day.",False,False

You may treat the disorder with therapy and healthier habits, not acting out on impulses inspired by your ED, but that illness is still usually in your mind with obsessive or bad thoughts about food/calories/fat/exercise constantly being battled.  No doubt the people who have admitted to switching gears from having a “real” eating disorder (anorexia, BED, bulimia) to being healthy have just stopped their old habits but switched over to have their mental illness focus on calories being reduced via healthy foods or via excessive exercise.  I follow Anna Paquin on IG and she’s been super honest about her constant struggles with an eating disorder.  She was anorexic, became orthorexic, and continues to struggle with building a healthy body through diet and exercise.  I’d bet that 99% of people who say they’ve beat their ED with healthy eating and exercise still struggle constantly with calorie counting, BMI, and the idea of not having a perfectly toned body.",False,False

If I don’t keep track then I end up overweight.    I don’t believe I’ve ever had an eating disorder but I have disordered eating habits that range in their intensity. Exercise has helped me get things in to a generally good place but I still have at least one instance a week where I need to remind. Myself that it’s ok to eat something.    I focus on exercising now because it pushes me to take the best care of my body possible. Even if that disordered voice won’t shut up I’m still engaging in behaviors that won’t harm me.    I can only really speak for myself but maybe these other fitness people are in a similar place.,False,False

I heard so much about how IIFYM (the idea that there's a certain target of protein, fat and carbs you should eat in a day and you can eat anything as long as it's within those targets) was so ""freeing"", both for people with BED and restrictive EDs, but idk I think meticulously weighing everything you eat is... not healthy.

But it's the type of disordered eating that society likes to label as ""discipline"" and ""moderation"" and they probably feel way better than when they had full blown EDs, so they see what they're doing as normal when they're probably just quasi-recovered or whatever term you want to use. Just my opinion though",False,False
