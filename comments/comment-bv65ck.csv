I have an ED and I still feel intimidated by some stuff here and elsewhere.  I understand it's nothing personal and everyone is different. It just seems like most people are pros and I'm a noob because I'm very basic. I don't do macros, for example. I think part of it is the fact that I first developed my ED when I was  very young. Like, 8. It basically escalated from being a picky eater. So it was never something ""scientific"" to me. Early on calories were not even something I considered. Nowadays I am obsessed with caloric intake but I'm still very basic. Not good at guesstimating food weight for example. I freak out at restaurants a lot. I just basically do cico, eating what doesn't make me feel bad/gross. It's something very subjective and intuitive for me so there's no way I could ever get on my high horse about it. And that does sometimes make me feel like I'm not knowledgeable and 'hardcore' enough to qualify lol except when I do a good fast, that makes me feel part of the club, as lame as it is.",False,False

I could see being still hungry or hungry really soon with a standard portion of cereal alone for breakfast, but piling more cereal in the bowl isn't necessarily the answer. Like another poster mentioned, adding an egg or meat/meat substitute or yogurt or tofu scramble for protein and fats would make a huge difference. And calorie for calorie, a big ol bowl of oatmeal or cream of wheat would prob be way more filling   My theory for why most people aren't happy with one cereal serving is the ridiculous size of most bowls. The standard bowl size nowadays is huge, even paper bowls come so big by default. A single serving of cereal isn't that skimpy but if it barely makes a dent in a massive bowl, it psychologically looks unsatisfying. Getting small dishes made such a positive difference for me. I had an old roommate who insisted we buy huge dishes upon moving in because he ""needs a lot of food"" and thinks refilling his bowl or plate is too much work.  He would eat a family box of cheerios in like 3 days alone and then complain he only eats one bowl per morning so it should last longer, ignoring the fact that he used a special cheerios branded bowl that was like legit 3x the size of a normal bowl (lol go figure, ofc the cereal brand bowl is meant to coax the buyer into eating tons of cereal) and filled it to the absolute brim. That plus whole milk was probably like 600-700 calories in cereal a day, if not more. And cheerios are one of the less caloric choices! Then he couldn't understand why he was gaining weight when he ate that and $10 of taco bell daily and doing nothing but gaming all day 🤦‍♀️",False,False

I feel like I've been struggling a lot feeling like I'm broken or a freak for not knowing how to eat normally, growing up with BED, and seeing normal-sized people freak out about how tiny recommended servings are is kind of... validating? Obviously it's not the same as my own problems, but it DOES prove that general education on calories, nutrition, etc. is woefully lacking. People just aren't taught anything about nutrition, and if they don't have a family that teaches them healthy eating habits, and/or if they have an eating disorder anyway, then they're just shit out of luck.  What I like them most for though is highlighting completely unrealistic serving sizes on packaging. I know that there have been harsher regulations lately on misleading portion sizes, like suggesting that a can of soft drink would have multiple serves or that one foil pack of poptarts is 2 servings, but it still happens. I hate seeing companies artificially deflate their calorie-per-serving and pretend their food is healthier and more balanced/manageable than it really is just because they tell you to eat less of it. Seeing ""normal"" people (at least, people in healthy BMIs without particularly disordered eating) shocked/confused/upset at the ""suggested"" serving size vs. the culturally expected serving they and their social circles are used to really highlights how dishonest these companies are being about their terrifyingly unhealthy food.  Tho on the flipside some of the skinny people will be like ""THIS is a portion of pasta?? lol THIS is how much pasta I would NORMALLY eat!"" (shows a massive fuckoff bowl of pasta almost half the packet) and I get like... upset? Because I start to think, ""Well that's how I used to eat, so why did I end up morbidly obese and they're still skinny? They're not exactly athletes. I know skinnyfat is a thing but... still :(""   But I know the reality is they're probably exaggerating and/or they don't eat like that allll the time, for every meal. So it averages out.  But I do wish these videos were presented with more explanation of what calories were, why these portion guidelines exist, etc. I think that would be way more helpful to people, especially people trying to learn about nutrition. Without understanding how RDIs work then the idea of portion control is pretty much useless and so are these videos.   Still watch them tho...",False,False
