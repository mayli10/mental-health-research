I used to be so scared because I read things about people being 30 and still having it and I thought I would be forever depressed.  The way I got out was literally forcing myself. I would do things I used to love and would always randomly say positive things even if I didn’t mean them.   I can say now that I am completely recovered from depression (my eating disorder is not a branch off it as my depression was due to something entirely different which Ik is odd and sounds like I’m not recovered but I am).  So, yeh, it’s sucks, and you may still have other problems. But it genuinely won’t last, even if your in the place I was when I actually wanted it to.",False,False
