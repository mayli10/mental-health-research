I‚Äôm assuming she does know or have a suspicion about OP‚Äôs ED or at the very minimum knows shes extremely self conscious about her weight. That goes beyond mean, imho. When people show you their true colors be wary. I was harsh but so was her comment, enough so to cause OP to post about it because she was so upset. Usually friends support you and say things like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre just as beautiful‚Äù or ‚Äúweight is so unimportant‚Äù. It just seems like her friend was almost rubbing it in her face that she gained weight which really isn‚Äôt friendship. I‚Äôm not involved of course and yeah probably overreacted but damn, that was cold of her. Just trying to let OP know her feelings are validated and that was rude and mean as hell.",False,False
