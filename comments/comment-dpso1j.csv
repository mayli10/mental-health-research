Water weight is a really common one because that can happen due to SO many different things; exercise, feeling cold, getting a sickness bug, bad nutrition, sudden change in diet, medication change, hormonal changes etc etc etc...  It may not be water weight, it could just be your body doing something different for a few days. Body's are organic, we can try to predict them but we can't, it's basically impossible. If we could then the diet industry wouldn't be so freekin' confusing.   Vitamins, minerals, gentle exercise and a steady intake of calories.
