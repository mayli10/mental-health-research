I have always struggled with my weight and with food, but I only really knew about anorexia and bulimia.  People that have a Binge Eating Disorder (without actually calling it that) are often portrayed as having no discipline, being lazy etc.  It made me feel like shit when I would shove food in my mouth even thought I didn't want to. Even thought my stomach would hurt and I would get sick. I would think  *wtf is wrong with me? Why do I lose control?!?!*  Now I know that it is a valid illness that I can get treatment for. Thanks to proED I started looking for resources to help me have a healthy relationship with food. ",False,False

I'll try again:  I hope you don't mind me posting your video here. I think it's really insightful and you bring up a lot of stuff I saw too like the relationship advice and a lot of stuff I didn't realise were going on like the diet pill stuff. I like your channel a lot :) you were probably the first person I heard talk candidly about their eating disorder and I was really relieved to find something so truthful and not incredibly depressing. Keep up the good work??? Idk what else to say but I hope you have a nice day :),False,True
