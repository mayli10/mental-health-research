His grandpa and aunt pushed food on me so hard and it was crazy stressful but his mom was incredible- she never commented on how much I ate or got upset if I didn’t finish my food- and that helped me relax / realize I don’t actually owe anyone an explanation for why I’m not finishing food. Now if someone says “you barely ate!” I just say “mmm/yep🙂”,False,False
