I'm not like ""Hi I'm Lunar and I have an eating disorder"" but if I'm confronted or if it comes up I don't lie. I never make excuses for not eating or for disappearing to the bathroom. It's just a thing. I sort of feel like secrecy contributes to stigma and I'm not down with that. Plus I'm just too damn lazy to put in all the effort it would take to conceal something like this.

Lately Iâ€™ve started to open up and be honest about it in a more controlled nd constructive way. Mind techniques and groupshare etc. Itâ€™s bc I want to be well though.

This consumes most of all my entire day and I do little else so lots of stuff doesn't even strike me as odd.  Also it's easier just to be like ""look, I do not want to eat that. I just don't.""
