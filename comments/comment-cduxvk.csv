Relapse one: getting to my goal weight, being happy with it for a while until I put on a pair of pants and it SQUEEZED me. Size 4.

Well she’s not skinnier than me anymore but he’s still not my boyfriend   Relapse three: someone at work bullying me so I just had no appetite and stopped eating   My current relapse is because my uncle’s molesting me while I’m passed out high. I can’t tell anyone. It’s because I was probably dressing too revealing so whatever. I can’t split up my family. My uncle told me thought I was so hot when I was 20lbs heavier.

It happened slowly, incrementally over the course of a few years, until hitting full blown relapse mode within the past few months.  Contributing factors:  -my cats dying (the first one was probably the initial trigger; the second died two years later)  -being treated like absolute shit by certain people at work, working harder than almost anyone else there with no appreciation and certain people behaving outright viciously towards me (to the point that I probably could have sued if I’d wanted to)  -quitting said shitty job and having pretty much no prospects or ideas about what to do with my life   -visiting my parents (including abusive mother) in a town I HATE and hadn’t been to in years because I hate it there so much. Gained about ten pounds there, and spent most nights getting to watch my morbidly obese mother eating shit food all fucking night long. Also being absolutely smothered by the both of them while I was there, with no peace or privacy whatsoever.  -my mother being diagnosed with cancer  -the small handful of people who I thought cared about/understood me turning out to be largely disappointing on all counts  -the only people left who I trust that actually do give a shit about me have either moved across the country or are planning to in the near future  -I’m still single and childless, and not getting any younger.
