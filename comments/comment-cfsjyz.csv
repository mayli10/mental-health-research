I’ve been having very similar feelings for a while now, and realized I’ve purposely pushed a bunch of people away because I kinda like it that way. Then I can just be in self destruct mode and let this shit envelop me. But you aren’t completely alone, if you ever need to talk feel free to message me. It helps me to know other people are feeling the way I am too sometimes. Shit gets real dark some days.   P.S. Self care tip: if you like movies, take yourself out on a date to see one! I weirdly love going to the movie theatre alone, you can just sit in the dark by yourself and watch an awesome piece of art and forget about everything weighing down on you even just for a couple hours. I saw two today!",False,False

And soul-crushing. But perfect nonetheless.  I wish I knew what to say.   Here’s all I’ve got for sure: I was panicking alone in a car when I read it. I’m slightly calmer now because it’s always nice to feel less alone.   My circumstances are different from yours probably, but so much of this speaks to me.   And I’m sorry. I’m really sorry. For what it’s worth though, I’ve had similar thoughts before that weren’t permanent at all.  You’re brave as fuck for posting this, by the way. I know how tacky that sounds, but I mean it. Concise sincerity is refreshing, and the world needs more of it.  ALSO. Abusive relationships are isolating. Eating disorders are isolating. Mix em together in any way, and you’re bound to be isolated at some point! It’s not necessarily a reflection of your intrinsic worth as a human being.   There’s no doubt in my mind that you *can* do things right—that if you do indeed stay in the dirty shell (and I truly hope you do), life will feel less hollow at some point.",False,False

There are so many wonderful things you can do , so many kind people to meet, and lots of love to give and receive. I hope you get the kindness and support you deserve, and I would like to send you this virtual hug and tell you you aren't alone",False,False
