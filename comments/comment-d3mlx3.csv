Not that any of this is okay, but that'd be my suspicion on why it's not talked about.",False,False

I only know one trans person who doesn't seem to have an ED. Personally, my dysphoria has contributed to my eating problems pretty much from the start, and now the stress of my family not supporting my transition has made my ED even worse.  But even though it seems obvious that we'd be at high risk for EDs, I'm surprised by how unaware doctors seem. Whenever I'm at the clinic I see at least a couple patients I'd peg as potentially anorexic. And then there's me - visibly bony, and also probably not looking great. Like sure, the doctors asked at my intake what was up with my low weight. But I gave my standard lame excuse of, ""haha idk I've been this way for years LmAo??"", and they just nodded and said, ""Maybe you'll gain weight on T,"" and never mentioned it again.   And just, idk man...part of me feels like they're secretly aware that a huge number of gender patients have eating issues, but their system isn't equipped to handle that kind of massive crisis. So they leave it alone, hope we improve with HRT/transition, and save the resources for people who are in legitimately scary physical shape (or who don't improve at all with gender treatment).",False,False

Restricted to a dangerously low weight, still maintain a low weight to make it easier to pass as ""boyish""/androgynous (still don't pass, just look like a little kid). Also tried to lose my period by force because it was dysphoric as fuck, but that never worked either.",False,False

I'm a trans woman and after finally getting on HRT, I was able to look at myself honestly and figure out the obvious. That I was extremely unhealthy and underweight and it made me look worse, not better.   I'm doing much better now.

And boy does being trans make it worse!! I'm two years into hormone therapy and pretty physically active and I'm SO hungry, still. I don't know what's T and what's just me.  I'm on the verge of seeking treatment but I'm scared I'll have trouble finding a therapist that specializes in EDs but is also good with trans people (and not terribly terribly expensive).  Also, frustratingly enough, getting all skeletal skinny just makes me hyper-aware of my goddamn hips, and my chest is proving to be the last place fat comes off.",False,False

I over-ate all the time to numb feelings of gender dysphoria, but it ended up making everything worse because pre-HRT all my fat gain went to feminine areas, which made me more dysphoric. And even though HRT has helped me immensely, it made me *super* hungry at first. Teenage boy level hungry.  I think that trans people are more likely to have some disordered eating going on than the general population. I haven't struggled with this in particular, but I know some young trans people who developed restrictive behaviors with the goal of preventing puberty from happening or reducing the effects of it. It doesn't seem rare.",False,False
