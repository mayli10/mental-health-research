Similar situation to your first paragraph: highly competitive school, stressed as fuck, no sleep, bad grades. Except, I mean real bad. Like C's bad. I had a C+ on my report card in freshman year, with everything else an A, and it fucked me up so bad. I got so stressed that I got super sick in sophomore year, ended with another C and mostly B's, maybe one A. I felt so stupid at my high school, like there must have been a mistake and they let me in by accident cause I just wasn't smart enough to be there. Contemplating suicide and just giving up on everything altogether.  But I didn't. I got tutoring, medical and mental help, and I got better. I got straight A's my next two years, in lots of advanced classes so my gpa jumped right up. I did summer stuff that piqued my interests, one of which was a competitive program at THE university in my state, my dream school actually. I still didn't sleep much but I was managing my anxiety and I no longer felt like giving up, i was actually really hopeful, optimistic, and determined. I didn't get into my dream school, but I got a full tuition MERIT scholarship at a really good school, the one I'm at right now. I feel challenged and invigorated, and if I play my cards right next week I'll get to do research in my dream field over the summer. Now I'm TUTORING in the subjects I got C's in. Like, parents are paying me to help their kids learn stuff I thought I'd never understand. And?? The real kicker? I'm majoring in those subjects, too. I love them now and I want to study them forever.  If I can do all of that from a place numerically worse than yours, you can do it too. Don't give up. You're doing so well, really. I know it feels like everyone else is in a better situation, has better grades or life prospects or social lives or WHATEVER, but they don't. And even if they did, it doesn't matter. You care about you, and no one else. Not your peers at your first school, or this one, or the college admissions officers. Your parents are so proud of you, even if you don't go to Harvard. I didn't either, but I love my life right now (outside of ed lol). I'm probably doing way better than I would at Harvard, the pressure and impostor syndrome would be unbearable. You're gonna be okay, no matter where you go, I promise. Coming from someone who was in your shoes, thinking the same thoughts, not even a whole year ago when I got my rejection letters. I wish I could show past me where she is right now, she'd be so happy and relieved and proud.   Sorry this was so long. Please PM me if you need to talk more, or if you need general college admissions advice. I'm actually suspecting that we went to the same school, so that would be really funny to find out!! Let me know &lt;3",False,False
