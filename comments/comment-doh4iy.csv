There’s so much more to Taurus tbh, like the natural Venusian flair for artistry and art/music appreciation, the innate warmth and compassion, and the closest embodiment to “zen” ideals one could get (like contentment, patience, gentleness, and appreciation of nature). I could go on!   And I noticed that Vedic astrology descriptions tend look upon Tauruses so much more favorably than western astrology descriptions, like they actually consider Taurus to be an incredibly intelligent and savvy sign unlike their western counterparts interestingly enough.",False,False
