IME, if the therapist isn't nearly or totally exclusive to a condition (with or without its common comorbidities), they're not likely to be of much help with it. If you want a therapist who actually knows what they're doing with EDs, I think you need to look for practitioners who say things like, ""I work exclusively with ED patients,"" or the like, rather than, ""I welcome patients with [insert list of diagnoses].""",False,False

I hate when people start pushing your problems, saying ""You are lucky, there's other people that's actually suffering"", it just makes me feel as if I was selfish.   A therapist is supposed to help you, not to bring you down.",False,False

A therapist making sure you aren’t too low of a weight is one thing — it’s reasonable for one to ask your weight or BMI if they’re concerned. But asking if they can say you “look too skinny”?? No. No. Especially since you’re already underweight (which should concern your therapist)!!  Also, comparing mental health issues to cancer is just... so dumb. Why even be a therapist if your reaction to everything is just “well at least you don’t have cancer!” ??   Everything your therapist said that you’ve mentioned in this post is inappropriate and borderline unethical. I know it can be really hard to leave when you’ve worked with someone for a long time, but in the long run it will be better for your mental health.",False,False

I question one who's willing to accept an increasingly ingrained ED until you stop looking fuckable.,False,False

I know it’s difficult not to take that as a massive trigger to just lose more weight or hear it as your obviously not sick enough yet and he shouldn’t have told you like that, but it’s not creepy or anything.",False,False
