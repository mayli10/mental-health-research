I‚Äôve been using:  Card Smart 647 (80 cals for 2 slices) Sarah lee Delight Whole Wheat (90 cals for 2 slices   Is it 350 for the slices or the loaf?

I do have a dom and he knows about my ED. If it were up to him I'd be eating a lot of bread and other high carb shit. I can't eat that way. I gain 10lbs just smelling bread.

I get even more stressed when I don't know exactly how many calories I'm consuming.",False,False
