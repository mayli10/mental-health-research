So a couple days ago you commented on a text post I made on r/lgbt and it really helped me with what I was experiencing. I decided to check up on you to see how you were doing, and it's sad to see this. I don't know what you're going through—I don't even know who you are—but you made me smile one day, and that made a huge difference to me. Maybe this won't change anything, and maybe it's not the best move on my part, but I want you to know that I genuinely appreciate you. Even if it's just for that one thing. I think that's enough of a reason to appreciate someone.  And if anything I say can count, I'd like to see you live and be happy. You deserve the opportunity for something better than this. I know it.",False,False
