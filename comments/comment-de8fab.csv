On the one hand Iâ€™m so glad you went to the hospital. I was getting scared for you, wondering about you on and off.   On the other, Iâ€™m so sorry that it just ended up being more triggering and invalidating. I kind of think of it like people with other health issues. Your bloodwork can be good UNTIL IT ISNT.   Shit, Iâ€™m bad again too, Iâ€™m living alone for a bit and actively trying to just straight up fast (a bit for the boy I was telling you about). And I know itâ€™s not good but itâ€™s so hard not to.   Idk Iâ€™m just so sad for you and for all of us reading what you went through this week. But Iâ€™m glad to hear from you again ðŸ’•. I wish I could help you, but I am here listening and sitting on the stage with you too at this weird fucked up show. :(",False,False
