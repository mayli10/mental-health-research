I dropped a lot of weight over 3-4 months and have reached &amp; now past, my original goal weight. However, i look at my thighs and they are still huge and not what i thought they would look like at this weight.  They have always been big and im happy to be able to get them to a UK 8 now but Im beginning to think no matter how much i lose they will never be how i want them. In jeans, shorts and other clothes they look huge to me but in tights they look much smaller.   Your not alone ðŸ’•",False,False

Sometimes you just have to do the eccentric part of the exercise. Itâ€™s the way with big body movements like that.  Keep working the muscle group till you get the full range of motion.   Instead of the full push up do a half push up. Do say a set of two half push ups 8-10 reps. Then do a set of full push ups for 5 reps.   I think the weakness there was the chest and arm muscles and the fact you were running a lot. You were strengthening your glutes, quads, hamstrings, calves and abs. They were getting most of the work out.   Are you still weight training. Some simple remedial works helps or working with bands to work out the weaknesses and the imbalances.",False,False

I don't know why having clothes on, even skin-tight clothes, seems to get in the way of BDD for some of us, but it does. I know that objectively I am thin because I'm underweight and my size 0 ""super skinny"" jeans are slightly loose on me, but when I wear shorts I feel like my legs are huge whereas when I wear tights or jeans I see my legs as thin.

I was running track when my anorexia was at its worst, and not only not dying but performing really well, and thatâ€™s not least because my legs retained (and somehow built??) so much muscle.

Can build big biceps but struggle with triceps. Bodies are weird how they react.  I am cutting at the moment and my abs legs and back are strong but my arms and shoulders are suffering.

Your thighs arenâ€™t horrible and thereâ€™s not a lot of fat on them. What you are seeing is the abductor muscle group. When you lose weight you lose it from all over your body but if you have a strong muscle group. These muscles can stay strong and pronounced.    I use to run a lot when I was deep into my anorexia and no matter how much I ran and cut certain parts of my body never budged.   We can exercise and diet but we also need to look at our body types and genetic backgrounds. I am Irish I am tall but my flexibility is good. I am chest dominant. Long arms and legs. Diet is high meat and carbohydrates cause that is the natural diet in Ireland.  If I lived in another part of the world my body shape and diet would reflect this.     Its body types and other factors. Genetic back rounds and whether you a man or a women.   I donâ€™t know if you lift weights or run or swim etc. but this can also have an effect on your body shape.  Donâ€™t be so hard on yourself. Work with your body. Be kind to yourself and your body.   Your legs are not tree trunks.,False,False
