Do NOT mix liquor and beer. If you decide to drink Burnett's then use one shot and fill the rest with cola or seltzer water. Nurse the drink! Do not feel the need to gulp it down and add more alcohol to it. Drink water in between any drinks you have. Trust me once you get that first one down you will feel it. Wait before getting more. It's so easy to think just one more won't hurt or I'm not ""that drunk"". Just having the cup in hand may help you feel more at home. Getting wasted isn't the goal here. Having fun is and that only requires that you relax a little.",False,False

It'll soak up some alcohol while still being low cal, and if you give it time before you go you won't feel too full? Also a glass of full fat milk is supposed to be good for lining the stomach... obviously I'm not a doctor but it might help, hope you have a good night ðŸ˜˜",False,False

Especially at a college party. That's not the place you want to be super drunk or blacked out for the first time EDIT to add or any time. Make sure you have a friend you can really trust go with you. Especially if you think you may drink enough to get drunk.,False,False
