The only way to minimize cellulite is to strengthen and tighten the connective tissue beneath the skin.  You do this by eating collagen rich foods (gelatin, soups and stews made from bones, chicken feet, oysters) and ensuring that you eat sufficient vitamin C to shore up your (limited) capacity for endogenous collagen production.  You may not be able to get rid of it entirely, though, regardless of what you do; it's just a natural fat-storage characteristic of women.",False,False
