That weight didn't cause your happiness, you yourself were happy.   I think the idea of just losing the weight is somehow so much less daunting than actually dealing with the root of the cause. Sometimes I think I tell myself that if I can only get back to x size all my problems will disappear but I know they won't.  I'll just be a miserable -lite edition me if I don't face the root of the problem. It's a big old daunting hurdle and tbh I don't really want to face it either lol",False,False

It's one more hurdle that I really don't wanna confront but fuckkkk if I want to be happy I gotta do that part too.  It's just so stupid. I know I was happy back in the days of my goal weight. But that was years ago so...it's important to remember I'm a different person now I guess. I was happy AND that weight...not happy because of it.  Is this logic?? Wtf..ew...disappear it.   Because I feel it's so much easier to lose weight than deal with my shit.,False,True

I've told myself that once I'm thin and tiny it will all just dissappear but it doesn't. Fighting your disorder is really important because once you hit your newest lowest weight you'll find another to fixate on. I remember at my very lowest seeing how terrible I was looking, I was horribly thin and I looked old? In my mind I had rationalised that if only I could get to my next low weight I would somehow magically look perfect. Shockingly I did not and it was a temporary wake up call. Take care of yourself, feeling happy with your body isn't a number on the scales. With this disorder no number on the scales will ever put a true smile on your face. If anything having a perspective from opposite ends of the scale has shown me that. You could be 80lbs or 280lbs and you'll still feel miserable inside.",False,False

We usually only eat put on fridays and Saturdays and by sunday night/monday I'm asking him where he wants to go so I can plan my week around those days because they are always the highest.  And he's usually like...uhhh I dunno what I will crave by then??   And that's when I realized I don't plan or eat by cravings but by numbers only. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯,False,True

Sometimes my boyfriend will bring me some food he thinks I would like but I’m like “thanks, but I already have my food planned.” He’ll be like “ok well maybe save it for tomorrow.” and I’m thinking to myself “yeah.....but I already have my meals planned for tomorrow too.” I hate when people bring me food I wasn’t expecting because it just doesn’t fit in, and like you said, it makes me feel horrible sometimes because they were just trying to be nice. Sometimes I wish people could plan ahead and tell me at the beginning of the week they are going to bring me food, what they are bringing, how much they are bringing but I know normal people don’t think that way lol",False,False

Fucking yes. This. 100%.  And the extra part is I keep thinking once I am thin af I'll stop with the disorder and just be happy again. As if that's how it should work...and I know that's not the case.   I'm sorry you've had to experience both sides of how people see your eating though. It gives you a unique perspective, but I'm sure it's a lot to process.",False,True

It's extra hard because like...you know your ED is crazy and ruins shit. But that doesn't mean you control it like a switch.   Thank you for the advice though!

I have been on both ends of the scale but I've noticed that until you're looking very much on the thinner side any comments about skipping meals, restricting calories or fasting is only really seen as a plus or a yeah okay... it can be very triggering because you know in your disordered mind you still have such a long way to go before people start caring.",False,False

An ex once learned how to make Singapore vermicelli for me since it's my favourite take out order and suprised me with it when I came home from work. I freaked out. Explained I couldn't and wouldn't eat it. It was a nice thought but eating it would send me apiraling into a deep self-loathing and I couldn't bring myself to have it. He flipped the fuck out on me. Shouting about how my ED was fucking ridiculous and ruining everything and why couldn't I just forget about it for a day and eat the fucking food he worked hard on since he's seen me have binge meals in the past. It was a rough day.  I'm so sorry you had to do that. I'm sure once he's had time to work through his feelings a little, you can sit and explain what you have here and he'll understand a bit more that you would have absolutely loved to enjoy his nice gesture, but mental illnesses are generally just happiness-ruiners.",False,False

I love making breakfast for my husband and I once spent d a y s making bread and balsamic caramelised onions from scratch to make him a French onion-style breakfast sandwich, only for him to take one bite and inform me that he’s never liked French onions.
