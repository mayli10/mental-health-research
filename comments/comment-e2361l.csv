I will say, I’ve suffered from this stupid disorder since the early 2000’s and 99% of the “tricks” I learned were through my own discovery of those dumb books that dramatized eating disorders. I credit the old pro-ED subreddit (that I fully now see as a lot more dangerous than I used to realize- I am so glad this subreddit doesn’t have those daily food diaries and weekly body checks, and outright bans thinspo stuff) for making sure I will never ever take laxatives. There were so many first hand horror stories. It’s a mixed bag, but I think it’s very very smart to be cautious of any online ED space. Even if we don’t mean to, like you say, it can definitely inadvertently cause people to fall deeper into their disordered behaviors.",False,False

I guess that in a perfect world, I wish that such behaviours were not mentioned at all... But at the same time, I don't, because the people talk about purging here a lot in a VERY negative light is the reason to why I've never tried it despite the fact that I've wanted to many times over the last years. This is just a very tricky topic. In general I think that ED communities like this are neither good or bad. At least this specific community is MUCH better than any other I've been a part of, so that's an improvement :)",False,False

If they don’t learn it in this forum they’re bound to learn it somewhere else. With the wealth of knowledge that the internet offers nowadays it is almost a moot point to try to censor such stuff. Of course I agree with censoring certain things on the internet like porn obviously, but beyond a certain point I guess you have to weigh the benefits of having a sub like this that people can come to and be welcomed by, especially if they’re not necessarily in a recovered space, vs the cons of people picking up more disordered traits here.   Idk, I’m not trying to argue with you or anything, I just thought you made a good point!",False,False

Things like certain safe foods (that might contain less calories but aren't necessary good for you), certain rituals, etc. Also, sometimes people talk about fear foods here and it's so easy to suddenly become afraid of a food item because you might find out from here that it has more calories than you thought it had.   For example, I make a point of not checking calories in some items that I haven't checked before. This is because I want to stop being aware of calories in general, and because I still want to enjoy at least some things in my life without getting anxious. Ignorance is bliss I guess. One of those things used to be alcohol. Like I could previously enjoy alcohol without stressing out about calories and drink a glass of wine and feel so good, but after seeing alcohol calories mentioned everywhere, I now cannot think of alcohol the same way anymore and must restrict/compensate somehow if I decide to treat myself to a beer or two or some other type of alcohol.   So yeah, even though this sub may seem very innocent and harmless on the surface, I think that especially for someone who is ""new"" to the whole eating disorder thing, this sub can provide some inspiration as to what foods to eat and what foods to avoid and perhaps introduce that person to a new behaviour that they haven't thought of before. For example chewing and spitting - I can imagine that some people might not have had that idea before, but then saw a post/comment from someone who mentions chewing and spitting and tries it despite the OP talking about it in a bad way.   I therefore think that pro-ED communities *might* be harmful for someone who isn't that disordered in the first place/haven't had the disorder for a long time (think about a teenager that has just started to dab in the whole dieting-&gt;thinspo-&gt;tumblr pro-ana stuff), but not *as* harmful for those of us who have been living with this for many years and is familiar with all ED methods, tips and tricks, behaviours, and foods.",False,False

Instead of being alone in my own head and looking for tips or ways to get worse, I scratch the ‘itch’ relatively harmlessly and I feel less alone.   And I am way more forgiving for when I do eat because I can see other people talking about when they do and I see that it’s not the end of the world.

They don’t allow me to normalize my disordered behaviors, but they help me to normalize *myself*.   As an example, the other night at a Friendsgiving, I was snapped at twice by two different people for taking tiny bites of food. They are concerned about me, but they don’t understand that snapping “just eat the whole thing!” at me makes me want to not eat at all (what I typically do). In that moment, I feel like a freak for taking small bites and for doing something that other people notice. Not their fault at all, but puts me into a state of self loathing.   When I can hear that other people may have the same thoughts (ex- it’s hard to get myself to eat this, eating in smaller bites helps me to feel safe) I no longer feel like a freak. Instead, I just feel like a girl suffering from an eating disorder.   This allows me to separate myself from the disorder and properly explain my actions and feelings when reaching out for help.

Tips and tricks aren’t allowed here, no one is encouraging people, rather I see a lot of commiserating and solidarity. I also see people genuinely happy for those who make posts about starting recovery.   Having said that, I do understand how it can seem to normalize these behaviors and thoughts. I think it’s healthy to take breaks when you feel like the community isn’t helping you or if you have out grown it.
