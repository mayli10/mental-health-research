Like can I please get a refund?",False,False

I think it’s even worse with bed because there’s so much victim blaming that comes with it too:/  When my dad found out about my anorexia he literally said *“well all women think like that ! Don’t bother with it though, you look just perfect”* like r/thanksimcured but um I can’t brush my teeth bc I’m afraid of toothpaste calories and I haven’t had a period in a year ?",False,False

Maybe you could pull up some websites about it to educate him or if you've got a diagnoses you could ask your GP to go through it with him if you're looking for support from him. If you know he won't come round, they're are plenty of professionals as well as friends on and offline who can help support you. Parents can really suck sometimes. It's horrible to hear stuff like that from them.",False,False
