If you cannot leave them alone altogether, could you maybe at least take a step back?   When shit hit the fan with my family and I couldn't cope with supporting everybody I tried to think about myself first. Easier said than done but it helps me a LOT to remember than I'm doing (kinda) good on my own without all of this drama.   It sounds super selfish but you don't owe them shit, and you have a right to take time for yourself and maybe come back once you have your shit together again. YOUR mental health is the most important thing. Distancing yourself (without cutting all ties) a lil bit makes a huge difference (at least for me).  For the party: Do you really have to attend? If you really feel uncomfortable going and it stresses you out for 40 days maybe your partner could understand why you wouldn't go?  Anyway, I'm so sorry for what you're going through and I hope everything will get sorted out soon &lt;3.",False,False
