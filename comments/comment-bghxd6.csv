Mine mostly happened while I was transitioning into deep sleep, so yeah, definitely at bedtime. My triggers are exhaustion and marijuana (which is funny because weed usually helps epilepsy)   Even though I‚Äôm technically ‚Äúseizure-free‚Äù, during several sleep studies I have had minor seizures as I‚Äôm falling asleep and that‚Äôs what affects my short term memory. Sucks, but gives me an excuse whenever I forget something. Haha   I didn‚Äôt take my meds throughout my pregnancy because there were risks of spinal deformities. Keppra never worked for me, found out I‚Äôm allergic to Lamictal after two weeks of taking it, so I was on Depakote until I got pregnant with my first.",False,False

I have temporal lobe epilepsy, no clue if it‚Äôs genetic as I‚Äôm adopted. We‚Äôre your seizures nocturnal or just near bedtime?  Question: did you continue taking your meds while pregnant? If you don‚Äôt want to share, no worries at all.   This is still kinda new to me, sometimes just like to hear other‚Äôs experiences",False,True

I had a seizure on my 21st birthday and then had them nightly for years after. My epilepsy is rare, genetic, and apparently just needed a trigger. I have my license back now and have been seizure-free for 3 years. I‚Äôm also off my medication for now since it‚Äôs not safe to take while breastfeeding.",False,False
