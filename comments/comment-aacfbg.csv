It's all calories in, calories out, so if they were really eating that way all the time 24/7 they wouldn't be thin. For example, I could sit down and eat two big macs (1100 calories) and lose weight for the day. It would look like I was just a relatively thin person binging on fast food if you just glanced by and didn't know anything else, but in order to continue losing that would be all I would eat in a day and it would actually be a pretty good calorie deficit of around 500 calories below maintenance, or 1 pound loss over one week.. You may also see an obese person eating the same two big macs (1100 calories), but they'll probably have also had breakfast (say 600 calories) and will eat dinner (maybe 1500 calories), which will bring their calorie total for the day above their maintenance level and cause then to gain weight. It's all about the numbers, some people just naturally balance out their calories and don't need to meticulously count them :) There are no magical thin people who are eating way over maintenance calories every single day and remaining that way.",False,False
