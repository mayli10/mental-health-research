I know Im ugly and shit, inside and out - so Ive... kind of created a bubble/safe zone around me/my mind of ""Im safe, nothing will happen to ME, no attention will reach my disgusting self"". But as soon as something small touches my ""bubble"" or just thoughts alone makes me feel worse than death. It brings such panic at times its quite embarrassing. I cant even describe the feeling... its like I freeze up in... fear? As if cornered by a threat?? Gosh this is such a mess lmao  Sorry, just had to vent a bit",False,False
