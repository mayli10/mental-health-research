Have you told them/shown them your gains? I was forced into recovery when I was 15, forced recovery doesn’t work because it only fixes the weight but it makes the ed brain worse. 5 lbs in one week is not reasonable, can you convince them that you’re already committed to recovery and compromise on 2 lbs?

My advice is to bust your ass to make those 5 pounds happen. It's gonna be a lot worse in a hospital setting. In order for you to be as comfortable as possible during this shitty time, you have to compromise. I know it sucks and I know it's unfair and there's going to be times where you want to rip your hair out, punch the walls, and scream at God himself because it feels like nobody is listening, but if you don't meet them where they're asking you too, you're going to end up going through the same shit, but in a hospital bed with far less comforts. Five pounds really isn't a lot. Hell, having a meal and a glass of water before your weigh-in will account for two or three of them. Good luck. I hope this goes as well for you as it can.
