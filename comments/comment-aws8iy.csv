You might be right there, Iâ€™m not sure which way around it is but I knew thereâ€™s only one BCP that has that in it (the rest are just progestin with the estrogen)  Estrogen also causes migraines and headaches. If you have concerns though definitely consult your doctor even if itâ€™s just for peace of mind.",False,False

Either way, taking it has definitely been beneficial for me. Except that I've been getting headaches much easier lately (I'm prone to migraines, though that's probably pretty normal here) and while it didn't coincide with when I started cypro or when my dose was increased to a full pill, I have to wonder if the headaches are related. I have read that cyproterone can cause brain tumours. I doubt I have a brain tumour, but these headaches might be worth getting checked out anyway.",False,True

It's hard to tell when you don't have a period, but it is possible for trans women to experience PMS symptoms as their hormonal cycle goes through the same stuff that happens with everybody. Like everybody produces both testosterone and estrogen and menstruation happens when a woman is at their testosterone high point, so when trans women are taking the right amount of estrogen they can experience all of the hormone-related symptoms cis women would experience during their period like sore muscles, nausea, etc. I did experience that for a couple months in a row while I was losing weight, but then it stopped as I became underweight. I've been trying to gain weight again lately and earlier this week I did think that maybe it had started up again. It did usually happen for me around the last week of the month, so it would make sense. That's a bummer though because I thought that all of this effort I was putting into eating more was actually working. I'm literally eating so much that I feel like garbage most days. I really can't wait until I get back to a healthy weight and can just go back to eating maintenance calories...",False,True
