Your body will think it's getting food, so acid and bile are produced. This can lead to lifelong problems such as the erosion of your eosophagus, stomach lining and heart burn problems etc. Chewing gum also does the same thing but as it is generally not done for long periods  of time or so often and also it is minimal as its not a large quantity of food or extremely palatable, it affects the body less.",False,False

People who c/s are usually doing this frequently, and because you are spitting anyway you tend to either chew for a longer amount of time or with a larger amount of food. Then, also take into account that c/s is more often than not done with 'unhealthy' foods, especially carbs. Together, this means the surfaces of your teeth end up with prolonged exposure to sugars and acids. That increases your risk for enamel loss and caries.   And of course there are the usual problems that come with not properly digesting food: if you only ever c/s, and never eat at all, you'll wind up with similar nutritional deficiencies as someone who isn't eating. Your body can still absorb some things through the mouth, such as sugar, but not everything.",False,False
