This is me too. Similar story to OP. I remember in my health class in middleschool our teacher showed us a documentary on eating disorders (it was old and only covered bulimia and anorexia, though) and it was as cookie-cutter and surface-level as it gets (one of the people the documentary followed was a ballerina, for example). I was fascinated and intrigued more than anything-- I had always had background thoughts and feelings surrounding food and eating, but never entertained or channeled them. As I got a little older and more anxious and insecure, I began to entertain these thoughts (for a while I just ate normally but had disordered thoughts, always feeling guilty and beating myself up and etc.) and then later began engaging in behaviors (fasting/calorie tracking/restriction/avoiding meals/lying about having ate/throwing away food/exercise purging). I was fascinated by eating disorders and watched anorexia documentaries, those ""my story"" videos on YouTube, and TV shows centered on weight loss/morbidly obese people, etc (what I could find on YouTube, e.g. Supersize vs. Superskinny) and just did my research in general. I tried checking out eating disorder forums, but only ever peaked because I've always been a reddit user and dislike other forum formats. I discovered reddit had an eating disorder subreddit (proED) and was a lurker for the longest time. This community &amp; YouTube videos were how I exposed myself.  My mother died (non-ED related) when I was very young (I don't remember her) and I found out (recently-ish) after I had developed disordered eating that she struggled with disordered eating as well when she was my age (she also engaged in restrictive behaviors and exercise-purged), and that hit me hard and changed my perspective/understanding of my own disordered eating",False,False

Eating disorders are caused by a chemical reaction in the brain, so even though maybe you *did* choose to do a few of the things that triggered it, you did *not* choose for your brain to fall into that disordered cycle. If you were not predisposed to develop an ED, the things you did wouldn't have given way to a full-blown eating disorder. The number on the scale, the pro-ana group chats, even the beginning of your restriction, none of that would have spiraled into a disorder if you didn't have a mental illness. It's totally not your fault. Your eating disorder is completely valid, no matter how it started.",False,False

People predisposed to eating disorders have actual differences in their brains: the reward and punishment pathways in our brains respond abnormally to eating and restriction.  If you didn't already have the mental scaffolding to support it, that stimuli would not have taken hold the way it did.  People without eating disorder genes could have been exposed to all the same things you were, and they would not develop an ED.",False,False

I really wish you so much love and happiness. You didn't deserve any of that and I hope your future is so, so much brighter than your past.   Secondly  &gt;Because it was MY choice to step on that scale, MY choice to decide to lose weight, MY choice to convince myself I was anorexic, MY choice to join those proana chats, etc.   Literally every single person on here had made every one of these choices [sorry if anyone here doesn't fit some of these bills and I'm overgeneralizing. I am admittedly particularly ignorant of BED, so I know that some of those mindsets can be different and I'm not sure how they will manifest]. Every single one of us has decided to step on a scale. Every single one of us has decided to lose weight (many of us while already at an unhealthy weight -- I know I had the same freakout when I hit triple digits. Yet I was still underweight). (Nearly) Every single one of us has decided to ""name"" what we suffer from, diagnosed or not. Every single one of us has sought out online communities of fellow sufferers. Proana was much more toxic than here (at least in my experience of having spent some time on both) but... Joining an online eating disorder community doesn't make this all your fault.   These are SYMPTOMS of the disorder. Not CAUSES. And doubting yourself into thinking you're faking it is one of the most insideous symptoms of all.  A healthy person steps on that same scale, sees that same number, and goes on with their day. They may even grab an extra helping at dinner since they realize they're underweight. A healthy person doesn't set unhealthy weight loss goals and if they try to lose weight they never consider starvation or purging to be viable options. A healthy person stumbles across a proana chat and is horrified, saddened by what they see. They feel awful for the (most often) young girls on there harming themselves. They're disgusted by the way these girls talk about themselves and others. They close the browser. They don't go back. An ED is an illness. You didn't do it to yourself.   It's a sneaky, tricky bitch of an illness that can fool you into thinking you're not ill.",False,False

As much as you think it might be your choice - it's not. It's an illusion of choice. Mine started in a similar way to yours - a brutal comment from someone I loved about my thighs and I thought, suddenly, furiously  'I will starve'. People without an ED would last only a little while, and be like 'eh I give up' and eat normally again. But that didn't happen for us, and it's not our fault.  EDs are caused by external factors that cause huge stress to build up. Your mom mentally and physically abusing you, your feeling of insecurity as a result, and the betrayal - she should know better, she should *care* better. You can't downplay how fucking devastating that is. You went to the kik groups to find people who you could relate to, and it gave you comfort to be a part of something, and that's ok. People without an ed would join the groups, and then leave after a while, losing interest. Many do.      Horrible circumstances caused your ed to develop, not you. There's no way in hell it is your fault. You were hurt, and you tried to cope as best you knew how. No one should ever blame you for that.",False,False
