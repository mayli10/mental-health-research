I am now 10 pounds away from my highest weight ever and acknowledging it makes me want to die. But, that caused me to quit stuffing my face long enough for me to feel hunger again and BOY did that feel good. I forgot how addicting restricting was because I was in a good mental place.

You see people who are in recovery demonstrating a bit of a lack of control OTT eating under the guise of recovery and freedom from restriction sometimes - you know like on YouTube, where they are eating like billions of calories of junk? (I always think - you're going to gain at a rate you can't cope with and return to vilifying types of food as 'bad' because you've gained on junk only).  &amp;#x200B;  I also think of people who start weight training with no prior gym experience and their rate of progression being super fast. Then someone who has trained for YEARS having a slower progress because it's harder to shock the body.   &amp;#x200B;  With long term restriction the long term stress on the brain and the body does lead to cracks. Often the environment also changes and doesn't support restriction as well (i.e. living with others who have trigger foods that tempt binges, or having a partner). Or being less busy, and having less time to distract yourself between your low calorie meals. A sense of failure and anguish at an inability to restrict always leads to more fails...or the gap between binges becomes much much shorter.",False,False
