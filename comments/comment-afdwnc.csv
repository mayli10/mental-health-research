The more situations you purge in (after a binge at home, after a big dinner out, purposely b/p at home, purposely b/p out at a restaurant, and so on) the more out of control it gets. Just because you did it this one time, though, doesn't mean you need to beat yourself up, and doesn't mean that it has to keep happening in the future :)  \*Warning\* unsolicited advice feel free to read or not:  My therapist told me that the most effective way to get rid of a b/p habit is to quit cold turkey . It may be scary that you feel like you're at a new low and the idea of someone telling you to ""just stop being bulimic"" sounds really dumb, but in my experience if you really commit to giving yourself the mindset of purging not being an option even after a binge, it becomes a lot easier to not feed your body things you're not comfortable keeping inside of it. I had gotten to the point where I was having heart problems from how frequently I was purging, but just ""riding out the urge"" is what helped me stop getting the urge!",False,False

Please don't go to the corner store. Drink a cup of tea. Today was bad, but you can fix it now. Sit with your feelings.",False,False
