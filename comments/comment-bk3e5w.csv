For the longest time I had myself convinced that I had no ED behaviours (even tho I'm diagnosed and actively in therapy) mainly because I feel like if I can't put words to a habit/behaviour, then it must not be ""real"". This is obviously a trick of the mind and I'm not 100% sure how to combat it yet, but something my therapist has asked me to start doing has helped a bit.   So basically she's got me filling out these cards where I write what I eat and then write a few thoughts that occured to me during that meal. For the longest time I'd eat while watching a movie to help me finish what was on my plate, but I'm just realizing this was an avoidance behaviour. Now I fill out the cards while I eat and finally I'm starting to see that I do, in fact, have an ED.   You could maybe try this excercise informally in a journal or something? Or maybe look it up, I think its a DBT excercise.",False,False
