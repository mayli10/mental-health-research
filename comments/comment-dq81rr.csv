Haha.   And yes, context does matter and that’s also exactly what I was trying to say. You just added the context shortly thereafter.  I was speaking previously in terms of general scope, but when adding context, of course we will get into more diverse and concrete debate.",False,False

You need to take it in context. I never said it's an be-all and end-all of weight management. Even if your friend is extremely ripped, which I still doubt, cause it's the internet and it's pretty easy to say your bud looks like Arnie Schwarzenegger, you're probably aware he's hardly an accurate representation of the population he shares his BMI with. Him being an outlier doesn't really discredit BMI as a tool. Again, context matters.  Now somatotypes are widely considered to be pseudo-science. :D",False,False

It’s just sort of a gauge for health. It’s nothing strict.  I’m very ectomorphic and have NEVER been a normal BMI, I’ve always been slightly under, even before my eating disorder, and I was fine.  My friend is a bodybuilder. Haha.  I would sit there and plan meals with him and we’d go over his exercise routine and even calculated the weight stuff together.   I’m not completely disagreeing with you, as it can assess future problems and current problems, but it’s not the be all and all of weight management.  If you want an accurate description, one would have to go into a Bod Pod at a hospital.",False,False

And I have a very hard time believing your personal example, too. If I'm not mistaken, Arnold Schwarzenegger had a bmi of 31 back when he was still in the prime of his bodybuilding career. So unless your buddy is a bodybuilder, he's probably just obese. Either that, or he doesn't weigh as much as he told you. But regardless, you're missing the point I made in my previous comment. Like I said, BMI is not supposed to describe looks. No, it doesn't take into account muscle mass because what it's supposed to do is assess health risks associated with being a certain weight and it can still be very trying on the body if you're incredibly muscular, like Arnie. But 99.9% of the population are also not bodybuilders, so if they get a bmi of 31. it's more than likely they're just obese and at risk for obesity-related diseases. It's still going to accurately assess the risk for the majority of people.",False,False

It’s a very outdated system nowadays and most health professionals will tell you that.   I had a buddy of mine who was lean as could be and very bulky, but his BMI was 30.  He was not obese in the slightest.   It does not account for muscle to fat ratio.",False,False

Like there’s certainly an accurate way to calculate it (like if you’re talking to people who got DXA scans then idk bodies are weird) but what most people do it the whole weight vs height thing and that really tells you nothing about body composition and is idiotic as a measurement. Like two people who are the same height and weight can look drastically different depending on which one is more muscular and where their muscle is.",False,False
