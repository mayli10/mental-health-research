It's very expensive and I kept seeing that they don't like the taste. Seafood is full of protein and I was so glad we had that for dinner today.  I never knew milk had protein. I keep avoiding dairy, I guess I should based on your eye opening reply. I also want to participate in MMA btw ðŸ˜Š  Update: Is there a certain gram on each chicken breast or product? Can I add seasoning? When I eat chicken breast I just broil it hahaha.",False,True
