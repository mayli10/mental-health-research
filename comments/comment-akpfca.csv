It’s never fulfilling. Although I do have to say there’s a weight I feel most comfortable in and that’s around my goal weight. I can walk around nude &amp; feel okay and it’s a # I cannot change even if I wanted to. ,False,False

And I was basically like...that's a rabbit hole I'm not going down. The point is for me to accept my body for what it is, not spend half my life and money trying to reach an ideal that doesn't exist and trying to find happiness in something superficial and temporary.
