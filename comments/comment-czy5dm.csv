If you ever need an accountability partner feel free to message me. I'm about to start a sugar-free cleanse just to get back on track.      I find it helps when I meal prep or fill my time around people or doing a hobby to distract myself. If its a really bad cycle, i sometimes just allow myself to binge for a while until i get so sick of it that I stop, wrote myself encouraging notes around the house and aim to turn things around. Be kind to yourself. It will stop soon.",False,False
