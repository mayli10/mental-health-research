It’s helpful and reassuring to hear about others’ experiences.   I find that my thoughts of self harm decrease as I feel hungrier and weaker. Though I think they’re both means to the same end. It’s good I’m getting help soon. I hope you can get help too.,False,True

I have realized that, though this all used to be fully about losing weight, I now restrict to make myself feel more comfortable in my life in general, and I hardly even think about losing weight anymore. Though that would be really nice, as you said. I understand.",False,False

My therapist thinks my disbelief at my condition is really coping mechanism i.e. depersonalization, but it’s honestly the cause of my most harmful symptoms. So... yay!  Good luck with your life.",False,True

Went through a severe restriction period as a young teen. 'Relapsed' about 8 months ago as an alternate form of self harm (have a history of more..traditional methods)   I often feel like I'm faking, though I think my behaviours are more self hatred than proving validity? Idk my brain is all a mess   I sincerely hope the program gives you what you need and that everyone is lovely and supportive.",False,False
