That’s what made the weight gain worth it for me; I truly savoured the food I was eating. Otherwise you’ll just feel guilty and bad, which in my experience makes getting back on track harder.",False,False

I never find it hard to get back on track as long as I’ve decided in advance which day I’m gonna do it, but if I need an extra boost I fast for a day, which functions like a reset. Everyone is different.",False,False

I went from 700 cal to 1500 cal for 5 days. I lost 0.5kg somehow? So I think if I’d stayed at 700 cal I would have lost even more.,False,False
