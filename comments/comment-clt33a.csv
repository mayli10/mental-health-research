I definitely relate, I‚Äôm not a POC, but I‚Äôm a minority and I also struggle with lack of representation within the mental health and eating disorder circles; but with posts and support from people like us, it will get better with time. üíú",False,False

I'm mixed race Latina, and I'm definitely too brown for my culture's beauty standards. My skin is too dark, my nose is too big, my body's too hairy. Seeing white beauty standards in ED communities really fucks me up because I could never look like that and I've never seen other people that look like me in them. I've never seen people like me be portrayed as pretty or an ideal. Fucks up my body dysmorphia even more and just makes me sadder",False,False

Being pretty ""for a mixed girl"" messes with me a lot. Like i'll never be properly pretty just the best of the worst. But i guess accepting what i've got helped. Like, thick curls look super cute in space buns, and maybe a curvier thicker frame means i'll always have an hourglass shape which is pretty cool  It feels so much less attainable though, since according to thinspo only models of colour can do it  But find the little things you like in yourself",False,False

Girl - you are absofuckinglutely beautiful. The media is just the media. I honestly think the POC have absolutely stunning bodies, I see African's with long, lean powerful legs, slim arms, and a feminine waist to hip ratios. Straight-up bombshell stunning. I am white and Australian, so I don't have the experience of feeling racism, but I do see POC bodies with awe and envy, in spite of the stupid 'beauty standards'. Fuck beauty standards.

I'm black, my parents are from Western Africa. I was born in Italy. It's so hard to feel valid and to seek for help in a black environment, even if I live in a ""white"" country. I completely agree with you.  Some poc feel like mental health issues are just a white people business. I hate this mentality.  You're not alone.  ‚ô°",False,False
