It doesn’t have to actually be measured (I’ll jam like 2 tbsp of food onto one - if it balances on there I’ll count it). I get such bad anxiety if I don’t.   Same with the scale! I need to eat, void etc before I weigh myself and before I eat. ",False,False

I used to also do something similar, though instead of looking in the mirror, I'd ask myself how I felt.
