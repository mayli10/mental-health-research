The case study itself identifies her as anorexic. Apparently she had a history of purging, but ironically, she probably would have been safer (at least from this particular fate, not from bulimia's other threats) as a true bulimic. Like, the real problem here was that her stomach had shrunk from anorexic restricting, and then she binged to an extreme degree and her stomach couldn't handle it and burst :( It's the same thing as happens to Prader Willi patients - they'll be medically treated with some kind of heavily restricted diet, so their stomachs finally shrink, but the second they encounter food without supervision, they binge horribly and have a gastric rupture and die.",False,False

I need a way to keep this possibility in mind without literally having to look at her to remind myself. It's only when I'm full do I think, ""Oh shit...""",False,False
