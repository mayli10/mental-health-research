I have tried many different antipsychotics over the years for bipolar disorder. Risperdal, Geodon, Seroquel, and Saphris all caused weight gain. Seroquel was the worst. I gained almost 30 pounds in one year.  I finally went on Fanapt. This was the only drug that did not cause any weight gain and had minimal side effects. Risperdal has a crapload of side effects. I wish I had known how toxic it was before I started taking it.",False,False

Two causes for weight gain: they are known to cause munchies (this is the main cause of weight gain that people deal with).  The second cause is a side effect that messes up your metabolism, but this is not common!!  Every medication has a list of side effects, that doesn‚Äôt mean you will experience them!",False,False

They can increase appetite though mine didn‚Äôt. I think quetiapine might lead to weight loss sometimes (but not sure about olanzapine and again, didn‚Äôt happen to me).
