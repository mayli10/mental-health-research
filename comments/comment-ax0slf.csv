I think I’m “lucky,” my 2 front teeth are fakes after I knocked them out of my head when I was 9 years old. Make sure you are not immediately brushing your teeth after a purge. Use sensodyne toothpaste, a soft bristle toothbrush, maybe ACT mouthwash (it has fluoride, may help with enamel) most importantly make an appointment with a dentist ASAP and confess what is going on. They can help make a plan to save the rest of your tooth.",False,False
