I thought I was supposed to be gently led to my own conclusions not told “figure it out” or straight up “do this.”",False,False

For me too, I haven't thought about my purpose for the same reason as you when you were younger- I'm just focusing on school now and I'll see what life has in store for me later. I was thinking about finding a new therapist, and maybe one that is more ED focused since that is becoming more of a problem for me lately.",False,True

Before that when I was in high school and college, things were simpler, I just focused on enjoying life and surviving school, knowing that worrying about my career and who I would become and what life would be like as an adult would come later on its own.  &amp;#x200B;  I would try to find a different therapist as this one clearly isn't helping you. When you are seeing the right therapist, they will ask you questions that will really make you look inward and look at your feelings a different way, and not in a way that is frustrating like you are describing. I think the best thing I can say about my therapist is that she finds ways to help me really question the eating disorder voice in a way I can't on my own, because my ED voice tends to infiltrate even the logic centers of my brain when it's particularly strong.",False,False
