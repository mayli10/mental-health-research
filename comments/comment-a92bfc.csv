I hated them I middle/early high school, but Iâ€™ve come to embrace them in adulthood! Itâ€™s just frustrating because I was already so small and now theyâ€™re smaller! I also feel like others look better with a small chest? Like mine donâ€™t seem proportionate to the rest of my body to me ",False,True

I naturally carry my weight in my thighs and butt and have been small chested my whole life! Now I guess Iâ€™m just even smaller chested ,False,True

Same for me though, except the biggest mine ever were was an A cup. Now they're even smaller than that and kinda 'empty' looking cause there's just no fat around to fill them out, still got the belly pudge and the upper thigh jiggles tho. Great!",False,False

Idk what my exact current size is, but I feel like any weight I gained would go to my stomach and thighs before it would my boobs. It's sort of weird, I like seeing other girls with small boobs, but on me it just feels wrong.  If you're looking for a solution, I have heard that topical estrogen creams can increase your breasts by a cup size, but I've never tried them myself.",False,False
