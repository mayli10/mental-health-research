Poor body image is an awful thing to go through. It’s a problem I’m sure everyone goes through at one point or another, though some people do have it worse than others. I’ll assume there’s more at play here than poor body image though, given this is on an ED subreddit, but correct me if I’m mistaken.  The first thing you should know is to not overdo anything. I know you feel like an imposter in your own body, and that’s normal. But you can’t rush back into things, otherwise you risk the very problem this sub deals primarily with. I mainly restricted, over-exercise wasn’t part of my plan. But for a lot of people it is, and it’s a rabbit hole that makes recovery so much harder.  Take it slow, this stuff takes time, but if you rush it you put yourself through so much more hurt. Have you had any thoughts about harming yourself. I don’t mean physically, like cutting, but if bulimia or restricting?",False,False
