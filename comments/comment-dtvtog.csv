This helps me not go too crazy at the holiday event. I have also tried not to have the snacks/appetizers before dinner and not to start drinking until just before dinner. I’ll have flavored seltzer or something to help with cravings and so I don’t raise suspicions. Then at dinner I’ll take everything I want but only enough that it actually fits on one plate. Then no second plates. And I try to only have foods that are “worth it” to me. Like I don’t need a buttered roll on my napkin on thanksgiving. There are more exciting foods to eat. For dessert, which I love, I take a few bites of all the options I want.   Doesn’t work every time but usually I don’t leave holidays feeling as horrible and fat as I used to. (I’m 30– older than I think most people here— I’ve been at this a while)",False,False
