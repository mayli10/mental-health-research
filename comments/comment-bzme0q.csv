If you're deemed at a healthy/over weight then it'll be bulimia diagnosed.    Some doctors/psychs are woke enough not to use bmi cutoffs as a Black &amp; White standard.   But ye that's literally the only difference...",False,False

I could be wrong lol so please feel free to correct me,False,False
