Talks about how much creatine to take and all that jazz. Very scientific and has studies to back up what he is saying : https://youtu.be/QSPmsqYRL2Y  I got my info from him. It took me about a week for the scale to go back down after it went up 2lbs. But I work out like crazy , cardio in the morning and heavy weights at night. I have a co worker who does light cardio and light lifting (below 30lbs) and she says the scale started moving again after 9-11 days. ",False,False

Also if there is going to be water retention exactly how much and for how long can I expect it to last? ",False,True

I usually aim between 100oz and 150oz of water per day. Just for the first week do between 15g or 20g of creatine and after the week do 5g per day. ,False,False

Apparently it’s not subcutaneous water retention (the one just below the skin that makes us look fat). The water retention happens in the muscles, which apparently would make them look bigger/firmer and it’s why you have to drink extra water with Creatine because you’re at bigger risk of dehydration.  So the water retention from Creatine will make the scale go up but supposedly won’t make you look fat. Also the article said if you do look fat it might be more related to your sodium intake than the Creatine ",False,False
