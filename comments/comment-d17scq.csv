I clearly remember one time when I had a breakdown, and I was crying violently on the floor. I wrapped my arms around myself and whispered “it’s fine, you’ll be okay” repeatedly. I was rocking back and forth and I it felt like I was in a trance, and like it was my ED saying those words, holding me and making me feel a false sense of hope.",False,False

I feel like I can't leave ED. He's been there when no one else was and he knows me, he listens to me, he's truly my only friend. He helped me so much, and when I actually do what he wants me to do we go along and everything is fine. Other times it's like fighting a battle that I will lose either way because there's no win with ED. Still, I believe him, because he told me that one day, when I'll be at that specific number, we'll be happy, and I'll stop being miserable. But in the meantime ED is causing me nothing but distress, anxiety and depression.",False,False
