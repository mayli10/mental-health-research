Iâ€™ve had a psychiatrist tell me Iâ€™d look better if I gained weight, and I donâ€™t understand why supposed professionals think itâ€™s okay to say something like that at all? But especially to someone with an eating disorder??  Iâ€™m sorry she was so rude. Glad you wonâ€™t be seeing her again!",False,False

I have really big boobs and I almost got a reduction a few years ago. When my weight gets lower they get a lot smaller and it's such a relief on my back. I would rather be flat-chested.

I've had a couple of long-term relationships and I'm in one now for the past 8 years, and I have no desire to appear sexy to the rest of the world lol.

She made it seem like I should prioritize my boyfriend's aesthetic preferences over my own (and for the record, that was her own assumption.
