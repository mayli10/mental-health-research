No one needs to run in a 3 ft. diameter circle for four hours just to burn Calories and no other reason",False,False

It is not so much that the exercise itself is a certain way, but rather that the exercise was started out of some sort of self-hating behavior. That's where it becomes unhealthy.  ""You're running again? You're sick; take a break.""  ""Aww :( I really love running!"" &lt;- not disordered  ""I'm a fat whore and if I don't run then..."" &lt;- disordered",False,False

I'm exercising 4 times a week (twice a day on two of those days). Some might say that's not over-exercising or compulsive, but the reason I think it is, is because when I skip a session, I literally feel like I'm going to put on 5kg instantly. If I don't go to the gym I actually feel like shit. I think I use exercise as a way to compensate for what I ate during the day.  I guess a good way to tell is asking yourself ""would I mind if I was not allowed to do any exercise anymore?""",False,False

If somebody runs five miles everyday because they love it and they make sure to fuel their body enough to allow for such vigorous training, it's a hobby, not a disorder.   If somebody runs five miles a day to ""work off"" or ""earn"" a completely normal meal, or to counteract a binge, that's disordered.",False,False

It pains me to see people running with bleeding feet, with an ace wrap on, with an ankle brace.   Feeling like you can't to eat until you ""earn"" it is disordered :\   Idfk on the last one. Exercising because you feel bad about eating? Idk. Some behaviors are so boarderline. Or maybe our society is just a piece of work. :\ so maybe on this one, it just depends how bad it effects you.",False,False

For example, running an hour 4 times a week - not obsessive. Running in inclement weather just to burn calories and taking calories into consideration over safety - obsessive, possible exercise purge-y behavior.",False,False

I am going to start hitting the gym daily because I am slacking a bit and just restricting won't give me the results I want as fast as I want. Also, when I am the gym I have no appetite so I guess that's a plus. I think if you exercise and try to go beyond your limints.. then it is a bit much?",False,False
