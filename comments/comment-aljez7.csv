We understand here. Maybe consider just educating your friend a bit on how the majority of a diagnosis isn't about weight. About how there are other forms of anorexia and bulimia that don't necessarily involve being underweight. Misinformation can be deadly. If she still doesn't understand, then I'm sorry. Lots of love to you",False,False

Its easy with an ED to feel like I'm overreacting and dont need help but youre right. I don't need anyone's permission to have an ED.   Luckily my city has one of the few free specialist ED clinics in the UK. They'll know what to do and I'm not gonna tell them what I think I should have. Theyre the experts. ,False,True

I have ADHD and I cannot tell you how endlessly frustrated I am being invalidated by people who say ‚Äúmedication is just a crutch‚Äù, ‚ÄúADHD don‚Äôt real‚Äù ‚ÄúAdderall is just legal meth‚Äù and other unnecessary judgmental bullshit. But the truth is, I don‚Äôt need the permission of others to have ADHD. Just like you don‚Äôt need permission to have an eating disorder.   If you want to seek treatment, just be honest about your symptoms with your care provider. They can diagnose you based on your current symptoms, because your diagnosis is not a value assessment of your identity but rather the starting point for whichever treatment options will fit you best. Anorexia may necessitate some specific treatment options you might not need at this time (refeeding stuff).   If you don‚Äôt feel like you want recovery, then it doesn‚Äôt really matter what you label your disordered eating in your own head. ",False,False

I just want to be recognised as someone with an eating disorder. My eating is not normal and friends and family do not acknowledge that unless you can see it.

Perhaps it depends which country you're in but I posted about this and a couple of people commented saying they'd told their GP, and been referred for CBT therapy.
