However, I think disordered eating is something everyone is dealing with: I figure most people are not out here eating healthfully, in appropriate amounts, without thinking about it.

It's when it interrupts functioning in your life that it becomes a diagnosable problem.  Eating disorders are not super rare (like the other poster said prevalence is typically like 2-4% lifetime risk, so if you know 25-50 people, chances are at least 1 has/had an ED)  but then if you're in certain populations- like college- the prevalence on having an ED is higher.",False,False

So it's fairly rare. Having an unhealthy relationship might not be enough to get a diagnosis/ not the same as having an ED. But I do think a large amount of people are not diagnosed.,False,False
