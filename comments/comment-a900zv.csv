I'm staying at my parents' right now (voluntarily, but still) and I swear, the refrigerator is:  * Literally 50% cheese. Nobody in the world could possibly need this much cheese. * All of the dairy products are low or full fat, including my beloved greek yogurt and cottage cheese * All of the meat products are things like salami or pork with a million grams of fat * All of the starches in the entire house have either no fiber or are prepared in some kind of fat * Vegetables and fruits are extremely limited * There is an entire cabinet full of snacks. 50% of it is Tastykakes. There are lots of ""snack bars"", all of them are like full-fat, peanut butter or sugary and loaded with chocolate. None of them are high fiber or high protein. * Dinner last night concludes with a round of dessert foods my grampa brought from Maine. I was hungrier after eating them than before I ate them. FFFFFFFFFFFFFF.  Right now my dad is cooking breakfast. Scrapple and whole eggs. RIP. Least I'm going to get to go to a spin class this morning and offset some of the damage and I can probably get away with restricting most of the day. But damn I just get so hungry when I'm at this house. Going from a high fiber, high protein, low fat diet to the opposite is just brutal for satiety.  &amp;#x200B;  Unsurprisingly, had nightmares last night about getting fat already. Readying myself for a few more days of that. Or dreams where I binge uncontrollably.",False,False

But honestly we deserve at least one or two days of happiness so I say fuck my ED im going to eat what i want and enjoy it. A few bad days can't outweigh months of progress.",False,False
