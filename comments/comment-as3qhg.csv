Recovering was pretty easy back then because most of my weight loss was due to me being horribly miserable and stressed out over school so when I graduated my recovery happened pretty naturally. (aaand now 2 years later I'm kinda sorta relapsing but that's a different story)  Everyone's recovery is different, and everyone needs different things to get themselves out of this fucking mess. Don't feel like you shouldn't have gotten treatment.  I guess it's mostly mentally, but it's physically challenging because clothing just doesn't fit me right (even in L's and XL's).
