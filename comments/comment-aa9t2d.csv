She started off by asking what size I am in Express (i have no idea, I haven’t shopped there in at least 10 years),  and then follow that up by saying her husband bought her a sweater there, it was size large and WAY too big for her, did she think it might fit me?  BITCH.  She’s at least 3 inches taller and 20lbs or more heavier than me, but it threw me off for a couple of days wondering if anyone could mistake me for being bigger than her!   On the plus side, my mom ordered this really beautiful long wool coat as a Christmas present for my other sister. When it arrived she saw it had come from China and was way too small.  Everyone tried it on and it only fit me!  Even my super skinny cousin couldn’t wear it because the sleeves were too short. ",False,False

People with the same height and weight can look very different based on where they hold most of their fat.  One may have a great stomach but worse legs or vice versa.    Wrists are the same way.

Even if I try to move my fitbit down my wrist by 2-3 cm it needs to go up at least one notch.   I mean my BMI is like 22.5 (new scale, and I have a higher than expected bodyfat RIP) and I have to use the smallest hole on my Fitbit (which is a small size wristband anyway).
