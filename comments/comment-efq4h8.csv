Gleefully scamming her followers, lashing out at people who dont comply with her demands for food, neglecting her pets (most recently, her dog was very sick and instead of taking it to a vet, she went to Chili's), constantly tearing down her gf... and the complete list is much longer than this. If she was 'just' fat, she'd be far less entertaining.",False,False
