With the years I've discovered some root causes of my ED that differ from the stereotypical causes.   Since I was 11/12 yo I felt subtly uglier than my classmates, especially with my wide face PLUS my thin ""wild"" hair. So I decided to compensate for this with weight loss. First it worked perfectly fine. I gained ""confidence"" and loved the control I had over my appearance. No need to mention that ED at that age are no sustainable way of life. In recovery I felt like they took my one and only way to cope with my appearance. After that I felt uglier than EVER before, nothing to compensate for my hair anymore.  Now, over 10 years later,  I live with EDNOS, I found some peace with my flaws but the ED habits stick with me. I still hate my hair, I tried to recover for nearly 2 years, ate a bunch of hair friendly food and guess what - it did not change much! I came to the belief that it is mostly genetically determined how it looks and feels. Nonetheless, eating better was a nice experience. Everyday I try to find a balance between my desire to stay skinny and not ruining my body.",False,True

My hair is a huge source of anxiety for me re: my appearance, I'm not confident in it at all, and I *hate* the idea that it might look greasy or thin - and I think you've just made me realise that it's because I associate thin/lank/greasy hair with being overweight.  I mean, in general I think I heavily associate being overweight with not taking care of my appearance, and so there are other things I associate with being overweight by relation. There are certain types of makeup and clothes that I associate with being overweight too, even if they're not objectively bad or have anything to do with weight.  I think a lot of us feel a lot of pressure to be perfect in our presentation as compensation for the way we feel about our weight, so if we feel ""off"", we feel really gross and terrible, even if nobody else really notices or thinks we look bad on, say, a bad hair day or a no-makeup day.",False,False
