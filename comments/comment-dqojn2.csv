On a ""good"" day, I can restrict with pride. On a high anxiety day, it is a form of punishment and self-hatred for being a failure.",False,False

Food has been a form of control throughout my life, whether through restricting or overeating. Up until a few years ago I would binge eat throughout the day. Then I tried to become more consistent and healthy with my eating, and it turned into heavy restriction. As I became ""normal"" weight and started to get skinnier, I focus on my weight a lot more. I feel as if my looks are one thing I can control. There are times when I do not restrict as much, but I think of every bite I eat and blame not being skinny enough for my problems. Unlovable? Scared? Lonely? It will all improve once I am underweight, so I tell myself. When my life feels most out of control, I either heavily restrict or eat with a less intense restriction and lament about how my life is falling apart. Either way, my eating and control issues are one in the same.",False,False

When I'm doing my safe routines and rituals around food, it makes me feel so much more in control of my life.",False,False

What and if I eat is entirely tied to how I feel. If things are okay I can justify being more ortho, or at least if I’m restricting I get that high and the feeling of being perfect or some shit.   But then when I’m feeling rejected or like a failure or alone or angry, then it’s furious and definitely self harm.   Crazy how I can justify it no matter the mood, but it definitely feels a little different. Getting the high of fasting vs the emotional blunting of using it to cover pain.",False,False
