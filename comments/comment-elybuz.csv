I've been meaning to go for ages but I didn't have anyone to go with/never got around to it/didn't have time before now/etc'?

Orrrr, you shouldn’t do something you’re going to be very uncomfortable doing so you can suggest something else. One thing to consider, do you want to go to his house? If yes, suggest a board game night instead or movie night (say you’re working on a recipe you’d like to perfect before letting him try it). If no, suggest something like bowling or ice skating (say you’ve been dyyyyying to go, that it’s been so long and he looks like he’d be good lol).",False,False
