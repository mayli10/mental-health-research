I also play make-up with whatever deficit is left using unbalanced liquid calories. :/  Besides the obvious distraction techniques, e.g. eating while watching a show, maybe try flavouring foods past palatable? (they're already un-enjoyable, so what the hey) Too much spice, too many conflicting herbs, too much salt, too much everything. Heat extremes too sometimes. Depending on the food, whatever tricks work for you to distract your brain from the texture.  Your tongue can still feel burning, so maybe try too many chili flakes in your sauce the next time you try eating spaghetti? :P  I can still enjoy the bite of mustard, so I slather it on most everything. Make it actually **taste** like something.  &amp;#x200B;  If nothing else, you're not alone, eh. :)",False,False
