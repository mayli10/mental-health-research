I cannot eat without distraction  - small spoons and forks only  - everything has to be eaten as slowly as possible. typically this involves disassembling food (ie mac n cheese but eaten 1 noodle at a time)  - sauce/dressing/grease must be scraped off  - foods should not touch other foods! no green beans touching my chicken!!!!",False,False

For example if we’re having chicken with peas and bread, I have to leave a bit of chicken, some peas, and some bread on my plate.   I also cut everything up in tiny pieces and for some reason I prefer to eat things directly from the container rather than on a plate/bowl.",False,False

The other night my friends were grilling and they had grilled shishito peppers and I was ripping them apart to get the seeds out with my hands and realized that it was prolly rude to do this...

I’m eating grapes, blueberries and watermelon rn...and I ate the blueberries first, then grapes and now I have the watermelon left...  I think it’s because we wanna savor what little food we have!  I eat any warm foods super spicy and hot in temp so it takes longer to eat. I will literally re heat my food 2-3 times while eating it. My roommate/bf finds this funny. (She knows about my ed and I fucking love her to pieces because she’s been very understanding)  I eat with a tiny spoon and tiny fork.  I take lots of water breaks so the meal lasts longer.",False,False

I know it’s gross, but tbh it’s one of the least gross things I do for my fucked relationship to food so idgaf. I try not to do it in public, but there have definitely been a few drunken episodes where I have publicly hamfisted a serving of lasagna right into my fat mouth.   Kinda related, but I try not to take bites out of food. Like I’ll tear off bits of a sandwich instead of biting right into it. Saliva freaks me out (says the girl literally putting all her fingers directly into her mouth when she eats anything) and the idea of my spit soaking into the sandwich when I bite it is just too repulsive to me.   I have to disassemble all of my food. Like that Kourtney Kardashian video of her eating a kit kat, biting off the chocolate sides, separating the wafers, etc. But because I’m the world’s biggest moron, I have to go 100 with everything. It takes me an entire lifetime to eat a fucking granola bar because I have to tear off every individual grain of puffed rice, every singular nut, every separate molecule of chocolate chip, etc.   Tl;dr: I’m weird and gross and I should not be allowed in public.",False,False
