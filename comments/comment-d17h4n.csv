Every time she comes and visits she obsesses over how small I‚Äôve gotten and despite the fact that we‚Äôre like the same size - we can share clothes - she won‚Äôt. stop. commenting. I‚Äôm not ‚Äúout‚Äù about my ED but I‚Äôve made it clear that it makes me uncomfortable but it just seems to not be a big deal for her. For someone who talks about how much she‚Äôs achieved through therapy and doctors she triggers the fucking shit out of me without a second though,False,False

My best (and only) college friend goes on about how little she eats. Like, ‚Äúoh, I haven‚Äôt eaten since yesterday,‚Äù or, ‚ÄúI just can‚Äôt eat more than a few bites of this.‚Äù And at the same time brings big bags of candy and chips to school. It used to be that I would end up eating a bunch of it and she‚Äôd eat none. That changed and now I always refuse it but it‚Äôs so tempting. I also plan out my calories for the day and so I bring them to school with me and she makes comments about how ‚Äú_leastofthese_ always has so much food, she loves her snacks!‚Äù As I eat my sad ED meals/snacks. But somehow also nags me if she doesn‚Äôt see me eating?? It‚Äôs triggering af. I can‚Äôt avoid her because we take most of the same upper levels together (about to graduate), but luckily this semester I‚Äôm only taking one class. I don‚Äôt plan on continuing the friendship after graduation so that‚Äôs good. Just one more semester. But holy fuck is it triggering üíÄ",False,False

My friend who I stay with would walk around with just her bra even though she knows how insecure I am about my body. She would talk out loud about how she thinks if she were to go on a diet, she would have abs. Sometimes the only thing you can do is to block them out and distance yourself from such people. You do not need negativity in your life. Just stop hanging out with them if possible.",False,False

He's soooo skinny. Just. So. SKINNY. And I feel bad for feeling bad/jealous over his eating habits bc he's also confessed to having disordered eating in the past but like. He was just always like... Done.  He was always finished with his food before he was actually finished with it, to the point where I wasn't sure if it was how he actually felt bc it didn't seem to matter how big or small the meal was, he would usually stop about halfway through. Unless he made it himself I'm realising. Meanwhile I have the opposite problem, where I'm forcing myself to finish food even if I'm full bc I feel wasteful if I don't (and also bc I'm totally using a social situation as an excuse to overeat so if I don't make the most of it now I don't know when I'll be able to again ooppppp)  We did laundry together and I was holding a pair of his jeans and I just. I literally can't imagine how someone's legs can be so small. I was like ""oh don't go down that rabbit hole"" so I didn't get too badly triggered but it sure did make me feel like a tiny bit of a failure lmao.  Everyone I know from the friendship circle I met him thru is so skinny. It's outrageous. They're all super nice about it and... tbh... all of them have exhibited a disordered relationship with food, and they all acknowledge it, too. So it's not like I feel like ""the fat friend"" or anything. But like. I am LMAO. and they're all so attractive and can fit into any clothes they want to and some of the trans friends in the group are having such an easier time transitioning bc of it and it's like... I Want What They Have lol",False,False

She‚Äôs constantly doing little things that remind me how fat I am and can tell she thinks it‚Äôs gross. Like moving her cup to the opposite cup holder further away from me when I get into the car. Or pulling her legs up to ‚Äúgive me room‚Äù to walk past even when there‚Äôs already like 3 feet of space üòë She also always wants to get junky food when we‚Äôre hanging out but talks about how she doesn‚Äôt want to get McDonald‚Äôs but it‚Äôs so easy and just once in a while. Yeah once in a while is always with me. I‚Äôm the fat friend she hangs out with when she wants to have a ‚Äúcheat day‚Äù. Even worse is that I told her about the same situation I had with an ex-friend and how much it hurt me. Now she‚Äôs doing the exact same thing =/   Really trying to spend less and less time with her but it‚Äôs easier said than done.,False,False
