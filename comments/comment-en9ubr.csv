I was at a psychiatrist about some other stuff and I overshared some of the ED related stuff  cause I wasn't thinking I have any kind of real ED (or that I'm deserving of treatment for it even when I say the truth) and wanted help for something else. She diagnosed me with unspecified ED along with what I was worried about and sent me to a specialist who wants me to start outpatient treatment and since that day my restricting and binging have been strictest ever cause of that same feeling that I'm a fake, that now I have to keep it forever, that it's not real if I do go to outpatient program before I get really really sick. It's scary.",False,False

Damn, you put it into words that my malnourished brain couldn't do itself. Let me just go add a variation of that into my letter for my counsellor. Seriously though, it's a bitch of a feeling.",False,False

People at work found me out about a year ago and now I feel so stuck it’s awful. But also I know they’d be super happy if things got better.,False,False

Like now I’m branded with the ‘eating disorder’ stamp and my outward behaviour and appearance needs to represent that in case people think I’m fake/doing it for attention/weak etc. I know logically they’d just be glad that I was trying to recover but yes, definitely disordered and definitely a feeling of being trapped!",False,True

Turns out eating disorders are...disordered.   It was not a nice feeling. Kind of a feeling of...being trapped? I’m sorry you’re having a similar emotional experience.,False,False
