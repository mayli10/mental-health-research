Maybe you should just sit him down and say ""I've tried to tell you this. You need to stop making comments on other people. It is really really harmful for my mental health. I want to still have a friendship with you, but I'm reaching a limit. Next time you make a comment like that I'm going to have to take a break from seeing you for a while. I need to take care of my mental health.""  If he doesnt get it even after taking a break he might just be self absorbed and you dont realize it yet. No shade to you, that's how I am with most relationships. Good luck ❤",False,False

Like, hanging out for days at a time and pretty much living together the entirety of the fwb days. He makes effort to spend time with me. He knows me better than anyone else, and generally I’d say he is a good friend, but I have done a lot for him. He can’t really reciprocate because I refuse help but I know if he could return the favor, he would. I’m hoping he’ll just accept he’s not gonna get what he wants all the time and the comments will stop.",False,True

I’m torn on how to confront him because while it makes me feel horrible every time I hear him saying those comments, I like how it pushes me to restrict and fast more. I know that’s not healthy but it’s hard to take something like that away from my ED without worrying I’ll start gaining.",False,True

He makes you feel like a last choice, and just from this post to me it sounds like he is just trying to use you but you're trying to not let that happen. When he isn't making those comments, are you guys generally good friends? Basically, do you feel it is worth your mental health to continue trying to fix the relationship?",False,False

I'm not saying ghost him entirely, but if you've talked to him about it and he still hasn't gotten the message, it's time to take a break from him.  If he asks why, tell him why. No drama, just ""I can't be around you unless you stop saying those things."" Don't bicker with him, don't justify yourself, he doesn't need to understand your situation, he only needs to understand how to shut up.  He'll either get the picture or he's not worth putting up with.",False,False

He seems oblivious about his impact and I’ve told him that it makes me upset but he still slips up. Like, he’s the “just eat” type. I really wanna see the best in him and keep him as a friend but if it keeps happening I’ll end contact.",False,True
