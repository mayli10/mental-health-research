I’m going to get another scan in a couple of months and one part of me doesn’t want to lose anymore muscle, but the other part is like “well if my results are worse then it means I’m succeeding”. Ugh   Thank you &lt;3 you too.",False,True

It sounds like you’re having multiple sources of info/data/assessment that say your body is deteriorating, particularly with regard to muscle atrophy. Which sounds a bit scary, especially from a quality-of-life standpoint.   That the disorder will make my brain excited by my body slowly disintegrating, that it congratulates me on my strength while it’s stealing my life away, that things feel like gold stars when they’re truly red flags...I think this is part of why EDs are such insidious and deadly things. Reading your post, my feelings are all over the map depending on which part of my brain has the upper hand. It’s so hard to find the path forward....to *want* to find that path. Wishing you peace of both body and mind. &lt;3",False,False
