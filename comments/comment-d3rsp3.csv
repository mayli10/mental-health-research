The restaurant is really small and my bosses are basically my friends, so they expect you to eat a full lunch because otherwise they will ask you why you didn’t finish your meal. We also get slices of cakes at the end of the day, so I try to decline, but every time I get flooded with: “are you sure? Do you want this one maybe? Or a brownie? Want to share? Really? No? Oh! You are so strict with yourself!! I wish I could be like that, then I would have lost weight like you!!!!” Yeah, they also follow my fucking weightloss like hawks.  You should maybe try and bring your own food? Then you can portion control the whole thing and package it away if you don’t eat it all.",False,False
