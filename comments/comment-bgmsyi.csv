I never get it, like I'm happy and enjoying life and food and then out of nowhere the ED thoughts come in and tell you the party is over. Like bitch fuck off and yet I always reluctantly go back. Logic ðŸ™ƒ  The only advice I have is to try and remember how you felt when you restricted and had to be so strict with yourself. Then contrast it with how you felt on your trip. Was the restriction and suffering worth being at the lower weight. We're you actually happier?  Maybe keep this vacation version of yourself going a little longer and see where it takes you. You can always go back but I think if you remember the positives of not restricting and letting go they may out weigh the negatives of some weight gain.",False,False
