I'm sorry he was like that with you, sorry you've ended up with disorders. I'm just sorry for it all. Do they know what they cause when they're like this I wonder? Do they even care. Unlikely.",False,True

My dad instilled fear to me so much as well that I suspected it became the root for all the issues and disorders I had now. My father once made me kneel on a pile of rock salt with heavy books on my hand and if my hands were lowering he'll whip me with his belt. He threatened me multiple times that he will kick me out and disown me to the point he throws my clothes and belongings outside the house. He abused me alot verbally, belittled me and gave me threats whenever I made ""errors"" like my grades were lower but still passing and decent, when he found out I was dating a guy and when I came home late from strict unreasonable curfews. Whenever I heard him say ""let's talk"" I cant help but panic and be anxious like what did I do wrong shit even if most of the time he's just gonna talk about something random. ",False,False
