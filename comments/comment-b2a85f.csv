[The Compendium of Physical Activities][cpa] is used to ""standardize the MET intensities used in various physical activity questionnaires [in epidemiologic and surveillance studies]"", and even [running very slowly (~10min/mi)](https://sites.google.com/site/compendiumofphysicalactivities/Activity-Categories/running) is [more intense than swimming](https://sites.google.com/site/compendiumofphysicalactivities/Activity-Categories/water-activities). Even after accounting for water resistance, not having to constantly accelerate and decelerate your whole body mass is going to be more efficient.   Where swimming comes out ahead is the sustainable volume - it's much easier to swim many hours a day than run the same amount if you're not an elite with years of training behind you.

Seriously.   I've dealt with hemorrhoids for YEARS. Take a garlic clove, cut it in half (you need to cut it so it releases its juice). Press it on your hemorrhoid and keep it on there as long as you can stand it. 20 mins if you can. IT WILL BURN LIKE A MFER. BUT IT WORKS.  Pop an Advil to get the swelling down and then take a nice warm bath (the water also will soothe the garlic sting).  I've had hemorrhoids go away after doing it once but if they're bad, repeat the next day.  Go easy on the heavy lifting and squats as they heal.  Good luck! ",False,False
