I totally understand that response. Seeing it shared by a 30 something year old very obese woman set me off as it felt like eating disorders were being appropriated in a really weird fashion to justify the normal act of eating food and enjoying a great on the holidays. (No intention to insult the woman who posted it.)  It frustrated me, I posted it and went to sleep and woke up to a lot of hate messages, which in highsight though I felt the wording was pretty unnecessary, I do understand the hurt and I will try look more into the original context in which things were posted, not just looking at who shared them.  Thanks again and all the best. :)",False,False

Yes, her wording was cringey and baby-ish, but seriously so what? Who is being hurt because she's simplifying her thought process using cutesy words? The thing that upset me is that people are actually commenting complaining about the word 'nourish'. What the hell? Nourishment is actually the REASON you're supposed to eat. Nourish is a good word to use to get yourself into a positive mindset about eating. And yet people are acting like it's a joke that she's using the word nourish to justify eating. Honestly, I think it's really low to make fun of a recovering ED sufferer. I don't care if she needs to use cutesy words or even mental gymnastics to get herself to eat.

It's one thing to critique the post inside an ED community, questioning its validity, but bringing it into a anti-fat community is incredibly harmful to people in recovery. Accepting fullness is HUGE in ED recovery. I had a total meltdown this Thanksgiving, because I was full and wanted to purge it all. I had to reach out to friends and my boyfriend for support. That's what that post was addressing. But seeing it on r-fatlogic, with dozens of people telling me, ""no, you're just a moron justifying your overeating"" was so triggering.

I read that post a couple hours before seeing this one and I'll admit I put a little bit of thought into whether it was appropriate for their sub or not, but ultimately I think it is. The message itself goes along with a lot of the core concepts of recovery but it's just no coincidence that it was worded and toned in the exact manner that FAs speak. Recovery and ED resources don't use those sorts of terms, or purposely speak in infantilizing manners.   I don't even necessarily agree w her example of someone complaining they ""ate too much"", honestly people shouldn't be eating past the point of fullness. And it DEFINITELY won't give you a ""happy tummy""... you'll just feel sick. I also don't agree anyone should make a habit of ""nourishing their minds and souls"" with food like indicated in the post. I could see why someone on this sub may be offended but you need to remember a large part of the world is facing an obesity epidemic right now and it is NOT healthy or ok to be encouraging ppl to eat past their hunger cues or eat to fill an emotional/spiritual void. That's a straight path to binge eating disorder. That's not to say I'm encouraging eating disorders or restricting but there is actually a middle ground between starvation and recklessly eating whatever you want. Recovery from eating disorders should not be rigid, but nonetheless people in recovery still need to know when to parent themselves. Eating 5000 cal binges of icecream and pizza daily is not recovery from an ED imo, just a transition to a new one.",False,False

But back about 2-3 years ago, It focused on two things. **1)** Calling people out who rejected CICO and believed in fad diets. **2)** Calling people out who tried to promote body positivity / HAES / Ragen Chastain.  A typical post would be like this: Screenshot of a facebook post from an overweight person saying ""Fuck skinny people! You can't be happy and enjoy food like me."" and then replies from the fatlogic community saying the person from facebook doesn't have a healthy relationship with food and if they feel the need to take to social media just to bitch about other people's existence, maybe their not as happy as they claim to be.",False,False

No one was bashing it because it was a recovery post, but because the infantilizing language and focus on ""tummies"". The way it was worded, filled with buzz words like diet culture and nourished, felt fake, forced, and insincere. The baby talk and  (what feels like to me) the disregard for the negative feelings associated with Thanksgiving from a disordered point of view isn't helpful, but more insulting.   The post seems to fit into r/fatlogic probably just because the overuse of buzzwords and distorted focus feels like it was written from more of a fat positive sort of perspective as opposed to a recovery one.

The mockery wasn't for the message but for the delivery. It does read more like the normal FA/HAES shit than legit ED recovery support because of how it was worded. I'm sorry if that kind of language works for you and I really support you in doing what you but fir me personally...that language does not work for me, I find it infantalising, dumb, and offensive.   &amp;#x200B;  Again I think the mockery was for the wording because so much of it reads like FA/HAES stuff where they use 'tummy' because they think its cuter and 'nourished' is often code for overeating and imho I don't like this kind of thing because I think it is a way for chronic over-eaters, binge eaters, compulsive/emotional eaters to deny they have a problem with food, deny that they are overweight/obese and deny that it's affecting their life and health and they need to change. It's just as dangerous as the old school proana cliques telling each other 500 calories a day is totally sustainable and praising each other's bones and saying you can totally be fine if you just take a multivitamin or something. As someone who is a compulsive overeater/binge eater/swinging around every eating and compensatory behaviour under the sun I like having a check of 'hey, this behaviour isn't okay and isn't healthy and you need to address it' which is the total opposite of what FA/HAES preach.  &amp;#x200B;  If it was just written as you had wrote it, with those tags, I doubt it would of had the same reception. because the content of the message when directed at recovering anorexics?

I wanted to explain a bit further why I shared it, but first I wanted to sincerely apologise for the upset and hurt it's caused you. It wasn't my intention to upset anyone, but that doesn't negate the effect it's clearly had, and I am genuinely sorry for that.  I have had serious problems with food my entire life. I used to be underweight and restricting severely, then someone hurt me very badly and I gained a huge amount of weight and became obese. I now have a much happier relationship with my body, and I am a healthy weight, but it is still a daily struggle for me. I subscribe to both groups like fat logic, and eating disorder recovery groups.  I felt that the post I shared, which I had found through pro fat acceptance tags, was very poorly worded and harmful in itself. My issues with food go both ways, and I found the language disturbing and infantalising when discussing adult women. I also did not feel it was encouraging healthy eating but rather over eating, and it had been being commented on and shared within groups that clearly encourage over eating.  As I mentioned on the original post I made, the wording could genuinely be used to perhaps be helpful to some people with eating disorders, but I felt it was being misused as well as being poorly written and made me deeply uncomfortable.  Perhaps I shared it because something in it triggered my restrictive urges and reading it made me uncomfortable because to me feeling full *is* a bad thing. I don't eat until I'm full, I eat until I'm not hungry.  Anyway I'm rambling. This is not an attempt to try and justify and defend myself, just an explanation of my thoughts and motivations in posting this. Again I am really sorry that I hurt you with that and I will put more consideration in future as to the way other people with problems around EDs might feel about what I share.",False,False

For example saying starvation mode is a real thing or that they are generically x weight so it is impossible to change that or calling everyone that is not fat anorexic.

Furthermore it was commonly acknowledged that these people were just ignorant or ill educated or suffering from mental problems that caused them overeating and that it was sad that they did not know any better. Also anorexia or eating disorder recovery seemed to be in a more positive light. To me it was the politic and hate free version of tumblrinaction.
