I bought a salad at trader joe’s the other day and the little dressing cup had more calories than the rest of the salad combined. It was pretty depressing. ,False,True

I don’t want another sandwich, because I probably shouldn’t have eaten the half of that one today. I don’t want a voucher, because I shouldn’t eat it again in the future. I just want the person who didn’t pay attention to understand how awful it is to have something you were almost looking forward to messed up!",False,True

I use vinegar as salad dressing (let’s be honest my salads are actually just a bowl of lettuce and nothin else) at home if I run out of my low cal dressings and people look at me like I have three heads when I ask for just vinegar in public.   Like, I have no idea how much olive oil and sugar is in your special Italian house dressing!! I don’t care if it’s clear. Vodka is clear and that shit I still have to budget for, it isn’t water.

When we first started dating my boyfriend he would put mayo on my sandwiches not on purpose just forgetting. Also I hate when I ask for vinegar on my salad and they assume I want oil too and then I’m like nononono.,False,False
