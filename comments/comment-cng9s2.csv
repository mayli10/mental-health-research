Never really realized that it was like, punishing myself, but now that I think about it... Yeah, I always did this the day after doing something embarrassing or the day after a [smaller] binge. Makes sense in hindsight",False,False

It seems completely counterproductive to have nausea and vomiting as symptoms of hunger. And as a severe emetophobe with a habit of restricting, it scares the absolute shit out of me. I got nauseous today from hunger and absolutely panicked. Why???",False,False

It wouldn’t be 100% truthful to say I “forgot” to eat (though that happens for sure when I’m hypomanic), it’s more like I avoid eating until I’m sick and regretting my life choices. So yesterday I put off eating all day until it was too late (the sun had set) so I went to bed having not ate anything in 28 hr, woke up at six this morning nauseous and puked, ate some oatmeal and puked, took my dog for a walk and puked on the walk, made it home and felt weak and frustrated and then puked. And the stupid thing is I know how to prevent it - eat something, obviously, but also just drink electrolyte water and take a Dramamine before the nausea sets in, even breaking my (accidental) fast more responsibly would help..  And yet this still happens like every other week. Last time I was puking in my car while driving to work (which is fucking dangerous!), the time before that I was IN THERAPY (awkward.)",False,False

""The real shit state"" is a dead ringer.  It's kinda neat that we both found the same solution independently.   Other people are just a weirdly good subtle human timer for ""you ain't eat in a while; it's that time again"". Keeping emergency liquids around has kinda helped too.",False,False

It feels like a real life nightmare. You throw up and feel better for 10 seconds and then your body goes into the real shit state.   I’ve gotten a *little* better by eating just enough so I don’t get to that state. Eating with people is the #1 thing that has helped. When I get depressed it’s horrible to think that going through that cycle is almost inevitable. At my worst I can’t even get myself to swallow food even when I feel like I’m about to faint and the smell of food sickens me.,False,True

So you get into a cycle of wasting food, with a raging migraine, dehydrated as hell because you can't keep water down, until eventually your body just goes...okay, there's your quota of suffering. Fuck outta here.  And by love, I mean ""am deeply viscerally afraid of nowadays"".",False,False
