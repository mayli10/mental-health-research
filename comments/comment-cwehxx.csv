I‚Äôll binge often at night but it‚Äôs bc I‚Äôm actually hungry. When high, I just want to taste everything and eat until I‚Äôm physically sick and have to take a nap",False,False

I get really insane munchies, eat a crap ton of food that I never normally would, sober up slightly and then panic about the calories which leads to a purge.

I guess I‚Äôd have to try and see how it effects me. My problem is the opposite, I‚Äôd give anything to *not* feel hungry and am trying to avoid binging üò£ but I‚Äôve heard it helps people with that too... just depends on the person.

I still worry about sugars and cholesterol, but if I'm really stoned I just ignore those fears and go crazy on some chocolate milk and shit. It's not a permanent fix, nothing is except complete recovery I guess, but oh god if it means I can eat those foods without hating myself afterwards I'm going to smoke all the time. Kidding, but I do use it as a medicine as much as I do a fun little drug.",False,False
