And there’s so fucking much of it. Even if you’re on maintenance. Nothing is fresh, everything is over cooked. Lots of things are greasy. When I was moved to PHP I often got in trouble for trying to eat smaller, healthier, tastier meals at home at night.  This was probably why I immediately fell off the recovery wagon as soon as I was discharged",False,False

I'm definitely not trying to crap on anyone's food styling or photography skills, since even the most delicious food can look unappealing in a photograph (Martha Stewart is famously guilty of this, and I know my own food wouldn't look pretty in photos if I didn't pay attention to lighting and presentation.) If these people actually do in fact like what they're eating, regardless of how it looks, then that's great.   But when I see people photographing a soggy plate of \[insert whatever\], hospital food, etc., saying ""this was so hard to eat, it was such a struggle,"" I can't help thinking, no shit...*anyone* would have a hard time eating that!",False,True

I don’t follow any recovery accounts but I feel EXACTLY the same way about some of the gross meals people on the “regular” diet subs post pictures of. Like they rave about “so much food for only 400 kcal!” and it’s some sad little bowl of grey oatmeal or wet-looking droopy vegetables or something and I just wonder how anyone would be inspired to lose weight in a “healthy” way looking at that crap. I’d much rather starve myself for a week and then eat an entire gourmet wood-fired pizza with artisan bread and olive oil on the side lol. ",False,False
