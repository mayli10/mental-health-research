I have a bunch of clothes I used to prance around in at my lowest weight and now I cant manage to get any of them around my body. The boyfriend insists everything is still fine, but I get so paranoid when I compare myself to those instagirls. I totally get it, and the process sucks but it'll get better. ",False,False

I gained back 50 lbs since March and I’m back at the beginning. Only now I know exactly how hard it’s going to be to get back to where I was. I have a bin full of clothes that I am too fat for now. I feel bad for my boyfriend. All we can do is decide if we are going to take steps toward fixing things or let ourselves backslide even more.  I know that you can do it, I know that I can do it. I also know that it is going to be HARD.  Just take every choice as a new opportunity to move in the right direction. ",False,False
