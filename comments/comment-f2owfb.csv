I failed my fast like the fat waste of life I am :) Ugh I feel like such a fake and I’ve eaten over my goal by about 500 calories. My stomach is so huge I have to wear maternity-esque gowns to hide everything. It’s so dumb how I lack any semblance of discipline yet I want to go to medical school.,False,True

You are so very welcome - here to help!! Did you decide to fast? How's it going??  Keep us posted.,False,False

The uni I go to is very competitive so people will judge my plump and bloated body. I definetely want to build more friendships but I don't think people will want to talk to me because I'm bigger than them.  Shit, I should've read this comment before I stuffed my face with breakfast this morning. I'll try and fast for 24 hours until tomorrow afternoon? I wasn't even hungry this morning - breakfast was just indulgent and gluttonous.   Thank you so much for your help! I think I might fast to re-start my hunger cues.",False,True

I was in the deep hold of an ED during uni and I wish I had been more present in the beauty of the present moment instead of worrying so much about how I looked. It's so hard to do, but try to focus on building your relationships and having fun!!  That being said, a good ole 24-hour fast always makes me feel better after a period of binging. It's a good mental re-set and actually makes me crave healthy and nutritious foods afterwards. I like to break the fast with some veggies and protein.   Good luck - hugs!!!",False,False
