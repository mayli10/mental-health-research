I was pretty skinny and growing up all I would eat was yogurt for breakfast and small portions of other meals. My mum went through a phase of force feeding me when I was a bit younger than 10 and i remember hating it so much and actually crying because it was so awful. When she didn't do that she made me sit and finish the whole plate of food. I couldn't leave the dinner table until I had eaten everything on the plate.   Looking back, I'm not even sure I had a problem with my meal sizes, I think my parents just gave me adult size meals and I struggled to finish them because obviously I was a child.",False,False

I would throw up at the table/gag cus I was so full &amp; couldn’t eat anymore. I dreaded meal times with her. Started having disordered eating habits &amp; physique goals around 13. I feel like the two are definitely related in some way but I can’t figure it out.,False,False

My mother’s side of the family is mostly overweight, but growing up her brother, my uncle, was actually quite underweight. Underweight to the point where it got doctors’ attention. My mother said he used food as a power thing and would refuse to eat. My grandma would have to prepare him special meals while the rest of the siblings had diet food. Even then he wouldn’t eat many times.  It’s come out recently that my grandfather was very abusive during their young childhood, especially physical with the boys. There were strange rituals around dinner time where my mother and her brothers would have to answer trivia questions and if they didn’t know the answer they’d have to look it up in the encyclopedias my grandfather kept before they were allowed to eat.   The underweight uncle has a learning disorder so it makes a lot of sense. He didn’t have to answer questions if my grandma was sneaking him out to White Castle. In all honesty I don’t know how successful he would’ve been at looking up answers because even as the oldest sibling he had the poorest reading comprehension. It was probably humiliating.  He now as a 60+ year old adult still goes through noticeable binge and restrict cycles. Like 20-40 pound yo-yo. He’s the only normal sized sibling but still has type 2 diabetes probably due in part to this.   I’m sorry for what you’ve been through, no kid deserves that kind of treatment.",False,False

Parents really don’t understand how their actions can be so detrimental.   When I was younger, around 6 or 7 I had heard my brother talking to my mom about how I was too fat for my age and that normal 6/7 year olds weren’t that big. And I was like, an average sized kid. My family has always had a very skewed sense of what “fat” is or they’re just straight rude. And from then on I’ve had tons of moments like that where my dad will tell me not to eat or my mom would tell me I’d have a nice figure if I watched what I ate or went to the gym, and so on.   Now I rarely eat and my mental illness is thru the roof :))))",False,False

I didn't experience anything like this, but I couldn't read and not comment. I'm so sorry you went through that kind of abuse, and at the hands of your mother of all people.",False,False
