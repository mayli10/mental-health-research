I WANTED to look sick some day, I WANTED people to be worried because I wanted to get back at all the assholes who'd ever made me feel subhuman for my weight.  But then I actually started losing and one, none of those assholes noticed or cared and I realised that they wouldn't care even if I did ever become visibly underweight, and two... the only people who DID notice were the people who cared about me. My mom. My partner. My coworkers and friends... The people in this world I want to hurt the LEAST. I feel this weird mix of guilty and elated any time any of them comment on my weight loss because I'm glad people can tell but I also feel so bad for how I've lost this weight. Especially when they're proud of me and ESPECIALLY when it makes them feel like they should lose weight too :( Like please don't diet because of me, I'm a fraud, none of this weight loss was healthy or good  Like I said. I'm still overweight so the response to my weight loss is still extremely positive but ? am I ever going to get to a healthy BMI? Am I ever going to reach a point where it turns into concern? Am I going to be able to stop when that happens like I tell myself I will?",False,False

I literally wanted nothing more than to get attention from my perfectionist, facade-driven mom for being too thin and when it finally happened, it was so disappointing. I thought it would be great but it just felt even more frustrating. I donâ€™t know what I expected but I just wanted her to care and sheâ€™s just really bad at caring in the right way.   Hang in there :(",False,False

My ex struggled with disordered eating too, and I was always concerned about her while feeling helpless about not actually being able to do anything for her.

It was a lot easier for me to feel validated by classmates and strangers because they didnâ€™t have that note of concern in their voice when they mentioned my weight.,False,False
