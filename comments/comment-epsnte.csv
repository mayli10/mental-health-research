I wasn't actually eating a lot, as the main meal was meat and I don't eat it, so I got to bring my own food. I also (beforehand) decided, as it was Christmas, to allow myself some of the potato chips. When I got up to take some, my dad told something along the lines of ""Be cArEfUl, ChIpS aRe UnHeAlThY"".  I swear I almost dropped my plate on the floor and my eyes probably turned red or something because his grin faded when he saw me lol. I love him but geez.  ""Happy"" ending I still took some chips (although probably way underestimated the serving). And it prevented me from wanting to get up again taking more.",False,False

Soup sounds really nice and warm and comforting, you deserve soup and I hope therapy continues to help &lt;3",False,False

On thanksgiving I kind of binged and I was going back for a third slice of pumpkin pie and more icecream. I got another slice and a big scoop of icecream (carb smart) and my grandma says oh my gosh you eat so much food. And then I threw the plate in the trash. She later talked to me and apologized just saying she was happy I was eating.  Still makes me not want to eat tho lol.,False,False
