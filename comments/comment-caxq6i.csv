So it's like you burn calories over time instead of all at once so not ideal but better than nothing lol,False,False

I wanted to donate blood a few years ago in summer. I'm really short and my normal weight range is also mostly around and below 50kg (110lbs) and you're not allowed to donate blood below 50kg because of health risks. Women have 60ml blood/kg body weight, and below 50kg you would'nt even have 3 liters of blood, so they obviously can't take 500ml away from your body. I didn't know that and sat there for 1,5 hours, had to fill out lots of papers and they checked my hemoglobin (which was also too low) and blood type. And after 1,5 hours I had the conversation with a doctor and she said that I ""should eat a steak for the iron and for my weight and come back when it's not as hot outside"". Well. Thank you... or something like that.",False,False
