I don’t love it either, but I’m no longer swamped with a tsunami of disgust when I see myself in the mirror.  With rapid and significant weight loss, I think it takes the brain quite awhile to catch up. Like that whole ‘residual self-image’ thing from The Matrix.",False,False

I was overweight prior to this year and had been for several years and I thought that all of my self esteem issues would resolve once I lost weight. Surprise, I still feel the same despite loosing 50+ pounds. I’m still the ‘fat girl’ that I’ve always been, its part of my identity even though I’m not even really overweight anymore.   Have things gotten better for you?  ",False,True

One way is to change your body...which can be done in healthy and unhealthy ways. The other option is to change your mind. When I got down to my LW (a weight doctors felt was dangerous) and still loathed my body, I had to acknowledge that maybe losing weight wasn’t going to “fix” how I felt.",False,False
