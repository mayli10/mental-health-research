Has anyone here ever gone a really long time thinking they were okay and then all of the sudden it's like ana creeps back into your life and you fall into a spiral again?   I've gone the past 4 years thinking I was past this point in my life. I've eaten pretty normally, I don't own a scale, I've felt fairly confident - and then she's back. It's been creeping back for a few weeks but I honestly felt in control until I went to a dinner party the other night and everyone thought it would be fun to weigh themselves and discuss it. Fucking funny, right? Except I weighed myself and I hit *that* number. The one I swore to myself I would never hit because it's the fat number.   I came home and tossed out everything in my fridge that isn't negative calories. I've hardly eaten in 3 days. I can't look in the mirror.   The last time I even looked at a pro-ana anything, was back when tumblr was full of blogs. Now I've spent the last 3 hours sifting through forums and planning how to get out of family dinner this week. It's terrifying. Absolutely terrifying.   Okay. Thanks for reading.
