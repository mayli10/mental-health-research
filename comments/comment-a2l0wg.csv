Every time I visit my Chinese relatives they either tell me how little I am or how I’ve gained since they saw me last.    I hope things get better for you soon. ,False,False

You say u remember those feelings, so how do u feel about it now? :O    I'm pretty happy honestly. Host family is nice, i have a good friend, school is boring but not awful. There are some things that bother me on a daily basis and I think that affects how much I eat. I just have trouble managing my emotions probably :(",False,True

I was never as thin as you, but when I first dropped below 18.5 it happened so suddenly and without me really meaning to go that far. I constantly balanced the guilt of eating with the guilt of not eating and everything felt wrong. If I ever felt okay about my decision to eat or not eat, I would immediately feel guilty about not feeling guilty. It's a rough place to be.  How are you feeling generally?",False,False

I used to high restrict but now I eat like 1,000-1,400 a day (probably). I just started at a low weight so it was easier for me to get to this point. I don't feel super unhealthy. Thank u for your kind wishes",False,True
