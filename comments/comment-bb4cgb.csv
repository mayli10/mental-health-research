I mean that. I can see lines and sag where they weren't before. I can kind of ignore it, but then I see girls 2-5 years older than me with none of this. Does anyone know Blackpink's Jennie? She's perfect, and I'm so desperate for picture proof to tell me otherwise. I keep seeking out pictures to compare myself to, but I swear, everyone and their grandma's naked mole rat all use blur tool and beauty filters. My self esteem just can't catch a break..",False,False

No, I wasn't happy that I only ate 200 Calories, but I was happy that I actually got 200 Calories in me right before I went to bed instead of fasting another day...wut am i turning intoÂ¿  Anyway, very close to my LW again. Look forward to dropping that much much more soon..  lol, two very contradictory paragraphs. On one hand I want to be healthy enough to reach my future goals, but on the other, I just want to be like 80 lbs eventually. Ugh.  Also, I was completely right; purging completely enables my binges. Now that I don't really have much of a gag reflex these days and I know I can't purge my binges because of it, it's like, I know I can't binge so I just don't. It's a cruel world for me to only get my gag reflex desensitized enough to only purge like once or twice a month now, without me knowing when exactly that kicks in, but w/e, at least I can actually restrict and refrain from bingeing now, at least for the most part.
