I had a period in my life where I genuinely let go of my ED and just ate what I wanted, didn‘t care about my body etc. and I just feel like I let myself go? I gained SO MUCH too. Then one day I just snapped right back into it. All it took was one comment from someone close to me before, and I was like ... that’s it, I wanna go back to being skinny and then it became all consuming. I don‘t want to let go of my control of food though, I like it too much that I actually can achieve things that I set my mind to. It’s too satisfying.",False,False

I do believe that you need to be aware of what you're eating even in ""recovery"", but that would mean I ain't normal again in first place, uh?  Idk, it makes me feel so lost. Like I'm not currently in recovery, but it's so easy to spiral back into this crap.  I wish the best for you. You'd probably heard it all before, but please, stay safe as much as you can.",False,False
