It’s not the same as say..drinking a lot of cola yes both damage teeth but vomiting basically will end up destroying teeth from the bottom up not the top down   Having said that I’m not sure you have been at it long enough for there to be any significant damage to your teeth   Bulimic from 12 Dentist only started saying stuff to me in my late 20s ..even then it was “have you ever had problems with acid reflux”? Got it straight away and I told them because tbh who cares what the dentist thinks and they are there to help   Fillings normally cost me about  $100 each and normally they chuck a consult free on top so $140-160 but varies a bit.   No one has to know anything..I know purging feels *insert whatever here* but in terms of teeth babe you don’t want to end up like me  In my 30s now stopped purging totally about 4 years ago ..All my top front teeth have literally snapped in half as in the bottom has fallen off .. just crumbled and I’ve had to get them done because it’s SO embarrassing and I refuse to let anyone see me   And yes I didn’t brush straight after..swished with baking Soda ect but in the end it was not enough   Others have it way worse and literally loose whole teeth at least I got half teeth lol   Please just try to be at the dentist alone and please just be honest with them so they can teach you what to do to stop that from happening   My whole mouth hurts sometimes..please don’t end up like me  ,False,False

Yes your dentist will say out loud “wow your enamel sucks” so don’t let your parents be in the room  Google says fillings cost $100-300 in Australia, when your parents hear they’ll be like, wtf floss ur fucken teeth  But you shouldn’t be outed.
