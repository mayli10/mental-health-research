I sometimes get in the mindset that there isn’t anything that matters more in my life than being skinny- which is completely untrue! definitely working on that though, your suggestions are really helpful ❤️❤️",False,True

Something I think you should try to focus on is to start loving or at least appreciating what your body *can do for you* rather than how it looks. If you love to go for long hikes, it would be helpful to frame recovery as ""eating enough to stay at this weight allows my body to climb through rugged terrain and enjoy the nature around me. If I lost weight again I could lose my ability to hike altogether or even just lose my ability to focus on my surroundings and their beauty, because I would be focused on how I *look* rather than feel, and on how many calories I am burning or feeling lightheaded,"" etc.",False,False

I haven’t been doing so good with the ed thoughts since I’ve been back to school, and I really wanna push my recovery back up to where it used to be just so I can focus on other things. And oh no- the GI symptoms sound painful! I hope they get better real soon, and that recovery’s going okay for you :)))",False,True

I did that when I was at a healthy and whenever I come across the photos it makes me feel okay even if I was struggling. I know I'm underweight again which kind of suggests it doesn't really work, but that's more because of health problems  than anorexia. I've had some bad days occassionally where I didn't eat even though I should have, but mostly I do eat just fine and only limit my intake because eating the amount I should is a little too much and it aggravates my GI symptoms. I lost a lot in a brief period after spending a night at the hospital, but I believe my weight loss has slowed down, so I think I'll be okay until I figure out what's wrong and how to treat it. My point is that it does work.",False,False

Other than that I guess I’d already accepted the fact that how I looked was how I was going to be for a long time. You’re so right though- health is all that matters, and I’ll definitely keep that in mind. Thank you so much &lt;3",False,True

You were fine, right? So that means you're okay with your appearance. The number means nothing. All the matters is that you are comfortable with your body and that you are healthier than you were before.",False,False
