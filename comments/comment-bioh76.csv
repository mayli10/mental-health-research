My friends would always tell me ""oh my god you have jimin thighs! They are so thick!!!!"" and at first I took it as a compliment because I thought that I could be similar to someone that I looked up to. All of a sudden, The dude lost hella weight, and his legs looked alot slimmer compared to mine. I wanted to know his secret because I was planning on going on a diet anyway. then I saw that he was only eating one meal over the span of 10 days, so i was dumb and followed after him. The dizziness i felt gave myself a high, so I just continued to do that without even caring about what kpop idols were doing. Eventually, I started to crave alot of things and b/p accordingly, hence the start of my bulimia.",False,False

But hey, I'm 110 lbs right now, I lose them boobies first and will keep grinding to skinny legend status I guess.   My secret? Poverty. It's poverty, honey.

My mom never had an eating disorder but she was definitely fixated on her looks and diet, and I know that can be tough. I think the thing that first drew my attention to my food choices was the ridiculous number of fad diets she would try, although as far as I know it never turned into anything more severe for her.  3.
