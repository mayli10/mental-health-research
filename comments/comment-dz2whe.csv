I don't. I hate people who ""hate food"" and I will not apologize because it is an instinctive reaction, based on the fact that if you hate food you are an alien who cannot be trusted.   That, or you have something like undiagnosed ARFID, in which case that truly sucks, but also YOU NEED A DOCTOR NOT A SHITTY TV SHOW  But also, I'm sorry, some of the superskinnies are 100% lying to themselves and/or to us, and with those episodes the show just starts to feel like straight-up gaslighting. I won't even mention the gaslighty feeling associated with most of the supersizes, because it's so frequent it's just ridiculous. A lot of them surely have BED or deep-seated issues, but you sure wouldn't fuckin know it from this bitch-ass show. Instead it's just an array of freakish, totally random, goggle-worthy habits that can be fixed by making them sit down to a vile dinner with an incredibly annoying skinny person?? Seems legit! This totally isn't an exploitative, tele-visual zoo exhibit!  Why is this show a thing.",False,False

And setting them up for better weight stretch goals, maybe setting them up with a trainer, therapist, or a nutritionist? But nah just swap diets, include random segments about how fat the american south is and show people genuinely suffering from eating disorders.  LOL but imagine the sensationalism if they made this show in the US itd just be people arguing and shouting at each other how theyre hungry or full or how bad their diets are. Just look at Gordon Ramseys shows in the US vs the UK",False,True

Like, there's such little talk of eating disorders. It's more like people who are too picky or busy to eat. Like, I WISH. I TRULY WISH. It doesn't seem properly representative of actually superskinny people (or maybe I'm biased. maybe most skinny people \*are\* that way)  Frankly, I find myself relating to the supersized people a lot more. They seem to have more psychological shit going on, whether that being the cause of their eating or as a result of their eating. For the superskinnies, they just like, don't dig food? I dig food, I feel you supersizes.   For a show that could do so much regarding the discussion on eating disorders, it really does jack shit. Supersizers and superskinnies can BOTH have eating disorders and rather than going \*hurhurhur eat what your counterpart eats and see how DUMB and RIDICULOUS you are\*, they could idk,, talk about getting a better relationship with food.
