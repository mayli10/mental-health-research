It’s like a popsicle. Or any other high-volume fruits like strawberries are also really nice. Or clear broth if you like savory.  It’s easy to feel fuller from those foods and stay under 150 calories.,False,False

Honestly the only thing that has really helped curb my urge to binge is to just eat more high-volume foods and consume more calories each day (even 150-200 every other day can help keep the urge to binge at bay).   I hope that helps!",False,False
