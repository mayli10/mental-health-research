My bf is always trying to get me to eat more (he's so kind and loving and despite my frustrations, it's not at him, ya know) and I always say ""oh but ate XYZ I'm good!"" And he's always telling me it's not enough. My therapist said anything in our life can become ""normal"" to us after a while so when you're used to eating next to nothing, a bit more than that seems like ""more than enough"" even when it's really not!   So I definitely feel this",False,False
