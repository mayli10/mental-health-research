Whenever I spend time with my few friends' friends, I get exhausted and have no desire to spend any more time with them. If I find someone even slightly annoying, I'm not going to hang out with them just for the sake of not being alone.",False,True

It's so hard to make new friends when you're an adult. It's like all I do is go to work, come home and watch tv, sleep, go to work. Then on the weekends I pretty much spend all the time by myself and rarely go out. I literally have 1 friend and that's it ðŸ˜• I really need to work on putting myself out there more and going places and meeting people because I'm not going to meet people in my apartment. It's just hard cause I'm really shy and can be awkward.",False,False

It's like people occasionally wanna be friends and then realize I guess that I suck and then ditch. I suck at talking to people in person. It's super awkward and I definitely come off as trying to hard. So it's easier usually to just keep my head down and no eye contact lol,False,False

Like, I just don't know how. I, too, am socially awkward and can't seem to make friends. I kind of gave up on it, actually.  Lol",False,False

Literally every friend ive made around that time period (maybe five years total) i have also fucked. Cause, idk how to just make friends. if i like someone enough to be their friend i also want to have sex and be close with them (it probably helps that im bisexual).   Literally ive only made three (what i would consider) real friends since then and sometimes i still think ""man if everyone was into it id fuck them, theyre cool"". and everyone else ive met through mutual friends i just consider acquaintances. I think im also just kind of a picky person when it comes to who i really like as a person and who i want to be ""my true self"" around and not just the polite normal version of me i put on when im with family and around people i dont fully know.",False,False

My job makes me want to have zero contact with anyone ever again for the rest of my life. Iâ€™d like to live in a little cabin in the woods as a hermit for the rest of my life. ðŸ˜¬,False,False

Right?? Why is that? I have an amazing boyfriend of over a year and have rarely been single since fifteen... Oh. Maybe that's the problem.",False,True

Doesn't help that everyone I work with is at a minimum 10 years older than me.  I'm planning on taking some art classes this summer. Maybe spending even those few hours a week with people will be enough social time for me anyway.,False,True

I'm nice enough and can carry a conversation okay, but how do I get to the point where we can go for coffee? Or maybe even dinner? Or have them over at my house?

You donâ€™t have as much of an opportunity as you did while you were in grade through high school. I find that if I want to make friends, I have to really work at it and put myself out there. Which is why I have like zero friends right now. Itâ€™s a lot of effort for me.   Do you have any hobbies that you are interested in or interested in learning? Sometimes trying to find local groups or classes on a new hobby or a hobby you want to learn something new in can help.",False,False
