Maybe put a pinch of salt in your water, and/or add some to your food? (salad, or herba(sp?) salata, is meant to be salted, hence the name, *salata*) Coffee works too well for my blood pressure and I have the opposite problem to you.",False,False

If you can keep your blood sugar stable and avoid hypoglycemia, and also stay well hydrated (more fluids than you'd normally take in because a lot of fluid comes from food), this isn't as much of an issue. A lot of nausea is from blood sugar issues or dehydration. If you're willing to drink some pedialyte, that's a good way to avoid both issues.  That being said, to a certain extent it's unavoidable because you're not providing your body with enough energy to function properly",False,False
