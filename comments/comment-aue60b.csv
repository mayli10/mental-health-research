I know many of my thoughts are irrational and self-destructive so I can empathize with people like my mom. It doesn’t make dealing with them any easier though when I, as an outsider, can see straight through their BS. But people don’t see what they don’t want to see.  You just have to accept that their thoughts are irrational and you can’t argue with crazy... they’ll just drag you down to their level and beat you with experience. (I think this quote was originally about stupidity but it works for crazy too).",False,False

And congrats on quitting smoking! Don’t let stress with her get in the way of your goals. You’ve got this!  I don’t live with my mom, but understand the frustration. I had another in a series of frustrating conversations with my mother this evening. She needs to lose weight prior to a major surgical decision. But she’s unwilling to count calories and always underestimates her food intake and weight. She insists she’s lost 15lbs because she ‘cut back on soda’ but refuses to step on the scale. She’s half-assing it and saying I don’t understand how hard it is to diet. Seriously?! Seriously?! She’d rather eat her way to an early grave than be ‘deprived’ of junk food, all the while insisting that she did everything she could.  Sorry to rant in response to your rant. But I understand. Talking about weight and dieting with family never, ever ends well. You can’t make someone else take their diet seriously. I’m very slowly learning to try and not take my mom’s issues with food on, because I have enough of my own issues. I give her solid diet advice that is faaaar more moderate than what I apply to myself. If that’s too hard for her then so be it.",False,False
