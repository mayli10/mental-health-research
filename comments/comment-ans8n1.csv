And they always look at me weird like ""Oh you're already done?"" Last time I did it, it was my birthday so I was like ""Okay I'm going HAM""  but my shrunken stomach stopped me from gorging myself like I did in my BED days. So after a while I was in so much pain, I couldn't eat anymore. Everyone was like ""You're at a buffet, eat some more"" &amp; they had a whole extra plate after I had finished, so I told them my stomach hurt. My aunt saw my empty plate and then she started talking about how she was super full. Idk I think she might have been joining me in solidarity but it just felt more awkward because I felt like I made her self-conscious about how much she was eating. :c ",False,False

I used to legit warn people ""if you let me have some of your drink, it will be half gone. I am a monster."" Then once I did learn to sip I showed off my new skill to people I previously had to warn lmao.   I also eat super fast. Sometimes I watch how other people are eating their meal and slow down or twiddle my thumbs a little so we finish at the same time. It's embarrassing, lots of people comment on it. And even if they don't, I'm so embarrassed when I have an empty plate and everyone else has a ton of food. ",False,False

Mine didn't care when I weighed more, and doesn't really understand why it's a big deal to me. I wasn't overweight so when I feel huge and disgusting, he doesn't get it.   He thinks i'm being silly counting calories, for some reason he doesn't think that matters???   But at the same time, I'd feel bad if we went to a buffet and I didn't eat as much as I could because it's expensive and I lived a long time barely scraping by. Then when I got upset about being fat, he brings up that I would eat multiple plates when we got chinese and I could just not eat as much.    Like, bruh, make up your mind. Should I stop eating as much to lose weight or not?",False,False
