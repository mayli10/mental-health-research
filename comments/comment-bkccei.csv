As someone who's been more or less regurarly purging like seven years (AN-r turned into b/p subtype and I  can't really point out when that happened), this realization made me think how sick is that. Like self-induced vomiting isn't a big deal (of course it is), but to admit to myself that I actually like the purging part more forced me to see how messed up all this is.  Of course, sometimes I'm just so starving I binge just have food for a little while, but more often than I would care to admit, eating dosen't particularly appeal to me, but I want to purge",False,False
