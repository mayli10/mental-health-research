By that logic, does that mean she can never leave the house since someone may see her and feel triggered? Should every skinny or obese person just not be allowed to be seen, ever?   The way I feel, telling people with highly visible eating disorders, be it anorexia or binge eating, that their very being needs to be censored is kinda fucked up.  Not all eating disorders are even triggered by jealousy or fear of another's weight.   Sometimes it's a messed up way to cope from sexual assault, or emotional, verbal and physical abuse.

People who get a free pass exploiting people with serious problems because they're ""trying to help "". And they are WORSE Eugenia NEVER talks about how sick she is. Talk shows list off Ed sufferers symptoms they go on and on about how bad their health is. Know what that did to my head? ""I've never had those health problems I need to be that sick!"" We are encouraged and driven by making ourselves sicker those are trophies, those are validation. It's worse than ""omg numbers!"" Eugenia NEVER talks about how her health is effected. We make her worse and she hurts no one. Looking at an extremely skinny person never ""gave"" someone an ED. They were given to them by people who hurt them in their lives and put ideas in their heads. Everyone keeps hurting Eugenia, talking shit about her and fuel her Ed further and then WE tell HER she's fucked up, that tell she has never met are her responsibility, because people feel like she owes them an explanation for the way she looks.
