I’ve put on about 30lbs since I met him, and before I’d put on 20lbs from my lowest. I feel like a whale. He says how perfect and skinny I am, but I can’t believe that. My BMI is in the overweight category now, and I despise myself for it. To make it worse, I went to a clinic a couple years back and they said because I was in the normal range I didn’t have an ED! And before that, when I was b/p every single day, I was dx with BED. They didn’t take into account the purging. I was morbidly obese as a kid, and in my head all that ‘hard work’ was wasted because I’m fat again and, to me, I’ll never compare (body wise at least) to his exes",False,True

I have my suspicions about my boyfriend's ex wife and know about her sister's ED (a little). We began dating at the beginning of my bulimia recovery and I've gained 10-15 pounds since.  I now flip between eating normally and compulsive overeating and can't compensate by purging. I feel like constantly apologizing for my disgusting body. I feel like I've ""let myself go"" or pulled some sort of bait and switch. It's an awful feeling.  I have to remind him occasionally that I don't like the way he's talking about bodies/food/etc. He's got pretty insensitive humor surrounding EDs -- sometimes it's very funny, but sometimes it just makes me feel shitty.",False,False
