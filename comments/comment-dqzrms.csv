So I think you're right. Option 2!",False,True

Tbh I think it's especially shitty to be commenting on anyones weight in a group, let alone in ED terms, but people continue to outdo themselves...",False,False

So it's defo not giving me an opening.   Maybe they're decided I don't have an ED and are just trotting it out because that's what they do now. I don't know.   But I also feel like making a fuss - even to say joking about mental illness isn't cool - would just focus the attention in on me where at the moment I can appear to be laughing it off. Of course, I'm not really laughing it off inside.",False,True

You know?",False,True

But in a way that can just get laughed off if you're not ready so it's not awkward?  Idk it just kind of reminded me of how my boyfriend will try to broach things with me sometimes without it being obviously a ""serious chat ™️"" so as not to panic me.  On the otherhand he may just be being an insensitive tw*t in which case I'd probs politely suggest joking about mental illness makes you a bit uncomfortable.",False,False

You could say that, while you know they mean no harm, it’s not cool to joke about mental illness, and that anorexia is a serious mental illness that kills people. Those kinds of jokes just adds to the harmful stereotypes surrounding EDs",False,False
