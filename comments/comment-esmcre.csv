What I find is that times when I don’t have to look at the clock (like weekends, weekdays can be hard cuz class and stuff) it issooo much easier to listen to my internal hunger. I try not to focus on the time anymore for meals. I still think like “I can’t eat because it’s before 10am” and “dinner is at 6”... but if I dont look at the clock then it’s soooooo much easier to listen to yourself!!!!",False,False

I have always relied entirely on external cues (the clock says it is 8am, so it’s breakfast time, the clock says it is 7pm, so it’s dinner time) because it gives me total control, and I will totally ignore all my internal cues ‘because it’s not time yet’.",False,True

And I think I’ve gotten to the point where I’m just so tired and exhausted by my ed that I really don’t care. My brain will try to make me count and count but I really can’t make myself because after 7 years of this crap I’m kinda sick and tired of it.",False,False

But then I started slowly (over many many months), really listening to like do I want to eat that much or little, and do I need to eat that yes or no? Then I would add a little bit more or take a pinch out of whatever it was. This makes it so you are less certain about the calorie amount, but it’s still comforting to know “ok instead of 150 cals this cereal with the little extra pinch is now 165-ish”. And when you start panicking just think “it’s only 15 cals, it’s only 15 cals, it’s only 15 cals” to reassure yourself that it’s finnnneeeee to add a little more or take some out depending on what you really want, not because it’s a ritual or the exact serving size.  As I became more comfortable with that (took a while),  I began to measure like 1/2 and guess the other half. Then as that became easier, I started eyeballing the whole thing. Then, after that became easier, I began trying to eyeball how much I really wanted (I was still really focused on the exact serving size). So now I try to focus on my hunger level and my nutrition needs, instead of solely “oh I can only have 28g of pretzels now!”. This is just my experience :)",False,False

I am fully aware of all the calories in things, and even in res when we worked on “exchanges” I still knew because I started logging calories when I was 12. idk how I will ever look at food beyond numbers, and tbh I still can’t eat something without weighing the caloric value vs. the enjoyment I’ll get from it, and even then enjoyment usually doesnt hold much value if the numbers are high enough.",False,False
