It's hard but I think you have a point about getting to a place where you genuinely want to give up the ED behaviors, too. I'll think on this more, thanks!",False,True

If you're too undernourished, your brain can't make the new connections it needs to in therapy.  I think you've also got to want to give up the ed behaviours and weight restore for things to truly get better though, but that's only my experience.",False,False

Ex:  If your ED is aggravated by severe depression and having no other working coping mechanisms, and psychiatric/therapeutic intervention successfully treats your depression and provides you with healthy coping skills your ED may improve.  If it’s linked to trauma/ptsd/c-ptsd and that is addressed and adequately helped your ED may improve",False,False

This is essentially what I've done. I'm over a year clean from bulimia symptoms without ever seeing a dietitian, using a meal plan, or seeing any ED specialists. I did talk about my bulimia in therapy quite a bit, especially at the beginning, but it was largely about recognizing patterns behind my symptoms so I could interrupt my usual cycles. I was a total BPing disaster at the time, though. My life revolved around bingeing and purging which was a primary reason I sought therapy. After a little while though, we mainly focused on mindfulness, building self worth, creating a life worth living, and other concrete tools to address anxiety and depression.   I know that one concern with people beginning treatment for PTSD while being deep in their EDs is that it can trigger it drastically by bringing up old/challenging emotions and memories.",False,False

I always treated it as a body image issue and got nowhere. As soon as I realised it had spawned as a result of my anxiety, tackling said anxiety made ED recovery so much easier.   Despite this I still continued to relapse right up until the point where I gave in and HAD to address my eating disorder.   Identifying and addressing the reason why you developed an ED in the first place can help a lot more than just addressing an ED. However, once an ED becomes part of you're life you do genuinely have to take it on if you truly want to help it.",False,False
