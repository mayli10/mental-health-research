Sure, that wasn't nice of me but I just snapped. It's such an intrusive question to ask anyway, people can be skinny for a myriad of reasons, including very personal ones, eg. illness. Be it mental or physical ones.  My favorite is when people say ""why are you so skinny? It's really not attractive, you know"" as is my purpose in life is to be attractive lol",False,False
