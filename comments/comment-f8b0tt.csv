Since the numbers have been adding up, this suggests that my TDEE is &gt;!1500 calories!&lt;, which is based on other calculators is more like my BMR—I am 5’7—and very below my calculated TDEE (&gt;!1700 calories!&lt;; if sedentary but &gt;!2200 calories!&lt; given my exercise regiment). This discrepancy is concerning because it would suggest that I am eating 50% more than I think I am and I truly don’t believe that is likely. (Warning: Science Talk) Another possible explanation is one related to adaptive thermogenesis, my metabolism has been slowing itself down to combat long periods of underrating. The concept of adaptive thermogenesis is a bit controversial, however, I see many physical manifestations of this such as my hair and nails no longer growing and the classic feeling of always being cold. Overall, I do manage to feel satiated with my current routine so I do believe my body is somewhat adapted. Other factors that definitely account for this difference are a decreased amount of calories burned from the thermic effect of food (since I am eating less) and a decreased amount of non-exercise thermogenesis, since I am generally slower and less active throughout my daily life—outside of the gym. I am really hoping that after years of screwing up my metabolism, it is finally deciding to turn itself up a notch. This is all wishful thinking and hypothesizing that still doesn’t fully explain what’s going on here.  Please help me :( Thank you in advance.",False,True
