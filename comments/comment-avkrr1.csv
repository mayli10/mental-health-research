I'm at a point where if I'm not following some sort of meal plan, I'm ""bingeing"". I know what normal eating is, but only in theory.",False,False

When left to my own devises, I just cannot eat normal no matter how much I want to. I went on a two night retreat recently (only one full day), and I ate somewhat ‚Äúnormally‚Äù and I found it so weird. Like oh we‚Äôre eating again? Okay. But I ate three meals and bought a pack of sweets at the shop and didn‚Äôt binge and I had a biscuit before bed because I was just doing what everyone else did and it was the weirdest experience. Unfortunately, when meals aren‚Äôt set and I‚Äôm not constantly surrounded by people, I slip back into my old ways. Straight away I was back in my binge/restrict cycle, but I still remember the glimmer of normality.",False,False

I do know what healthy eating looks like, all the micro and macro requirements, in theory. But in practice that knowledge is kidnapped and muted to one side and I freak out that something had more than 100cal. Pretty irrational, yes, and it makes me angry with myself.",False,False
