Unfortunately whenever I bring it up to my mom she guilt trips me.,False,False

Sahm of 2 now, but before that I always worked 2 ft jobs, 40+ hours each a week. My ideal birthday for YEARS has been sleeping all.damn.day. (though the husband did get me a fancy af vaccum last year and I was over the damn moon lol). And even though mine are still young, it still hurts my heart to imagine them saying they don't want 'me time' with me (although I totally get the reasons!). You're almost 16 hun, she wants TIME with you. Like the other comment said, see if you can get some 'y'all time' without the focus being food. A massage, a manicure, a class to build memories (stained glass, pottery, etc). I feel for you, because I was I you, but as a mom now, I feel for her too. Hell, mine is creeping up on 5 and I'm panicking over how fast it's gone. Try and see if you can give her (and you! Trust me, you'll appreciate it more later!) the time without the food commitment.",False,False

But this is how people show they care for each other - spending money on them. Iâ€™m being cynical, enough. Is there a way you could suggest doing something else with your mom, like getting your nails done? Still spend time with her, still let her treat you to something, but not at a restaurant. Go back and apologize, say you appreciate the thought but you donâ€™t like being the center of attention or celebrating yourself or whatever your other reasons are, and thatâ€™s why you got upset, and also that since youâ€™ll be tired after work maybe you could do something relaxing or another day. And happy early birthday! Really though itâ€™s just another day.",False,False
