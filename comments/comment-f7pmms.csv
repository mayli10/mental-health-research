My group of friends (4 of us) went to a cafe, and they ordered full meals and I got garlic bread. I’d never been there before and had expected the same kind of serving size as the few cafes I do visit regularly. Boy I was WRONG. Out comes this basket of 4 sticks with so much garlic butter, I definitely didn’t want to eat it, but I couldn’t tip my friends off that I was still struggling with food. So I ate two of the sticks and feigned that I wasn’t hungry anymore. They’re not fucking stupid though, unfortunately. And after 20 minutes of begging and pleading with me to eat them, and me refusing, they decided to split the two sticks into halves and give a quarter to each of us. And you know that feeling when you’ve worked yourself up so much that you physically can’t eat any more without feeling sick? That was me, and I ate it with tears in my god damn eyes. The friend who was begging and pleading with me put his arm around me when I finished and said in his sweetest voice “Now, that wasn’t so hard, was it?” And I know he comes from a well-meaning place, but he made me feel so bad.",False,False
