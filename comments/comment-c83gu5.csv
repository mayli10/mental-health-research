You could be losing water weight, glycogen, or even muscle mass as well. Not all weight loss will be fat, and not all weight gained will be fat either - it all depends on a myriad of factors.  Lastly, and also quite importantly, 'eye-balling' fat loss is entirely **subjective** and you may not even notice it for an extended period of time. A much more reliable method is to use an objective measure, such as measurements.",False,False
