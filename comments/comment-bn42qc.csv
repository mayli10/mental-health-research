It’s a little scary but honestly it tends to be so confusing that even when you’re used to it and recognise the signs, you’re too out of it to really feel scared, if that makes sense. It’s almost always over before you know it. Typically it takes me quite a while to feel back to normal once I wake up, my head stays woozy for ten or fifteen minutes, but it always passes. You might find you can’t hear things properly (like you’re underwater) or can’t make sense of things people are saying. Just wait it out, everything goes back to normal after a while.",False,False

I get a metal taste in my mouth and my body gets flashes of hot and cold, so fast it almost feels like it’s at the same time. That’s it until I wake up again, which usually isn’t longer than a few seconds. I’ve fainted a few times and once I had a “nightmare” while I was out, but only that one time.
