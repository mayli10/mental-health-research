I did a little research and found this interpretation (wall of text! Sorry!): [“the majority of the studies point to a reduction in short-term resting metabolic rates that is greater than can be explained by the loss of body mass or fat-free mass over the same time period. Unfortunately, there has been very little work done over the last few years regarding the duration of this phenomenon. Wadden and colleagues' work indicates that this disproportionate reduction reflects metabolic processes associated with the hypocaloric dieting itself. When calorie balance is resumed, the resting metabolic rate is dependent on the new body mass, especially fat-free mass. This is relevant for motivated patients who adhere to severe hypocaloric diets to achieve rather large weight losses. When they get to goal weight their metabolic rate is severely depressed, and they can experience almost immediate weight gain if they resume their prior higher calorie intakes. Recent studies have not continued to measure changes in resting metabolic rate for extended periods to determine whether the reductions are self-limiting. Again, the work of Wadden and colleagues supports a self-limiting hypothesis. More research is needed on this critical issue.”](https://academic.oup.com/fampra/article/16/2/196/480196)",False,True

The reasons are biological and irreversible. As early as 1969, research showed that losing just 3 percent of your body weight resulted in a 17 percent slowdown in your metabolism...  just wasn't true. that that ""permanent metabolism slowdown"" is just the change to one's basal metabolic rate.",False,False

And a more empathic approach to treatment simply doesn’t pay: While procedures like blood tests and CT scans command reimbursement rates from hundreds to thousands of dollars, doctors receive as little as $24 to provide a session of diet and nutrition counseling.”  “The effects of weight bias get worse when they’re layered on top of other types of discrimination. A 2012 study found that African-American women are more likely to become depressed after internalizing weight stigma than white women. Hispanic and black teenagers also have significantly higher rates of bulimia.”  “But perhaps the most unique aspect of weight stigma is how it isolates its victims from one another...Surveys of higher-weight people, however, reveal that they hold many of the same biases as the people discriminating against them.”",False,True
