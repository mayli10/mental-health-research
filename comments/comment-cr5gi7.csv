You can't plan around it. I think you need to maybe speak with a friend, a parent, a teacher or a councilor. I am not trying to scare only help you but you should take control of it early.   I am not trying to be preachy or condescending. I have suffered with anorexia since my late teens. I am 35 and even at my age with all my experience its a tough.   Keep talking keep posting.",False,False

I usually eat something like an apple for breakfast then have a pretty normal dinner of safe foods but it depends what it is and sometimes have a snack like a celery stick in between. I haven’t eaten it I’m calm now as she’s left the house. I couldn’t do it it was just too much as I need to eat tonight.

Does your mother know you have an ED. If she does it will be hard to explain you don’t want to eat your restricting.   This will pass but you need to stay came. If you are restricting you might have low blood pressure and you could faint. Just keep breathing and focus.   An apple is only 5% of your daily KCALs. Could you just eat a little?   Try and stay calm. Tap your finger into your palm on the same hand. This will help to focus your thoughts.,False,False
