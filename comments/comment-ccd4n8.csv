Definitely saving it for a reminder every once in a while!  I don't really care about men or what people in general think of me. But my mind doesn't quite agree... The guy who said that was clearly a jerk anyway. I met him for 20 minutes and I had enough, really. Still, when he said that I couldn't help have this thought. But thank you for this comment, it makes me feel so much better :')",False,True

It‚Äôs bc we were young and internalized all the objectification that society had been bombarding us with since birth.

My life became so much easier when I stopped worrying about what men think of women.

Male attention is 100% worthless. Dudes stick their dicks in anything and then they wanna pretend they have standards? I bet the guy who said that doesn‚Äôt even wash his hands after he uses the bathroom. Him saying ‚Äúoh I‚Äôd date her if she was skinner‚Äù is his way of coping with the fact that the girl in question wouldn‚Äôt even give him the time of day if he approached her lmao. Don‚Äôt let a man‚Äôs insecurity mess with your head.   I promise you even if you were ugly and obese, you‚Äôd find a guy. The only female virgins are those by choice. Look at the animal kingdom and see how consistently females are the sex that gets to pick and they do so mercilessly. The only exception are male animals that provide a significant biological investment in their offspring. Human males do not fit that category by a long shot. You could remove 90% of males from the human population and it wouldn‚Äôt affect our reproductive capacity as a species in the slightest. In short: male opinion doesn‚Äôt matter, it never has, and it never will. Men will try to convince you otherwise, but don‚Äôt fall for that trap.",False,False
