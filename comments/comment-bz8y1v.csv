I hit my hw a few years ago, ~135 lbs. I hit my lw just before Christmas last year, 86lbs. In that time, my weight has only fluctuated between 95-112lbs between periods of restriction, binging, and recovery. It’s a decently sized margin, but it’s not “regaining all the weight” like anti-diet people talk about. But it obviously depends on the person and the manifestation of their disorder.",False,False
