I know God knows that it’ll trigger my disorder to fast so I don’t do it and if anyone has an issue with it, I don’t really care because it’s honestly between me and God. I’ve just accepted that even if I recover, I’ll never be able to because my body will freak out and not know what’s happening. I can demonstrate devotion to God in different ways. It’s hard though when people start asking. I hope you can be at peace about it.",False,False
