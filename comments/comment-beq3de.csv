I just wanted to make it clear I’m not encouraging you, because for people who don’t have EDs, there’s a fine line between reassurance and encouragement that they don’t see the nuance of. I didn’t mean to sound like I was telling you off or anything!! ♥️",False,False

I feel your pain, and I’m sorry, but please don’t ask for advice on how to lose weight quicker. I think that’s why the last sub got taken down.  Also, bodies are weird. I know this isn’t a great comfort, but it’s true. At your calorie intake level, you are definitely going to be heading for a woosh soon, when your body releases the water weight in the cells, and you suddenly drop. I’m really really sorry, and please take care of yourself ♥️",False,False
