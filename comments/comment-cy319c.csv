The last two weeks I’ve been too scared to weigh myself. So many of my clothes are very tight and require me to have not eaten at night so I have a flat stomach. I’ve been wearing the same few plaid skirts that hide my tummy (bless AA tennis skirts) and leggings with my boyfriend’s shirts. He keeps telling me I look the same but I know he must be lying, I’ve been eating more especially at night and I feel so gross.",False,False

I just donated all my clothes I wore at my lw and it felt so shitty, but I went shopping today and bought some new clothes that are looser on me and actually fit and I feel so much better in them than my old clothes",False,False
