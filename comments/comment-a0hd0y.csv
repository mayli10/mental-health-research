There are recipes online to make a kind of homemade electrolyte drink with different flavoring options.  Is it hard to drink flavored water? If it's not, there's flavored regular and carbonated water. There's also Crystal Light and generic versions, which give you a lot of flavoring options.",False,False

Purging removes a log of electrolytes.  Get some Powerade zero, salt the food that you keep down, and maybe try out an electrolyte supplement. (Nuun is tasty imo).  If you don't feel a difference after those things I might be wrong, there are other things that can go wrong that I'm less familiar with, but losing electrolytes can make it harder to retain water and so drinking *enough* won't actually be enough.  If I'm nauseous I like a stevia sweetened ginger chewable from a supplement company called natural factors. (They are Canadian but available where I live in the US). It's basically calorie free and it helps so much.",False,False
