I just remember you could get away with helllla shit there. That's awful! Some of these people that work at these places should not even be anywhere near the medical profession. What a cunt.

Ridiculous things happened, and it was sooo institutionalized. I started to restrict and hide my food at meals, but my diagnoses was only bulimia, and the physiatrist in charge of the “lodge” I was staying in acted like it was a fucking joke when I told her what I was doing. She literally smiled at me when I told her and just nodded and was like “uhu” while still smiling really sarcastically, like I was some poor bulimic who was trying to restrict for attention. I got zero help with it and continued to throw away food sneakily at meals.   Then I fricken relapsed with my bulimia 3 months into my stay there by b/ping on gum, since they let me buy and then keep literally bags full of gum on outings, and not only did they not take the gum away from me when I told them, but they shortly after discharged me and told me I was recovered.   Weirdest thing was that I was paying out of pocket to be there. Didn’t they want my money?? Shit’s whack. /endrant",False,False

It’s so hard, it’s so very fucking hard, and I know that when you’re “in it,” it seems like you can never get out, or you don’t want to get out, or that anyone on the other side of treatment is fake or lying.
