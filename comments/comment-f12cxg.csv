(Mostly becoming extremely depressed and suicidal a week or so prior to the start of my period.) I was so excited to maybe finally have part of a solution but for some reason my docs just didn't...listen? Eventually I did get a referral to see a person in town who specializes in hormones and hormone therapy, but then my insurance changed and I wasn't able to actually go do the testing. Could be something to maybe look into though?  Best of luck! Hormones are heccin powerful things. For my situation, just getting on a generic of Seasonique has ended up making a life changing (and possibly life-saving) difference.",False,False
