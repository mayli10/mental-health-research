With all due respect, I would not take the advice to restrict or fast before your trip; it will set you up for a binge, and therefore purge.  You have to force yourself to eat regularly and adequately everyday, without restriction. Doing this has changed my life; the urges to are binge reduced greatly. Is there anyone there who is a normal eater (meaning anyone without an ED history or history restriction/dieting)? Sometimes it's helpful to just copy how someone normal eats to help you understand what that looks like.  Good luck; I truly wish you the best on your journey towards recovery.",False,False

You’re right, your body probably needs the rest as well... When I can’t see any end in my b/p periods, I usually fast/heavily restrict for a day or 2 which sort of ‘resets’ things in my mind. I hope you can get through this!! Xx ",False,False
