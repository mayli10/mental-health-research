The comments feel alienating. It should be inappropriate to comment about anyone's body size, no matter how small. ",False,False

First of all, I want to be jacked and always have. But then also, if I could change one thing about my body that's not actually in my power to, it would be height... I wanna be like 6 feet tall. I want to be a huge, scary woman. Not this scrawny, shivery creature I have become :p ",False,False

I went to visit her a week or so ago and she said “I’m almost afraid to hug you because I’m afraid you’ll break you’re so tiny!”   I felt gratified on one level, but I also don’t trust anyone’s opinion of my size so I constantly feel like I’m being patronized. That fear of being lied to motivates me to lose more until I FEEL small enough. ",False,False

I see it as a check on my view of myself.  But if you have a history of losing your dignity or freedom over your weight (i.e. doctors and clinicians) then I can see why this would cause despair.",False,False
