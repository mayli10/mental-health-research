The body really does need nutrients on the regular. Electrolyte imbalance can easily happen too, which can produce very nasty symptoms like what you describe. So getting fluids+electrolytes might be something to look into. Sports drinks like powerade zero or propel have some, or you can mix up your own electrolyte drink too. But if symptoms aren’t rapidly improving, seeing a medical professional is prudent because other things could be going on. Stay safe, and hope you feel better soon!",False,False
