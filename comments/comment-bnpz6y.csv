I know it's so hard...you hurt so badly on the inside that you want everyone to see how hard you're secretly hurting without having to actually vocalize it. OP, if you've ever been down this path of worsening symptoms and ending up in the hospital/higher levels of care/losing your job/friends/etc, I encourage you to ""play the tape through"": Say you did actually go and lose X pounds?

Big part of my motivation to restrict is (used to be...?) the idea that all those people who made me feel like worthless garbage for being OW would feel so bad and guilty if they knew that I only lost weight because I was starving myself. Like it would be some big dramatic angsty revenge plot.  Realised pretty fast that nobody would fucking care. Nobody would care if I was starving myself and exercise purging to get down to a """"""healthy"""""" weight because people don't actually care about health and they think fat people SHOULD be starving themselves. They would barely even start to care if I got underweight. The only one I was hurting was me. But that was fine too. After a while it became a sick in-joke more than revenge.  People in this thread are right. WE care about you and we don't want you to be hurting like this, either physically or emotionally. Shit's hard and restrictive eating like this is usually just another form of self harm like cutting or burning and you deserve better. We're always here if you want to talk. What's wrong with needing attention sometimes, everyone does. You deserve to be attended to.",False,False
