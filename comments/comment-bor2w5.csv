I’m surrounded by family and friends who make me eat 2-3 meals a day all summer and every bite i take i feel nothing but disgust and shame. I’m not at all hungry but they will ask questions so i just eat tiny portions and hate myself the whole time!! I think I’m going to pick up running to counteract this but how did i ever eat normally???,False,False

I put food in my mouth especially if I'm around people. Even if it's the first bite I've taken that day i feel so extremely judged and shameful.,False,False
