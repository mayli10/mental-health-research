I know the disordered part of your brain is making you freak about 14% body fat but that’s barely above essential body fat! There is no way that anyone would be thinking you look fat or flabby or anything at 14%. You could easily put on another 6% of body fat and still look super fit and toned. ,False,False

Less lean mass = greater body fat %. Also I really hope you’re male because even 14% is dangerously dangerously low for a female.,False,False
