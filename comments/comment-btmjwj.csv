That's like, model height. When you're short, in my experience, weight gain looks bad very very quickly, because it's all within this one short area. When tall, it can spread out and you can gain way more weight before looking like it. Again, that might be my disordered thinking.   My point being, some of us wish we were taller just as much as you wish you were shorter! We're not confident either! Just keep your head up and try and own your height, I'm sure you look amazing!",False,False
