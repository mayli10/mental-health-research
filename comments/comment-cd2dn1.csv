That I had been given a special granola bar. I thought it would ""boost"" my Prozac lol. Bottom line. If your unsure just ask.",False,True

I was also ravenously hungry which was an awful combo.  Oh, and absolutely EVERYTHING made me cry.   But I was on some other drugs at the time for migraine and mood stabilizers. They were not working for me. I seem to be very sensitive to side effects of a lot of medications I've tried. Which is unfortunate.   I've heard a lot of people have really good luck on Buspar, so I'm not saying any of this to dissuade anyone from trying medications their doctors recommend.",False,False

Im on Prozac with it too. But usually some water and saltines about half hour before and if it's really bad I have some weed for it too. I live in a medical state and my dispensary is great at helping with side effects. Plus my doctor knows I use a puff or 2 to alleviate some side effects. Way better than when I was on celexa and turned into Dr. Jekyll &amp; Mr. Hyde lol,False,True

I'd get shivers up and down my spine like 20 minutes after taking it and shaky hands. It always made me feel like I was on the verge of throwing up.,False,False
