I realize I framed that poorly. I was the one who brought up the point of clothes being made a certain way initially, so that’s my bad. I was speaking about how some clothes don’t fit me right simply because my chest is bigger and so they ride up or look weird on me, and that’s where the conversation stemmed from—not that people can’t wear what they want.   But I see what you’re saying, and honestly I think I’ve fallen prey to the idea that smaller clothes won’t suit me but that’s because of society and my own head being mean.",False,True

All bodies are allowed to wear whatever the hell they want without a man policing them.,False,False

My boyfriend is the most loving, supportive, and positive influence in my life but a seemingly harmless comment from him will send me spiralling out of control. I remember we were introducing his mum to one of our favourite take out dishes and I mentioned that I'd actually had it not too long ago. He said ""careful, you don't want to be eating that every day"" obviously just meaning don't eat it too much because it is really unhealthy and ridiculously high in salt. The fact he said every day though instantly made my mind go ""he must be thinking I am eating it every day because I've put on so much weight in such a short space of time"" and then I started restricting the next day.",False,False
