I have a similar story to share. When I visited my mother recently, she had purchased a bunch of used clothes in size adult small, adult extra small, and child large. I am an adult and can often wear a small, but those clothes were really pushing it for me. I just couldn't fit into 90% of them. Rationally, I knew that it was the clothes making me feel bad because they were ill-fitting, but it was hard to get past the expectation to fit into them all. I like used clothes (once washed, of course), but I had to tell my mother that most of it didn't fit. She was so disappointed, and had to vocalize this disappointment.  I wouldn't have been so bothered by it if she just let it go after that, but she didn't. All day she kept bring up how ""I can't believe that it all didn't fit! Are you sure? What a shame! I can't believe I wasted all this money ($30~), I really thought it would fit!"" She just kept going on and on and kept bringing it up every day for the remainder of my visit. It drove me insane. I think that she was just upset that her $30ish dollars went to waste, but the way she was phrasing it made me feel guilty about not fitting into child size clothing as an adult. I was about ready to give her money and tell her she could have it if she stopped talking about the clothing. Looking back, I should have just told her, ""Those comments make me feel bad about my appearance,"" or something along those lines. Then again, it is easier said than done.",False,False
