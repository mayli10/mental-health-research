A big issue I have with art is 'perfection' and for some reason that translates to me thinking that I have to do photorealistic/hyperrealistic stuff because if I did actual more creative stuff, people might be able to find fault and now I'm stuck in a terrible rut with my art of focusing on one type of drawing, unable to do anything else. I'm not even freaking good at realistic shit either, I'm just beating myself up over a style I don't care about because as a kid when my parents saw my drawings they would critique them on how realistic they were and I can't shake it. I want to do creative stuff with colours and cool stuff and I just can't. I've backed myself into a corner. My creative juices have dried up. I'm scared of colours and making decisions about colours. I'm scared of paints. I'm a CLOWN. I wish I could just be happy doing art and happy making 'mistakes' and not so afraid of making 'bad art' and just enjoy myself for once.       Sorry for the rant, I just relate so hard. Everything is obsession, there is no middle ground. It's perfection or starve to death. It's fucked.",False,False

Thats why i do it. I never finish anything, constantly get creative blocks and my stuff usually looks something between trash and mediocre, but i like doing it. Its not my source of income and i rarely even show anyone, so i dont care if its shitty, its just a release.",False,False
