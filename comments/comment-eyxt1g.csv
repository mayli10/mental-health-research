So I’ll feel “skinny” as long as what I’m eating is under the size of my fist. Probably because a lot of the really skinny girls I’ve known ate mostly sugary stuff, and I guess I like the feeling of control only eating a little bit of junk food gives me. (I’ve never liked savory foods like cheese, meat, etc anyway,) Sometimes I’ll commit to a full meal but it’s very mood dependent and not the norm.   If I had to pick a food that made me feel fat it would be chips, because as a kid they were my emotional eating food.",False,False

Anything that requires me to take big bites to eat makes me feel gross.  Also, not exactly the same, more like I just don’t like the feeling, but food that you have to eat with your hands??
