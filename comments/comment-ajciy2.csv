I do that for as long as I can then alternate with fake ""abs"". I just lift my bent legs and it is like mini-abs.    I started doing this because I don't stand up that often and my legs were in pain, but I learned to appreciate it.     Coincidentally, a while ago I also bought a ""desk peddler"" that looks a bit like [this](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41PfZaX%2BrOL.jpg), and I was thinking about bringing it in but it's noisy and doesn't really offer any resistance (I got it for like 12 euros at Lidl so can't complain haha).

I mean 10 calories is an example. Imagine with 100 ðŸ˜­ I try not to think about it but then I just find pics like that without even looking haha   I guess what frustrates me is that there is no way for me to see how much I spend in those microscopic tasks. If 10 calories are significant over a year then micro-exercise might be too! ",False,True

Walking to/from the bathroom. Stooping to pick something up off the floor then standing back up. Crouching to plug something into an outlet. Reaching for something from a high cabinet. Moving around while washing yourself in the shower.      You're easily burning off 10 calories. Breathe. You're doing just fine.",False,False
