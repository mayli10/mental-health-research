You got this. :)   That's really good advice, I think I'm going to try to implement it. I think whenever I binge, I'll try to do anything else besides restrict and starting the cycle all over again. Maybe something that I don't view as punishment, but relaxing and calming instead.",False,True

Struggled with bulimia but it still caused weight gain. I’m still recovering, haven’t relapsed in a few weeks! But what I usually do in these situations is get up and do something. Doesn’t matter what. I’d clean, go for a walk, hang out with my boyfriend, anything besides isolating yourself with your urges.  I always told myself, “you start changing now or never.” Do something that’ll make you feel better in the end. Something productive or active. (And don’t restrict afterwards. You will end up binging again. Guaranteed)",False,False
