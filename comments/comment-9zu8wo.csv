Curbed my appetite, gave me energy. I was happy on Wellbutrin, excited to do stuff.   I struggle a lot with BED and that got a lot easier to deal with on Wellbutrin. Someone else mentioned Wellbutrin made food taste like cardboard, but I didn't really have that problem. ",False,False

I did lose a lot of weight on it tho. I have heard good things about Wellbutrin but it's not really available in Australia. I'm currently on Anafranil (TCA) for OCD and this helps with many things, including food related obsessions. It's the first anti that has actually helped and I'd tried 6 before I came across this. I would say it is weight neutral for me; however, I have a low tolerance to medication so I don't need much. I've heard it can lead to weight gain if you are on over 200mg (I'm on 100mg) but I've been on it for nearly 2years and have never had to increase.   I've also been recently put in vyvanse for BED and it is amazing! It's so much help. I've cut my binging habits down by about 2/3rd which is very significant. It also helps with things like motivation and actually getting out of bed to do things. Also small things like my room staying clean for nearly a year for the first time in my life. Only problem is that in Australia, it's not on the PBS so you have to pay the private script price of $100+. But if you're in the US, most insurance companies cover it (and I'm sorry for complaining &amp; your health system). It's also a stimulant (ADHD medication) so it is addictive and somewhat difficult to get. I have to keep a food diary to show my psychiatrist fortnightly and get heart checks as well regularly. But when you've had binging issues for over 10years, it's definitely worth it.   I hope you find something that works, meds trial and error is a tough time. Remember you know your body and if the side effects are detrimental to your life, definitely ask to change. Good luck! üíñ",False,False
