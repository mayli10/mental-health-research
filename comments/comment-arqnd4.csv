I'm glad you have the resources there for when you want them, though. Keep turning to us if you need it, definitely! We're always here for you &lt;3",False,False

And I really don't. I don't have anyone irl because I'd hate to trigger my treatment friends and my family doesn't get it. Hence why I turn to the internet I guess.",False,True

You don't have to apologize at all! I really hope it gets better for you. Does your treatment team know about your struggles? Can you talk to anyone irl?",False,False

I know the case thing wasn't me, it just felt like a big slap in the face when I'm already struggling. This is so so freaking hard. I don't even want to recover, but I'm only 17 so I don't have a choice. Living in this body is fucking torture but I have to pretend everything's fine or else I get sent back to treatment. I'm in so much pain and I'm so fucking lonely and I just can't take it anymore  Sorry about the rant. I hope your night is going ok &lt;3",False,True

If that trumpet case broke because you sat on it, it wasn't a good case. I recognize you from your other comment about playing in a pit band for a university group, I was so happy and proud for you! But if your trumpet case is old, used, school-issued, or just fucking unlucky, it wasn't your fault it broke. It definitely wasn't because you weigh too much. I sat on my oboe case so many times even when I was 15 pounds overweight and nothing ever happened. It's shitty that it broke, but now you can get a new one that'll protect your instrument better so you can keep playing in that wonderful band!  Also, re: recovery body. I'm really sorry you're struggling. It sucks, and I know there's nothing I can say that'll reassure you. Try to remember that you're doing good by your body, even if it feels fucking awful. You're gonna be okay. You may even lose some overshoot weight, but don't focus on that or it'll drive you back again. I hope you're doing okay. Please don't hesitate to reach out to me if you need to talk more!",False,False

How do they expect us NOT to die from self loathing alone? If treatments are to help us why can't they help us be at like the BMI of 19 and just supplement vitamins and minerals. I feel as if those treatments are trying to degrade us to drag us down. ,False,False
