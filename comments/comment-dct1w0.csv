My 120-lb ex was a stick and could barely pick me up by the waist when I was around 110 lbs (I'm short so it was just normal weight). On the other hand, my SO who's 25 lbs heavier and used to squat over twice his weight could princess carry me at that weight+10 more and LOVED doing so to show off to me lol. Whenever there were muddy hills and I hesitated because I didn't like getting my (new) sneakers dirty earlier, he'd offer to carry or piggyback ride. On some Reddit thread I saw recently, most guys could lift up to 150 or 160 lbs (of human, not rocks) easily, with anything over rated as moderate strength required",False,False
