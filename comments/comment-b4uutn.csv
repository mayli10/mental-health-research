Dont beat yourself to much over it. I binged on half a container of peanut butter last night and only gained a pound. Hopefully the damage wont be too big. ,False,False

BUT ymmv as it's a huge commitment tho in terms of not being able to purge without risking infection etc, so i think nails as a temporary, ease into it thing would be really helpful :') anyways lmao ",False,False
