That post and the mod comment are infuriating.  I sort of see the rationale the mods are using to allow the post. Im sure it is important to be mindful of food choices when trying to lose weight in a healthy manner.  But that bracelet is taking a thoughtful reminder for healthy weight loss mindset into extremely disordered territory. It‚Äôs not asking the wearer to check in with a question ‚Äòare you hungry or just bored?‚Äô It is literally a statement ‚Äònot hungry just bored‚Äô that the wearer will see EVERY time they eat.
