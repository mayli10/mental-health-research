But that's because i make a weekly meal plan before shopping to make sure I stick to the budget. After I make the plan and shopping list, I go through and calculate measurements, calories, etc for my portion of each meal and write it all down. Every item, for each meal, that way if I don't finish a certain thing, I can subtract from the already there number (like only eating half a portion of something I calculated for a whole of).   Snacks usually day of. Though tbh, I rotate through the same handful, so I typically already know the calorie count of each and use my current deficit to figure out which one I'm allowed.",False,False
