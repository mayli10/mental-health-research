Treatment centers are going to take your control away, first and foremost. You will not be able to make ""special requests"" because they will not do that for anyone. Trust me, I told them everything I could to avoid full-fat dairy and make other diet changes. It won't work, but luckily I was able to request soy milk. If you have food allergies, you need to have clear documentation given to the facility or they might not believe you. Unfortunately, a lot of people with eating disorders will fake an allergy to avoid a fear food (and trust me, I get that in their cases). I think the leggings and a words policy is fair. You might not get it, but some people will struggle with this going into treatment. Some people might not even go to treatment if  a therapeutic environment isn't set up for them. I was one of those people, and it made me feel horrible having to be around girls who were severely underweight when I was just on the low end of ""normal"" BMI. Try to be empathetic because everyone deserves a chance to recover in the most comfortable setting possible.   &amp;#x200B;  I'm not saying that this treatment facility has not done things wrong, but those are the points that I actually don't think are a problem coming out of this facility. Get them official allergy paperwork to try and help that issue and work closely with the doctor and dietitian. Speak up for yourself about not viewing your weight or close your eyes if you have to (that is really strange btw, nowhere I've \*ever\* been has allowed that). Be an advocate for your own health, but also remember you have an eating disorder. It is true that a center is going to challenge every food principle you have ever made for yourself, and I genuinely hear a mixture of anger in your post from the perspective of both someone with an eating disorder scared to recover and a person just advocating for their health.

(2) It is *not automatically the case* that the other clinicians are ‚Äúright‚Äù, it‚Äôs far more complex than that.  (3) Naturally if the other clinicians are advocating a plan that feels safer/cleaner/more familiar to the patient, while the recovery centre is challenging them, the patient will strongly prefer the medical opinion of the former. Still doesn‚Äôt automatically make the centre wrong.  (4) It is not inherently problematic for a patient to experience more GI symptoms, even considerably more, as part of treatment.   (5) Somatisation, POTS-type symptoms, and anorexia-related GP are all incredibly common comorbids of restrictive EDs. OP‚Äôs situation is far less unusual than they think, and it is actively unhelpful to reinforce the impression that the centre couldn‚Äôt cope with their specialness and therefore mistreated them. That is not the issue. Everyone who focuses in on ‚Äúzomg medical so srs‚Äù is deflecting from the real issues: of everything OP has cited, their most serious condition is the restrictive ED.   Most importantly, OP is talking about their past experiences and this is a reflective/analytical discussion. You imply that they are saying ‚Äúmy doctor says I should eat XYZ‚Äù and I am saying ‚Äúno, you should eat ABC‚Äù. That is completely untrue, unfair and a misrepresentation of what I actually did say. I suggested they reevaluate their experience and consider that they were pathologising more of it than they perhaps should (where many of those aspects are typical/normal and not in any way wrong or unethical), because doing so might actually improve the efficacy of a review that they presumably *want to be efficacious*. Otherwise what‚Äôs the point of writing it? If it‚Äôs going to be dismissed as ‚Äúoh, just a ranting ana‚Äù, then there is no point.   Giving constructively critical feedback is not wrong.
