I lay on my side and he lays behind me and rubs my back and reads the news, blog posts, a whole book, whatever. This almost always takes a full fledged panic attack and dials it back to calm. If you can’t do this for whatever reason (no SO, busy SO, shitty SO, whatever), a close second would be to put on a podcast. Anything that will hold your interest will do, but I especially recommend ones with multiple hosts, because the back-and-forth conversation will do a better job of holding your attention and stopping your mind wandering back to obsessive panic thoughts.   Hope this helps.",False,False
