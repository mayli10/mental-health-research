I'm 5'1 and I can't relate to have long thin legs. While I'm on this tangent, eating at a deficit when your short is so fucking hard. I feel like I don't even get enough food when I'm maintaining. I hate watching everyone eat three cheeseburgers and fries for a SINGLE meal meanwhile that's what I'd be able to eat for a whole day if I were maintaining. My boyfriend also likes to say that it's not hard and he would be able to do it. It drives me insane. Then he's like when I'm eating at a deficit it's by the same amount it just translates to my height instead. It's not the same though! 1800 even if you're tall as a deficit seems so different than 1200. Lastly, why is finding short clothing so fucking hard. I don't want to get everything tailored, especially things as simple as leggings. I also hate petite retailers. Most of them are ""petite - 5'3 and under!"" What do you even mean?! 5'3 is vastly different from 5'0. You can't have a pair of pants that fits both. Also I don't consider 5'3 that petite considering it's my friends height and she can mostly fit into normal pants pretty fine. This is a dumb rant but meh I hate being short, literally any amount of weight makes such a big difference.",False,False
