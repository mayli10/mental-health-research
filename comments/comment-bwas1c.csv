I was taking something until fairly recently that required it to be taken with food, but eating made me want to throw up, thereby purging the med before it could work and making the whole thing pointless, but if I didn't eat before taking it it made me throw up, thereby purging the med etc. etc. The whole thing was hugely infuriating.  But honestly sweetheart if you can make yourself you should be taking them. Your mental health is a priority and getting that evened out should hopefully make food issues easier to deal with. You're not getting any better by not taking them so it's worth a try x",False,False
