Started college and within the first month I found myself walking past college and instead going shopping as the stress started to pile up and I didn't know how to handle it. I wish I had've gone to one of the college counsellors because I think if I had of just admitted that I needed a bit more support and considered part-time, I would have been able to continue without having to completely stop altogether.   It's always better to reduce your hours then quit altogether. I'm sure things will improve once you start to voice your concerns and work towards working on yourself. The study part is still great in order to distract your mind and remain productive and active.",False,False

You're not alone. If your school has a mental health center, see if you can get in to talk to someone, even just for one appointment.   I saw what you said in another comment about going down to part-time-- that also sounds like a good idea. If it makes you feel any better, it took my SO from the age of 18 until 26 to get his bachelor's, and now we're 28 and he's finally starting grad school. It's never too late to finish your degree and you are not any kind of failure for needing more time to achieve your goals. You're going through a lot. Don't be too hard on yourself. We're all here if you need us. &lt;3 take care",False,False

I know this is so cliche and shit, but your health is more important. I promise. If you need another couple of months, school will still be there.
