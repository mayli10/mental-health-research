I've been dealing with my ed since I was 13, my first boyfriend ( he was 18) when I was 15 didn't give a fuck about his body and was chubby and would just eat whatever, and I found being around him all the time and him forcing me to eat I loosened up a bit, but I also developed purging habits during that relationship. my current partner is beautiful and for his job is surrounded by models all day, its the biggest motivator ever. 100% my ed fluctuates to who I'm partnered with at the time.",False,False
