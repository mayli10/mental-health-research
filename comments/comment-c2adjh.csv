It doesn't help me personally. I'm not sure which hobbies to even try. I'm just at a loss. As for meeting people, I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm either socially awkward or I subconsciously push others away (it's probably both tbh). I'm kind of invisible to the rest of the world. I've always had difficulty making and keeping friends.",False,True

Is that something you can do? Can you go to meet ups or find local clubs and just try out different hobbies, even if you’re not totally interested right now? Your interest can grow!  Do you have a therapist? That can help with the connection piece too. I think just starting to put yourself out there is a good step, even though I know it can be hard and scary",False,False
