I had been in a binge spiral since I started taking it and I’ve gained a shit tonne but I’m not sure that it’s the medication’s fault because now I’m restricting again and I’ve lost quite a bit- I think it makes me a lot more frantic in my emotions, leading to all-or-nothing moments, whereas Prozac kept me a lot calmer and a lot more moderated which made it easier to eat normally.  BUT it all depends on the person and I don’t want to put you off if your doctor thinks it might be good for you- that’s just my experience on it, but yours might be completely different!",False,False
