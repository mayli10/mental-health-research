If I eat croissants or bread or pasta, I could eat loads of that and I'd get really bloated. Eating mainly meat + eggs made me feel really satiated for long periods of time and my energy levels are great.  Carbs are the devil to me... but I guess for some people it would be the other way around so I can't give you any advice, only anecdotes",False,False

I’ll definitely cut out the crap foods I eat to make room for fats and protein because I think that will really help out with feeling satiated. And maybe I’ll get my period back lol,False,True

I’d say roughly 40% carbs %30 fats %30 protein works well. honestly if your ED allows it eating 3/4 of a regular diet and rarely ever slipping up is a sustainable way to be underweight. I’ve been about the same weight for years and eat more than some of my non eating disordered friends a lot of the time I’m just very tall so I don’t gain weight. I used to restrict so intensely, but even if I stayed that way for a month, I’d either end up binging or almost dying...",False,False
