Don't forget how much many of our boyfriend's show through their actions that they love our new skinny bodies, and they love them more and more as we lose weight. At the same time they urge us to stop restricting.  Total mindfuck in so many ways, not worth it.",False,False

It just makes you a shittier person because you have to lie about it. My boyfriend gets so upset when I restrict and has basically forced me to eat at times. It hurts him so much and I hate myself for treating him this way, but it doesn't make it any easier to recover.",False,False
