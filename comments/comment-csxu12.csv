Yes they're good for losing weight fast but what about KEEPING IT OFF? That's what' is so stupid about fasting. You don't just fast and than maintain- you fast and then binge because well, guess what, YOUR BODY NEEDS FOOD. We are ANIMALS and as much as we wish we were some alien species that didn't have to eat to sustain our lives- we do. And we get very, very crazier the hungrier we are.   &amp;#x200B;  I'm just annoyed cause I keep trying to fast and I feel like shit and like a failure because I literally can't go longer than 24 hours. People who fast for 3 days, HOW?",False,False

You didn’t eat for 3 days. No judgement. You wanted to look lovely. No judgement.   All I ask is are you prepared to eat. Have you eaten? Are you ready for a bounce back when you start to eat again. I am just saying be careful your body will be craving KCAL’s. Plus your body is at a heightened tension. You just need to be careful when coming off a fast for your Mind and body.,False,False
