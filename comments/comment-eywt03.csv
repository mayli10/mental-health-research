I’ve got a calcium chew and a magnesium powder (there are magnesium capsules too depending on your preference. Just pick a form with good bioavailability - iirc that’s the forms ending in -ate.) Potassium I think is hard to get from an OTC pill because at least in the US they’re usually limited to a small amount since too much potassium is dangerous for your heart. Many salt substitutes do contain potassium chloride but I don’t use them much because it tends to really upset my stomach if I have more than a tiny bit.",False,False

If you are feeling like it’s coming from deficiency definitely supplement! Also maybe CBD lotion rubbed on your feet if it is available to you.   If you feel like it’s more of a bone cramp, fish oil also helps! Good luck!",False,False
