It's so cool knowing that now bc my team, to my awareness, didn't really relate to me in that way so I felt really out of touch in the past. Health practitioners have this responsibility if they decide open up and it can bring out a better outcome for both parties in treatment plans. I had seen counseling in general to be really one sided tbh. Tyty",False,True
