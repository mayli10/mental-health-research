You absolutely have to tell him off next time you see him. Something horrific like “still got a 3 inch dick of has it gotten smaller?”   Fuck that guy!,False,False

Idiots who make statements like that make us think that our problems are everybody’s business, and it’s not at all. I’m so sorry he said that to you.  And, I’m sure your boyfriend appreciates that you were helping him in the first place. That was super kind of you and tour words just prove how much you care for him and I’m sure other people as well. Good on that nurse for not pushing the conversation too far. I hope today is much better for you",False,False
