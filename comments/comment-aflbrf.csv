Or, we go out to all the restaurants and I get larger, more unhealthy and hate myself more. This won't be forever, when I'm back to a healthy weight I don't mind going out once a week. However this is not sustainable and it is hurting my health.   If you want to eat at these places, go, I will not be angry or upset if you want a waffle. Or, we can make similar food at home that I can measure, count and portion properly so I can enjoy it *and* still have a calorie deficit. ""  You're making really good healthy choices here, he needs to realise how damaging 30lbs can be, because it won't stop at 30 if he bullies you into it and it'll make you relapse, purge, and starve yourself and that's an awful way to live.",False,False

This sounds like it was unfair on you but he may well be feeling constricted in his habits. If he’s not interested in eating better with you then take charge of what you’re gonna eat and if you’re cooking for him too then he can add a steak or extra cheeSe or whatever it is he feels is lacking. He doesn’t want to change his eating then that’s on him but it should stop you ordering healthy even at his favourite place. You’re fair to say you’re not interested in the bagel but be should be able to eat what he wants. He shouldn’t be mean about it and say you’d steal it or whatever but you guys obviously have different requirements and it’s important you guys let each other eat how you want. This sort of issue comes up a lot on mainstream subs like loseit and 1200P and people have shared experiences on how they made it work. I feel you with the ED element making things harder and more emotional but just know it’s possible to make It work.,False,False

It's quite strange to me that he said he was getting eggs for both of you and he returned with a meat sandwich for himself as well (taking extra time to return). I think the things he wants to eat isn't the problem, neither is your weight gain. As you described: he is asserting his agency, being kinda mean (at the very least he is being quite unsupportive) and a bit passive aggressive. You are expecting him to match/ support your dietary/ health choices. He isn't/doesn't want to.   &amp;#x200B;  You both sound very unhappy and stressed. He sounds rude. ",False,False
