My happy weight/bmi is 135lb/24.5 and I could eat and snack all day long and not gain weight. I've lost 20lb now, but I just know that if I stop restricting, I'll quickly blow back up...

Like obviously, in theory, I was eating maintenance Calories, but I have no idea how to replicate that in practice. If I ate freely, I *would* gain wait, as much as my ED team insists otherwise.   Like, I know myself. My natural setting rn is BED. Unfortunately, I wasted January and didn't lose any weight this month, but in the past, if I honestly didn't care, I'd just gain weight. I didn't develop BED from restriction; it just happened spontaneously. ",False,False

I was anorexic for years (like age 14-21). I’ve been in recovery for about 4 years now, with lots of slip ups. But I always thought it was *insane* that people could skip meals by accident, not think about food constantly, casually snack on things, go out to dinner, etc. And I still have some anxiety about that, but for the most part I can eat “normally” now. Idk I’m not trying to sound preachy or anything - but it’s still possible for you to recover. I thought I was in too deep, too. It’s just - don’t give up. ",False,False

Like say you love cinnamon rolls, tell yourself you’re allowed to have one on Sunday. Then you won’t be upset you can’t have one on Friday or Saturday, and you won’t be upset that you did have one on Sunday, because it was part of the plan and not you giving in to a binge craving or losing control.

I maintained at a weight I was happy with (about the highest weight I could be to still be underweight)  Then I learned about calories and had kids and now I’m scared of calories and food and binge eat and even tho I’m way underweight now, I just can’t eat normally.

I don’t know how ‘normal’ people do it. They skip meals if they’re not hungry, snack if they are, don’t count calories, barely give it a second though. I hate this life so much.
