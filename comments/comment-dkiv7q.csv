I remember when I was 17, at the beginning of the gravest part of my eating disorder, a middle aged woman laughed and told me that she STILL had no idea whether she eats 'a healthy diet', because news of new health fads are always coming out, but that she tries to listen to her own internal body rhythms and go with them. That fascinated me at the time...I even felt jealously. Little did I know that it would take another 7 years for me to start understanding her happy carelessness, which I viewed as pathetic mediocrity.  And that´s what I´m trying to get at... that many people are confused by eating disorders because they don´t understand how we can´t understand them. Then comes us not understanding how they can´t understand us, being flabbergasted at their mediocre happiness.  But no happiness is mediocre. It may take years for you to get to a place where you feel in sync with your body rhythms, but maybe this post here, this change of perception, can be a first step.-  That´s all for now.
