Even without consciously exercising at all, you’d probably have expended 1400 calories *at least* (though it might depend on your metabolism too) because you burn calories to stay alive haha. On top of that, thermic effect of food is a thing – energy is required to digest and process the food, and I read somewhere that this can take up around 10% of the caloric content of the food (so if you ate 2200kcal, maybe around 220 of that would be expended due to TEF).   Besides, when you eat more, your body might also naturally burn more calories than usual eg. fidgeting more, higher body temperature, etc.   Basically I’d say that you really wouldn’t gain any real weight/fat and your appearance definitely wouldn’t change! ED might be a trip, but the math don’t lie haha. Weight fluctuations might happen, but that would 1000% be to do with food weight or bloating or water retention, which are temporary.   Say strong, friend. You deserve to eat whenever whatever. Take care &lt;3",False,False
