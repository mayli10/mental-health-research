Then I never purchase it, never go after work or during lunch, don't stop anywhere, don't go to the grocery for pre-planned binges... I can't justify the monetary cost nor the mental cost of how it'll stick to me, nor the time I'll spend either going there waiting in the drive thru or walking in to order or pick up my online order. Mostly when I want something I want it now, which is good because like you I'll get bored or just want to go straight home after work. Impulse control or something I guess IDK.   Someone mentioned here awhile back all the joy in a binge is in the planning and setup phase. The dopamine rush you get from thinking about and planning it all out. Then when you actually go through with it you're in agony afterward for hours or days. I find this true for me.",False,False
