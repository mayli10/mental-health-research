I know a lot of people use them to put fruit on/butters/generally to serve dessert on, but I don't do that.

I've also been thinking up other ideas though:  1. cottage cheese with a lettuce/spinach barrier, fried egg on top? (might be ew and I might be better off eating the cottage cheese/egg separately, but it's an idea my brain isn't gonna give up on until i eventually try)  2. thin layer of cream cheese with lettuce/spinach barrier with deli meat &amp; tomato slices (or sliced hardboiled egg w/tomato slices)  3. serve rotisserie chicken on somehow?

Though now that i think about it, one thing i wouldn't be opposed to is some chopped fruit (banana, apple) with greek yogurt served on top. Peanut butter would be acceptable too, but I don't know what else I'd pair with the peanut butter on a rice cake, because I'm opposed to letting myself eat peanut butter by itself (e.g. sometimes I include a tablespoon or two in my oatmeal, but that's about all I use it for).  I could experiment with beans and pastes but I haven't ever really eaten beans before though I plan on starting to even if I don't like them all that much.
