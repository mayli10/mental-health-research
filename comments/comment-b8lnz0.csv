I did keto to lose most of my weight when I was obese (then just quit eating when my ED got out of control lol) but I’ve been thinking of going back to it without counting calories just because it kept me so full. I’m really addicted to sugar/starches again and need to detox badly. :(,False,True

Counting macros MAY be useful, but if it causes you to become anxious, don't bother counting. This is naturally going to steer you towards things like eggs, meat, fish, cheese, liver, kidney, and nonstarchy vegetables. The calories per gram is high but you don't need to eat much to feel full because it's all protein and fat, not carbohydrate (which for some people has an orexigenic (makes you eat more) effect).",False,False

I either eat everything without worrying about it and end up on a binge or I don't eat. I don't know how to lose weight normally either because it's like when I do start eating I have no self control and over eat every single time. I've tried taking these Trans4orm diet pills I found on Amazon and it does seem they help a little with being able to lose weight just by giving me more energy, and I've researched vitamins and stuff to help control my urges to eat even when I'm not hungry. I'm current taking L-tyrosine and l-dopa to boost my dopamine which supposedly helps with motivation and self control, and I'm taking chromium which is supposed to help keep your blood sugar levels stable and it does seem to help me not feel hungry for longer, but when I do eat it's still just. A lot. ",False,False
