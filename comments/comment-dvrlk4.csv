Please accept that you have a lot of unhealthy thoughts and behaviors and start seeking help to become a healthier, happier (and honestly, probably skinnier) you. If I had done so when I just ""related to some things"" I wouldn't be in a hell of sliding back and forth five pounds between high end of healthy and overweight. I literally can't lose weight anymore and I'm just miserable. I started out keto too. It's a very dangerous slope to dance on.",False,False

Your teeth, your stomach, and your hormones will get royally fucked up. Your stomach because it spikes insulin and digestive enzymes in preparation for things that don't make it to the stomach, your teeth will start to rot from overuse (because c/s is HIGHLY addictive and escalates over time. If you dont stop before it's too late you will spend mountains of money and multiple hours just chewing and spitting). And your hormones start to get confused, your hunger and fullness hormones get out of whack, your thyroid will produce incorrectly, and you can absolutely destroy your body's way of messaging about food and appetite. If you're willing to risk this just to about 220 calories from a snickers bar? That's pretty disordered.",False,False

People would think a lot of the food I eat everyday is ""bad"" or whatever but it fits in my calories and macro goals so is it really ""bad""? Yes, some foods are an *indulgence* and may not provide the best nutritional value, but you can still enjoy those foods, in moderation. I don't think it's healthy to label food you enjoy and can eat within in moderation as something negative.  I think it's important for everyone know that different foods offer different level of nutrition and then you can make informed decisions on what to eat. The foods by themselves aren't really *bad*, but they can be a part of healthy or unhealthy diets.  Me when I survived off of 1200 calories of just oreos: bad.   Me when I fit in 2 oreos into an otherwise balanced diet: good, imo  This kind of logic works with all foods. There are days where my boyfriend wants to go out together for pizza or McDonalds or whatever. I can get a nice meal from McDonalds for about 500-600 calories and be satisfied or get 2 slices of medium cheese pizza for about the same.",False,False
