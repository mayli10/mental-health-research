If I don't count and try to eat normally though, I end up eating unhealthily little, even less than when I'm actively restricting, because I have so much anxiety about everything being too much. Ugh, I'm so messed up lol",False,True

Unless I upload my food intake in my food diary app, I am not able to tell whether I’ve consumed enough or too much. And more often than not, if I eat around 1500-2000 calories (which is approximately my maintaining amount) I feel bad about myself because it feels like I ate too much and I feel guilty and fat and disgusting. These days I only feel good when I restrict. Congratulations to you to feel amazing after eating normally, I think it’s a step forward towards recovery",False,False

I’m not all the way there yet. But eating more regularly than I ever have on trial and error/nutritionist/therapist optimised daily meal plan that doesn’t change very much day to day and as such has become very habitual. And there are days when I actually don’t really think about food, like when or what I will have, assessing my hunger and whether or not I’m too fat/deserve it.   A day where I didn’t think about food. It’s like realising a part of your brain opens up that was busy and you can think and feel smarter and more observant and stuff.",False,False

I’m on a holiday, and it took a while to get into eating again, but after a few days of eating man it was a shock to realise this is ‘normal’ for most people",False,False

I ate relatively normally this weekend because I was with a friend and I realized... wait, this is how normal people live. This is what I’ve been missing the last seven years.
