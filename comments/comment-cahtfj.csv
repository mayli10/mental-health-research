I want to feel really full in the evening because that's when I tend to binge or think about food the most.  I'm probably going to fast one day (36 hours) a week too to encourage myself to resist hunger/cravings.  Congratulations on avoiding binges, I think this is the hardest part!",False,True

Just stumbled on it yesterday, and surprisingly loved it! Found it inspiring too, have been binge free since. I mean it's only been a day and a half but that's huge for me.     And thanks to your post, I'll definitely be checking out ep 2!     What new kinda diet are you trying out?",False,False
