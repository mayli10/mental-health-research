I was trying to avoid all sugar so when my mom was making mojitos a few weeks ago she said she'd make mine without the simple syrup. Didn't realize tonic water had a fuck ton of sugar and calories in it until after I was done drinking it (and I thought she used calorie-free club soda)(And isn't tonic water JUST WATER??). Cue the tipsy panic attack ugh.,False,False

It really threw me for a loop when I realized that my dietitian when I was inpatient didn't even count 40 calories because it was such a minute difference that for our bodies and for weight gain or loss, it doesn't change anything. I was so engaged in my eating disorder that I couldn't understand because I felt that the 50 calories in the Pedialyte that I had to have with every meal and snack was so many liquid calories but it's so low that they don't even count it. It's crazy how our eating disorders turn an amount that's nothing to everyone else into the end of the world. If you have trouble with lightheadedness, a lot of times it's caused by low blood sugar so having some sweetened almond milk might help with that (on the bright side).",False,False
