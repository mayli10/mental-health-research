Plus most of my friends are huge guys who still have crazy metabolisms. Super triggering dudes even outside of how much they eat. Definitely blow them off more than anyone/thing else.   Don’t let it bring you down. It’s okay to need some space, this is really hard stuff to deal with and some people just aren’t gonna understand that. If going out and socializing is gonna tank your mental health there’s no shame in sitting one out or rescheduling. You gotta do what’s best for you.",False,False

Probably because I opened up to one friend about my ED and they haven’t done a single thing to help or really reassure me unless I basically force them. It also feels like none of my friends really care or ask how I’m doing even tho I’m clearly becoming emaciated.   Overall I’ve come to the realization that a lot of people I love just kinda seem to use me. It’s really lonely. I’m looking forward to the day I send the “Hey I’m back in the hospital” text and see how many people give me a call in inpatient.,False,False
