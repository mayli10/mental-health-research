She can't force you to see someone or gain weight, although she may tell a counselor about you. When I lost around 100 pounds in high school and came back after summer, 8 students/teachers contacted the school counselor assigned to me, so I was called into her office. I was severely underweight at the time, but there was nothing she could do other than beg my parents to get me help (they claimed there was not a problem). When I went through a short recovery phase and talked to her about that time, she recalls how helpless she felt. She was afraid I was going to die and legally there was nothing she could do about it aside fro call CPS or something.  &amp;#x200B;  So yeah, long story short: baggy dresses are a good idea but there's nothing they can force you to do regardless, aside from badger you to get help.",False,False
