I always feel guilty when people ask how long I've been vegan or vegetarian because I first went veggie over 10 years ago but between my family not being supportive, taking breaks while trying to recover from restrictive phases and having insatiable cheese cravings during binge phases, it's kind of awkward to explain that you've been on and off and don't have a veganniversary because you keep slipping up with cheese every few months at least. I find the online vegan community to sometimes be very hateful towards people who are transitioning or struggling because if we know animal ag is wrong enough to want to be vegan we shouldn't see animal products as food anymore or whatever, but there's absolutely no mention of how people with EDs especially should be granted way more wiggle room in their journey and not make themselves sicker trying to live up to the perfect standard. Despite the fact that tons of veg*ns got their start on that lifestyle at least partially as a way to cover for their ED or as a result of their ED let's be real... We're clearly a large invisible monitority in the vegan community that non disordered people just pay no mind to when they speak ðŸ˜’",False,False

With the advice from my doctor and my husband I decided to start eating fish, which I felt so guilty for - But I feel ten times better since adding fish to my diet. I have more muscle too, and Iâ€™m not as underweight as I was either. Now Iâ€™m an egg-dairy free pescatarian!  You know whatâ€™s best for you. If itâ€™s making you a healthy weight then thatâ€™s a good thing.",False,False
