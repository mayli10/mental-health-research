I ate the eggs, they ended up saying that the toast wasn‚Äôt required which was a relief, and my boyfriend came with me and was my quiet cheerleader until my urges went down. The lady running the scans is probably wondering why I‚Äôm doing leg lifts in my chair as I wait for the next scan, but I don‚Äôt care about that as much lol. I‚Äôm so relieved that I didn‚Äôt cry in front of them! Now just to make it through the rest of the day and forget about this haha üòä  Thanks everyone for your support, you‚Äôre all the best! üíñ",False,True

If you break down in front of the people doing the test, that's okay. I am sure you'll be able to crochet or read or something! I had to do a barium swallow study once and that stuff was SUPER constipating - so eggs/toast sound better to me than that. I recognize that might not be the case for you but if the idea of ""well at least it's not barium"" helps, there ya go",False,False

I have medicine that helps me digest when my body is struggling. I had gotten to the point that I would try and eat ‚Äúnormally‚Äù and food would sit in my stomach for well over 24 hours and I‚Äôd end up vomiting if I kept eating (not purging- just my body couldn‚Äôt handle it). I was so bloated that I would freak out and it hurt SO fucking bad that I would curl in a ball and sob. It WILL be worth it to get the help you need and you can always take a walk or exercise after you eat if it helps calm your ED down. Much love- this shit sucks!,False,False

That‚Äôs another thing I‚Äôm worried about- that I will have hit my calorie limit by 9am tomorrow and have to go through the day still lol.   I will definitely think of you and try to pretend they‚Äôre my safe foods too üíñ,False,True

Have you gotten treatment for gastroparesis? (And if so was it helpful? I‚Äôve been in so much pain since it got bad lol)  It‚Äôs really weird, I use CICO religiously and can eat normally with family or enjoy sweets, but something about eggs and white bread is just ‚Äúnot worth it‚Äù to a paralyzing point in my mind. Like I hate egg yolks anyway so voluntarily ‚Äúwasting‚Äù calories on them is making me so anxious even though i ultimately believe that food is food and I know I won‚Äôt gain from this meal.   Plus it‚Äôs at 8am so I will have hit my daily calorie limit by frickin 9am tomorrow! ü§®",False,True

I finally conquered all (most) of my weird fear foods earlier this year and it‚Äôs quite nice to eat whatever I want (as long as I stay within the calorie limits of my ED that is). You‚Äôll be fine in the end and I promise- getting help for the gastroparesis is SO worth it!,False,False
