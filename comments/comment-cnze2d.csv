I just hit 67kg which is the lowest I've been in a while (lowest is 59) and I was hovering around 73kg before this but somehow I feel even fatter than I did at 75kg??? Like.... how,False,False

I got to my goal weight but gained maybe 6-7 pounds back in a short span of 2 weeks. I remember being at this weight feeling good when I was losing weight. Now that I am back up I’m like I’m very chubby.,False,False

But now I feel like I look the same when I was 20 pounds heavier. I’ll look at pics from my HW compared to now, and I really don’t see any difference :/",False,False

I'm officially lower than my lowest weight, and I feel fatter than I did when I was at this weight before. I think the euphoria of losing so much weight and being lower than ever before was what made me feel so skinny the first time, and now that it's slowed to a crawl and there isn't as much tangible progress, I just feel worse. I think that might just be the more common version. I think it's a mindset thing.",False,False

I lost 3 kg in May, gained them back last month on vacation. Now I feel fatter than ever even if I've been this size before for months and it's not even my HW. I guess I'll always feel fat until I lose again because in my head I'm not skinny because it's not my LW so I must be fat. ED logic.",False,False
