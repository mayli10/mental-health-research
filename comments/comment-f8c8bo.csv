I would say ghosted is a better term for this. I was &amp; still am scarred. So I was seeing a therapist for GAD, PTSD, &amp; depression. This was actually 3 years ago &amp; before I developed a full blown ED. So anyway I had been seeing this young lady for mmm 3 months roughly? Like end of June until beginning of October. One day in October there was awful weather &amp; I was ALWAYS told if you donâ€™t feel safe driving due to weather just text me &amp; we will reschedule. So I did that, icy roads &amp; a 20 minute trip into a city for therapy session? No thanks. I very politely asked if she minded rescheduling &amp; allowing me to miss my appointment. She was totally fine with it &amp; said she would be in touch. After that day I was never able to contact her again! She stopped answering texts &amp; emails, wouldnâ€™t return my phone calls/voicemails, &amp; the real kicker? I showed up at the office during normal hours to find the place locked up. I mailed her a check for the money I owed from my last appointment (I paid by the month) along with a letter asking what happened... she cashed the check &amp; submitted the insurance paperwork but that was it. Soooo unprofessional.. I have no idea what I did wrong even though I know I did nothing wrong. It was so messed up. &amp; honestly the last two months of last year I reached out to another therapist &amp; told her all of this info &amp; that I wanted help with my ED along with other things. She was great &amp; I thought we had a good connection &amp; were making some real progress! But in January I found out my insurance no longer covered therapy as a regular visit it was now specialist making it something I couldnâ€™t afford. I called my therapist to let her know about this &amp; she didnâ€™t answer so I had to leave a voicemail explaining all this &amp; asking to cancel my appointment until I could figure out my finances. She. Never. Even.  Called. Me. Back. I was honestly so sad for like 2 weeks because I thought we had more of a relationship... needless to say I will not be going back again anytime soon ðŸ˜­",False,False
