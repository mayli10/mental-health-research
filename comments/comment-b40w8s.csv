It's not necessarily a red flag.  That being said, I wouldn't fully discount the idea of him purging just yet.  I would totally think he was purging if he didn't have world records set (officials are there to judge fairly, right?).",False,False

He basically restricts and has a full-time job exercising. Also, who knows how much he can actually absorb eating that fast.",False,False

I think of these kinds of videos like that, except it's the opposite. Instead of using large amounts of food to balance out intense working out, his career involves intense working out to balance out eating large amounts of food. I mentioned this in another thread recently about mukbangs, but there's this well known Korean broadcaster who works out anywhere from 4\~12 hours a day to keep up with his food livestreaming.  Not that everyone definitely does it this way. There are probably youtubers who do this ""healthily (careful meal planning + working out),"" those who do it ""unhealthily (purging),"" and those who do a combination/neither. Matt Stonie was already a very well known competitive eater before Youtube, and I just get the feeling that someone who's been doing that for so long is probably doing it as sustainably as he can (with exercise and doctor supervision).",False,False
