I've only starting seeing more of this recently (as in, active content) but it sort of explains a subset of EDs and ED talk that I couldn't relate to.",False,False

Most likely, the doctor would want to ensure your weight for the following situations: 1. It is necessary that for your medical follow-ups you have a control of your weight, regardless of the reason for consultation. 2. Upon realizing your BMI, he was surprised because your BMI is lower than he expected, not because you don't look that way, But because it is a significant number that is definitely worth making sure that it is so. 3. Probably your psychiatrist (as you mentioned it was for SSRI), is considering changing your current treatment to another based on that, or adjusting the dose according to your weight.  Be safe honey, take your meds ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False

No shade at all to anyone in the sub, but it's got to be painful to be overweight from BED (or recovery from restrictive EDs, or any other reason they're overweight) and see people shrug off shockingly low weights as not that thin -- especially if it feels like a humblebrag about how sick they are. Again, totally not trying to shame or shade anyone for being honest about their weight or their BDD (I'd be a hypocrite of so, since I am flared as UW), but I feel badly for people seeing that and being insecure or feeling invalidated.",False,False
