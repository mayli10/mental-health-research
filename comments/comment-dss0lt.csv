You're focusing on harm reduction and that's the best thing you can do. You won't be able to stop his ED, but you can at least make it not kill him so fast or make him so sick. I think that's a good idea.  One time I was going to go on a date with someone who also has an ED and I offered to bring homemade smoothies for us because they're low cal and super healthy. I knew that she probably wouldn't want to eat anything, because she was in a bad place at the time, but I like really talked them up and she seemed interested. Not sure how that would have gone over because she ended up having heart problems on the subway and couldn't make it, but I think it would have gone well.  Another good alternative to smoothies or protein shakes is meal replacement shakes. I haven't been doing so great lately myself but I've been drinking one every morning and I think it helps a lot. I also take 3 vitamins and fiber supplement because I can't really muster up the energy to make healthy meals for myself, but it's working pretty well. I feel I've been doing better since I started doing this.",False,False

IME, when I’ve been approached by someone else with an ED with things like this, it does feel very... sabotage-esque, even if I know it’s out of them caring. However, I *didn’t* feel this way (as much) if the person offering it also drank one. Bonus points if it’s with me/in front of me. Even if I don’t drink mine.   So, I dunno. Casual is better from how I’ve dealt with it. And not being super vocal about him looking/seeming like shit. Like: “hey, you’re doing a lot of heavy shit. Want to join me for a shake? It’s helped me out a lot and doesn’t even do damage to my day.” If he says no, just shrug it off like: “alright. Can I leave it with you, anyway?” Like don’t be pushy. But give him access to it if he does decide he wants it later on. Or he’ll toss it out. Whichever.   🤷🏻‍♀️ I dunno how your friend is, so I dunno if this really is the best way to go about it. It’s just the way I’ve handled it best when in his position.",False,False

That way if he turns it down, he doesn’t feel like he’s disappointing you which might lead to even more guilt. That’s how I’d like it to be approached if I was in the same position. Keep conversation light and don’t put pressure on him so his mind can’t use it as ammunition against himself (about 1000 times easier to do than you think). Also, do it when you two are by yourselves because he might be embarrassed or feel pressure which, again, can lead to guilt.",False,False
