She wanted to be healthy but I think that will lead her to the opposite spectrum. I knoe that she aims to achieve her metabolims to be repair in some way but I think that she are actually damaging her body with that crazy amount of calories.,False,False

She does eat a lot of food that isn't ""real"". Processed Snacks, processed bread and cereal, way too hard on sugar and carbs, mixing that with fat. It's very dangerous. It's fine to do that binge for a short period of time to get some weight back. But now she's sticking to a very unhealthy diet even at a pretty heavy weight for her height and does not seem to be moderating the quality of food and the amounts of carbs and sugar.      That being said, this is an entertainment channel she created. It could be exaggerated, and she is probably more knowledgeable then most of us about diet. She's the last person that needs an education on what's healthy eating. I don't understand her angle, I hope people are not taking her message wrongly and just going ham on junk food forever. She's either doing this thing emotionally and might be in trouble, or putting on an interesting show and she is calculating carefully how long she can do this without damaging her body long term and will get back to healthy baseline soon.",False,False

I've been dieting for almost as long as I can remember and I've dreamed of just eating and being full like a ""normal"" person for so long.   My identity has been wrapped up in how I look for so long, I'm honestly scared to go ""all in"".   I really respect Stephanie for doing what she's doing, and the fact that she's doing it so publicly.",False,False

Before she started this she was mostly muscle weight, so TDEE goes up. Idk, maybe hers is closer to 2800 or 3000, but mine is like 3100 on an average day, I am les muscular than her, and work out probably less per week, and dont always get 10000 steps like she said she does",False,False

Every time she did cheat videos, she would claim she doesn't restrict before or after, and also implies that she actually takes up all the calories from everything she eats (i.e. doesn't purge). But that's just not mathematically possible. She always ends up back to her baseline weight in like two days without extra bloat from water or glycogen, and it's so dishonest to people who follow her, especially women in the fitness industry that are disproportionately likely to have eating disorders.",False,False

I love Stephanie and really empathize with her when it comes to extreme hunger (as most of us on this sub probably can too due to restriction or underfeeding). I was amazed to see her do this because as you’ve said - it’s not like everyone else’s ED recovery that’s salads and açaí bowls and boot camp for 3 hours. It’s real and raw and just completely honest.  With that being said - I don’t see it as discouraging. I see a woman who has been absolutely shredded, is strong, is conscious of herself and her needs and is resisting what society is telling her to do (which is either stay underfeeding to keep her physique or fake a recovery).   I see her as so strong. And for her to be honest about how the weight has impacted her emotional state is great, too. I think of her when I fight my ED thoughts and I’m like “I’m being such a baby. It’s weight gain. What’s more important is resetting my body to function normally and listening to it.” Or else I’ll be miserable forever.   She’s also eating a ton, for a long time. Even for me my refeeding / baby version of All In has really really really really fixed my extreme hunger. I used to be able to eat TONS without any feeling of fullness because I would restrict so heavy. Now it’s like, a little better. I can feel full. I can stop and say no more without it being Ana or Mia talking and more just like, my fucking body talking.",False,False

Tbh she probably burns like 3500 a day with the amount of muscle she has. I dont think the math adds up that she gained almost 20 pounds at a 500 to 1000 calorie surplus. That's 4-8 real pounds a month. She's basically having cheat day calories every day, and we've seen from her previous videos that she usually gains like 10 pounds from a cheat day. So it makes sense she'd be up ""18"" pounds but is actually up like... 4 to 8",False,False

Most people say that in recovery you first have a big appetite and you eat a lot but then it slowly goes to a normal level again because your body isn‘t craving that much food anymore (like a healthy-normal amount). And Stephanie deprived her body from food for a long time so it’s also a kind of restriction like most of us with a ed do probably. Also I don‘t think that Stephanie gained 18lbs of fat. She says on Instagram that she is bloated a lot and I think eating so much food has to result in also a lot of water and of course food weight! I don‘t think everyone would go that extreme. You could watch Jen Brett also!,False,False
