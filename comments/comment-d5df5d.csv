Don't think too far ahead as you will get overwhelmed. Anytime that happens stop and focus on the moment. There's times I have been unable to think of making it through the day...so I simply think of the moment instead. Which quickly becomes the next moment and the next. The day passes, another starts...and eventually, I can start to think ahead again. Sometimes that happens quickly after just a few days, other times it has taken me several months. And that's okay.   So, anytime life makes things so very difficult for you, go to taking it moment by moment. And as you make it through this remember to tell yourself how proud you are because you are making it. When life is tough, every moment you get through is an accomplishment.",False,False

I make that my focus during meals. If I'm beyond meals, I focus on any calories I can manage. And when needed, I set timers to remind myself to stay hydrated. In between that, I try to focus on other things. When my brain goes to those thoughts I make myself stop and think of something else. It's not simple or easy, none of this is. But you can make it through this. Remember that.",False,False
