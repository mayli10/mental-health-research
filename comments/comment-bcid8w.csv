I got it with a free coupon too which was good but it tasted like sweet cardboard. I'm sick of breaking fasts with shitty food,False,False

Everything you’re feeling is completely valid, and I’m so sorry if my previous response felt that I was invalidating your experience. I’m at a similar BMI and miserable. I don’t deserve food much less anyone to waste time on me. But just know that a stranger in Chicago is worried about you, thinks you’re valid, and seriously is wishing you the very best. At the very least, stay hydrated and in touch with even one person close who can help you feel a little calmer or a little safer.",False,False

You mentioned you do daily intensive sports- when you’re exercising your body you need to refuel. Instead of failing at your fast, maybe you chose to break it to nourish your body and instead of gaining fat you’re just replenishing what’s there to give you fuel to continue on your journey. A little fucked up maybe but you’re a good person, you don’t deserve the guilt trip your mean ED brain is laying on you RN.",False,False
