I have been on and off from college due to depression, life, anxiety,  etc. Sometimes taking things slow is what is best for us. I am sure your parents will understand, you are not a failure!",False,False

One semester I cancelled college and stayed at home doing nothing and that made things worse for me, and then another semester I only took 3 classes which gave me lots of free time to work on my mental and physical health but also kept me busy enough without causing me stress. Best decision I ever made.  So I suggest taking only one or two classes so you have something to do and that way you'll release responsibilities from your future self while working on your present self. Don't waste the time, work out and try to eat as balanced as possible. Look for help if you need it (dietitian, psychologist, doctors, etc) during that time.  When I told my parents I had to explain to them that I couldn't go on without damaging myself, I was OW and was scared for my health, and if I continued I would gain even more and I also told them I wanted to enjoy my career and not suffer through it because of my depression, so I wanted to take the time to myself. I told them I didn't intend to lose my time because I would be working on myself   It's okay to stay behind for a year or two, it's not a race. Do whatever it takes for your mental well-being.",False,False
