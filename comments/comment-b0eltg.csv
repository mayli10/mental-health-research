It's your job to be a doctor. It's your job to give that advice - it is NOT your job to take it!   Idk I grew up in a family of health professionals. Nurses who live corned beef and hate exercise, drs bringing cinnamon buns to the staff so they feel less guilty indulging even though they have diabetes. Don't think you're the only doctor who has health issues. It doesn't make you a hypocrite. I don't really get that argument. They're people, not to be put on a pedestal.   And... you're a doctor so you're not allowed to have your own struggles? You're still human! Of course you're going to have your own issues. There's way worse shit you could be doing than having an ED. Cut yourself some slack. ",False,False

A steady effort goes a very long way. The most successful is often the most tenacious, rather than the brightest and most expected to be successful when younger. You will see this in 20 years.

It goes to show how much stigma is involved, especially in healthcare. We’ve come pretty far with accepting depression and anxiety (especially with high stress careers) but if your ED is exposed it can even be detrimental to your early career if the program directors find out- they may question your ability to function on the team.",False,True
