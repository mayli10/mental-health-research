I was just like, ok cool, but then they made they made this big point about how it's only because they have braces now and didn't want to brush their teeth after eating at work or something, and not because they have an eating disorder, because they're not *vain* like that. All I said was I have an eating disorder and I'm not particularly vain and they went 'umm whatever' and left LOL. It was actually nice them leaving me alone for a few weeks after.  They got their braces off and now they just eat like packet foods and candy at work and refuse to exercise, even though I said exercising might make them feel good (cause they always blame never doing any work on being too depressed, but won't take meds or go to therapy), so good luck with that I guess.",False,False
