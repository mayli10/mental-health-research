Maybe he is afraid of making the wrong move on this guy who he isn’t as comfortable with. Either way though he is still an ass for leading you on and making you feel so down.   Sometimes ppl are shitty, you can’t give them the power of letting their actions emotionally affect your life. Your self worth is worth more than 1 attractive guy.",False,False
