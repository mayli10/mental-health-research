I think the idea is that if someone seems likely to relapse into restrictive or disordered behaviors that lead to weight loss, making their target weight higher is meant to discharge them with a ""buffer"" so immediate relapse wouldn't cause enough weight loss to make them dangerously underweight or in need of hospitalization again. For obvious reasons I don't think that is a particularly helpful move and I think strongly encourages relapse into restriction and/or development of a binge-centric disorder, and I believe this practice has fallen out of favor in most treatments, for good reason. But I have heard of it (in addition to the semi misguided belief from some providers that all recovery from any ED must involve some degree of calorie surplus and weight gain) and OP makes it sound like this is a very experimental doctor/program, which makes me kinda wary but up to them if they need the help that bad and think it's worth it. But only because a doctor requests something does not make it ""right"" or even helpful for all patients, so take it with a grain of salt esp in a treatment that says from the get go they're experimental and probably using unconventional methods on patients.",False,False

Would your family or friends love you any less? Would it affect your grades in any way? What I'm trying to say here is that a normal person would be at least semi ok with gaining weight for a chance at free treatment which is an extremely rare opportunity.  And who says you have to gain 14lbs of fat? Maybe get into yoga if they offer it and put on some muscle and become stronger. You may even be the same size if you put in on in mostly muscle mass.,False,False
