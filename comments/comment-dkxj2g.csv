Some things that can make you more prone to it are being female, lifting weights, having digestive issues, and being prone to dehydration.    5 lbs difference is pretty normal for me when maintaining- and that's only weighing in when I've had a good dump! Up to 8 lbs can happen if I eat something I'm sensitive to, I'm on the rag, my TDEE was considerably bigger than normal, etc.",False,False

Realistically I know I can’t have gained 4lbs in one day from that, but my brain is screaming at me that I’m a gross slob and can’t eat ever again now.",False,False

Like one time I was just drinking knorr stock cubes in hot water (because they're low calorie and very filling) and my weight went up 10lbs that day. Another time before my period and sometimes half way through the month I'll just go up a random 3lbs, ,have a hot bath and drink water and pee and the weight will have dropped the next day.   Water weight is crazy",False,False
