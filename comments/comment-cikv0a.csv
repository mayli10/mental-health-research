It does take a long time of trying to get better. For me the most frustrating thing is, you cant see yourself getting better until you look back at where you were. Like see a painting from 3 years ago that you couldnt see flaws in, and now all you can see is all the things you want to fix in it. I have always had ""natural talent"" for drawing, painting, etc., but even I started out as shit- just a lil better than average for whatever age I was at the time. All you can do is start. It is slow going so I know how frustrating it feels for a perfectionist. BUT the best way to put that to use- find something you want to paint. Maybe get one of those canvas books where it's a thin piece of canvas that can be ripped out- it's like a sketch pad but canvas. And just paint the same thing over and over until it's as good as you want it to be. It's time consuming finicky work, a pain in the ass, but it's what a lot of painters do- usually they dont sit down and paint it in one go, they have multiple renditions and you can see how a painting evolves over time.  Anyways, I hope you can pursue painting and piano and learn how to be okay with starting out ""bad""",False,True

I've been trying to start painting or learning to play the piano, but I have so much trouble tolerating my lack of natural talent. I want to skip ahead to being the absolute best so I avoid practicing at all and that shoves my goal completely out of my reach. Self-sabotage is a common symptom of perfectionism and fasting definitely functions as self-sabotage. It's something we can overcome with effort and help, though.",False,False

Like if I dont do something new perfectly, or each hobby perfectly, I have a breakdown. Like, weightlifting is something I've been enjoying lately. But then I discovered a website that rates you vs pro deadlifters or something and I'm at the ""adequete"" category. And another website has me as like slightly above people at my age/height/weight/gender who lift. But I dont want to stop until I am at the ""pro"" category and at the top 99% of lifters my a/h/w/g. But I also dont want to stop restricting. So on bad days where I'm fasting and heavy lifting I'll literally be getting black vision and nearly passing out at the top of every lift. But I just wont stop :'-) my brain just beats me up if I dont give ""my best"" each time, but it also doesnt accept anything equal to or better than how it happened last time. I guess it's something to talk about with my therapist. If you actually read all of that, thanks ðŸ’•",False,True

But... if you could have any special talent or trait, what would it be? Make a list of the things you really value and want for yourself... you can work hard toward anything in your life that you want! All the time and energy an ED takes up could be filled with... painting or memorizing poetry or learning botany or literally anything you want to do. Seeing a therapist can really help if you have trouble thinking of things or thinking about these other aspirations makes you really sad (it does for me, but I'm working on it!)",False,False
