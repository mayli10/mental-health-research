I recently bought a sandwich and it was suppose to have 3 slices of cheese in it. I spent $11 on it and it turns out they forgot all the cheese.

First tried them in New England clam chowder in a sour dough bread bowl on a childhood stay in San Francisco. Tbh the crackers were better than everything else except maaaybe good fresh sourdough bread.   I used to eat them plain but would also eat them with chopped tomatoes and Worcestershire sauce. Weird but good. Like savory cereal (but not much liquid),False,False

If I binge on actually good food at least there feels like there was some reason for it. When the food sucks my guilt is doubled.
