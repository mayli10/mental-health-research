You’re mad that you can’t purge whenever you want because they love you and don’t want you to. To that I say, I understand completely, but you did the adult thing by telling them. That is really kind to yourself.",False,False

I moved back home with them and when I did I basically stopped purging, but occasionally something random would make them question me if I was purging and I legit wasn’t so it was always very infuriating. On my 21st bday, I got home and ended up throwing up bc I had drank too much that night, and the next day, my dad asked me why I threw up. Like fuck them they made me like this in the first place. I don’t think they have any right to ask me about it, but the best part is that now I actually have relapsed and they don’t know shit about it bc I’m not actually as careless as they seem to think.",False,False

What takes you so long in the bathroom? Why do you look pale and have red eyes when you come back? Those are the questions my mom never bothers to ask. It's good, i mean the freedom.
