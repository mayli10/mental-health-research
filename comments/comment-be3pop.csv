Mention that you’ve noticed that shes been behaving in a similar way to how you have, and that you’re a little worried. Let her know that she doesn’t have to talk to you, but if she did, all you would do is listen and support her, you would never try and force her to do anything she wasn’t comfortable with.  Depending on her personality, it might be best to send this as a text, I know I personally wouldn’t let you get past the first sentence IRL, but I would hear you out if I had time to read and gather my thoughts.  You’re a really good friend for doing this, I hope everything goes well for both of you ♡",False,False
