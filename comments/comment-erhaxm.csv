I worked fast food and was so scared I would be tempted by the food, but I sorta got sickened by it bc I was always around it. When lunch came around it was pretty easy to say no to the food and stick with a diet drink ngl.",False,False

Even if they make you buy food you don’t have to eat it, or can take it home to give to someone else. The staff probably won’t care if you don’t want to eat anything at work",False,False

Obviously things might be different where we work but for me we have a 30 minute break if we work 5+ hours. I don’t really think you would be forced to eat because some people might be vegetarian/vegan or have allergies that prevent them from eating. I’m sure if you tell them you don’t want to eat that they’ll understand. Where I work people ask “you’re not eating anything?” and that’s it. I just say I don’t have money (since we have to pay) which is actually the truth then I  grab some diet soda and spend 30 minutes drinking it. Might be different for you though. I don’t think they will force you to eat if you really don’t want to though so I wouldn’t worry about it too much.,False,False

That’s the main reason I am freaking out",False,True

I can’t imagine a place forcing you to eat but rather have breaks in case you get hungry,False,False
