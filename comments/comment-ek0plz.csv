Sometimes they have no idea what to say, but say anything to show that they listen and care. Of course some of the comments can come off as rude and abrasive. It's hard for people to connect and understand with someone if they themselves haven't gone through a similar expierence.   I would take anything commented lightly and know that you've worked up the courage to tell your story and that's the most important part of all of this. You are strong. You are wanting to change your relationship with food. And for that I applaud you. Sounds like you're ready for the next step in your journey. Thank you for sharing!",False,False

It strikes me as this weird cocktail of shouting to the void, snap judgments, and echo chambers. But while I’m not shocked it didn’t yield healthy/helpful interactions, I am still saddened you had that experience. It’s a courageous and powerful thing to tell our stories, it just can be a challenge to find the right place and people to do it with.",False,False
