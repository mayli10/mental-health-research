People respond with hate because they don't wanna be called out for it.   Perhaps fighting it could start with ""low-key"" removal; instead of   &gt;""delete this it's triggering"" or similar,   it could be (if on reddit for example)   &gt;""Hey, would you mind flairing this NSFW or spoiler? I have an eating disorder and it's triggering/this could be triggering to people with eating disorders"".  Perhaps along with a short explanation as to why - ""whilst this is joking, many people with EDs feel compelled to live off coffee/nicotine in order to suppress their appetites and lose weight.""  So like if someone is making jokes about not eating, say sth like ""please be careful joking about starving yourself; if someone with an eating disorder sees it then it can trigger them or cause them harm"".   In my opinion stuff is always worth challenging regardless of the hate, because whilst it's unlikely to change their minds, what it WILL do is sow the seeds of doubt that what they're doing is alright, and/or make them think a little more before doing it next time (even if it's just because they don't want to deal with someone challenging them). And it also makes it clear to anyone who comes across it that it shouldn't go unchallenged.    I'm trans and this is why I almost always challenge transphobia when I see it, even though I KNOW it'll just lead to hate etc. It sows the seeds of doubt and it means that any trans people coming across it see that it won't go unchallenged.",False,False

It's not healthy to be looking at that kind of stuff for hours a day. The entire thing gives such a skewed perception. Back in the day it used to be magazines and TV/movies. Those were *much* easier to avoid or scoff at.  Internet/social media is in this bizarre middle category of not quite real life, but not quite fantasy.
