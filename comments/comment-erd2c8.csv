Like if I eat one scone for lunch (~400 cals) thats a concerningly small amount but if I eat a bowl of brocolli soup (~100 cals) that's totally fine, it's so baffling",False,False

On the flip side my “fear foods” (if you could even call them that) are mostly calorie-dense foods that are easy to eat more of an therefore usually lead to me eating more calories :/,False,False

The other day I felt so invalidated (and also conflicted) because I was eating a spinach salad and my boyfriend said ""I'm so glad you're eating more, that's good!""... Like bruh, this whole salad is less than 100 calories. Part of me wanted to tell him that, and of course the other part screams no let him think this is good so you can get away with restricting more easily.",False,False

They reintroduced me to all that stuff and way more so now I still eat them even though I've relapsed because I can't imagine wasting the few cals I eat on shit I think tastes awful. But it does feel uncomfortable and fake restricting while still putting almond milk in my coffee, butter on my toast, etc. even if I'm still actually restricting because my brain is so wired to think restricting means cutting out food groups entirely.",False,False

There are foods that ""aren't worth"" the calories to me and there are foods I eat more of cause they're low cal but so long as I stay under my calorie goal for the day I'm not that bothered what I eat. If I'm at a family members house or something I can mostly eat what they give me if it's unavoidable, I just go overboard restricting after it.   Very much makes you feel like you can't tell people you're struggling in case they're like ""but I saw you eat pizza last week"" (yes, but it was 500 calories, that's all I ate that day).",False,False
