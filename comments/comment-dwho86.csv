For me one of the perks of staying how I am is the lack of hunger and not having to deal with all the mess around food. However I'm also writing this in a moment that I feel good. Yesterday I was ready to break and say fuck it to all of this but I waited and now I'm fine again.  I guess it would be nice not to have to weather those moments of me suffering more then normal.   this is kind of what I'm talking about there's just so much indecision so I do nothing.,False,True
