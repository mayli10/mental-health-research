But honestly if there’s any truth to it, I think it’s way “higher up” or like much before actual doctors.  There are so many things wrong with what people going into the medical field are *taught*. And there is so much old and rooted stigma in the field about many different things that are annoyingly impossible to change, especially since it feels like there aren’t many people who GAF. At least not enough to put up a big enough stink to get something done.  I’m not saying there’s an Illuminati deciding everything lol. But like... reality is money controls this world. It drives fucking everything and the people who have it want to keep it. Decisions made are just one after the other in their favor and then we end up with fucky twisted rules. So while there’s not one person or a group of people literally saying “people being sick makes up money so let’s make more people sick and make getting treatment complicated and difficult”. But there *are* a ton of rich selfish asshats making their own decisions to in the end serve themselves. And all those decisions fall into each other like dominoes and we end up here.   I don’t know if I really worded that well, but that’s kind of how I look at things.",False,False

I had lots of frustrating interactions with doctors, that's why I said that they can be total assholes. But sometimes patients are mad and say it's the doctors fault even though it's not, but the patient just doesn't know enough about the background.   I should let YOU be frustrated and strive to do better myself?... What do you think I do? That I want to become an asshole doctor? I am frustrated as well, not only for me but also for others. I just wanted to give some insight on what could be the reason for a case like this. I even asked about what happened to OP,...  It's not like I just wanted to defend asshole doctors and that I am not one of y'all... because I am. And yeah, venting is important and everyone has the right to be frustrated in those situations but it's not a solution when someone thinks that doctor's are all bad and won't seek help because of some negative experiences with stupid assholes doctors because they're not all the same.",False,False

And OP literally said this was a conspiracy theory, ie, an exaggeration of reality. Instead of getting defensive you should just let us be frustrated about our experiences with other doctors and strive to do better than them in your own professional practice.",False,False

I really am.  It's just that I hate the constant doctor/medical field bashing... I get that all day long and it's annoying for me since I'm working my ass off for my state exam.     What made you post this? Did you try to seek help but the doctors didn't do anything? Because doctors really can be freaking assholes.,False,False

A lot of doctor's are just ignorant assholes OR don't know better because during university you don't learn much about the variety of eating disorders. The main topic is anorexia nervosa, and just a few sentences about bulimia or binge eating disorder. So people have no clue that there are way more eating disorders and that you don't necessarily have to be underweight.   On the other hand... The doctor itself can't do much about an eating disorder until people are severely underweight, because (s)he is the one to treat the physical part of it. For the disorder you need a therapist, who isn't necessarily a doctor, because (s)he's the one for the mental part of it.     The problem is that the doctor sees you and has to evaluate/rate the severity of your illness and decide if you need therapist or not. But normal doctors don't know enough to do this properly.      And when a psychiatrist says you don't need a therapist/help with your eating disorder just because you're not underweight... then (s)he's just a plain asshole.",False,False
