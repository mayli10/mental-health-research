Just wanted to pop my head in to sympathise.   I'm not sure how in line with healthy recovery it is (I'm sure they'd be telling us to just eat what our bodies are asking for, like that'll happen lol), but I tend to at least feel a little bit more full if I drink a LOT during the meal. Usually I drink at least a pint while making it (I also choose foods that take a while to cook), two at least while eating it and then I'll either drink another pint or have a can of diet coke (late to the party but I just tried cherry coke and ðŸ‘Œ) after.  It makes me feel pretty sick sometimes but I'd rather feel sick than I-want-to-rip-my-skin-off hunger.  Good luck! I hope quasi recovery becomes full on.",False,False
