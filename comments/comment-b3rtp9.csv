I literally was consumed by the thought of food all day to the point I couldnâ€™t study for my law school entrance exam, brain fog, felt shitty, worried about food or thinking about it. All this obsession with food would lead to binges. And when I binged.... man I canâ€™t study after that. Day wasted. Would lay in bed hating myself instead of studying. Iâ€™m sure you all can relate. I was honestly scared for my future because I knew that this prioritization of food over school and studying was gonna catch up with me.   I realized I was terrified of ruining my future over what? Fucking counting calories? I decided that my future was more important than losing weight (at the moment). I decided that I have the rest of my life to lose weight, but right now I have another priority.   After 5 years of tracking, I deleted MFP and decide I would listen to my body. I already had the knowledge of calories and macros to guide me as to what I needed to eat. Watched a lot of videos on intuitive eating and fueling your body. While I still find it hard to listen to my hunger and fullness cues, I find that I am no longer obsessed with food and can actually focus on something other than calories.   This is my story. I still had ED thoughts and behaviors sometimes, but nothing near how bad it was before.   You need to have a talk with yourself and decide what is more important, and change your behaviors and actions to follow that.
