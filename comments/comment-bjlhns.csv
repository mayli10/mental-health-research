On one hand, I want to pass out so I'll finally be, ""sick enough"" to have a real ed. But on the other hand, I don't want people to worry, and I dont want to hurt myself while falling, (also I'm insecure about looking fat when I pass out and im afraid I'll look so stupid ppl will laugh at me) another fear is that I'll pass out while I'm holding my violin and I'll break my violin, (is a handmade stradivarius copy so I really dont want anything bad to happen to it)",False,False

My scale broke lol. I felt so weird about it, scared but so proud.  You can get electrolyte powder on amazon that you can put in water and drink to help balance your electrolytes out, zero calorie stuff- I recommend it for damage control .. look after yourself please ♥️",False,False
