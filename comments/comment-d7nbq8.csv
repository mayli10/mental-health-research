I think that's one of the weirdest advantages of having any type of mental health issues. You know all the signs, and regardless if your parents were helpful or not, you know how to handle it and react better than people that haven't dealt with it.",False,False

And the best motivation to get my Shit Together even when I'm disinterested for my own sake.",False,False
