Weekends are so much harder bc I spend all my time alone in my room so I tend to fill the time with food. l kinda have no people to hang out with rn which is probably why I have been binging so much this school year.,False,False

If I stay busy I can forget. Video games are a great distraction for me as well. My hands are busy so I can't stuff my face.,False,False
