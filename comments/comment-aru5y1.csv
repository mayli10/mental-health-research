I'm only 5'7, but compared to everyone on my mother's side I'm a damn giant. And everyone just leaned into it!  I was sent away from the kids my age as a toddler because I was so much taller at the age of three the babysitter was afraid I'd hurt them. Class pictures?  Shove Lark to the back so she isn't in the way of all the tiny cute kids.  Sports?  She's tall enough at age 7 to play JV basketball.  Best send her to her godfather for the summers so she gets a sports scholarship to college just like him!   High school graduation?  Fuck me for wearing heels, it's my big moon face floating over the dean, forever immortalizing the girl whose feet were so huge her grandmother cackled that they were big enough to need their own kidneys.  Engagement photos?  The damn photographer shoved me down on my knees so he could get the angles right because the wasband and I are so close in height.   I'm not even properly proportioned!  Oh no, no long eventually graceful limbs here-  I'm  all damn thick torso with stubby fingers and hammer toes because we couldn't afford shoes that fit. I was in hand me downs from my mother and aunts from 7 to 12 until I finally outgrew them all.  Just last month my mother's siblings wanted a photo of all of us together for my grandmother's birthday- and there's my gargantuan ass in the very back as always, towering over all my aunts and uncles and grandparents.   I'm never going to look delicate. No one will ever think I'm fragile.  Oh no, Lark is the sturdy one (seriously, fuck that word), the capable one, the one who never needs protection or comfort because she's fucking huge.  She can handle assholes who get aggressive, assholes who follow her down the street, no issue with Lark having to walk two miles back to her car alone at one in the morning.    I resent the fuck out of my height. And my bone structure. And everyone who decided I didn't need protection, safety, or comfort.  But no stress, it's fine- I'm sturdy! ",False,False
