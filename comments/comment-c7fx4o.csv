My bf loves to cuddle and I get a little self conscious sometimes if Iâ€™m bloated or have put on a bit of weight but he comments that he loves how soft I am. And when I am laying on him I usually ask to make sure Iâ€™m not too heavy/squishing him and he looks at me like Iâ€™m crazy and says of course not. I think for the most part, we are way more critical of our own bodies than whoever weâ€™re sharing a bed with.",False,False

As per sweating- I am sweaty af naturally. It may be icky but it's just a natural body function. Tbh you'll feel better if you just say, :""hey I'm on a med that gives me night sweats. I cant guarentee your sheets will be dry when you wake up- kinda awkward, lol. We should probably plan on washing your sheets in the morning! Just wanna give you a heads up"" if he's a regular, okay guy, he wont mind, and if you play it off nonchalantly he'll probably go along with it! Good luck!",False,False

Well ok about the sleeping with a guy who you feel is way hotter than you part.  My strategy was to  - wear clothes I look least bad in, so for me sleeping in long black leggings (he doesn't have to know I usually wear baggier pants) and a loose top. If clothes were removed, for whatever reason, I'd just put them back on before bed and say I'd be cold otherwise ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚  - always be under covers -- this makes me less visible, and the excuse of being cold is convincing, not suspicious, and often true    - SNUGGLE if you're snuggled up against him he can't see you that well, and fat actually works in your favor (unbelievable!!!!!) because it makes you soft and comfy. Only if he likes snuggling obviously. If he lies on his back, you can kind of lie half on him half off him and use his chest as a pillow, so even though your stomach is protruding a lot from lying on your side he's ""trapped"" so can't actually see more than your face. This still always made me anxious since I was worried I was too heavy for that, lol, but he liked it. If he lies on his side, spooning is great, and if you want to be maximally invisible I always liked being big spoon for a guy (and they usually welcome the change!)   not sure what your situation is though so ymmv",False,False

Not sure what to do about the sweating except maybe wear clothes so you donâ€™t get sticky.,False,False
