It still hurts though and I understand how you feel. My ex likes bigger girls and there were a few times where he just straight up called me fat. He meant it in a positive way but like dude.

Solid, fucking *oof.* What a backhanded compliment...minus the compliment part.  I don't even want to go into detail about the ways that would screw with me. Maybe y'all need to ban weight as a topic - she's gonna gain if she keeps putting her feet in her mouth.  Just remember that weight is fluid, and in a serious long-term relationship, even Ms. SizeStandards is probably going to fluctuate. She's in for a bad time if she wants a serious years-long relationship.  Hope it was just a shitty, meaningless offhand correlation that came out real bad.",False,False
