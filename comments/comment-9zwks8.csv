You aren't condescending at all, I'm actually 30!  Thank you I will post here, I don't post there any more and haven't been on for awhile, just remembered it.  Hope a good day for you",False,True

You sound quite young. How old are you? (I don’t mean this in a condescending way but I find that most people on here are age 19 and up)  My advice is don’t post on those sites. From what I’ve heard they are toxic. Post on here. This environment is monitored. It’s more mature. It’s supportive. Fuck those bitches.   ,False,False

I get it- it's addictive, but the less you weigh yourself the more you can focus on how you feel physically. Remind yourself that those people are haters and don't deserve your attention. It's not about anyone else but you. ",False,False
