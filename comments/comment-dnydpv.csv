Basically, I tracked my diet and she made suggestions for me to improve it. Unfortunately, part of the changes we have to make will for sure have to address some fears from our ED.   I'm a runner and I avoid carbs (mainly grains) a lot and restrict my intake. She said I definitely need more carbs and that I should try integrating more into my diet. She's not policing my intake, but there's no point in going to see her (and waste my time and money) if I don't try to make these changes. She's actually a nutritionist for some professional athletes, so I trust her evaluation and really hope it improves my athletic performance.   The changes you'll make to your diet will be more individualized. Idk what you're eating or your activity level is so it's hard to predict what a nutritionist would say. If you're not ready to make changes to your diet, then it's not worth going. I mean no judgement in that statement- It's a step towards recovery, and recovery really only works if you're ready or at least curious. I'm still not sure what I want, but I'm trying to be open to something different if it will help me feel better.",False,True
