At the time, I‚Äôd just been through a traumatic experience, so to cheer myself up, I bought a Groupon deal for lipo. Unfortunately, the oral anesthesia failed (opiates make me hyperactive rather than sedated, yikes) so I was fully awake having the procedure. It was so painful until the local anesthetic started to work, which felt like fire being injected into my veins. I was screaming expletives and the doctor told me that he couldn‚Äôt do the procedure if I was going to yell, and asked me if I wanted to continue, which I did. When it was over, I got to see my arm fat in a big container with my name on it, lol. My BMI was around 19 at the time, but surgeon told me that he removed almost a POUND of fat from each arm. üò¨",False,False
