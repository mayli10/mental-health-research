So, the fact you made it 10 days is awesome!!! Donâ€™t sell yourself short. Echoing what others said, one slip up doesnâ€™t mean youâ€™ve ruined your chances at recovery. Tomorrow is a new day! You got this. ðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œ   ",False,False

I feel like because I gave in to the binge, the cravings and urges will get stronger. And if I couldn't resist today, how can I resist its stronger version tomorrow :(",False,True

I hope you donâ€™t b/p because thatâ€™s painful to go through, but if you do, itâ€™s okay. You can do this, you can recover. ",False,False

I know itâ€™s scary to think about getting back into and itâ€™s tempting, but you made it 10 days and thatâ€™s awesome! Recovery isnâ€™t linear and thereâ€™s gonna be setbacks. A setback doesnâ€™t mean youâ€™re a failure. Choosing recovery means choosing to fight those thoughts all the time every day and thatâ€™s exhausting. I havenâ€™t quite mastered that myself so I donâ€™t have a ton of advice, but I believed in you!",False,False
