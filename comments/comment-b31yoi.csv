I have severe IBS with every symptom on the list. There are some things I can't eat simply because I can't digest them like red meat, fried stuff or raw veggies like carrots. I don't know which type you are but maybe it's just the choice of foods thst causes the distress in your guts?  IBS is a bitch, ED or not. If you wanna talk about it feel free to dm me.",False,False

Because I can relate but I’m not sure if we can relate on the same level because you explained kinda vaguely on how it makes you feel. ,False,False
