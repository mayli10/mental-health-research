I usually live with my mom (and I'm alone at home most of the time) but once in a while my dad invites me to a restaurant, or to eat something at his home and I get to enjoy food I wouldn't normally allow myself. I acutally look forward eating with him.  I'm glad I'm not alone with that feeling !",False,False

My boyfriend is starting to pick up on my eating habits though. He caught me reading the label of something and just looked at me and gave me a hug. I almost cried and he told me ""If you think it's a problem, I can assure you it isn't. I know it's gonna take a lot more than me saying it, but I promise you don't need to restrict at this age"". It broke my heart but also made me so happy",False,False
