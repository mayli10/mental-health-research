She said I would permanently damage my body, but at this point in my life I honestly didn't even care. Being skinny was much more important to me than being healthy and unharmed.    I had already accepted that the marbling would be permanent, however, it completely disappeared very quickly when I stopped using the hot water bottle as it got warmer outside.      ",False,False

However, my mom has chronic pain issues and has permanent marbling on her back from using heating pads to deal with the pain, and it's never going to go away. It leaves her pretty self-concious. While the age range in this sub tends to skew pretty young, be careful if you find yourself using the max heat setting every day! Damage over time builds up.",False,False
