As the other commenter mentioned, most Americans are somewhat deficient in b12, and you DO survive off of b12 “reserves” for a time period after ditching animal products. However, if you already had a mild deficiency before going vegan, this can accelerate the process of becoming more severely deficient and this can be dangerous both physically and mentally for your health. While I can’t help with your other symptoms (although they do sound like depression, a comorbidity with EDs), I would definitely highly encourage a b12 supplement and tbh probably a D2 (plant based) D3 supplement, as a vitamin D deficiency (super common, especially in the colder months) can contribute to depressive episodes and interims of apathy.

You should definitely take a b12 supplement as well as algal oil. Your exhaustion likely stems from a deficiency from having an ED and lack of calories overall.   I’m sorry you’re going through this.
