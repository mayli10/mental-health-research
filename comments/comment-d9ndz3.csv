Plenty of non-disordered people feel better counting calories. I get that it's a trigger but if it's causing you to restrict more there might need to be some intermediate step between counting everything and going full intuitive eating.  It'd be something to talk to your therapist about if you see one.  Edit: not saying you should count cals forever, I just mean to actually improve you need to also be comfortable (to a degree) with the changes.",False,False
