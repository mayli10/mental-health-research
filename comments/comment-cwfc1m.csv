I can't even handle the bloating I get when I'm PMSing, much less my bf's big headed child (I love the man but he's BIG. 6'5"" and 200+lbs. I'm 5'5.5"" and very tiny). I don't know what to do about the situation but what I do know is that while I am in control, like you said, I need my bf's input before anything is decided.   You're seriously such an incredible and beautiful person, thank you so much for everything♥️♥️ expect some updates soon when I finally figure out which road I take!",False,False

If not, it could be a tough road. I mean either way it is probably going to be really rough. But you (YOU) have control over this situation and I know you will make the right decision for you. This internet stranger loves you. I haven't had any children, but feel free to pm me if you ever just want to vent. I'm good for it.",False,False

Like not only is my anorexia the worst it's ever been but now I HAVE to recover for the sake of another life. And, on top of that, I'm about to graduate from college and only work as a substitute teacher when I have breaks in my schoolwork, my bf is about to lose his job due to downsizing, my parents were FINALLY starting to become less disappointed in me and then... This. Ugh.   I thought my hair was falling out bad before but I'm gonna be bald before I figure out what the hell I'm gonna do lol",False,False

I've only told strangers on the internet because I'm afraid to tell anyone else. I'm not sleeping because I keep thinking about how I need to tell my bf but I don't know how he's going to react.  BUT... I managed to eat two meals yesterday and I didn't purge which is HUGE. I may be scared and lost but that doesn't mean that this poor thing has to suffer all because it chose me as its mother lol",False,False
