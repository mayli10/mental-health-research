It made me feel worse when I started to consume it again.,False,False

That could be just me though.,False,False

Yes 100mg straight away - I'm on other meds too though, which my doc said might help with the negative side effects.   So far I've only had mild nausea and dizziness, and maybe a bit more tired. It might take another day to really kick in, so thanks for the migraine warning!",False,True

It's been a lifesaver. It hasn't had any effects on ED-thoughts, but it does reduce my desire to binge and purge very slightly. It's had no effect whatsoever on appetite, weight, or libido for me. I remember getting severe migraines for the first couple of weeks on the meds, but that gradually wore off.   I'm a little confused- so you're prescribed 100 mg- are you straight up taking that dosage, or are you starting with a low dose and gradually building up to it? My doc told me to take one half-tablet of 50 mg at first, then a half tablet twice daily (taking one whole tablet at once made the migraine side effect so much worse).",False,False

Be careful not to stop taking it suddenly if it increases your appetite or doesn’t work well for you bc you’re supposed to wean off SSRIs slowly. I just wanted to throw that out there that you’re not 100% guaranteed to have an appetite increase or suddenly gain weight because that’s what I was worried about before first taking sertraline too  On a more cautious note, please be careful!! Sertraline is rough when you first start taking it, especially a higher dose. Expect WILD mood swings for a few weeks before your body adjusts and be prepared for potentially worsening ED thoughts/behaviors. Things usually even out after a few weeks-months but keep your doctor updated and try to find what works for you. Good luck &lt;3",False,False

It did make my mind rest a little bit so I wasn’t as focused on food and every little thing I ate though. I started noticing it maybe 3-4 weeks in? But I started at 25 for a week 50 for a week then 75 up to 100. I stopped because I felt like my anxiety was under control so my eating habits also diminished.,False,False
