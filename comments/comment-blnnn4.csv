Like I recently went out to a fancy restaurant and absolutely stuffed myself, but I knew when our reservation was so I fasted for about a day and a half beforehand so that I would feel comfortable eating whatever I wanted at dinner (and I did). I mean my next planned binge is over a month away lmao and I know exactly what, when, and why I'm going to get it.  For me the instant mac and cheese for example (which is a dairy/gluten-free kinda gourmet brand I find much more edible than say Kraft, which I also would not consider worth any calories) is because packaged foods oftentimes induce less anxiety in me than having to measure ingredients myself, because I don't trust myself to portion certain ingredients properly. I love to cook, but pasta, for example, is a fear food because I binge on it so easily, so I'm scared to open up a packet of dry pasta and measure out a portion in case I can't stop myself from measuring out too much, or I go back and make more later because now the packet is Open and Unfinished. On the other hand, I can open and make an entire packet of this mac n cheese and know (or believe I know lol) how many calories are in the entire thing and, more importantly, not be able to over-serve myself. I also don't get the urge to eat more pasta afterwards. So a pre-mixed pack like that is the only way I trust myself to be able to eat what would otherwise be a fear food.   Also I was going to say that I'm okay with boxed/frozen foods but in reality I haven't eaten one in months because every time I contemplate it the calories don't seem worth it, outside of the mac n cheese or some brands of instant ramen, mostly bc the ramen is nostalgic. I like trying new convenience meals for the first time because I like trying and recommending new foods that fits my diet, but I rarely eat it a second time unless I'm binging.  I definitely get anxious if my ""can't say no"" foods are offered to me unexpectedly or I didn't actually ask for them or want them. LOL my partner ordered me a meal the other day and unbeknownst to me added a side of potato salad on my order to be ""nice"" and it made me so anxious OOPS. But I also struggle with BED and get even more anxious about the concept of wasting food, so in a scenario like that it's a battle between my anxiety over wasting food and my anxiety about eating unplanned calories. I would say the winner depends on what else I've eaten recently.  Thank you for talking with me about this stuff, it's really interesting hearing other people's experiences. I think it's really showing me that there is no one manifestation of disordered eating.",False,False

I will take almost any excuse to eat because if I don't have one then... I don't. So I'll fish for my partner to order fast food for example because I'd never order it on my own. I feel good about eating with other people because it's socially acceptable, in fact it's expected of me, so I'm not doing anything wrong, whereas I feel like it's not acceptable for me to eat the same food at other times.  It's a 50/50 on whether/how guilty I feel afterwards lol. Depends on what it was and whether it went over my calories/how much.",False,False

Sometimes one of my super low calorie OMADs might not turn out how I imagined, but it’s always made with ingredients I know I like. I don’t think I have any high calorie safe foods, except for like avocado or black beans or chickpeas or whatever, but I always include so little of those as ingredients in meals that it never adds up to very much. I would never eat something like instant mac and cheese, I never eat frozen or boxed meals. Those calories couldn’t possibly be worth it for me, if I’m gonna eat something like a cheesy pasta dish, it’s gonna be fresh pasta with a homemade sauce and definitely not an “if it fits your calories” situation, it would be part of a pre-planned binge.   My “can’t say no” foods are the ones I mentioned before, meals I love that I only eat on the weekends. They’re not necessary a “can’t resist” situation since I would never eat them unless I planned to, even if they were offered to me. To the point that my anxiety would flare up so much I’d probably destroy the meal, rather than just say no or just eat it lol. They don’t trigger binges for me but I would never eat them by themselves, they would be part of a “refeeding” schedule which would include other calorific meals and treats. I wouldn’t say any of those things make me feel the need to purge or restrict, but I do restrict heavily before and after, but in order to “earn” them rather than to punish myself for eating them.",False,False

I have ""low calorie safe foods"", which are foods that I may like or not like that much but are low enough calorie I can eat whenever. Then I have ""high calorie safe foods"", which are the things I mentioned before - 700kcal is a lot for one meal, but it's doable, and it's even more doable if it's my OMAD, so I'm okay eating 700kcal of instant macaroni and cheese if I know I will enjoy it. But if that same mac &amp; cheese were 2000 kcal then I would not eat it because I don't enjoy it THAT much. So in that sense I am limiting myself.     ... Aaaaand then I have the ""can't say no foods"", which I AM okay with eating at over 2000 cal a meal. They don't trigger a binge (usually), they're just so good I care more about eating them than I care about the calories. Sometimes I try and adjust for it by fasting afterwards and it's usually my OMAD but not always. Now that I think about it it's a very short, very specific list of food items and almost all of them are things I can't/don't make myself and don't have many opportunities to get. So I guess it is kind of like a safe food. That's the bit I was wondering if anyone else could relate to, I guess - having specific foods you KNOW are super calorific but they don't make you feel bad or feel the need to purge/restrict/generally panic like other calorific food would?",False,False

I barely eat during the week (typically &lt;200 kcal/day) so I can save up all my calories for something I’m going to really enjoy on the weekend. There are a small handful of meals from a couple of my favourite restaurants in town that I eat every weekend and they are more than worth the low restriction.   The only place where I differ is the small portions of good food. If I’m gonna eat something good, I’m not gonna limit myself. I’m very “all or nothing” when it comes to eating.",False,False

I feel like a big motivation behind not eating right now is because I don't want to waste calories on food that tastes bad. If I'm going to eat a significant amount of calories, I'd rather spend it on a (small) portion of good food that fills some craving. If I have to eat something disappointing, then it had better be super super low-calorie. So if I don't have anything on-hand that I'm really enthused about eating and know will taste great, and I don't have something &lt;150cal instead, then I just don't eat anything.  OTOH there are some foods I will over eat for no matter what. Certain restaurants or certain dishes etc. They taste so amazing I don't care if it's 2k calories. I mean, I do, but I care more about wanting to eat it. Can you relate?",False,False

We obsess about food so much that we learn all about it and how to differentiate really good food from the mediocre stuff and the trash. We become experts on nutrition, it would be difficult not to become food critics as well at the same time. It’s okay to let yourself enjoy the food you eat.

And when I do allow myself to indulge, I take a breath and also allow myself to enjoy it. There’s no point in wasting calories on a sad meal.",False,False

I always want to eat. If people give me an excuse to eat then I usually jump on it because I can pretend it was ""out of my hands"" (when it really really wasn't) while other people talk about being terrified of that exact same situation.  I don't think means you're faking, though. Because EDs and disordered eating are more than just simply being afraid of food. I realise that even though I enjoy the food I do eat it's because it's safe food, so I can't reasonably say whether I'm afraid of general eating or not.",False,False
