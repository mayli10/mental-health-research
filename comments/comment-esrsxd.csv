If possible, I would try speaking with your psychiatrist about it and she can help explain the competition that is common with EDs to your mom. Any reference to a body type/shape/condition can be triggering as well. Maybe come up with a list of “danger” topics, that she could avoid? I did that with my mom because she didn’t realize that “looking healthier” translates to weight gain/fat in my brain.",False,False

It's frustrating when people don't realize not only did I not ask but your also giving me more things to obsess over/feel bad about,False,True

I hope not. But I’ve gone through the same thing with a roommate/Friend before. She kept mentioning restrictive diets or how “oh no I only ate 800 calories today but I’m just full!!!” and things like that. It drove me absolutely mad because she would say it as if..like humble bragging, maybe? It made me feel really competitive and just annoyed.",False,False
