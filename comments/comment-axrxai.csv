Once, when I was trying keto and he was wondering why I wasn’t eating the same things he was, I explained that I was eating differently because sometimes grownups needed less food than growing boys or something like that.  A few months ago, he was saying that he didn’t like his belly because it was fat.  He’s, if anything, on the thin but strong side, with a perfectly normal, barely there, little boy tummy.  He told me that he doesn’t like how he looks in the mirror.    Turns out my ex was telling him he would get fat if he laid around too much, and ‘lovingly’ calling him a “little piggy” because of his (frankly enormous) appetite.  Kids *internalize* that shit.    I talked to my idiot ex and explained that that shit needed to stop, and he agreed.  I haven’t heard it from him since, but I hope that doesn’t come up again.  I try to stress that exercise is good for you to be big and strong, and the importance of good nutrition, because I DON’T WANT HIM TO BE FUCKING DISORDERED.  Ugh",False,False

All of my issues with food... Come from my mother. Copying her own habits, listening to her bullshit, having her out me down all the time...  I have a three year old daughter myself now and I'm trying so hard to create a healthy relationship with food for her and its so hard. Through doing that though I really feel like I've also been helping myself. ",False,False

Especially with a “diet-culture” so prevalent today, I can’t blame someone for making an offhand comment like that. I think it becomes more of a problem when those comments become discussions (like someone else said about how their parent/grandparent said it was so easy to starve themselves when they were young to lose weight).   We definitely overthink things like that as people with ED’s, but I do agree that those kinds of comments, over time, can be damaging to little ones. ",False,False

Luckily my mom is ultra sensitive with her word/topic choices and has never talked to me about dieting, but my aunts will talk about nothing else. I love going through old photos with them, because they have great stories to tell, but half of the conversation goes back to how skinny they used to be. ",False,False

I didn't know you can have a positive feeling about your body when you aren't thin.

I just wish parents would choose their words more carefully around their young children and teenagers. young people have very impressionable emotional relationships with food and their bodies, and my body image was negatively influenced by my mother’s dieting as a kid.

I wholeheartedly believe that parent’s words become a child’s inner voice and resonate throughout development- it is reckless to talk about bodies and diets and thinness in front of children (or anyone, really).
