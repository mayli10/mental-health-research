I really don‚Äôt recommend strict keto because of how easy it is to binge and how restrictive and limiting it is on top of a calorie restriction (it‚Äôs miserable). However, my takeaway from that is that if you really aren‚Äôt comfortable upping your calories to try to save your hair you can switch your macros and get a higher percentage of protein and healthy fats and fewer carbs so that your body has the nutrients and proteins and fats to replenish some of its natural oil and keratin to keep your skin/hair/nails healthy. You can also take biotin or a B complex vitamin with biotin to facilitate the same process",False,False

My hair dresser has said it's coming out at the roots, but in terms of health my hair itself is fine. Proper nutrition helps, but it can take three months for it to show with hair. Eventually you start regrowing small, wispy bits of hair. The other suggestion from my hair dresser was to take some length off so the hair falling out will look less dramatic.",False,False

That's why it's brittle and falling out. It will both break easily as well as fall out at the root, in my experience. It is awful and I'm sorry you are dealing with it right now. In my experience, it was completely reversed by getting medical treatment for the malnutrition &amp; ED. Good luck ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False
