Living with parents who can‚Äôt always make ends meet as much as they try, can make childhood really rough. Here‚Äôs a list of things that I can think of that can be cheap and also a nice change from pb&amp;j‚Äôs :  For veggies, cucumbers where I live are always less than a $1 each, and a bottle of ranch or low calorie dressing is usually less than $3. It‚Äôs a good snack that at least gets a little veggies in, and you can use carrots or celery instead. They are all relatively cheap if you are willing to buy them and cut them/peel them yourself. You could also buy some celery and raisins and make ants on a log (one of my favs). Meat can be a little more expensive, although sometimes at grocery stores you can find clearance meat that is closer to expiry (but is still perfectly okay to eat, just has to be used right away or frozen for later use).  It‚Äôs really cheap to make soup with any meat too! Just boil it for a few hours and then add veggies and salt/other seasonings and cook for another hour. It makes a lot and is a nice hot meal, great for cold nights especially without the ability to use the heater. I would also recommend going to the dollar store, as they have a ton of really cheap stuff, like pasta. I‚Äôve made dollar store spaghetti before, and while it may not be a gourmet meal, it‚Äôs still better than a pb&amp;j. They also sell things like oatmeal, cake mixes (which usually only require eggs and canola oil), chips, trail mixes, cookies, and sometimes they carry soups too. Also if you don‚Äôt have a heater, maybe some hot cocoa/tea might help you warm up (they sell those at the dollar store too).   I know some of these things might be fear foods, I just wanted to provide a full list of things that your parents/you could make. I hope this helps at least a little, because I know firsthand how shitty not having a variety of food can be, especially with an eating disorder. üíï",False,False
