I did shit like this once every so often except it'd be something like 2-3000 cals at Sweet Tomatoes (SO loves that place) or a buffet and didn't fast to compensate, just took 2-3 extra days to get the deficit back. Idk how much water weight I gained every time because I don't own a scale anymore, but I definitely garnered way too many stares at my stacked plate the last time we went there a bit before a trip to the hospital recorded my BMI at 12.8 (and I'm 5'1""). Maybe it's because I'm used to eating 1300-1400+ most days and not restricting severely that the meal honestly sounds like a normal non-binging amount to me. The 2 extra honey buns may be indicative of something though if she was rather underweight",False,False

I've always been embarrassed of eating around people if they aren't also eating. If we're both eating a meal, I'm not going to feel super guilty for eating most of it unless they are obviously picking at their food. Sometimes I still eat too much but the stomachache im guaranteed to get after works pretty well to keep be straight for the following days lol.",False,False
