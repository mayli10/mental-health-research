Ah ha its just another thing in a long streak of my brand of clumsiness. It'll heal up eventually and it could always be worse! At least I haven't broken my nose in 10 years so I have that going for me!",False,False

My husband is your height. He weighs in at 70-72kgs depending on the season. He works as a tree climber and a foreman. He is strong and he is healthy. He is of course what a lot of people would think is ""skinny"" but truthfully he is just about all muscle. But you need to know you are 100% valid in your fears and feelings.  Go slow. Go at the pace you need to be the best and safest you and know that there are a lot of places you could be safely along a spectrum. If you want to get into building muscle a good place to start, with working with your doctor would be body weight. You don't have to start off using barbells. Lord knows I haven't been and ya girl about a month ago couldn't even open her own pickle jars. Now I can! I gots itty bitty muscle starts but I can open a jar now!  Don't be like me though, I overestimated how much I could pick up and dropped a 15lb weight on my toe. The nail still looks kinda funny.",False,False

As an adult I can be healthy and stable +/- 5kg from that number (I prefer the minus side, surprise surprise).   I dunno if that helps at all, that it’s more a zone than a set-in-stone number, and an estimate to boot. Mostly what’s important is finding what is mentally and physically healthy for you. It takes time. And time takes time.",False,False
