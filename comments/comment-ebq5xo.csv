So toxic like a drug. So enticing and heartbreaking, and the constant variable in all these relationships was the hurt. Was the never being enough.   And then I met my partner who hurts me in an entirely different way. It hurts every day how much he loves me. It stings like pins and needles. Now I get it though. It hurts because of my own heart knowing how I let other people treat me before I met him.  Every day the way my partner touches me, defends me and looks at me is an insult to the person that stayed with men who made me feel like a second option, like an afterthought.   You're not over-dramatic. I remember being in a room with a man and never feeling more alone.",False,False

But maybe i'm being delusional. Thanks for the reassurance though :')",False,True

There are men out there who will love you regardless of your body or weight. You deserve a partner who is aware of your feelings re: body image and can be supportive of you.,False,False
