Maybe we should just pick on everything they eat for a few days so they can see how uncomfortable it is. I don‚Äôt know why they think it‚Äôs even acceptable.   Although I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm wayyyyy to shy to try that.,False,True

They make it pretty clear that they‚Äôre jealous and want me to fail, to the point that they‚Äôre almost actively sabotaging me. People can be so nasty :(",False,True

I sometimes think about how I‚Äôd like to just wear a giant bubble or something when I go out so no one can see my body shape to comment on it. And so many people think that it‚Äôs a compliment when they talk about weight loss, it‚Äôs really not. I hope your co-workers learn to shut up :(",False,True

Depending on the person, I will usually say that I‚Äôm not comfortable talking about it, or to mind their own business ow whatever but by then they‚Äôve already said enough for me to be feeling really bad.   I might try the medical condition one for repeat offenders though. Maybe it‚Äôll gross them out enough that they just avoid me completely haha.",False,True

They feel insecure and tell you to stop. You eat less healthy than them? Thank God, you are probably failing too, just as they have many times before. Soon your success will go away and stop reminding them of their failure. üò° Fuck em all to death!",False,False

My head just screams *shut up shut up shut up!* and it makes me want to binge even more. So annoying.,False,False

Anyone who thinks it‚Äôs cool to comment unprompted on anyone‚Äôs food, weight, or appearance should get thrown into shark-infested waters with a suitcase full of chum.   Are you in a situation with these people where you can tell them to stop? Really, you‚Äôre allowed to just tell them: ‚Äúplease stop talking about my food/weight.‚Äù It‚Äôs not illegal. You can be as nice or rude about it as you want.  Or you can do what I did. ‚ÄúI actually don‚Äôt want to talk about it, my weight loss/my diet is because of a serious medical condition.‚Äù This usually scares or grosses people out enough that they don‚Äôt bring it up anymore, and the best part is that it‚Äôs not even a lie! Sure, they‚Äôre probably not thinking ED immediately; but it‚Äôs not *my* problem if they jump to the conclusion that I have a tapeworm or thyroid disease or something.",False,False
