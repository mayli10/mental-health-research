It says NOTHING about you. Itâ€™s an error for her to think she can decide what an excessive amount of food is for a body that isnâ€™t hers. None of us can speak for what anyone elseâ€™s body needs.  Your frustration is valid! That was uncalled for and definitely would be hard for anyone to hear, let alone someone with an ED! I for one am proud of you for having hot chocolate and biscuits even though I know youâ€™re probably not too thrilled about it right now.   You are not alone! That freaking sucks. Sending lots of love your wayðŸ’•",False,False
