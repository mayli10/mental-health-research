I used to have a relatively normal relationship with food, occassional junk food and sugar aside, I'd eat when I was hungry and stop when full. I wasnt obsessed with food. But I have this theory that when I decided to cause my body an artificial food shortage, it got wise and learned to focus more on acquiring calories, and acquire them in vast quantities when available. Now I dont stop thinking about food, I dont stop being hungry, I can't fast like I used to. If I restrict at all, I binge uncontrollably. I think maybe it's a metabolic and hormonal shift that occurs in response to restriction, because I've heard this same thing from people who've been engaging in disordered eating for a while.",False,False

It's weird, I was so much more active back then too with marching band and school, I barely stopped moving. I guess I need more calories now that I'm working, but it's so frustrating. I miss those days but at the same time I probably wouldn't be around anymore if I had kept that up",False,False

It’s not sustainable, which prompted many unwilling, anxiety-filled recovery stints throughout the years.   Although I still restrict, it’s to a much lesser degree and I’m comfortable and stable. I’m so grateful that I can mentally be comfortable with a higher amount of calories.   TW - I control my body even better although it takes a longer amount of time.",False,False

Now I barely have the discipline to do that. Maybe it's a sign I'm ""recovering"" or whatever, but I really wish I could go back to eating 1000 calories a week.",False,False
