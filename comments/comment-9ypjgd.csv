He sounds pretty lame tbh. He could be damaging any progress you might make with recovery. Tell him to take his ugly financed car and baby temper and get out. Make sure you are in a safe space with witnesses. If he does manage to touch you, call the cops bc he can go to jail for what he is doing. It is not okay. Do not fall for his false claims of remorse or love or promises to ""change."" Those are lies. He only needs you to stay for his ego's sake.   Trust me he won't change. He probably can't even if he did try. Hitting and having a temper is part of his personality, part of his messed up brain. Nothing to do with you. You did nothing to cause it. He will act that way with anyone else too. His problem is anger, not you.. so don't listen if he tries to place that on you.  Don't waste your time on his ass.  This is not something to be shrugged off, it will only get worse and worse and next year you will be posting about your broken arm and cracked rib.   ",False,False

Or do you just want to think that because you were dangerously underweight and restricting while now you feel like you don't have control? Try to be honest with yourself. And try to make decisions that will help you be happy next year :* stay safe xoxo,False,False
