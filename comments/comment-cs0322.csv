Basically 500-600 cals and I was loosing weight really fast when I was borderline underweight already.  Found a therapist specializing in eating disorders.  She seemed pretty chill and friendly. I never had luck with any therapist as I find myself lying and never fully disclosing the issues I’m having.   I’m finally opening up to this lady. She’s asking about my diet weekly and I mention that normally I eat a crap ton raw veggies and fruits. As weeks go by she is starting to say shit like “I need to eat better like you do!”.  “Wow I should start eating cauliflower rice, I’m gaining weight and have a beach trip coming up!”. “You honestly eat healthy you just need to start eating a spoonful of peanut butter a week!” This is after I told her peanut butter is basically my all time #1 fear food.   She was listed under eating disorders but I think that might have been an error and she didn’t want to lose me as a patient and didn’t understand the severity of my condition. She slowly suggested that I was getting better and could come once every other week since I was getting dinner dates with the guy I was sleeping with once a week (still eating the soup option or a salad). I stopped going to the appointments and she never followed up lol.",False,False

And whenever I brought in a chai latte (I thought these weren’t so bad cuz I was still a teenager) he goes: aren’t those all sugar?! Never drank one again   Therapist #2: not even sure he was a real therapist. Got referred to him through school. Irish guy, late to every appointment; one day he handed me his business card and the back said “sex therapist!!!!” I was like omfg how did I get referred to this guy?   Therapist #3: told me she loved me. Hugged me goodbye. Called me all the time in between sessions. Sat really close to me. Sometimes held my hand. When I had a mental breakdown in treatment she told me it was “scary” and so I stopped talking to her for awhile. This was a huge ordeal because I really trusted her and she had been telling me to let myself feel anger and I had no idea how to properly express it lol. We never had an official termination session even though I asked for one. Wtf. I cried about it for almost a year   Therapist #4: YAWNED DURING SESSIONS!!!! basically fell asleep! Refused to take any responsibility for it; said she has issues she couldn’t keep out of the room  Current therapist: thinks I’m “healthy” and should be grateful for my “health” and asked if I have a “problem viewing myself as healthy” as if I’m batshit or need to be sick lol when I’m super underweight and starving. THE END I’m pretty much done w therapy for good lol or at least for like a year",False,False

Yeah probably not the thing to say to a delusional paranoid person.  &amp;#x200B;  Same doctor. Same hospitalization. As I said, I was suicidal, so I was trying to find ways to hurt myself.

I was already restricting when I started to see this therapist but over time I started restricting/fasting much more and my weight was in a really dangerous range, but she didn't ever refer me to a higher level of care even though I was honest with her, and I was only getting worse. She was nice, but she just wasn't equipped to treat ED patients.  The therapist I saw in one of my treatment centers was a treat. By the time I was admitted I had mostly been weight restored. The *first session* with her, I recall her saying to me, ""You can tell who needs weight restoration here by looking at them."" Which just came out of nowhere and only fueled my thoughts of ""I'm not sick enough."" And sometimes she would just tell me things like ""Some of the girls here are really, really sick"" as if *I* wasn't sick enough to be taken seriously by her because of my appearance. I felt like I had to get worse while in treatment to show how much I was struggling. I don't want to sound like I'm pawning blame onto other people over whether I recover. But some of the stuff she said to me as an ED therapist at an ED treatment center was not appropriate.",False,False

At the time, I was 12 years old, 80lbs and 5""0. 5 months prior I was 130lbs and fat. I wanted help but they sent me to the counselor, who showed me pictures of extreme cases of anorexia and asked, ""Do you wanna look like that if you keep starving yourself?""  At that point I just wanted to leave so I said no and kept lying so she'd excuse me. But fuck, hell yes I did. That was the entire point. The fact that she even asked if I wanted to look like that meant that I didn't look like that already, so she just gave me a bunch of thinspiration.   A bunch of my friends have also told shit during recent relapsed like, ""Don't starve yourself! You'd look weird if you were skinny."" Also, some other people will try to say that I'm already skinny, when they're the people who make offhand comments about my weight they forget. Shit like, ""you're not skinny... but you're not fat!""  The fact that they even react with any comment regarding appearance, in my ED brain, proves that appearance is above all the most important thing. It's the only way to be accepted, happy, and successful. Removing the fact that our society is built around this fucking weird ass lookism hierarchy from my mind and distracting myself from it is the easiest way for me to start to feel comfy again, but alas, no matter what I do I can't pretend that isn't the case.

Eventually I get put on an antidepressant *she prescribed* even though that's not part of her skillset. It turned out that the pill actually made my depression WORSE. I was on it for over a year before we figured that out. * Dietitian #1. Puts me on this weirdly specific meal plan where neither me nor my parents get ANY freedom in what I'm served. No options for carbs or proteins. Only the exact foods she said. She also made me eat TONS of dairy. I was pretty lactose intolerant and this made is so much worse. I'm vegan now but it sucked back then. * Therapist #2. She breaks confidentiality by sharing something petty I mentioned in a session for no reason. I was not putting myself or others at risk, and this comment was said in the heat of a mental breakdown. I later told her in a calm and professional tone that I would gave trouble trusting her because I didn't feel that she valued me as a person. She didn't deny it. * Dietitian #3 (#2 was rad but got promoted). Literally the most demeaning person I've ever met. I tried so hard to work with her throughout res, but she refused to listen to anything I said because I was a *patient* and clearly *not to be trusted*. Eventually I gave up trying to work with her. All she wanted to do was break me. I relapsed so bad bc of this bitch.  But guys, my team now is wonderful.
