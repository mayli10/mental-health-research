But since I start around 6pm and am in bed by 10 it's not too many calories. My weight had decreased MAYBE around 5lbs since may, but I've lost 4 inches to my waist, can see muscle in my arms, stomach, thighs, and forearms, and my hip and collar bones now protrude. I think I'm accidentally doing fitness by cobbling together ED thoughts and laziness.... And a love for Mac and cheese. ",False,False

I also don’t eat any rice or pasta (or meat). I finally had to give in and add a protein shake at least 2-3 times a week because I wasn’t getting any gains and was really wiped out. I rationalized that having one immediately after working out was only to feed my muscles. Originally I added half a frozen banana, which is super yummy, but ultimately it freaked me out too much so now it’s just protein powder and almond milk. ",False,False

I was eating 1300 calories a day and only lifting maybe 4x a week and honestly even though I was losing weight, I stayed weak asf and barely saw any muscle growth whatsoever.  Now I’m eating 1600 calories a day and lifting every day+ running every other day and I have SO much more energy and I’m actually seeing progress. I would definitely recommend eating more for energy.  Also- if you’re scale-obsessed like me, it can be super triggering to see the number stay the same or go up because of muscle tone/growth, so I use measuring tape to track my progress instead",False,False
