I don't think they have any eating disorder and experience hypocrisy like that, so they took it as a joke.    Worst part of it all, my mom is like that to my younger brother who's a teenager. She constantly nags about his overweight, but prepares grand, gourmet meals and wouldn't stop asking him to eat. He started restricting and that triggered me another way. I have been fighting with her about not being two-faced to my brother and let him eat without getting such remarks.",False,True
