Something that helps me when I'm trying to hide something I don't like (usually acne) is to draw attention elsewhere. So I'll do dramatic eye makeup for example. A suggestion for you might be to show off your neck with a loud necklace. Or maybe some colorful heels. Whatever you like most about your body - celebrate it! You're going to look beautiful and I'm excited you get to see your boo soon! ,False,False

I honestly relate so much to what you said, my bf keeps telling me he loves me no matter what, but I just have this intense hatred for my body :c  It's not hypocritical of you to type all of that, tbh I think many people with EDs have complete clarity when it comes to others but are horribly oblivious towards themselves. I think you should read what you typed when you're struggling with the same thing, because it's really really nice to read and gave me a lot more peace of mind :)",False,True

I think a huge part of me developing this disorder over this year has been feeling like I need to have the perfect body for when he sees me again. Right now I'm like 15lbs more than when he last saw me, and he knows that, and he says that he'd love me no matter my size, but the raw hate I have for myself, and like you, disgust with my stomach fat especially, keeps me from believing him so I am stuck in this detrimental cycle of hatred and self-punishment.   As hypocritical as this may seem coming from me, I do think it's important to remember that you are so much more than your body. The beauty of your relationship and your boyfriend's love for you is that he loves you for that inner person. When he sees the stomach you hate so much, it's just an accessory. He looks through those trivial outside variables to see the real you, who is beautiful to him inside and out. He has stuck with you through long distance, proving that your company and spirit are more important than your body for him. He has stuck with you through your ED, which shows he's here for the hard times. Just try your best to believe him when he says he doesn't mind your stomach, even if you feel completely the opposite, because his commitment shows a lot of love and support for you. That's what I've been trying to do at least, and feeling how much I love him and he loves me is sometimes the motivation I need to sway me from doing something destructive. I'm so sorry you're feeling this way and I'm wishing you both all the best. ",False,False
