I experience anywhere between 3/10 and 6/10 pain on a regular basis, so it's difficult to be consistent. I also go to physical therapy twice a week - 40 minutes each session. I do some of the therapy exercises at home. I can't overdo it without risking injuring myself further, or prolonging my recovery process. I'm also allowed to do low intensity bike riding but a) I don't have a bike right now and b) I'm too embarrassed to go to the gym on crutches and use a stationary bike. But I use a stationary bike for 10 minutes at each PT session, so that's something I guess.",False,False
