To the point where I just feel bad for my body for having me control it. Sure it’s a shit body but I’m sure someone else could have done better with it.,False,False

So she told me to start writing out what my negative thoughts are and make a column of evidence supporting this belief and all the evidence against it. Its helped...a lot to be honest especially with body image. I still hate myself but maybe someday i wont,False,False

It's exhausting on multiple levels. I did go through the 'well if I'm always gonna be miserable and full of self hatred I may as well be a healthy weight at least' phase, but nah. If I'm gonna feel like fucking shit all the time may as well be thin while feeling it. Hope you're doing as ok as you can be atm, sending you love.",False,False

Plus I'm already showing signs of aging. I truly wasted my youth. I'm trying to come to terms with the fact I will never like who I am, yet knowing that also means I will never come to terms if that makes sense? My self esteem is irreparable. I'm not sure what to do, the only times I feel good is when I forget I am me, in this body. I look forward to when I get to die, I'm not suicidal but it will be the one thing I'll be good at.",False,False

I’m overweight now and I’m trying to lose weight even though it means nothing in the end...  The only time I didn’t hate how I looked was when I was a functioning alcoholic. That was a fun few years :/",False,False

Doesn't help that I'm chronically ill on top of my ED. Like, this body is dysfunctional no matter what I do, I can't change my genetics and it'll always be a struggle to exist in this body. I literally relapsed into my ED because there's just no point in eating if it makes me sick/gives me hours of pain. But even before that, I hated my bone structure and face and those don't really change with weight loss. But I'd still rather be skinny but ugly than fat on top of my ugliness.",False,False
