I just want my best friend to know, but I don't want to tell him, because I am so exhausted and I also don't want to cry and I think I couldn't even find the right words to descrive everything. It's like I know everything I would want to say but I wouldn't be able to do it the right way. And I also wouldn't  want to be confronted about  it. Like I am always afraid someone finds out and then wants to talk to me about it and make me get help...   &amp;#x200B;  Oof.",False,False

Bulimia and also I'm super depressed like 9 out of 10 levels of suicidal right now I literally have a plan and the means but not the motivation currently, but I know from experience once I verbalize any of this I get hospitalized whether I want it or not, and thus probably lose my job and become socially shunned. And once someone knows you're bulimic that's all they think about you and think you're disgusting and grotesque and all that. But yeah I really need to do something about this because it's not good at all. Don't worry though I have too many obligations to self destruct.",False,False
