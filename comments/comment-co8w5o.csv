Ensure her she is beautiful to you and her weight doesn’t matter in the slightest.   I know the feeling of not wanting to be looked at or touched. Get her a huge jumper and comfy pants from her wardrobe and give them to her, tell her to get comfy and wrap up in a blanket with her hood up and then lay beside her. It sounds dumb, but the only way I can enjoy comfort is when I am as “invisible” as possible.",False,True
