I'd lost 160 lbs in just over a year. I'm terrified of being obese again, but I also don't want to be in the hell known as AN anymore.   The NHS funding issues etc meant I was on a long waiting list for an IP admission, but if I had kept on eating so little, I would've been sectioned and tube fed before I would've been admitted, and I realised that nobody was going to save me; only I could save myself.",False,True

I also honor hunger and food now, it‚Äôs a very necessary thing.
