I'm glad you're finding some happiness in this hell year. And congrats on breaking the binge streak, it's tough. It's even tougher not to use the magical manic motivation on restricting, man, it almost makes it /too/ easy.   I have also been in my manic GROOVE this past week. I completely gutted my room. Got rid of every piece of clothing that doesn't fit, I hadn't worn in the past 18 months, or I just plain didn't like. Pared down my books, journals and sketchbooks. Dusted, polished, vacuumed every nook and cranny, washed my sheets, spent way too much money on baskets to organize everything (but it looks so cute ughh and it's so neat). I donated 2 trashbags of clothes and two big boxes of old misc. objects. It feels so good. I haven't eaten in two days, tho. Which like. Nice but I'm kind of upset about bc food tastes sosososo mich better when I'm manic but literally I have been at work, the gym, or at home cleaning and sorting from dusk until dawn the past 3 days. I've only slept about 6 hours across that span of time too. And while I've spent an unplanned $80 on cleaning and organizing supplies I don't regret it bc everything feels so much better.   My roommates have caught the spring cleaning fever too bc they said I inspired them and they also went thru their clothes and belongings and until we took donations out to goodwill and trash out to the dunpster the upstairs hallway was just lined with trashbags. It was a really good bonding experience for all of us to sit together on the porch, sweaty from sorting and moving stuff to just sit and watch the sunset. GOD i love this feeling I'm literally like high off of cleaning rn.",False,False
