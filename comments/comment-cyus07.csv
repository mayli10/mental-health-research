Do not do this.  I'm in college and I have the same fears. I recommend meal-prepping once a week, maybe 1 time mid-week if you run out, for cooking. Put the meal into a container and stick it in your fridge. Pull it out and heat + put the meal together. Make sure you're eating a balanced diet so that your brain can stay healthy and you can succeed in your classes.   I recommend being in counseling weekly if you're not already. Most schools have counseling free of charge.  Good luck this semester!",False,False
