I didn’t want to acknowledge it when I got down to a 18 BMI, which thank god I appropriately freaked me out and gained weight in the following 4 months, but now at a 19.5 I’m thinking I look too fat again.

It’s becoming a struggle to convince myself to eat normally, if it wasn’t for fruit being so readily available, something I don’t restrict along with veggies, I’d likely be down quite a bit.  I’m browsing this sub nearly obsessively...  My best friend is half a foot shorter than me and a normal size and I’m fitting in her old “skinny” clothes she’s been getting rid of. It’s giving me a strange sense of satisfaction being able to fit into her old clothes... it feels mean spirited at times. I don’t like the thoughts I’m having about other’s bodies. I don’t like the thoughts I’m having about mine.    I lost over half my body weight less than 2 years ago without WLS. Over 100 lbs in 7-8 months. I haven’t had my period since even though I’m coming up on a year of maintenance.  My hair is growing back in, I’ve got 6 inches of new growth, but am I really eating ok? Probably not.
