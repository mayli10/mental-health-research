Sometimes (not always) they give forms to fill out - assessments or general questions about any history with treatment and meds.   I think both behaviors and emotions are important. I usually take the position that I’m not so good at assessing what’s important so I try to just lay everything out (minimize my instinct to minimize, as it were). Sometimes I write out notes beforehand so that I don’t forget things. They’ll usually ask clarifying/expanding questions along the way.   I hope it’s a positive experience and that you feel listened to! If the experience isn’t what you hoped for, hold on to hope - good providers really are out there and sometimes it takes a couple tries to find them.   Also, it can be kinda draining and overwhelming (and fire up my insecurities/self-judgement), so if possible I try to plan something nice for myself afterward. For me, a walk, a trip to the library, Netflix with a cozy blankie. Anything that feels soothing and centering.",False,False

If it's your first visit to this psychiatrist, they'll likely just take all your health information. That's what happened with my last psychiatrist. I didn't even have a chance to talk because he spent the entire time just confirming my info &amp; putting it in his computer.",False,False
