I figured I could snap out of it if I wanted to *typical addiction thought* I had a “reasonable” goal weight. Was eating decently and exercising normally. But when you stop having daily scale victories, you slowly creep into worse and worse habits to get the high of weight loss. Then it gets extreme. It’s such a horrible process but I was happy and healthy in the beginning of my journey. Then I ended up gaining weight painfully when i could’ve stopped and been proud. It’s so tough but I completely feel for you. Admitting and acknowledging is the first step.  Try to prioritize getting help as absolutely hard as it is and surround yourself with good people because you are worth it. Don’t go further down the hole because all there is at the bottom is pain and suffering. Hypocritical I know, but I wish I could have gotten there sooner because I’m so sad that I am still battling this at a huge cost to my health, sanity and relationships. You are perfect, you are worthy of help and love and you will get through this xx",False,False
