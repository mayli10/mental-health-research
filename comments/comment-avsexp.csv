I’ve been playing piano since I was little and I know some really pretty songs, and everytime I play I feel a nice sense of pride that I’m able to do that. I’m sure you have little random skills that give you a self esteem boost every now and then ❤️   The feeling you’re feeling is something every one of us experiences time to time.. just remind yourself that eventually you will be in a place where you’re feeling confident and on track again, just try to use something else to take your mind off of it in the meantime.",False,False
