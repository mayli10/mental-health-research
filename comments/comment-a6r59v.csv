I've always been well aware of what is disordered and unhealthy (and what isn't) about my eating habits, I just can't seem to stop it :/  Although it was triggered by not feeling thin enough, I think at its core it's less to do with looks and more to do with self harm/feeling like I don't deserve food/wanting to punish myself.",False,False

I was 120 pounds for years, then during my first year of college I ballooned up to 130. I thought that being back at 120 would look ""normal"" again and being 110 would be my ""perfect body"", but now I hover around 100-105 and honestly I look the exact same as at my HW.   What's been most frustrating is not ever having been as thin as I want to look eventually, so I don't really have a goal weight because I have no idea how much more I need to lose to get there!",False,False

I actually didn't have any food issues before - I acknowledged I was overweight, I made a plan to exercise more and track my calories, I stuck to my plan with plenty of wiggle room for special occasions.

When I finally got down to that weight nothing much changed. My thighs didn't have a gap. My arms were still fat and I was so embarassed from them that I never wore short sleeves. My ribs didn't stick out as much as I wanted them to. And I didn't get my 55cm/21inch waistline. There was still so much stuck to my body that I felt all my efforts 'til that moment were fucking pointless. I fell into a depressive, self-destructive downwards spiral and two years later, here I am, back at it and pushing for even less.  Now my UGW is 35kg/77lbs, less is fine too.
