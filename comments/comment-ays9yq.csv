My immediate gut reaction was to get defensive, but a lot of what you are saying is making sense. I've been struggling with binging my whole life and have been purging in waves for about two years.  In my post I said I \*haven't\* been purging (meaning I have in the past, but not recently--which has led to me gaining the 20 pounds).     My psychiatrist says I don't have an eating disorder, I'm just ""dissatisfied with my weight."" My Primary Care Provider and my therapist think I do. My PCP's solution is for my boyfriend to lock things up; my therapist's solution is to work on having a healthy relationship with food by just not worrying about what I eat.      Ugh, it's just like, I'm so frustrated because I've been asking for help and keep hitting these roadblocks. And it makes me want to recover even less!     The reason my PCP refused to prescribe the Vyvanse and not cut the Modafinil is because he doesn't want to give me an amphetamine when I have a history of overdosing. I have bipolar and borderline personality disorder, so I struggle a lot with intense mood swings, impulsivity, and depression. I'm currently on psychiatric leave for three weeks from work and school right now actually for mania. My psychiatrist just cut my anti-depressant in an attempt to swing me out of mania. I feel so out of control right now with everything--food, self injury, mood, etc...     I dunno I feel like maybe this sub isn't for me and I should be in r/ bpd, but they are all assholes who say I don't have BPD (because we are assholes lol). I just have a lot going on and want to get my eating in control again...well everything in control. It's one day at a time, one hour at a time, and one minute at a time, though, right?",False,True

I'm massively unsurprised they didn't give you Vyvanse.  I think the only thing you're missing from your ""how to induce a heart attack within 10 years"" plan is blood thinners.",False,False
