First, only keep food in the house that you have planned to eat. No snack foods, nothing just in case, only whatever meals you plan to cook for the week. Second, eating at very strict times. If you eat at the same time(s) every single day within a few days your body will adjust to it and you will only feel hungry at those times. If you eat sporadically your body won't have any way of knowing when you should eat and you'll feel hungry constantly. Last, be gentle with yourself. You don't want to restrict because that's not easy on your body. Eat enough to satiate you and to give you the energy that you need to get through the day. In the event that you do mess up and cave in to cravings or eat a larger portion than you planned don't beat yourself up over it. Accept that you made a mistake, remind yourself that everybody makes mistakes and that it is okay, and promise that you will try to not make that mistake again. As a bonus tip, I find that focusing on healthy eating cuts down on cravings. When I get all of the nutrients I need I don't have the urge to go out and buy foods that I can binge on. Usually that means Doritos for me, but lately it also means sushi sometimes.",False,False
