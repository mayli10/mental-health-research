I had big boobs and a bum and he loved my body so much. I was so sexy and fun! he's a typical guy and loves his manual labour job, fast food, nights out on the town and big boobs and bums hahahahaha   &amp;#x200B;  first couples months were bliss, lots of sex, laughs, fun but then I lost about 15kg in the space of 3 months and he told me he wouldn't touch me unless I let him weigh me. I refused. all of our conversations turned to my eating, my weightloss. he's not good with emotional shit so he never conveyed his words well, often resulted in him trying to insult me out of my disorder.   &amp;#x200B;  got officially diagnosed as having relapsed my ed (ana + purging subtype) about 2 months ago, shits been different since. he's still like my best friend and I love him lots and he loves me too but its never going to be how it was. he's just not attracted to me anymore, and can't cope with how my brain is now and how I react to things. understandable cause why would he want to be with someone thats entire being is calories. it fucking sucks so bad",False,False

In this kind of situation, it's always seemed like most people aren't like you and actually open to listening because they genuinely want the best for their relationship + partner.  As a person, you're more than this. You've got some behaviors that you need to work on, but the first step is caring enough to worry about that - and plenty of people don't even do that.  You're not a shitty person. You're a struggling person who might need to work on self-awareness, security, and coping mechanisms.  Mental illness and symptoms of anxiety aren't always compatible with the general idea of being a good person. That's not an excuse for letting them wantonly screw over other people, but it's also not even *remotely* the same as being like douches who hurt people just because they can/get off on it.  Talking about feelings is *so fucking hard* lmao. I've had to solder every single screw on the chassis to disassemble a laptop for battery replacement, and it was easier than being like - ""hey, love of my life, I feel sad about this thing, and kinda dumb for feeling sad"".  Someday, this can just be a rocky time between you two that you don't look back on super often.   What if you tried to talk about it in writing instead of face-to-face? Sometimes that gives me more time + space to gather my thoughts. I hate crying in front of other people too.",False,False

Don't have sex unless you want to have sex. But talk to him about your insecurities about how you've been feeling, especially about other girls.  He chose to be with you for a reason.  &gt; and i’ve been punishing my boyfriend for me feeling like shit.  You're dangerously close to being an abusive partner. Every single time you do that, it poisons your relationship. It's easier said than done to control yourself in the heat of every moment, but if you realize you're being manipulative or mean, **apologize and stop**.   He can wank for a bit if you're just not in the mood for sex, but you absolutely can't take your shit out on him and expect the relationship to be happy.",False,False
