I know I get resentful when he expects me to eat, but says he cant (which I understand but, if you _cant_ why should I either?) idk I'm sure its different for everyone but in our relationship 90% of conflict is a result of ed stuff. :/",False,False

He told me that about a year befoere i met him, he lost a lot of weight by only eating two apples a day. it sounds like he suffered from some body dysomorphia, and only stopped restricting after he fainted from working out. now he's obese and has a problem with binging. Ive tried to talk to him about it sometimes, but hes just as secretive as i am with my disorder, so there really is no getting through to him. I come home to empty boxes of pizza and cookies pretty frequently, and it makes me sad because i dont want him to like die in 15 years. but he doesnt want therapy or my help, so i just feel lightly anxious and bad about it all the time while i try to convince him im not unattracted to him.  meanwhile i workout 4 times a week and high cal restrict and he compliments my ""tight"" ""small"" ""fit"" body, and even though i disagree and think i need to lose a few more pounds, i get sick validation all the same. its...confusing",False,False

You don't overstep and try to dictate her eating habits. You deserve the same basic decency. She is your equal, not your nutritionist or your parent.  Even when she thinks you are making a bad choice, she isn't entitled to overrule it or harass you about it. It's not like that's going to fix anything anyways.  It's kinda hypocritical because you'd think she'd know how invasive, uncomfortable, and counterproductive this is? But that's about it.  I'd literally just be like...stop. I heard you. I hear you. Now stop. This isn't helping.  You don't have to debate about whether she should be allowed to do this, because she shouldn't. But it's worth pointing out that her fear is not unfounded, and it would be deeply unfair to try to tell her that she's only worried because of her own disorder. Don't weaponizing that.",False,False
