THIS BEING SAID the way Adderall metabolizes in your system you will start to need higher doses, over time you will max out and need to restrict the Adderall to build you’re tolerance again to be able to feel the side effects.  It can be a rollercoster so be mindful when takin it especially if your loving the weight loss.  Use the medicine strategically. And most of all be careful.   Remember, if you lose your rx due to the dr thinking you MAY be abusing it (there are forms of adhd meds that aren’t addictive such as what I’m on, Strattera) you will gain the weight back. So keep this in mind.",False,False
