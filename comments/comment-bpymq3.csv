Because you're an adult, you have legal rights to your medical information. There should be a release form requiring your signature for your info (diagnosis, prescriptions, notes, appt times, everything) to be shared with ANYONE including your parents. I believe its after the age of 13 you must sign a consent form. Can you ask your doctor's office to retract this release form if you did sign one? That would mean they legally cannot share your info and your parents wouldn't find out. Thats how I got through recovery without my guardian knowing! They never knew (and still don't know) anything.",False,False

I don’t know anything about inpatient/the costs of outpatient but that’s my only half brained idea.",False,False

They barely speak English, and (1) I don't think they offer family sessions at my school and (2) I don't think they offer bilingual sessions either.  I wish mental healthcare was more affordable :(   Thanks for your answer! I appreciate it, even if it's not what I want to hear",False,True

Maybe you can ask a counselor at your school to do a family session. If you're in the US, treatment will cost you tens of thousands of dollars (if not more) out of pocket. My copay for 3 weeks of residential was more than $3000. I don't even want to know how much the PHP, IOP, and OP cost, but I would assume tens of thousands with insurance.",False,False
