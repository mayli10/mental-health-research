I also tended to hoard or obsessively think about household goods like soap. If things were halfway full I would freak out and feel like I needed to buy a second thing, and then I'd get anxious about the money that it cost, but also really felt compelled to stock up. It was exhausting. It also went away after I ate regularly. ",False,False

Iâ€™ve got boxes(!) full of protein bars, powders, snacks like jerky and popcorn, my freezer is filled with veggies, fruit, ice cream, pizzas, meals Iâ€™ve bought to heat up, meals Iâ€™ve prepared myself, etc   Itâ€™s ridiculous. I canâ€™t go a day without buying food. But the more food I have the less I eat, and I get super anxious when I donâ€™t have a lot of everything. Iâ€™m moving out soon so I have to stop myself from buying and finally eat what I have to not look like a crazy person when I pack my boxes with food (itâ€™s all way too expensive to throw out lol) so Iâ€™m doing a â€žonly fresh things are allowed to be boughtâ€œ thing this month, but itâ€™s so hard!!!
