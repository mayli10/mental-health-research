Plus, we associate food with comfort and happiness. I do this all the time.  One thing I’ve found that sometimes works is a hot bath with a nice scented bubble bath mix- it’s warm and gets your brain out of the kitchen and gives me a similar feeling of comfort and self care - sometimes it’s enough to derail a binge.

I'm a sensation-seeker on all fronts because there's just something missing inside me. I suspect it's the persuasive hollowness of the childhood I never had. Or maybe the love of my father (paging Dr. Freud...). Whatever it is, it's the motivating force behind everything I do, but particularly my bad habits- i drink to feel, i smoke to feel, i binge and purge to feel, i even starve to feel. There's a hole in my heart or in my head hat demands to be filled. ",False,False
