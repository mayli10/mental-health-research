As I said, I’m sure there are things I’m not aware of. Based on the nurse’s comment and the food orders I’ve seen, they haven’t been doing that as of now.  I’m pretty sure the only “diet” he’s on is the required diabetic plan from the hospital. I’ll keep an ear out though.",False,True

He probably could lose a huge amount of weight in a short amount of time doing a supervised 500 cal diet; the good news about fat loss is visceral fat goes first, so the most dangerous fat would be drastically reduced if he could get down to a BMI of 35 or under",False,False

I am definitely not a doctor, but to me it seems nearly impossible for him to healthily lose enough weight in the time necessary in order to get a transplant. Eventually he won’t be getting enough oxygen at maximum flow. It’s just so surprising to me that they’re presenting it as an option. But as I said, I’m sure there are facts that I’m not aware of.",False,True

Dr. Now is like a one in a million surgeon for doing what he does on such large heavy people.   There's a lot of risk with airway and dosing complications with anesthesia, etc. The doctors have essentially decided that surgery is riskier than not doing surgery right now, in your father's case.",False,False

It sucks seeing a loved one in the hospital and I bet that whole situation isn't helping things either. Just take a step back and remember that you're totally allowed to be upset. Just don't take it too personally cuz sometimes there's just nothing you can do :/,False,False

If he was closer to the overweight range, then I’d understand. You’re right, I can’t change his mind. I just don’t want him to hold onto this false hope. Though it’s totally possible that I don’t understand the whole situation. On that show - I think it’s my 600 lb life, the doctor requires the patients to lose a certain amount of weight (20 lb?) before surgery, so maybe it’s something like that.",False,True
