All the girls I've dated have been at least a little chubby, but usually pretty big.  Thin girls make me body check. It can cause problems tho, my last relationship ended after I started spiraling back into my Ed this year. Pretty sure I was making her self conscious with how quickly Im loosing weight. I gained like 30 pounds the two years we were together and once I lost that amount and then some she started being super self conscious. Lots of comments about how I'm six inches taller but eating half as much as her.

The only exception being opposite ends of the spectrum. Extremely underweight, hip bones, chest bones, thigh gap? Not really interested. (Even tho that's what I'm going for). So obese that regular exercise isn't currently a possibility? Also not interested. I think it's just because even when I'm not in an active ED I'm very active, I love to hike, bike, run, anything, and I would want a partner who can easily do those things with me. However, I really am far more attracted to personality (sounds fake but true). I'm bi, and I've found myself insanely attracted to very overweight men and women due to their personality, not to mention overweight =/= not attractive.   Anyways. For anyone who read this and felt upset, I wanna say: if you are very overweight or very underweight but you love your body, that is awesome. I'm very happy for you. Please don't let my body preferences make you feel bad. What I'm looking for in a partner is not what everyone is looking for. Not everyone enjoys exercise, and that's fine!   Anyways anyways.
