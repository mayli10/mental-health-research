So it was definitely strange to have those things from months ago held against me from when I haven’t had hard moments with it since then. And I knew I was going through a particularly hard downturn in my mental health for a bit having just graduated college and not knowing what I was going to or where I would live, I made sure to check in with him that he’s okay with talking about these things and apologizing a billion times every time I broke down. So it hurts to have someone turn around and get mad about it which I why I kept telling him don’t worry about fixing me because it will drive you crazy, I know because I’ve been trying to do that all my life, and  it did. And I can’t keep my sanity for both our sakes if I skip therapy, etc. and travel home every weekend to visit. Anyways thank you and sorry for the wall of salty rambling. Best wishes to you and your awesome SO 😊💙",False,True

Maybe long distance just wasn’t working for him but he didn’t wanna say that. Idk. Most people don’t logic too well under high emotional stress like that so I’m trying not to blame him. And Thank you so much 😊 I’m really trying to utilize my newfound time to focus on taking care of myself and it’s going pretty well so far.,False,True

Don't blame him, don't blame your ed, it may have not had anything to do with that at all. Sometimes you stop loving someone. And it's okay.   Count this as a blessing, OP, and use this as a chance to go out and find your somebody. Because it wasn't him. Keep up the recovery in spite of him and when you're recovered and healthy and a great weight he can stalk your Instagram and eat his words.",False,False

Seriously, there is someone out there who will love and support you through your recovery. Nearly 5 years ago I met my SO when I had just started recovering from anorexia. We had been together for like 3 weeks and he would sit with me while I sobbed over being too scared to eat the cheeseburger in front of me. He didn’t think I was weird or too much work. He just loved me through it. 4 years later and here I am relapsing, off my bipolar meds, with severe panic disorder, basically just a complete mental case, and all I have gotten is unconditional support and gentle pushes towards getting better. That’s what you do when you love someone.   There is someone out there who will stay by your side unconditionally while you are on your recovery journey. And until you find that person, don’t waste a millisecond of your life on some dickhead who thinks your mental illness is “too much”. You did not choose this, and you’re trying your best. You’re better off alone than with someone who treats you as a burden for something beyond your control.   And again, seriously fuck that dude, I can’t imagine having so little compassion for someone you “love”.",False,False

Looking back, it was an awful toxic relationship anyway and the pressure made the ED worse. I'm glad I didn't stick with someone who had so little patience for my humanity.  Not saying yours is toxic but you'll find someone who  finds the good parts worth it.  My boyfriend is the most supportive person I know regarding my ED, in part because I don't have to lie to him. He just cares and reassures and brings me logic when I have none. Takes it in stride. Find that person, they definitely exist.  Anyway I'm sorry this person isn't willing you give you time and slack, but I want to point out that you're doing everything right, and that shit doesn't follow someone else's schedule. Keep fighting the good fight.",False,False

It makes sense since it seems like he started to break down often when I wasn’t struggling any more and kept bringing up past traumas when I told him to stop, as if they were his own. And it god damn hurts to have someone deny your progress and capability to change to your face. So agreed, and thank you 💕",False,True

It sounds like your partner might have actually liked when you were sicker because then HE could fix you and now he’s upset because you’re working towards recovery on your own? Idk maybe not but that’s how it comes across when you describe it,,, anyway you deserve someone that will support you throughout your recovery so fuck him",False,False
