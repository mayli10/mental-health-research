I find myself exercising more, literally trying to run away from that feeling. Restricting becomes such a high and such a distraction from the discomfort.

It‚Äôs that weird combination of mania and starvation high.  I thought I was the only one with that desire to just destroy myself when I‚Äôm manic, it‚Äôs completely indescribable to someone who doesn‚Äôt have mania.  Like complete self hatred and complete euphoria at the same time.  I used to cut myself but obviously it became too easy for other people to recognize and I haven‚Äôt touched it in like 6 years.  I have a lot of other issues that feed into my ED, but mania is probably one of my absolute biggest triggers ever.  Makes sense that it‚Äôs called ‚Äúcomorbidity‚Äù I guess.  I think just HAVING bipolar feeds into it a lot, like the control aspect.  I was diagnosed with it pretty young, like 13, and I‚Äôve spent the last 8+ years not being able to control my own feelings, all the lovely side effects of med cocktails (including weight gain, woo!), therapists, hospital trips, the works.  Being able to have ONE part of my body that I can control, oddly enough, has kept me sane.  I dunno.  I hope you can find peace soon, I wouldn‚Äôt wish this on anyone and I‚Äôm sorry you have to go through this too.",False,False
