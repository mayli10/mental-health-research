Just fyi, I should have mentioned it before, but I met him on a dating app. The idea of dating him is kind of in my head but also kind of not... We're just friends but it's implicit that we're open to dating. But yes, you're right, I think I'm overthinking this too much. I just really like this guy and don't wanna screw it up.",False,True

You are very wise and introspective. It's impressive !  It seems like you just need to take your own advice : take it slooooow. Don't start dating him yet, either in real life, _or in your head_.   Give it a little bit more time to better imagine if dating him is good. Is worth the 'big reveal' at fear of losing him. Right now you don't know him well enough to be able to construct a head-idea of what dating him would be like with who he _really_ is as a  person. You, who just got out of a long relationship, and him in the same, are both fortunate to know well that it takes time to understand who someone really is. Even if you feel connected.   When your informed idea of properly dating him is something you _really_, unambiguously, want, dooooooo itttttt. You deserve a happy relationship with a wonderful, understanding partner. ED voice should not isolate you at all ! It shall not hold you back ! That's not fair ! Having such a crush is the first step ! And I hope it for you that it will blossom into exactly this ! I send hearts ðŸ’•",False,False
