It's like, some places are run by people who understand EDs and are empathetic and overall try to be sensitive, and then the places that aren't like that are so bad it's almost a joke? Why is it so polarized lol it's actually ridiculous",False,False

WHAT. THE. FUCK???  Legit had this convo with the dietician yesterday: “Can I see my meal plan so I understand what’s on my plate?” “No, you have to wait until you’re approved for meal planning”  And that was it. I couldn’t say more because it just all went around me having to wait. Well, it’s been almost a month bitch, the fuck? I’m going in today to say I either want to try IOP or just leave and find a private practice therapist &amp; dietician.",False,True

It's like we're not even fucking human, just livestock they need to get fed to count the day as a success.  I don't know why it is so fucked up. I don't know why it is all about weight and you can literally be at rock bottom mentally but if they're forcing Ensure into your body you're ""recovering well.""   I'm sorry it's bad for you, I hope it gets better.",False,False
