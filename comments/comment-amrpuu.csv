Here's what I do:  -SPF!! Every day no matter what. Even if you're going to be in your house all day, the UV rays come through the windows. Don't forget your neck.  -Gentle skincare routine and regular exfoliation.  NEVER squeeze pimples. Squeezing can damage the underlying collagen in the skin. Instead, use pimple patches. They suck out all the garbage overnight.   -For body, dry brush before showing and lotion after. Don't forget your neck.  -Research shows that dietary sugar intake can contribute to collagen breakdown and early aging. Cut down on processed sugars and eat a variety of fruits and vegetables.  -Water. Lots of it and regularly.  -Sleep. Minimum of 7 hours/night. When I'm restricting, I have a hard time falling sleep so I take melatonin to meet my sleep quota.",False,False

I‚Äôm frequently told I look at least 10 years younger than I am.  Often mistaken as sisters with my daughter your age, which we both HATE, her more so, I‚Äôm sure.  She‚Äôs made comments similar to yours and it really concerns me.  For decades I‚Äôve been OBSESSIVE with exfoliating my skin.  Face scrubs like Olay microdermabrasion, micro needling(u can get the rollers on Amazon) witch hazel and ROC day and night cream.  Just diligently removing old cells and stimulating collagen production.  I really think it‚Äôs help me avoid the signs of skin damage from frequent tanning, which I still do to help with SAD and low vit D.  But honestly, you‚Äôre sooo young.  Pls, pls don‚Äôt worry over this.  What u mention are really just expression folds and completely natural.  I think the Kardashians and all other unrealistic beauty images in our society today are causing a generation to fear aging or to feel their natural looks are no longer good enough.  It‚Äôs selling an image of unrealistic expectations.  Check out those high maintenance women on The Real Housewives.  They all spend tons on surgery and Botox, but somehow u can STILL tell they‚Äôre in their 40‚Äôs or 50‚Äôs, and to me it looks like they‚Äôre just trying too hard.  Please don‚Äôt start Botox.  I‚Äôve had it injected for migraines and it did flatten my forehead lines, which only I noticed, but it also collapsed my eyebrows and eyelids causing them to droop for months.  I also have vision problems in one eye that a neuro ophthalmologist said may have been caused by the Botox spreading to the eye muscles.  And even if it does look good, are u really going to want to pay for that every 4-6 months for the rest of your life?  Bc once u start, it definitely can become addictive, and we‚Äôre all here probably prone to addictive tendencies and have complicated and distorted relationships with the mirror.    Those of us with ED‚Äôs tend to be perfectionists and unrealistically critical of ourselves.  Pls don‚Äôt focus on something that‚Äôs not even there yet and truly appreciate and value your youth and beauty.  I know I never did.  I was always critical of my appearance.  But as I look back at photos, I feel like that was another person and I should have appreciated my looks and enjoyed them.  I never saw or appreciated it then and wish I could go back and tell myself that the mirror was lying to me.  I think like our weight, sometimes we see one thing in the mirror, but it‚Äôs not necessary accurate.  And I think the best thing with age is no longer giving af what others think and I honestly wouldn‚Äôt want a man with superficial expectations of perfection.    It‚Äôs great to take healthy steps to feel better about yourself as part of self care, which is really important, esp in recovery.  I‚Äôm sorry for the motherly preaching.  I just hope that u can see your true beauty and really enjoy it, not be discouraged by the unrealistic images we‚Äôre inundated with.  You‚Äôre beautiful! üíï  ",False,False

I'm still enjoying the life of finally getting away from my zit-filled teenage years. And though I never had acne, I used to pick at my pimples a lot as a teen, so right now my main focus is fading all of my pigmented scars (again, I didn't have acne, so I don't have craters, just surface-level darker spots that have already mostly faded, but I want them 100% gone so that I can't even see them).   HOWEVER, I'm 100% certain that preventing wrinkles before they come is a lot more effective than trying to fill them back in after they come in. You are doing a very good job by already being concerned about prevention. I'm only doing a very minimal routine with like basic moisturizer, facial masks, toner, ALWAYS putting on sunscreen when I go out in the sun, etc. right now because I'm trying to adjust to my new, zit-free skin still (I didn't do anything to get rid of them; it's just age), but hopefully soon I can start doing what you do üíï sorry I really can't be any help there",False,False
