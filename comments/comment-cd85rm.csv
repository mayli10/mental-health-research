Worth it to face truths like that, even if it’s difficult :)",False,False

Yeah I try not to think about what my body is doing to live through my ed, but on the odd occassion I do it's a bit of a reality check!",False,True

In the end it’s always the body wanting to save itself, you know? With PCM it’s really the body breaking down as it tries to do so which is really scary. It’s always worth it to up intake, esp if it’s adding more protein or other nutrient-dense food.",False,False

That makes sense, I'd guess the vast majority of people with eating disorders don't eat enough protein though; I certainly don't. Doesn't detract from the message at all, thanks for your knowledge :)",False,True

It’s called Protein Calorie Malnutrition (PCM). Basically in every body there’s fluid leak and build-up, but if you have PCM (so taking in a fair number of calories but not enough protein), the abdomen begins to swell with its own waste fluids bc the lymphatic system can’t keep up with the leakage.   That’s kinda a TLDR but basically their bodies aren’t swollen from fat, otherwise their stomachs wouldn’t be taut. So-called “under-developed” countries deal w PCM a lot in the lower class, bc high protein foods are so much more expensive.   Obviously i don’t wanna detract from your overall message, since it makes sense. Your body is always gonna fight for you, to keep you alive and healthy as much as it possibly can.",False,False
