Always the big focus is on weight, and then some focus on the past, current lifestyle and events etc. but very little for the BDD and self esteem they kind of don’t seem to know how to tackle it. Ime it’s the hardest aspect of ED to fix as well.  Currently my therapy is radical (psychedelics, self-management no docs). It’s not for everyone but so far it’s the best one for me at helping the emotional side of recovery. However, the body image thing is the last one to go and it’s the only thing holding me back rn I think. Even the new insight and mindfulness I’ve gained doesn’t change it, it’s quite frustrating at times but I’m not giving up I see it as work in progress. Atm I’m able to rationalize and tell myself that i don’t see myself how others do, it does feel like going through the motions most of the time but it’s better than I was before at least I believe it now (sometimes!). I’ve accepted that this may be just how it has to be, while maintaining hope that this last hurdle is possible.  Good luck 🙏🏽",False,False
