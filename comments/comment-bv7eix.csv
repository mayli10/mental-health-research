But at the same time they also have professional chefs, trainers, dieticians, and assistants to help them (or force them) to maintain their weight, and the eyes of millions of angry torch-wielders to judge them if they gain an ounce. I think it's fair that most of us here don't lose weight like they do lol.",False,False

Not saying all of them, and obviously these women are thin irl (many underweight too), but christ, so many of these pictures I'm seeing are ridiculously airbrushed or abusing angles/poses/camera lenses etc.  I mean, I think this is what people say when they say ""don't compare yourself to them"". Don't beat yourself up for not having the same body as them or being as thin as them when to start with, no two bodies are identical, but more importantly THEY don't have these bodies probably most of the time. They cut weight before photoshoots, they flex and they suck and they pose so they look their best, then they get photoshopped on top of that to look flawless - hence ""goddesses"". It's not something they maintain 24/7. Are you subbed to /r/instagramreality?",False,False

I don’t know if this will help at all and my advice is totally unsolicited but you’re a separate entity from all those other women. You have to focus on how you look and make yourself look the best you can. Their existence is totally separate from your own. xx,False,False
