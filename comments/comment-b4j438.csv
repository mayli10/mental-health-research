Like even my grandma. Now im in recovery but theyre still all dieting (my mom, stepdad, sister) its so funny but also sad how my ED behaviour influenced everyone around me althought ive never talked about it.",False,False

She was kind of chubby after having kids, not majorly so, but she never exercised and just ate junk so she just never lost the weight. Any time my weight was brought up (I was just an average weight, not skinny and not chubby) she would always make a point to mention how her whole life until she had kids she was so effortlessly skinny, she couldn't have gained weight if she tried and back then she was skinnier than me. She also seemed kind of smug that my sister was fat, which she had been ever since she was a baby basically.  She also seemed jealous that my dad liked me more than her (they hated each other so not surprising lol) and would act out and be mean to me if my dad and I were having a good time together. Until they got divorced, it always seemed like she held a lot of contempt for me.   I stopped talking to my mum almost a decade ago now and she wrote me a letter once admitting that the jealousy of my dad liking me more than her was real, among other shitty behaviours, which is probably one of the most fucked things I could think of. Being jealous that your husband loves the kid you made together - wtf?? Based on that I assume the weight jealousy was real too. Unsurprisingly, I do not miss her lol.  It seems like you love your mum though, I hope this doesn't negatively affect your relationship and that your mum is ok. This sort of behaviour does happen and it's ok to be concerned for your mum.",False,False

She experiences BED which is shitty, and she also had a thyroid problem (caused by giving birth to me üòÖüòÖ) which causes huge weight gain. Once I lost weight she was constantly harping on me to eat more and to eat meat (I‚Äôve been vegetarian since 2010), but doing fad diets herself (like weight watchers, paleo, keto, 100% juice diets etc). I love her but she has been obnoxiously  jealous of my weightloss. I was over weight, I dropped under weight and now I‚Äôm a healthy weight- struggling but trying to be healthy. I wanted to donate all my old too large clothes and she says stuff like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre going to get fat again so don‚Äôt throw it out‚Äù. And other horrible things. Our relationship has been super striated, in part because of my disorder but also in part because she is envious. I don‚Äôt know how to make her understand that this is not something to be envious of. Being sick isn‚Äôt good. Rapid weight loss isn‚Äôt healthy. This is bad. Please try not to be envious of my illness. She doesn‚Äôt get it. Maybe never will??? ",False,False

When I was a teen and overweight because of BED, my mom would consistently pick at the fat on my body. It honestly only made my ED worse.  Now, I'm finally below my mother's weight, and guess what? Now she's gained a few pounds that's she's been trying months to work off, but they won't budge for her. I see what she eats. It's pretty healthy, but she'll eat meals cooked in oil, have a piece of bread on the side, rice on the side, etc. I thought it would feel good to finally be smaller than her, but when she sees me eating the same plain chicken leg w/o skin, veggies, and broth every single day, and I realize that's not something she's willing to/can do, I just feel guilty. I would love for her to eat all the food she wants while keeping at her ideal weight, but, given that she's 5'1 and 58? years old, that's just not possible.  When I was just beginning the match/pass her weight, she did seem to have a jealous tone in her voice. She wouldn't really put me down, but she told me to stop losing weight, which idk why because I was still overfat for sure (like the 125 lb mark?). Now that that there's more distance for me since that number, she tells me I'm hitting weights she's never even been before, and she's actually seems to start getting concerned.  But whatever. I remember every time she would poke at my belly whenever I sat in the passenger's side of her car, and I cringe at the memory. I remember all the times she'd zoom on my fat arms during family photos in 8th grade, and I feel sad. She made me feel like she failed as a parent when she caught evidence of my binges. She would take pictures of the pile of wrappers she found in my room and threaten to tell everyone and punish me for it. Did she ever think, as a child, something was wrong with me? No. And while there is no way I'd starve myself just for her, it does feel good as I approach the lower end of a healthy BMI and perhaps one day go below that, because at least there will be proof enough for my family that I actually do have an ED. And finally, I will have a physical representation of how much being called fat hurts me,",False,False

Since i‚Äôve visibly lost a lot of weight she always compliments me on it and mentions how much she wants to lose. She likes talking about how much she weighed when she was my age, how slim she was etc. Her preoccupation with weight when I was growing up has probably been a factor in my disordered eating tbh ",False,False
