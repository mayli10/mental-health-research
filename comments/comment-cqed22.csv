I just see orthorexia as a step up from binging/purging, fasting for a diet, etc. I know it's still not mentally healthy, and no, I don't like her personality. However, if I could have an eating disorder revolving around disciplining myself to eat only fruits/veggies and being slim af than I would choose that any day over this hell I'm in of waiting until I'm starving to pig out (and subsequently feeling horrible about myself). I do think she's a bit ""cracked out"" and I'm sure she craves junk food/meat but denies it- however, that is not for me to determine. I just see a crazy, skinny b*** with a high amount of energy that seems to come from natural sources and not stimulants like caffeine, etc.",False,True

The same woman who thinks losing her period means she is healthy?   No she’s not healthy, she’s delusional and needs help and that’s coming from a fellow insane girl",False,False

It would be hard enough if someone was on a plant-only diet. The raw movement isn't based in science at all; people just like to think of extreme ways to be controlling about food.,False,False

She essentially just does high carb high restriction that, in my unprofessional opinion, has signs of orthorexia.  The only way to maintain a body weight is to have your CICO balance to the maintenance number for that weight, regardless of the weight. So that means either eating less or working out more to maintain a weight smaller than you currently are. How those calories go in or out are whatever works best for each person on a case-by-case basis.  Eating a varied diet is important for health, and setting unnecessary food group restrictions (i.e. going ""yeast free"" without any proof of an issue consuming yeast) doesn't make someone healthier. Obvs vegan can be healthy, but she is a raw vegan who doesn't consume gluten, yeast, oil, and a number of other things. If you become a fruitarian you will not have a varied diet and will need to supplement.",False,False
