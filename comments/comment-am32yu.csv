I eat breakfast at 4:40am lunch is either 11am or 3pm, and dinner is anywhere from 5-8pm. All I do is think about my meals (same food every day but still). Then I weigh every single morning before I eat at around 4:45am. If I binge I skip weighing, I don’t need to punish myself like that.",False,False

Except right now I can only eat jello and soft things cause of a wisdom tooth extraction. It's been hell but I lost 4 pounds so it's also been super satisfying.

I'm in a slightly different situation because I'm under high supervision for anorexia recovery, so my meals roll around the clock at the mercy of others, but a schedule is a schedule.  I wake up and eat. Then I try to find shit to do until I have to eat again. Then I get enough alone time to secretly exercise, then I have to pretend like I wasn't just exercise when everyone gets home, then they leave again and I exercise again. Then everyone's back and I have to eat again, kill more time, eat, kill time, go to bed, exercise in the dark, go to sleep, repeat.  It's fucking torture and I hate it. I just want a life. But it wouldn't be any different without the constant surveillance. I'm spiraling out of control and I can't bring myself to stop.",False,False

It’s the worst on the weekends, because I don’t have class or org meetings and study groups to keep me busy from thinking about it.   And then immediately after the meal all I can think about is if I ate too much and if I’ll gain weight until I weigh myself next morning. And as soon as I realize I’ve lost more weight my thoughts immediately cycle right back to “Ok cool how long until I can eat?” or “Damn I’m hungry where’s my daily dose of adderall and Diet Coke, now that’s a god damn meal” ",False,False
