If she's concerned about your BMI, she needs to be willing to have an adult conversation with you about it. She shouldn't be edging around you trying to get your stats like you're thirteen.   She's wrong to be worried - parents always worry after their children, and eating disorders are truly no joke. Still, I understand your fear of discovery, and sympathize. Bottom line, you're not obligated to tell her your stats. She may not react well to you setting this boundary, but it's unhealthy to expect your adult child to share all their medical/personal info with you.   Like, things like this are what led my mom to eventually tell me I was not ""allowed"" to make my own medical decisions, bc she had ""invested"" too much in my health for my body NOT to be partly her domain. I'm not saying your mom is at this level of crazy, but just, my oh MY do I wish I'd set boundaries earlier than I did.",False,False
