I would definitely try to find yourself a therapist and see where to go from here. I also think admitting to yourself whether or not you think you have one is a step in the proper direction too.  I ended up reaching out to a therapist a few days ago and plan on talking with her about the issues that are happening and it's like a big weight off of my shoulders, since that person is going to have a more objective look at the behaviors and emotions and say what they think (in their educated opinion). Perhaps that would help you too.",False,False

Especially the obsessing with calories part. Do you have a therapist? It canâ€™t hurt to go to a couple of sessions and ask for an opinion on how to proceed (it could be talk therapy, it could be psychiatry, theyll try to work with you to find a middle ground solution!)",False,False
