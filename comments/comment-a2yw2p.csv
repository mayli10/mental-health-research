There are coping mechanisms that are positive and there are some that make you feel worse afterwards, like this. I know how hopeless it can seem (I c/s for years and hated it) but it is possible to stop. Even just cutting it down is a step in the right direction.   Alternative coping mechanisms to try are any of the arts. Whichever one you enjoy, music, singing, dance, drawing, writing poetry. When you feel like bingeing distract yourself with something you enjoy. Sometimes you’ll be able to ride it out, and sometimes not. When you can’t, be kind to yourself.   Treat yourself and your flaws like you would treat your best friend and his/hers. Patience and kindness is what you would give to your loved ones and you deserve that too.  ",False,False

Binging is almost always triggered by stress, even if you can't pinpoint it. I know what it feels like to be out of control and obsessed and can't stop thinking about food or eating, almost like an out of body experience. But you can fight your binge urges (ie, just do your best to wait them out, don't give in for one hour and see how you feel...even a one hour delay is better than binging immediately) and they also will naturally subside eventually.
