In restricting, there really isn't such thing as a GW, and UGW, because you hit the marks and realize you can go lower. You may look in the mirror and see a thin individual but on the inside you are sick. This isn't about losing weight, it is about control through restriction. If you need to chat, I have physically been there before.",False,False

I remember being content with my weight loss when I was a nearly healthy weight, slowly the ED demands more weight loss, it's convinced me im ""fat"" despite being at a severely underweight bmi. The thing is I don't think I look ""too skinny"" or think I've taken it ""too far"" because to me I genuinely still see myself as very big, despite knowing my weight. It sucks. Eating disorders suck. Please be safe. Remember; the desire to lose weight isnt due to your body, it's coming from your ED, which doesnt care how thin you are, it will always want more. I'm here for you.",False,False

Today I caught myself thinking, “well, maybe I can make it 110. 105, even. Just to be safe”.",False,False
