Tbh i was so shocked about how calm and relaxed she seemed while slowely chewing on the seperate pieces and asking me if i want any. Tbh i sometimes get so shocked about how healthy people eat without beating them up over that.,False,False

Worked out the calories to be like 900, and felt really stuffed. Couldn’t eat the rest of the day because I was so full.  And my plate was maaaaaybe half full. Most other people had their plates PILED with food, and most of them went back for second or third portions. I can’t even imagine eating that much without my stomach hurting or without feeling sick. Blew my mind. Seeing how other people eat is so bizarre to me.",False,False

I feel guilty mentally tallying the calories if I see them make food but it's so automatic now.",False,False
