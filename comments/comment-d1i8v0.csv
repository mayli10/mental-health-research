They really are insane; talking about this keeps reminding me of more examples.  When my sister came home from a long trip and had gained a bit of weight, but was still a perfectly healthy BMI and looking great, my mom and aunt teamed up to get her a personal trainer and dieting-help without her having asked for it at all. It's years later and my sister still brings it up because the shock hasn't worn off.",False,False

One night I confessed to my mom that I was down to about 500 calories a day and she said ""that's not necessarily unhealthy, I eat about that much when I'm dieting"" completely straight faced. That generation was wild!",False,True

I was hanging out with a married couple of friends, and the guy grabbed a couple of crackers before our planned 1-hour walk and then lunch, and the wife started making comments and asking ""Do you really need that?"" until he put them back. Made me really sad. It seems a lot more accepted when it's aimed at a guy, whether the comment is from a friend or a wife/gf, but it's not like he automatically won't care just because he has a penis.  I think when it comes to parents, it's sort of generational too. My parents are in their early 60s and wouldn't spot the difference between a diet and an ED if their lives depended on it. My mom told me I was at a good weight at a slim/healthy BMI, but that two more kilos off would be ""absolute perfection."" When I then lost more than that she got all shocked Pikachu on me.",False,False

My girlfriend is a trans woman and was raised as a guy, so I asked her and she said it's more normal for guys to rip people for weight/food, but I still don't get how you do that to your own fucking daughter. I can't wait to move again.",False,True

Sometimes I just don't get people. I would never, ever say something like that, like not even to my worst enemy. I can be unkind if I'm angry, but there is no person on earth I wouldn't give a tampon to in an emergency, and no person who's weight or food I would comment on.",False,False

I ordered a double cheeseburger at a restaurant instead of a single after I hadn't eaten for three days and my dad said to a table of like 6 other people, ""Oh, she eats so healthy, doesn't she."" I was so humiliated and I just wanted to cry. He's been like this since I was a little girl :(  Thank God my girlfriend is living here with me and I'm not alone, I don't know what I'd do if I was just living with my parents and not her. I'm very lucky to have her. I know the situation will get better, but it's hard right now and my ED brain likes to guilt me and make me find reasons to not eat or spend money on food.  I just looked it up and apparently it isn't available in my country :( oh no, thank you so much for recommending it!",False,True

Even though money is tight, you deserve to eat and be healthy. You wouldn't starve your gf to save money, and she wouldn't want you to starve to save money either. Everything is temporary, and so is this situation. Soon you'll be out of their house again and living with your gf, who sounds really sweet and understanding.  In the meantime, have you tried the TooGoodToGo app? Restaurants and cafes let you know when/where to come pick up perfectly good food that they're otherwise gonna throw out. You can get delicious meals super cheap.",False,False
