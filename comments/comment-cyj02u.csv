Now it lasts 5 days max and the heaviest flow it's no big deal if I forget to change my pad bc it wont bleed through.  But, it is reversible! It takes eating more and getting more nutrition but you can get it back",False,False

It’s all a bit of a blur now, but I remember losing my period, and I remember that one day, I raised my arms above my head and fainted - like, fell down, lucky I didn’t hit my head and sustain a brain injury -fainted.   I ended up needing to be hospitalized for six months, because I just couldn’t bring myself to eat.  Not eating felt like such a feat of control, but then I couldn’t pull myself out of it, even when I started getting really scared (I actually asked to go to he hospital - my champion parents were in denial about how sick I was, and I was terrified).   I ended up having an epiphany, where I realized I’d rather be “fat” than be dead.  I’ve had relapses since, but overall, I’m really glad I got help.",False,False
