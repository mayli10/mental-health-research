Iâ€™d line an amazon box or a drawer with those mini garbage bags and throw up in that and then hide it under my bed until i could toss it in the large dumpster outside,False,False

So then I did it in plastic bags but kept them on this high ceiling thing in my room that needed a small ladder to reach and when I would go for runs Iâ€™d go get them and put them in a string backpack/sac and throw them away in businessâ€™ giant trash cans.   We become geniuses when we want something bad enough.",False,False

It's a good one",False,False
