I'm pretty up front about my ED, and I kind of have a ""well, this is how I am, so you can take it or leave it"" approach. Some people leave. A lot of people leave. Some people figure out ways to encourage and support me but understand my eating habits and do not pressure me to eat things I don't want to or make unnecessary comments. I love these people, they deserve the world.   But that being said, I usually eat one meal a day, so I kind of make it work with partners in that they accept that I don't eat anything all day, then we share a meal together in the evening. So it kind of works out. Not everyone shares these same eating habits. It's all about finding what works for you and finding someone that is open and accepting of you.   I hope it works out with your new guy :)",False,False

However he was very understanding and we couldnt be together if he wasn’t. Im glad we talked about it, because I helped him realize that forcing me to eat isnt helping; rather, doing things like encouraging me to take a variety of foods or try a little dessert when I am in the mood to eat is helpful. What also helped however is not telling him much of my food insecurities when i have them; ill mention it like “im not having a big appetite day” or “i was able to discuss the food stuff with the therapist”.   Honestly it sounds like he is pretty attentive but also trying to get you to admit that you have some issue, perhaps because he thinks you’re in denial or thats the best way to deal with it.   If you see this being long term I would wait until he makes a comment like that between the two of you and then bring it up and say something like “i know you mean well and im happy that youre caring but right now the comments arent helping/im working on this on my own/im not at the point of talking about it”. Also reassuring him with ways he can help, like focusing on fun activities can help too.",False,False

It sounds like he’s sharp on EDs in particular- I really wouldn’t be surprised if he himself or someone else he cares about has had issues with it in the past. It’s very likely he knows the path you’re on and how fucking exhausting it is for those who love you.   Which means shutting him down about eating/not eating comments are going to translate as “I’m choosing my disorder over you”. Which also means you’ll probably end up having to discuss and address the disorder itself.   And that’d be the only “good” way to do it. Tell him you’re dealing with eating issues and comments like that done in that way just upset you. From what I’m gathering from your post, I wouldn’t be shocked if he’s the type to push for openness and honesty, meaning he’s going to try to get you to admit to him you have a problem and that you need to get help and get better.   Granted, I’m going off of my own gut feeling because this guys way of pointing these things out reads very similar to how non-SO was. He was highly perceptive and took zero bullshit. He had put up with it in the past and wasn’t willing to deal with watching someone else destroy themselves. To him, lying was lying. It was open up or fuck off, basically.   That’s the fun of EDs and relationships. One is going to ruin the other. So discuss it blatantly or try to maneuver around it by stating it simply as upsetting you and then having the topic dropped. Either way, stuff is going to need to come to light for things to work.",False,False

I would just say you’re a picky eater, or funny with food and that you don’t really like it being commented on, it makes you self conscious. lots of people have some little thing like that about them which they don’t like being pointed out.  eventually the comments might wear you down, or get between the two of you. I really hope not, if this guy just has the best intentions and your relationship is going well. If the two of you “get” each other, it shouldn’t be an issue. but for me, pointing out any food related habit or anything constantly is enough to get me to hate someone 🙃",False,False
