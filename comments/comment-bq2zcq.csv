Not all his flaws and bad habits and other things that make him imperfect.  You are SO right and this is such a wonderful insight to know you have. People's social media accounts are highly curated because they kind of have to be - he needs to give the people what they want, and that only gives you a one-dimensional view of his life. I'm really glad you took the time to respond to me because I feel really confident now that you'll have a good experience meeting him. You should definitely still get to meet your idols! And it's not bad to let yourself experience and enjoy infatuation if you keep yourself in check, too.   And lol, yeah just stick to garage band dudes ;) all the hot grunge without the drama.",False,False

He also lives on the east cost and I live on the west. So many reasons it wouldn’t work. Plus I don’t REALLY know him. I only see the side he wants to present to the world. Not all his flaws and bad habits and other things that make him imperfect. I don’t have any friends to bring with me but I’ll screen shot this one too and write a reality check on an index card to look at if we kick it and I feel myself obsessing. Thanks for all the advice. Gonna stick to band dudes who’s music I don’t like.,False,True

You are so enamoured with this artist and you think they're perfect and amazing and that's a lot of pressure to put on a partner. You shouldn't WANT him to reciprocate if you do meet because that just means he's willing to take advantage of someone's infatuation, especially if he's older and more experienced than you.   If you do meet him, I would recommend you take a friend who can make sure you don't take this to extremes. I'm glad my older message was helpful and I think your idea of screenshotting it to return to it is a good one. I really don't want to see you get hurt, and it's so easy to get caught up in such intense, convincing emotions.",False,False

And yeah it’ll hurt if I get rejection but I might as well try cuz you never know-I mean fuck it right.  I know there’s an imbalance of power but who knows. And yeah I know everything else you said is probably right though. Gonna screen shot it and come back to it when I need a reality check.",False,True

If I have the right musician, then it looks like he's already possibly seeing someone, based on one of his Insta posts?  It does sound like the way he's talking about you is only as a friend or a fan. Someone with a platform as big as his has to be careful about what he says, not wanting to lead you on but also not wanting to jilt you so that you speak poorly of him. As nice as it feels to daydream, I think you're setting yourself up for disappointment by hoping that something might happen between you two, that you could get him alone, etc.  You have to understand that a relationship like this is massively imbalanced. He gets lots of people messaging him, and he feels pressured to respond to them all, while you only get messages from him and place a lot of importance on them. They are going to feel much more personal and meaningful to you than he has the capability for.  Can I ask how old you are? You should still go and hang out with him, but you shouldn't expect or wish (as hard as that is) that anything will happen with him, because if you do you're setting yourself up for disappointment and the fall from that would be devastating. I especially worry that you will perceive any ""rejection"" from him as a reflection on your weight when it will have no connection whatsoever, he just can't reciprocate such an imbalance of power and idolisation.",False,False
