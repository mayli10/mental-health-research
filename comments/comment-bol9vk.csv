Sometimes we need to be shown how somebody else loves us, to slowly start imitating and trying it ourselves.  EDs are diseases of self-hatred and depression. At least speaking for myself, my husband has been my biggest rock. I need to remind myself that I am loved, and maybe I can start doing that to myself as well.  I don’t like looking back at the photos of the day we eloped. I think my outfit and body look absolutely horrible in it. But the thing is, the joy of the day is helping me to psychologically overcome that sentiment. I still regret my outfit, but fuck it, we were eloping! Fuck the outfits, I was marrying the love of my life.  (P.s. when we eventually become “official” and parents pushed for a traditional ceremony, I was in a deep &amp; dark place in my ED. I was barely eating anything. I knew I was a little bit skinny, but I loved it, and I wanted to fit into my dress perfectly. I now look back at those photos, and they make my heart sink more than anything else. I looked so sickly on a day that was meant to be one of the biggest days in my life. Like, I looked AWFUL. My arms look like twigs, and I can barely look at those photos without feeling a wave of sadness. I’m actually tempted to re-do some photos.)  Don’t let the ED control you. You’re taking control of one aspect of your life by eloping, so you can do this. ;)  Again, congratulations, and tell body dysmorphia to go fuck itself.  (Sorry for all the F-bombs, but EDs make me very sad and angry.)",False,False
