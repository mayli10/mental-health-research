Sure. OMAD? Fine until it triggered a binge. I want to go back but I don't know that I can!,False,False

That's why it works. Plus overweight people often have more waterweight to loose in the beginning.,False,False

I never meant that IF was meant to be an ED behavior i Just mean that IF doesn't seem to be working for someone who low restricts, and doesn't eat much in the first place. It seems easy to me personally and maybe to others with ED who restrict and fast a lot more than just 16:8. It just amazes me how normal people lose so much weight with IF.",False,True

Because 16 hours was too easy, I started 18/6. Then that felt toooo easy, still. I did that on a daily basis. Then I went OMAD and then it triggered my BED and that's when I started fucking up. I think that the reason why a lot of people (non disordered) lose that much weight on IF is because by eating in a ""short"" window they cut drastically the calories. That's all, IMO.",False,False
