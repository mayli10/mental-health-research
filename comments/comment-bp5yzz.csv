Frankly I deserve it because I'm pretty much an ugly far mess. No men ever want me and I'm a garbage person I wish I was dead. Seriously what's the point when i get rejected at every turn. I am so fat and gross it was a miracle any guy could get turned on by me anyway. He was probably embarrassed of me bc I'm pretty hideous.,False,True

Was it your first time being intimate with him that that happened or were you guys pretty comfortable? Definitely spare him the details of everything and don‚Äôt worry that he didn‚Äôt call you this weekend. Father‚Äôs Day weekend is kind of a crazy one to pin people down. as far as talking too much/too little you should take his lead and do just a touch less. Like if he texts you 10 times a day then you text 8 or whatever.,False,False

Although things are going well I'm basically trying to prepare myself for being ghosted at any time. He didnt try to make plans with me this weekend and I havent heard from him since Thursday and its Sunday night. Last time I saw him I bled all over his sheets during sex. That was Tuesday. I'm anxious about it but its probably fine. He knows I have a gyno appointment tomorrow but maybe this is just too much for him? Or maybe hes just busy? I dont know. I've never been in a reciprocal relationship before so I dont know how much contact is too much and how little contact is normal. I so dont know how to date. He did meet two of my friends the last time we hung out which is promising though.,False,True

I told myself I'd try dating again when I was 145 but I'm soo much bigger than that.  I dont hold out much hope for myself for being thin ever again.,False,True
