I almost never go on here anymore now that I am committed to getting better. Everyone on here is so supportive but I feel like a lot of the posts trigger disordered habits for me so I just personally tend to avoid coming on here. After all, my main goal is to not think about food and exercise all the time. Regularly visiting this sub would be an unhealthy constant reminder for me. I wish you all the best!",False,False
