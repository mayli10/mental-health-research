He's been working a lot recently so been tired, and I understand that he's not in the mood and just wants to cuddle. But I also have that stupid ass part of my brain that goes ""yeah see? He said no already 4 times, you know why? Because he's not attracted to you anymore"". Irony? We got together when I was 20kg heavier so I know its definitely got nothing to do with my weight. My ED however has it's own thoughts on the case. I've recently been progressively getting more depressed/anxious too, so that along with ED is increasingly making it hard for me to enjoy sex. Joys. All I wanted was to lose some weight to look better and enjoy it more, instead it's like I've swapped looks for joy. Except that I dont have either.",False,False

I only really like dinner dates if it's before one of us has to leave because I feel so gross doing anything after eating.  My go to is to go out for drinks.

I don't think I've hugged or even really touched anyone for at least four years (other than shaking hands which doesn't really count, but I'm going to take it).
