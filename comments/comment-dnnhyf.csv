Whenever i am REALLY craving  t h e s w e e t n e s s i just have a hard candy or a lollipop. They are sweet and last pretty long bc u cant chew them (and if u will u will ruin ur teeth) so they do kinda statisfy,False,False

I normally will have a sweet/dessert-flavored protein bar as a lunch to get the sugar and chocolate cravings taken care of while feeling a little better about nutrients. Not perfect, but it's helped me a lot!",False,False

While CICO applies and a person could eat his or her entire TDEE in chocolate, ideally you want to form good, sustainable dietary habits for when you return to a normal intake.  What do you like? I live with family so what I eat is kinda boring since I don't have the luxury of privacy to meticulously prepare my food, lol, so I try to get my sources of protein in ways that are easy, accessible to me, and that I know I like.  Eggs are around 80 calories each and there are so many ways you can have them. One of my favorite ways to have them is scrambled and served with a tbsp of queso for each egg (100 calories total, i usually have 400 calories worth unless i have it with some else-- like a piece of toast with butter-- then I'll just have 2 eggs). Another favorite breakfast of mine is 3 slices of crispbread (20 calories each, 60 total) with 2 tbsps miracle whip drizzled across the 3 crackers (100 calories), and then a sliced hard boiled egg on each cracker (3 eggs is around 240 calories), and then seasoned with salt/pepper and paprika, for a total of around 400 calories.  A can of tuna fish is 90 calories, 20g protein. I know some people add less or think mayo is gross altogether, but i like to add 3 tbsps of miracle whip (150 calories). 2 slices of whole wheat bread should be around 200 calories and have around 10 grams of protein. Altogether, that's a basic tuna salad sandwich, and pretty normal thing people eat for lunch, around 440 calories.  If leftover calories stress you out, what are some go-to snacks you enjoy? For protein, i like string cheese cut into 6 even pieces and wrapped in 6 slices of turkey lunch meat (about 160 calories for both the string cheese and turkey). A cup of plain greek yogurt is 120 calories. I like to eat greek yogurt with a sliced banana (also around 120 calories, 240 total). If i have granola or a ""healthy"" cereal , I'll have some with it, too. Sometimes a tbsp of honey (it honestly goes a long way if you drizzle it rather than stir it in, and is the only way i have honey that i feel is worth it)  If i had any other advice, it would be to plan to allow yourself a treat-- at the end of the day. You'll have something to look forward to and the security of knowing you can still have sweets. You don't want to feel like you're depriving yourself from enjoying food, but you don't want to literally deprive and malnourish yourself by only eating sweets, either.",False,False

Probably you already know it, but since you're malnourished, it's most likely that you will get sweet cravings, like chocolate. That's the way your body will tell you it's lacking in certain nutrients. I've once read that getting potassium (do you like bananas? They have a lot of it!) and magnesium could help to reduce the urges.   But above all, please don't over push yourself! &lt;3  I have those cravings too, and eating more fruits and veggies (the holy macros!) had helped me a lot. Hope this can be useful, even a little bit ^^",False,False
