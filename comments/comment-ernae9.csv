Her legs and waist are sooo perfect. I fought her as my bias for so long (cycling through all the other BP girls first) then I finally had to accept that the reason I wanted to not like her was because I was jealous of how perfect she is. So, here I am, accepting that Rose is my ultimate (among ggs).",False,False

I allow myself stuff like Secret Eaters, Superfat v Superskinny, and the like (ya bitch needs to get that catharsis of relatability). I've got this rule for myself in *part* because I think it'd be bad for me, but it's mostly because those videos annoy the hell out of me because of how fucking *stu*pid the people making them can be sometimes.  I broke the rule let myself watch one titled ""[Idol]'s weight loss!"" and it was, I swear to god, 25 minutes of different photos and fancams and interviews and public appearances that this person analyzed to try and estimate what the poor girl's BMI was in every single last one, calculating her average BMI for each era, each leg of each tour, each off-season(?) etc. etc. It was some impressive-ass dedication, but it creeped me the fuuuuuuuck out, ngl.  And then she ended the video by saying this (and this is a verbatim goddamn quote; I went back and re-watched the ""conclusion"" to make sure I could use her actual words):   &gt;""Well, there haven't been any leaks as to whether [Group] follows one of those infamous 'k-pop' diets, and every piece of behind-the-scenes content that they eat food in shows them eating normal amounts or *huge* amounts of food, so, as far as I can tell, [Idol] loses weight cause she dances a lot and probably has a fast metabolism.""   I swear to god I have never laughed harder at a YouTube video before lmao. After I saw that for the first time I checked out like two or three other ones and skipped to the end and every last one of them said dumb shit like that lol so I've got no real reason to want to watch them anymore.  I'm really really sorry that you struggle with watching that kind of content, though. Back when my ED first blossomed from a sprout of body dysmorphia into the pernicious, miserable weed that it is today, I would spend just about every second of free time of every single day watching weight loss and proana shit. It's fucking rough, I've been there, and I feel you. If you want any advice with trying to cut that stuff out, please DM me and I'll try and help.",False,True
