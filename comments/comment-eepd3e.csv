As a musician, artist, and creator myself, who has been struggling with AN for nearly 2 decades, I am concerned about this and the effect it's having on people currently struggling with an ED.   Not trying to preach, just thought I could offer another approach to the situation for any support people who might be reading this. I think people undervalue the role of a healthy support system with ED prevention and recovery.  Also, what comes of to you as disordered? Genuinely curious, as I do have AN and am struggling a lot right now with disordered thoughts. But it's also possible that you have misunderstood me or I did not explain myself well enough (was trying to keep it short).  I'm always open to discussion and would love to hear your thoughts.",False,True

Especially coming from someone with diagnosed AN?   I do see that people attack overweight celebrities as well especially on social media, but I've never seen a petition signed to remove them from those platforms.    A recent petition of this type received 18000 signatures.   I truly believe that creators, artists, musicians, and performers struggling with an illness that are not glorifying eating disorders or actively encouraging their admirers to look, think, act, or eat like them have every right to continue creating and sharing their art and passion with the world.  Outright censorship of these people is harmful to the ED community and society as a whole.",False,True
