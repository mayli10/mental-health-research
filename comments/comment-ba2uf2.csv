I think it's only really noticeable because I'm looking for it in detail on my own body though, and lots of people who have never been overweight have them!",False,False

I was talking to one of my friends about feeling miserable about stretch marks and she just said that I should be miserable because of the world we live in and how our bodies have to be so perfect, and that made me feel a little better.  I just hope it stays like this and I won’t get a lot more than that",False,True

I have them and I’ve never been overweight. The best thing you can do to minimize their appearance is take care of your skin. There are moisturizers that can help minimize their appearance, make sure to use sun screen while outside, and with time they will fade. Everyone has marks on their skin - don’t let it get you too down. ",False,False

My stretch mark isn’t so visible because it’s really light, but I’m afraid I’ll get more because I literally have no control. And my five are near so I thought I’d just eat whatever I wanted, hide behind large clothes, and get the perfect summer body after the finals.   Stretch marks didn’t even come across my mind. Now I’m more than horrified",False,True

Any product that promises to make them go away 100% is a rip off. I looked like a zebra after I had my son because I was near my lw when I got pregnant and vitamin e oil/cream has been the best over the counter solution for me and my pale pale skin. Also the tanner and more moisturized my skin is, the less noticeable it is. ",False,False

I got some at age 11, now I'm 22 and they're honestly so faded I can't tell where they are. I have to feel for them!  Mine went from a red pink, to a light purple, to silver, to white, to basically my skin colour with some texture.",False,False
