I'm sorry you've been dealing with this for so long. Your situation is definitely more nuanced than I know how to help with. Obviously the most I can do is give advice but I genuinely dont know any advice to give for this. I hope you can find someone out there who can give good advice.  Best of luck &lt;3,False,False

I have a chronic illness, so I'm obsessed with eating an ""anti-inflammatory"" sugar-free, whole foods, plant-based diet with a ton of restrictions. My habits look exceptionally healthy on paper (especially now that I'm inadvertently maintaining), which is kind of a mindfuck because I get a lot of praise for being ""healthy"" and ""fit."" Little does anyone know that I have *so much* guilt and anxiety fueling my workouts and constant calculations in the back of my head.  Two years ago (at this same weight, though I tried ""recovery"" for a year in between then and now), I was surviving on about 800 calories a day and my hunger was not this intense. I know you are right, and I tell myself the same thing constantly: if you want to lose weight, just fucking eat less! It's not rocket science! I guess I'm just complaining because sometimes my appetite is manageable and I feel totally in control... other times, I feel horrible despair.  Idk, maybe I'm just mentally exhausted. I have literally tracked every single GRAM of food I've eaten for 8 months. I cook all my meals at home and don't eat anything prepared by anyone else. I don't want to change, but also, I don't think I can live this way forever? Gah. Sorry for the rant and thank you for listening.",False,True

Obviously, you're on an ed sub so you probably dont want to hear this: you dont need to lose more weight. If you want to lose more weight you will have to lower your intake. But I'd say the most important thing is to have proper nutrition!!! I just eat small amounts 2-3 times a day. Usually my intake is at a net -700 if I workout. I rarely feel hunger and when I do, I eat something v small and wait 20 to 30 minutes to assess my hunger again. To people on the outside, I look like a normal eater, but if they tracked my calories, they would see that it's usually sub 1100, and I usually burn 2100. Anyways, I think your eating would balance out a bit if you tried to stabilize how often you ate. I hope you can work through this. Also, for burning calories, weights (heavy weights) burns caloriesquicker, so changing up what kind of workouts you do may help you see faster results and get more toned in the process.  I hope I didnt say anything upsetting or harmful for you. I wish you the best &lt;3",False,False
