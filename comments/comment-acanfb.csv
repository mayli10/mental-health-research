Was doing 8:16 and then naturally went OMAD instead. It is amazing. Im not constantly thinking about food because i typically plan out what to eat the day befor and I always eat at night. It has made me so much more focused on everything except food. And its a really satisfying meal because i can eat a high volume dinner without it being an uncontrollable binge. Aaaand i dont feel bloated and am losing weight while high restricting. Try it out, the best thing ive ever done :)",False,False

I have miso broth (non vegans do bone broth) or arugula salad to break my fast when I think breaking the fast isn't going to sit well with my body. I usually have it while I'm making my meal (I started with 16:8 and now I do omad).,False,False

Then a 3 day fast which sucked and I decided is not my jam. Now I OMAD and lemme tell you, OMAD is life. I tell myself I‚Äôm eating once a day and I don‚Äôt have random ‚Äúsnacks‚Äù that hike up my count I don‚Äôt have the urge to eat outside of my one meal. And that meal gets to be a solid real people meal! Even at lower calorie counts, it‚Äôs real people food. My OMAD is at night so added bonus of fasted cardio and every day is a 22ish hour fast! It works flexibly too if my friend wants to have lunch, that‚Äôs my OMAD and the next day I go back to my normal time. ",False,False

I've been working on recovery for like 8 years and started this 2 months ago. IF is the only thing that's worked for me for this long. Ya'll I LOST a half pound on the week of Christmas.

My bf is really great, but I can tell it makes him nervous. ",False,False

I save money cause I don't buy food while at work and less of my food at home goes bad because I only eat there.
