Having experienced homophobia it just seems different and less innate in a lot of cases. Maybe that’s just my own internalized feelings though. Regardless, I’ve noticed the difference in treatment drastically especially lately and it has me very frustrated.   I feel as though people don’t understand what this disorder is like or how hard it is for me. I just wanna quit this whole disorder honestly. Everyone I’ve seen who has this disorder after another has always said it’s the worst to have. But on my body it’s the least severe so...",False,True

It's just as dangerous as other EDs and should be treated as such. People think that fatshaming someone for binging will motivate them to stop, but that's like saying that shaming someone with bulimia or anorexia will get them to stop. Shame just continues the cycle. EDs are an addiction and need to be treated as such, the problem lies in the lack of control and support the person feels, no one would choose this.",False,False
