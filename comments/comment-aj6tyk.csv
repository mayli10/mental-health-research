Have you ever looked into contouring? Iâ€™ve learned how to create the illusion of a much slimmer face this way.  I am so glad I got my nose &amp; boobs done! Even when the rest of my body disappoints me, my fake tits never do. I started out with deflated C/Ds &amp; went pretty big, but I know a few small-breasted women who went to skilled surgeons &amp; got conservative, natural looking implants.   And getting my nose done did wonders for my confidence; I refused to smile in photos prior to my surgery (or really even be photographed at all), but then developed the confidence to do a bit of modeling. Good luck with your consultation!",False,False

I have zero face definition and when I stand next to someone obviously heavier than me but whose face looks skinnier, I really wonder whatâ€™s the point. :â€™)   Also have tiny boobs and hate my nose. Planning on a nose job too this year and while Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ll like it better, part of me is scared it wonâ€™t make me any happier... idk sorry for being a downer but Iâ€™m like, are you me?? Haha.
