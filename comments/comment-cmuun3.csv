With all my heart I hope you enjoy it. Sweet 16. You are beautiful just the way you are. And you definitely deserve to celebrate this day that is all yours. you made it to this day and I wish you so much more bdays.   I wish I could give you the present of one day eating without regret. Being without shame and guilt and worry. But you are the only one whom can give that precious gift to you.    I will just give you this reminder that enjoying this one day won't change your appearance really. And logically you must know I am right.. If you want you should eat your cake. Or drink that drink you like. Or dress up like you are the master of party.    You are not alone in all these feelings you are feeling. 5 years is a pretty long time to be struggling, but it really is not a guarantee that your next birthday you will even think about posting here. &lt;3 a lot can happen and you are not beyond help or recovery!    Wishing you a beautiful day!",False,False
