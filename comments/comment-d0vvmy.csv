I just take a shower instead of wallowing in what I have to do, enjoy my face masks and bubbles and jellies, and it washes the knots away. Plus it’s a nice, busy distraction away from whatever was in your focus. As a bonus, you’ve just practiced self love and self care AND you’re clean and smelling fresh. I’ve taken to even taking multiple showers a day because of it.",False,False

Meds can help if you have really extreme stress too.,False,False
