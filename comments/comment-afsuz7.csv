If you can't afford that, and you have a little time to do so, volunteer at a food pantry or shelter to pass out food. It may help with your guilt if you know you are actively correcting what you feel guilty about.",False,False

I notice how mean and nasty I am the deeper I get into my ED and I don‚Äôt like being that way. So in that sense the guilt is sometimes useful because it pushes me to eat for the sake of others ",False,True

There was nothing as painful and humiliating and shameful to me than having my older sister say, ""We're worried about you."" I don't deserve your worry! I want your love and to spend time with you, but I never want to be a negative on anyone's mind. I don't want to die, but I just want to disappear and bother no one, and here I am, trying to disappear and it's causing even more trouble!",False,False

The amount of compassion and worry my family shows me just makes me feel EVEN MORE horrible. Because technically this is something I could control and ‚Äústop any time‚Äù (easier said than done, like an addiction almost) but I feel so bad when they treat this like something completely out of my control, like I‚Äôm a victim of this illness rather than a co-contributor.

The majority of my budget goes to groceries.

Her daughter is dying. Of terminal cancer. And she came to see me because I can't eat.
