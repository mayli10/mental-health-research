I made some sickness tea (specifically for being sick, don’t know the name off the back of my hand) and put a tbsp of honey. It’s helping but I have to keep honey around me to help soothe my throat. Definitely buying some soup or making some. :)",False,True

Soup (if you check my post history there’s a recipe in there from a couple weeks ago when I was sick. Easy to make and low cal).  Scrambled eggs or egg drop soup (heat broth on the stove and whisk in an egg).  Juice shots (any kind with ginger.)  Smoothies made with real fresh/frozen fruit and ginger.  ...ginger lol,False,False

Otherwise, soups are always helpful to me while sick. Any warm &amp; soft foods, really. Gargling (not drinking!) saltwater may help as well.  When sick, any tea without caffeine is good &amp; honey is super soothing for the throat, so use as much as you'd like!  Most importantly, rest as much as possible.",False,False
