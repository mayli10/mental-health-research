And I can't help but wonder if part of the reason I love watching him do that is because of my own fantasies for myself or perhaps even living vicariously in the moment.  Like don't get me wrong, if he started bingeing again, I don't think I would enjoy watching that..but watching him eat 1000+ Cals freely in one meal without feeling the urge to binge or purge honestly brings me so much delight.  And like, I've always known I've liked more muscular guys in general, but I think I enjoy the extra fluff he has on his body when he's bulking more than the shredded look he has when cutting, and I didn't know that was a thing for me before I started dating him.  But of course, I genuinely think he's gorgeous no matter what state his body is in.",False,False
