We bred a lot of them to have a very high food drive to make them easier to train and you end up with a lot of labs that are hungry all the time and even resorting to eating non-food items. 3/4 labs I see are obese.   Definitely go to your vet and ask if you’re worried though. They will probably delighted at your lean boy and give you reassurance that what you need.",False,False

I wouldn’t feel bad because by the sounds of it you don’t actually know if you’re under feeding him or at least didn’t at the time. If you don’t follow the vet’s advice *then* that’s not a good thing to do, but until then you’re not a bad person",False,False
