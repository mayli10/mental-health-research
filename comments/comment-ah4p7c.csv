I spent a really long time counting and restricting calories, like, really long. I'm doing a lot better lately, been recovering for like 7 months or so. The way I think when the ED is dominating vs when I'm in charge is very different. Keep in mind I'm an active 6' 1"" male so all my calorie numbers are going to be about double what you guys are used to.  &amp;#x200B;  Ed:  * Agonizes over the number of meals/snacks I eat and tries to delay eating as much as possible, always trying to ignore physical hunger until I want to die. * Worries excessively about the calories in condiments, sauces, coffee creamers, etc. Some get eliminated, most just get weighed, counted, and usually overestimated * Rounds all the calorie counts up, resulting in a lot of overestimation * Anything over about 150-200 calories is off-limits for a snack * Anything over about 500 calories is off-limits for a meal * Overly focused on taking in as much protein and fiber as possible, and eliminating all sources of fat * Any kind of treats, even ""healthy"" or low-calorie ones are off-limits * Any day over about 2500 calories is sketchy and probably justifies forced intermittent fasting the next day, even though that's way under my TDEE most days * Thinks that if I eat a slice of cake, I will instantly gain fat, then spiral out of control, leading to more fat gain  Me:  * If I'm hungry, I should eat ASAP. When in doubt, eat. * When in doubt, I probably need more calories since I'm trying to gain strength and restriction is counter to my goals * Understands a certain amount of dietary fat is essential to hormonal health and physical satiety from food * Even if I overeat today, my body will tell me I overdid it by feeling less hungry tomorrow and it's no big deal * Smash a 300 calorie pint of Enlightened just cause? Why not? It's only 300. * Everything in my history has shown that even eating 4-5000 calories in a day and smashing a bunch of high calorie foods doesn't do anything negative to my physique or weight, even in the short term  Literally couldn't be any more different.  &amp;#x200B;",False,False
