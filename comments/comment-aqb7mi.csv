I'm gonna split it and have 1/4-1/2 (depends how yummy) and OMAD it! Thank you so much. You saved me from a mental breakdown fr.  Now to plan out the next day ugh....my bf's family is having a get-together and it's potluck style.  It's shaping up to be yet another maintenance day lmao :))))))  You're a lifesaver &lt;3 ,False,True

This is for the entire portion on the plate, so divide accordingly. You're on EDAnon, so I  know you're a pro at estimating portions and fractions lol  Molten Cookie  500c (flour, sugar, and butter are all calorie dense and make up about 400 of that. the truffle or whatever other chocolate they're putting inside is probably another 100-120)   Belgian waffle - 300c (mostly flour. honestly - i'd try to focus on this lol)  Cookie dough bits -  a one tablespoon sized ball/bit is probably around 100c (basically sugar, flour, and butter with chocolate chips in it, but no eggs or baking powder. a tablespoon is about the size used to make a regular cookie - so basically the same calorie content)  Brownie bits - a one inch by once inch sized square is probably about 120c. flour, sugar, and butter are the main ingredients again, with the addition of egg since this is actually baked, unlike the cookie dough. there is also cocoa powder in this, but it is pretty low cal. if this has chocolate chips in it, add like 20c per square.  Cookie dough ice cream - probably a 3/4 cup scoop. about 420c. - non halo top ice cream is usually made with cream so that's why it's so calorie dense.  Milk chocolate drizzle - probably about 120c if you get every last drop on that plate.   **If you ate everything shown on that plate, you're probably looking at 1,580 calories. So if you split it with your boo and eat like 30%, it's not quite as bad as it looks! Don't panic, enjoy, and have fun with your man!**  Granted, professional kitchens go wild on sauces, but the basic proportions of cookies, brownies, and waffles can't change much or they won't bake well. I feel pretty confident on the calorie counts on those. Hope this helps!",False,False

Reminds me that it’s ok. Plus you can just share off the same plate and take smaller bites.,False,False

Do the good ol fork dip for flavour without too many extra calories,False,False
