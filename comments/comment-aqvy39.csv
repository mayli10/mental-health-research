I kind of do the same thing.  I work 2nd and 3rd shift mostly. The hospital I work at has their cafeteria in a different building and it closes in the late afternoon. There is also only two of us in the lab so a.) it is hard to leave to get food. B.) almost as impossible to even take your meal break.  I feel weird cooking at home and painstakingly weighing my food in the presenance of my 5 housemates. They're mostly male and could probably careless but I am like a cockroach. The instant someone else enters the kitchen, I scurry away. I have such aniexty with people seeing me eat.  I too love fast food because it is standardized and the calorie counts are so easy to look up. If I don't eat at home before my shift, I keep saying ""I will grab something on my way to work"". Except my GPS takes me on routes where I pass by jack shit or stuff is just closed.  So I have been OMAD of black coffee and whatever protein bars 7/11 or wawa has. ",False,False

I just feel really constructed and judged if I eat a meal I ordered at a restaurant IN the restaurant, so I always take it to go and eat it at the park. Itâ€™s ridiculous, but I also love this routine.   Last weekend I was gonna get one of my favourite smoothie bowls and eat it at the park with my SO, and right before we left to go pick it up, it started SNOWING. Like, REALLY snowing. Can-barely-see-three-inches-in-front-of-my-face snowing.   Suffice it to say, I had a panic attack and spiralled into a full on breakdown. Like, really universe? You gotta play me like that?
