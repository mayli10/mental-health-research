I would eat sweet bread that my dad brought home all the damn time and be hungry like, 20 minutes later but id have to skip eating because I already ate all my calories for the day ðŸ™ƒ  One thing I can suggest is to pack up some safe food? Like, oatmeal packets for breakfast, maybe a couple extra for late night hunger, granola bars (if you like), rice cakes, anything that you consider safe and is packaged so it wonâ€™t go bad? Let your teacher know that youâ€™ll be more comfortable if you bring them, Iâ€™m sure it wonâ€™t be a big deal :) ",False,False
