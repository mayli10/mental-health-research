Men tend to have larger frames and more muscle mass which contributes to a higher weight. I don’t know how to guess men’s weights accurately at all and I would assume the same is true for this guy with your weight!! Just because he guesses it wrong, doesn’t mean you look fatter than you weigh :)",False,False

Plenty of guys have guessed that I weigh around 105-110, and when I've corrected them (I weigh quite a lot less) they've been like ""HOW ARE YOU EVEN ALIVE?!""",False,False

A lot of people, ESPECIALLY guys, have no idea wha a number looks like on a person. Plus, males have different weight standards that females, so maybe 138 on his buddy looks pretty slim and you look slim too, so he just kinda guessed based on that.",False,False

Our fears make it hard to see ourselves objectively. That dude was off base.   Our brains have a negativity bias...basically we tend focus on the bad stuff and disregard the good stuff. I hope you won’t let this dude’s offhand comment steal the good from your evening.,False,False

Guessing weights or ages is really something I avoid being part of because no good can come of it.   Something that I’ve observed among some non-ED males is they are offended by people underestimating their weights (presumably because that means less muscle). It’s totally possible this dude inflated his guess in an attempt to not offend. Who knows.  Be safe. Wishing you the best in the new year.,False,False
