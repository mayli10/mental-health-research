Nuts have no stop point for some people.  Fruit for me is an appetite stimulant. It may be different for you.  I don't understand the thing with societal demonisation dairy. I think it was invented by vegans in conspiracy with people in paleo spaces who have an undiagnosed dairy allergy.  Skim milk, rice, potato, bread, pasta... Have it or don't. I don't have it very frequently, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't.  Stop listening to society's critiques of the foods you eat. It'll get you deeper into disordered eating.

Also, eggs will not clog your arteries, because they have the good cholesterol that you want!  Nuts have calories but they have a lot of healthy fats.  Fruit decidedly does not have too much sugar or carbs. Fruit is fibrous, so its carbs are digested a little differently. In addition, the sugar in fruit - fructose - is also digested differently than sucrose, and does not raise blood sugar levels as quickly as sucrose. Fructose is what I like to call a “good sugar.”  Rice, bread, and noodles are carbs, but they’re not empty. My boyfriend is a weight lifter and like half his diet is rice, because he likes it and it fits in his macros. Simple carbs are not necessarily *bad* for you.  Having recovered a year or two ago (haha what is recovery even), I like to tell myself that *all* food has good sides. All food is good for the body, or good for the soul, or both. All food gives you energy. Eggs? Protein! Bananas? Potassium, good carbs! Milk chocolate? Makes my period easier to deal with, and is quick energy!
