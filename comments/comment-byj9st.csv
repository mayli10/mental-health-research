I didn't notice until I was in public and realised it didn't look casual and I looked weird. Eating differently. Etc),False,False

And probably builds a stronger relationship if it lasts, because exercise releases endorphins! So your brain is like makin happy chemicals while you're around this person, and so is their's, so your brains would eventually associate each other with strong happiness!!",False,False

You have to plan in advance, the activity takes longer, and run the risk of ending up stuck in the woods with someone you donâ€™t want to be stuck in the woods with.  However, some people might enjoy all of these elements, as it definitely gives you more alone time and obviously takes more communication and admin than grabbing a coffee.  Iâ€™m definitely more of a lowkey gal, especially when Iâ€™m getting to know my date. I love black coffee (not even ED related) and as long as I have an idea on how to plan my day around the resturant Iâ€™m all good with more basic dating.  Plus what if my date is fitter than me and thinks Iâ€™m a heffalump lol.",False,False

But Iâ€™m so introverted and comfortable being awkwardly silent that everyone would weed me out very quickly if I didnâ€™t find environments where Iâ€™m more comfortable to get to know people lol  Very good point though. Long term, Iâ€™d def want to be with someone who I could have comfortable silence with. They just donâ€™t work really well too early for me. Also, comfortable silence comes much more naturally to most people while hiking than staring at each other across a table.",False,False

They're a great tool for weeding people out.  I'm a pretty mellow, introverted person, so a key part of figuring out if I connect with someone is how we handle those lulls in conversation. I only want friends/romantic partners who can appreciate quiet companionship. If the silences feel good, you get a second date. If not, we were never gonna truly click.",False,False

Doesn't matter the weather, the time of day, how many miles it is - nothing will stop me from walking.   If the date goes really well and the other person has a car and wants to come home with me and I accept the ride, it ruins the sex because I'm in such a bad mood about not walking home.",False,False
