Eventually I ended up in the ICU...several times. And various facilities, therapists, etc. I thought that once people grasped how much pain I was in, they would fix it...fix me. But it didn’t work that way. They could help me find the way, but I had to do the walking.

I was a drowning person on the cusp of slipping under who was almost too spent to grab the life preserver. I floated there for a long time...not living, just surviving - and sometimes barely that.    My life totally unraveled. I’m only just starting to weave a new one, in my 30s. I don’t want a do-over but if I could reach back and talk to that younger me I’d tell her that life doesn’t have to hurt so much for so long. That she was not weak, or a monster, or undeserving. That she was loved. That help that helps was out there and she deserved it right now.   I can’t tell her that. But I can tell you &lt;3",False,False
