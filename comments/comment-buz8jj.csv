Also, anytime I know heavy restriction or b/p wont be an option (with friends all day, etc) I will, for the whole week to two weeks before the event, mentally and out loud, each day, give myself permission to either eat at or above my TDEE or eat like everyone else is. That way when the day comes I'm not panicking about how much or what I'm eating because I've mentally coached myself over and over that today is different from other days. I think that's how (good) ED recovery works, but i only do it for short periods of time lol  Anyways I hope that helps a bit &lt;3",False,False
