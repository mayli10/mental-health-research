It can last a few months to be honest. But you're definitely not disgusting, you're a beautiful human being and you have a lot of value. You don't have to feel bad about giving your body what it needs to not die, for as long as it needs.",False,False

It's normal to experiment hunger after a long period of restricting. Your body is  telling you that it needs food to repair the damage, and that's why you're eating a little more. But it's definitely needed.   Your intuitive eating will adapt itself when your body is repaired, and you'll naturally eat at maintenance. You don't even have to worry about it. Even if not worrying is hard, believe in yourself ‚ô°",False,False

Sometimes I binged  sometimes I restricted but it just eventually kinda evened out to me just eating pretty normally everyday. I don‚Äôt follow a meal plan anymore and actually eat really well now, without much anxiety (most days it‚Äôs so autopilot I don‚Äôt think about it at all) It‚Äôs super hard though and I really hope it doesn‚Äôt come off preachy or recovery pushing or anything like that  it I don‚Äôt mean to at all like it actually really sucks and it‚Äôs scary and stressful and there‚Äôs a lot of times I was like fuck this I don‚Äôt care if rather have an eating disorder, but I feel a lot better in terms of food and body image than I used to.

After that i actually craved healthy somewhat ""normal"" foods and meals but nothing crazy. Also allowed myself a piece of vegan chocolate when i wanted some and i went a long time without binging after that tbh. Just make sure you take your time to eat. Actually sit down somewhere and wait like 10-20 minutes before you get another dinner just because you want one.
