Piglet sounds cuter than pig to me bc they’re so tiny and cute. You know those micro pigs??? It kinda seems like gentle teasing to me but I wasn’t there. I can also understand the feelings it brings up.   I find sometimes ppl just don’t understand what’s triggering for ppl with ED’s. Better to just not make comments at all.,False,False

I have another who will say it to me in arguments intentionally pulling at my ED to hurt me.,False,False
