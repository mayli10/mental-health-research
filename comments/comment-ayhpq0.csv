(Iron deficiency yadayada it’s true.)  BUT.   All I can think about after eating them (or any meat save for fish and crabs) is how they’re just sitting in my gut rotting. Probably some old wive’s tale I got told forever ago, but that shit sticks with you.  Doesn’t stop me from feeling disgusting after having a burger.  Can only think about this weird gross grey sludge moving through my intestines.   Silver lining: don’t eat very much red meat.  Didn’t care for it before but I’ve also found other sources of protein I love so much more. (Hello, sushi, hello tofu.)",False,False

I still eat it for convenience, but I’m a mad man and much prefer the healthy hippie food snake oil included. I wish I could go vegan but my family won’t let me",False,False

I want to eat so bad, for example something like chocolate cake, but I think of the texture of the cake, all flaky, and my stomach feels sick. When I get into a restrictive phase my brain can make every single food seem bad",False,False
