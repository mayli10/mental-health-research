I still buy everything in a medium or large, and size 6 or 8 pants. I don't even know what my pant size is now but I do fit in small and extra small. My jeans look horrible on me now and you'd think it would make me happy, but I'm scared to try on smaller pants so I'm just stuck in these.",False,False

I tried on my pants (fall is coming..... eventually...[sweats in Midwestern temps]) and only TWO pairs of pants fit me right now, the two tightest pairs I owned last winter, and even they both gap at the waist a little.  I'm hoping to recover from this relapse and fit back into my pants properly!",False,False

If they can be pulled off in a ""cute slouchy fashion"" way, then no. If they were meant to be form fitting and end up looking baggy in a not cute way, then... yeah.   I have a few items I have purchased while being at my highest weight. They actually look awesome at me and I know for a fact once I lose the weight, they won't be cute anymore. The bright side is that I have an entire storage tote of clothes waiting for me when I reach that weight so. I mean. It's bittersweet.",False,False
