But I only didn't weigh myself because it's the weekend and my family is at home and I couldn't do it without them knowing. They don't suspect I have an ED (at least not that I know of...) But they always make comments about it when they know that I have. Like, if you weight yourself more than like 1-2 times a year, you're weird.",False,False

I find that if I know I didn’t gain weight suddenly I’m willing to eat more so the weighing kind of helps but I want to get rid of the mindset all together. Small steps,False,True

It is actually very freeing and most days now I won’t even think about it because it’s outside of my routine. I do occasionally get the anxiety of not knowing what I weigh and so thinking that maybe I’ve doubled in size but I’ve found that if I just try and stay calm I can push through it. Congrats and good luck xxx ,False,False
