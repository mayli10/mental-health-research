You're experiencing relapses, which means that you might need to work further on the psychological part of your ED.   I personally consider that there are various stages in the process during recovery, and in the last step, which is the most difficult one, you are supposed to get rid of the ED mindset which dictates you that food will make your body look worse. It costs a lot, even for recovered anorexics, to reach this specific step, since body images issues don't disappear forever. An ED it's part of you.   Whether or not you **truly** want to get rid of it, it's part of your compromise to live happier around your friends and family who will surely support you.",False,False
