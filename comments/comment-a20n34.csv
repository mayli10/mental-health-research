In high school and early college, I was taking weekly vocal lessons and was actually pretty good. During the first couple years of my disorder, my purging habits really damaged my vocal chords, and that combined with being too nervous to sing properly again means I lost pretty much all of that training. I just wish I had my nice voice back. It's probably the thing I miss the most.    Also my hair is pretty thin now, but damn I really just want to sing without being self conscious again.

I've been so conditioned to eat alone. No one in my family eats with me anymore because when I was an athlete, I ate 5-6 small meals according to a clock. When I starved, I just didn't eat period. When I binged, I ate in secret. And in recovery, I just am so focused on healthy habits and I'm in the food zone. Now that I'm better, I've lost their desire to eat with me. I have to work on that next.  At work I eat lunch alone - even when I eat with other coworkers, I prepare and eat my own food while they grab food from wherever food court we are going to. I just can't buy food from some random place, even in recovery. Sometimes I even go with the intention of buying a snack or something with a co-worker at Starbucks and I never come out with anything but black coffee. They laugh that I've bait and switch them.  I still have the habit of saying 'I already ate' when spur of the moment food decisions come at me. It's such a habit.  And finally, my daughter loves these things very much: pizza and a churro from Costco, McDonald's, ice cream from this Italian ice place and I get them for her every week after her practices or on the weekend errand runs. She's 9 and I only remember once having pizza and a churro with her at Costco.
