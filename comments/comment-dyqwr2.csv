I’ve noticed that if I’m dehydrated I hold onto water weight.  Prior to a couple of months ago I didn’t really drink water but I stayed hydrated because a lot of our water comes from what you eat (depending on your diet). When you restrict this low you make sure you increase your water intake (not saying go gung-ho) and add to that that your purging as well. If you’re not voiding frequently enough this is a sign.,False,False
