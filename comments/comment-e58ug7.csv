Like ik thats a stupid thing to say bc its not some homogenous group but hoooly shit. When you can get shit for deviating at all from a char why would anyone wanna cosplay near these people?   I used to wanna do it so bad cause I thought people looked cool and it looked fun but seeing how people would shit on girls for being ever so slightly heavier or thinner, not as pale, or not as young looking as characters, I was really put off. Like fuck dude. Cosplays don't exist to be your eyecandy :/",False,False

He has no right to be making comments on what you eat and how you look, especially since he KNOWS your history with disordered eating. Like, I'm sorry, but COUNTING *YOUR* CALORIES? When you're in recovery? That's absurd!  He needs to stop doing this RIGHT now. And if he doesn't, I'm sorry, but you need to distance yourself from him until he learns how to behave. Because no matter how good he's been to you in the past, this is REALLY inconsiderate and harmful behaviour from someone who's supposed to LISTEN to you when you ask him not to do things, and you deserve someone who cares about your wellbeing.",False,False

I‚Äôve been trying make sure he eats and stuff to try to make sure he isn‚Äôt developing an eating disorder either. I don‚Äôt want that for him or anyone really.  But he eats three meals a day and has proudly set his calorie daily limit at 2,350 so he‚Äôs not visibly starving himself.

The second half made me actually laugh out loud XD the amount of effort cosplayers put in for anything is impressive but even more so for people cosplaying different species!!
