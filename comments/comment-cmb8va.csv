Listen, I checked out your post history, and sorry but you're going to find zero to a very tiny amount of people who participate here to be receptive to any sort of ""your body knows what it wants!"" (which is actually just scientifically unsound)  and ""Being fat is fine!"" rhetorical.",False,False

I have been going through the same exact thing for the last 3 years and I, too, need to find a way to stop dinner binges...  My husband says that if I eat more throughout the day, I wouldn’t feel the need to gorge at night. There’s definitely some validity to that statement, but when I eat more during the day, I feel like shit about myself for ALL the hours I am awake, as opposed to just after dinner.   It’s an all-consuming double edge sword.   I used to be a bit more disciplined in my eating habits, and a method that worked for me back then was NOT keeping excess food in the house. Literally just the bare minimum. And nothing that triggers binges... sugary cereals, frozen breakfast items (I’m a waffle and pancake lover too), hell even fruit is so sugary it would set me off...  At the end of the day, I feel like us bingers need to feel the high that a successful day of portion control brings, in order to make it a long standing sustainable change. The problem is doing this more than once, and not relapsing in between.",False,False
