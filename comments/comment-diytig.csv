I got stomach ulcer from over medicating my period pain and been on proton pump inhibitor medication since then.   Eating disorders can fuck up your heart and other organs really bad, so I hope your doctor checked up your heart? Also heavy restricting and anxiety can feel as a chest pain, and restricting prob is making you recovery from infection quite slow. If it’s also stomach ulcer, you might find some help from plain youghurt at night but stomach ulcers also need to be treated properly.   Hope you find out what’s wrong!",False,True
