Like, sure, let’s say my friends thighs look big today, does that in any way make me think negatively about her? Hell no. It’s neutral. I just wish it got through my thick skull that people think the same way about me.",False,False

Once it started though, i did notice things about people that i notice on myself. For example, i notice how big peoples thighs and calfs are, because i notice that on myself.   &amp;#x200B;  In general though, the reason i worry about what people think about me (whatever it might be not just my stomach/body parts) is because i notice those little things on other people which makes me think they do as well. People always say that no one notices if your hair is a bit messy or your shirt is a little small but that doesn't really help me since i notice small things like that on other people. This makes me think that others are the same and *do* notice things like that.",False,False
