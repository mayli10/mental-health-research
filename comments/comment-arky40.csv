Having come from 35 in 6 months or so, iirc.   As I just put on that post, the inpatient unit that is being looked at for me can accept people as low as a BMI of 10, I'm at 14.5. Thus, I feel (of course) that I'm not ""sick enough"" and is driving me to restrict even more. 100-250 kcal a day, when at least before I was on 400..   Plus, there's a waiting list and we know that there's around 4-5 women waiting, and the beds are prioritised based on BMI - compared to a BMI of 10, I'm a fucking whale!?",False,False
