At this point I had had my period for a few months/a yearish, my chest was either a B or C cup, and my hips had filled out.

From then on I was acutely aware that I was double the size of the rest of my classmates, and about a year later I found tumblr thinspo and the clown show really began.",False,False

My heartbeats was at 29. I didn’t care. I needed the final solution which was being loved and admired which required being thin in my head. A cause I would literally die for.
