I am just amazed of the many facets of your short post.   I am taking your post for face value (I am **NOT** searching this).....  1.

What darkness are you in with your disorder that you obviously are torturing yourself with sex, food, and exposure? ( I have been in some really dark places with my Anorexia, but have never even contemplated this level you speak of.) 4. How can we help - because all I want to do is help that poor person.  5. I actually have a tears about this- because like I have said I have been in dark places with my Anorexia; I am thanking God that I never went to this extreme, and I am so lucky that I chose recovery.",False,False
