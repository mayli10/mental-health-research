I know what this is like: I ended up pouring my heart out in my teens to an acquaintance who I just felt weird and awkward to talk to afterwards!   It‚Äôs so screwed up how badly health insurance screws us in this country. It‚Äôs like either cope with maladaptive mechanisms which may or may not destroy your health or play Russian roulette with your insurance company for treatment that may or may not cut you before it becomes effective.   I hope your pain has eased a bit. Take care of yourself. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è,False,True

They never gave me any idea of how long they would hold me, it was just indefinitely. They didn't provide any real therapy, they were just a place to keep people away from sharp objects.    When I told the staff I wanted to go home, I was told that crying was evidence I wasn't stable enough to leave. All told, all they did was forcibly put me on prozac, take away my shoelaces, hold me for 2 weeks, made me miss a significant amount of school, and cost my parents about a thousand dollars a day AFTER our pretty good insurance.   They didn't even provide a referral for a psychiatrist or therapist for follow up.",False,False

I've contemplated admitting myself after the urges got so bad this past fall &amp; I was tired of failed attempts.

I‚Äôve used the text/chat support lines in the past and they‚Äôve all been really helpful at that moment in time to get me ‚Äòunstuck‚Äô to where I could sleep on it and then talk it through later.
