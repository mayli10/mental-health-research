I think some of the problem with placement is that because it is happening at a convention, there’s only so much privacy and it’s all ages. The placement isn’t *exactly* what I wanted but after thinking about it for a while, it will actually work out as long as the sizing isn’t incredibly awkward. But at the beginning of my conversation with them today my option essentially was to do whatever design they were going to give me wherever they wanted which definitely does suck, I think I gave into it because I was just too mad to really care. I do wish that the original plan could have worked out, especially since I made it so far in advance essentially to make sure it would happen, but in the long run, I’m okay with how it turned out. The design is cool and it’ll actually look good with my other tattoos, but I am still upset that I couldn’t do what we planned. Tattoos are a way to feel better about my body so a lot of the custom plan stuff was around that, but I’m too deep in relapsing to get something that I’m not gonna like since it’s not something easily changed and will just make my BDD worse than I can handle. It’s still not the ideal situation, but at least Im not going to get something I don’t like just out of spite for the situation stressing me out on top of a heap of other stress",False,True

It sounds like they're making you get a design you don't really want, and don't even get to decide where on your body it's placed? Am I reading that right. ",False,False
