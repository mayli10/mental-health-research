Like another commenter said, to be able to order takeout when myself or my partner doesn‚Äôt feel like cooking, and trust myself to eat until I‚Äôm full and then stop- not have a stare down with a pizza or sneak off to purge when my partner is asleep.   I made a list of all the foods I wanted to be able to truly eat the other day when I was high and rereading it hurt like a bitch- some part of my brain just wants such simple things. ‚ÄúA Reese‚Äôs peanut butter cup. Cereal. A PB&amp;J.‚Äù Why can‚Äôt I give it that? üòî",False,False

The other day i was sitting in the cafe alone, eating, and another girl came and sat near me. 6 months ago, I would have gotten frustrated, packed up and left because I couldn't eat in front of other people. The other day I could do it with no issue.  The other day I went to a coffee shop and the cheesecake looked good, so I got a slice and ate it IN the shop. 6 months ago I would have thought that was scary, impulsive, and punished myself for it by either purging, fasting, or cutting. The other day i just enjoyed my cheesecake, and it was amazing.   Yesterday I went grocery shopping and got what looked good. 6 months ago grocery shopping was an ordeal, and everything was calculated out, to the exact amount of eggs I needed to the amount of SLICES, not loaves, of bread. 6 months ago my cart was full of coke zeros and sugar free jello packets. Yesterday it was full of health and some things I would have been afraid to even touch back then.   The other day a guy took me out to dinner and i got food and ate it, stopped when I was full, and ate the rest later. 6 months ago I was scarfing down food just so I had enough time to go purge it in the restauraunt bathroom. The other day I enjoyed myself and had a nice date without thinking too much about food.   I don't know how much I weigh now. I work out and do strength training 2 or 3 times a week, and I can see and feel my body changing. I know I have gained weight but I dont know how much. 6 months ago i weighed myself every day first thing. If i had lost .5 pounds, I was happy. If i gained .2 pounds, it ruined my day and i felt so fat even though i was at my lowest weight ever.  Today I wake up and the first thing I think about is what I'm going to do today. 6 months ago my first waking thought was food and weight. Now i am finally starting to wake up and live.   I never knew this life was possible, after 8 years of having ED, it was such a huge part of my life, a part of my identity, I wondered what it was like to live without it and now I know. Recovery is possible and it looks a lot like OPs post. If you can imagine it, it can happen.",False,False

Wish I could just go out to eat with my boyfriend, have a few beers, and not stress about my calories or get upset at him because I feel like I ate too much. Wish I could just have a lazy evening where neither of us feel like cooking so we order a pizza, and I eat it until I‚Äôm full, not beyond that, and not worry about eating ‚Äútoo much‚Äù and be able to just enjoy the evening and his company without fixating on all the fucking unlogged calories. I want to be able to have my regular tv show binge-watch with my friend without ending up binging on all of the snacks and the delivery takeout we ordered while she sits there, having eaten enough to the point of fullness, watching me shovel food into my face to the point of being sick out of compulsion.   Wish I could just be normal.",False,False
