The difference was I always knew whether I theoretically *should* have been gaining weight. It seems when I ate more intentionally nothing really changed, and the second I restricted I went up. For a disorder that craves control that's infuriating. I appreciate the response and hope you can find what works for you. Enjoy your tea :)",False,False

I'm wanting to say a dietitian, but I understand if that's not feasible. Maybe you can come up with a general meal plan to make sure you are getting enough nutrition and not accidentally underestimating your intake?   I watch a lot of recovery YouTube's that stress not counting as the ideal.  https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/b421pm/ed_recovery_youtubers  Is a good list of them!",False,False

I genuinely stopped caring for the calorie content of my food and just focused on eating when I was hungry and making healthy choices. I made a decision to gain weight so I could be at a healthy BMI again. If it wasn't for the fact that I've been sick most of the past year and the realization that I would need to be very particular about my eating habits I think I would have been good for the foreseeable future. Unfortunately things aren't well for me any longer. I wasn't able to gain weight while I was trying to which really sucked. Eating in excess just made me more sick. I did my best to avoid getting sucked back into the cycle of restriction. It was really tough because eating most foods makes me bloat and that caused body dysmorphia to become a problem for me again. It's mostly a problem when I feel stressed, but sometimes I can't tell if I'm seeing myself as I am or not. The final nail in the coffin was probably that I seem to have somehow gained the weight I wanted to when I wasn't trying to. I was eating an excess of 500-1000 calories every day for weeks before I stopped trying to gain weight and didn't gain a single pound. A few months later and I'm visiting family, stepped on my dad's bathroom scale, and it says I gained 10 lbs. I don't know if that's accurate or not because it is an old scale at this point, my dad has had it for years, but last year it was accurate. I can't see any reason it wouldn't be now. I just feel like I would have noticed if I gained weight. Like, it should be visible on my body or my clothes should have started feeling tighter or something. I know this is a good thing, that I finally managed the gain the weight I wanted to, but the fact that it happened when I wasn't trying to gain weight means I'm not in control anymore and that kind of terrifies me. I've had a lot of problems which I've had to work to get under control, so it's something I'm used to at this point in my life, but I've never had a chronic physical illness before. I don't even know where I would begin dealing with this. The closest experience I've had is physical symptoms from psychological problems so I managed the symptoms and worked on fixing the source. Pretty easy when all you have to do is think nice things. I have an idea about how I could manage the symptoms. I noticed I don't feel as sick when most of my calories for the day come from liquids and earlier this week my mom gave me some tea that helps with abdominal cramps and other stomach issues (*it's ginger and turmeric with cinnamon added for flavour*), but managing the symptoms isn't enough. My illness gets worse when I eat and when I'm stressed out. Managing what I eat is easy, but a liquid diet and some herbal tea won't help me when things in life get tough and I don't know what else I can do. Like, I've only relaxed once in my life and I had to read a WikiHow article to figure out how to do it. I wasn't exactly in a high-stress situation when that happened though, so I doubt that's something I can look up and read whenever I really need to calm down. Not only that, but all of my problems are aggravated by stress, so I'm going to have a lot more to focus on than just some pain. Just thinking about all of this has my stomach in a knot. Anyway, that's probably a lot more than you wanted to know. I'm going to go make some tea now.",False,False

I would say that it depends on your mindset. I needed the reassurance initially that I wasn't overeating, but later I needed to stop so I could truly recover.",False,False
