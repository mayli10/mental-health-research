I‚Äôm sure heavy restriction destroys tolerance of certain things or even the effects of medication or drugs. Honestly extreme restrictive periods mixed with my daily 5-6 cups of coffee... I don‚Äôt even know how I‚Äôm still alive.,False,False

Now I only drink Dunkins iced coffee lmao bc i‚Äôm poor and the other day I made some iced coffee at home and it gave me CRAZY anxiety,False,False

My teeth are actually perfectly fine even after all the drinks. Though once you hit around 400mg of caffiene (daily recommended limit) you start to get heart palpitations and you will start shaking. It‚Äôs especially bad if you haven‚Äôt had anything to eat. It‚Äôs really dangerous to drink that much, and there were many times where I felt like I was about to have a heart attack.",False,False

Normally I try to limit myself to like an iced coffee and a shot of espresso a day, which I‚Äôm going to guess is between 250-300mg, but sometimes I just need more. Also if I don‚Äôt have some form of caffeine in the morning, I will inevitably get a migraine.   There was a time last year where I was probably having nearly 1000mg every day, it was rough. Having that much caffeine didn‚Äôt really affect my appetite, but it would make me lightheaded and I‚Äôd get the shakes. Also it just prevented me from falling asleep, I didn‚Äôt actually feel more energized.  Coffee from a French press (or cold brew) tastes great black! If you still think it‚Äôs too bitter or just don‚Äôt like the taste, you could add a zero cal sweetener and maybe some almond or soy milk?   I‚Äôve been drinking coffee probably since I was about 12 or 13, and I don‚Äôt think my teeth are yellow really. They‚Äôre not super white but they don‚Äôt look bad!",False,False

I usually alternate between green tea and an herbal tea (like a peppermint for bloating) every other cup or so. Also I realized my tea cup is huge. It‚Äôs probably enough for 2 normal mugs.   The supplements help a ton with anxiety. Lemon balm is my go to any time I start to feel anxiety usually. Rhodiola is also really effective as well as Ashwaganda.  You can also get Lemon Balm in tea form but I recommend mixing it with another tea because it doesn‚Äôt really taste like anything.,False,False

I drink Diet Pepsi too and I think that‚Äôs 34mg per can. So some days in the 800s+. And I EC stack so whatever that is on top of everything.   I‚Äôm not really into coffee or tea. I like the bubbly energy drinks.   I personally have always had a high tolerance to stimulants. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,False,False

Since my ed hit me i only drink 1-3 cups a day cause i cant drink coffee black and y'know. Calories. Anyways my teeth thankfully didnt change color and i dont recognize the caffeine in coffee anymore.  So since i dont drink much coffee anymore i compensate it with energy zero but i try to drink only one a day. Energy is the only thing that can wake me up since coffee has no effect anymore.  What i noticed is that the less you eat the more you get sick by coffee. Same goes for energy i guess.,False,False
