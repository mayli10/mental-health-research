I'm very ashamed of it.  One day when I'm more stable I'll calculate the damage. I have so little money now, and its only now that I think I can really get myself together and stop wasting it all. Its hell, but that doesn't mean it can't get better.",False,False

I’ll order enough food for 3-4 people, end up throwing away some of it after I feel like death, and it’s just sooooo much money down the drain. Seamless/Postmates/Instacart make it even easier to get huge binges delivered to my house, and the delivery fees really add up. I’ll spend $70-$80 a day, easy.",False,False
