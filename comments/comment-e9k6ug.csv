Unfortunately it’s just an illogical fear about something that happens in a kitchen or factory of which I can’t see for myself. And even if I watch someone make the food, my mind will jump to it being a different problem with the food.",False,True

The thing is it’s more about the contamination in my body aspect of it. I feel dirty because I never know how the food is prepared. As ridiculous as it sounds, the ideas of something as small as a person accidentally breathing over the food before I eat, or something like someone in a factory accidentally spitting on it while talking, makes me not able to eat it. I have OCD which largely explains the avoidance, but the problem is I’m just not eating. In the past 3 days I have had 2 meals.",False,True
