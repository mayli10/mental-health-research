An osmotic laxative (like MiraLax) can help you go but doesn't have a potential for abuse like stimulant laxatives.  You may want to check out the book *Sick Enough* by Dr. Jennifer L. Gaudiani. It has in-depth info about medical complications of eating disorders.,False,False

I’ll try to just eat high protein and fat for a few days and slowly reintroduce more carbs i dunno i’m just trying to not die over here :(",False,True
