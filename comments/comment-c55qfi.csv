I’ve been purging for 13/14 years, some years way worse than others. How did I not know this???

I won’t try to diagnose you but if you’ve been purging for a month, it’s not mouth cancer. Cancer is a slow-acting disease that might (on rare occasions) happen to someone with a long, long history of bulimia. It’s probably some kind of infection, which doesn’t mean you shouldn’t get it checked out... but as someone who used to convince myself I had cancer on the regular (lol), I will just tell you it’s almost definitely not that. Remember google is just looking at your symptoms, whereas you also know the cause (purging).  If it’s possible to stop or at least minimize your purging for a few days, you should try to do that and see if it gets any better (I know, easier said than done). If it doesn’t look any better though should try to reach out to a doctor sooner, maybe even just a walk-in clinic or something. Could be easily treatable. I hope you feel better soon!",False,False
