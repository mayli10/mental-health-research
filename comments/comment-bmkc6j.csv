A bit of backstory: After unknowingly but deliberately isolating myself for 4 years in a foreign country at university, I ""accidentally"" got an ED which started by dieting for 1 year at that point. All of a sudden I started having panic attacks, crying every single day, having almost physical pain (I don't think it was physical at all, it felt like it tho). I did not want to believe that restricting was an issue. I chose to believe I am only depressed and anxious, and have done every exercise, food and daily routine adjustments to make myself not cry for NO REASON and feel so much chest pain anymore. Nothing worked of course. All the exercise and not eating only sent me in a numb mode. Ended up losing more weight, and quickly became kinda zombie-like. No more focus on any coding (even most basic code became hard to understand), and that was my MSc. year too. I remember graduating, and my biggest happiness was in fact my very underweight BMI not the damn diploma and degree.  I am now fine 2 years later. I rarely ever cry just because. After graduation, I went to my GP which sent me to a psychiatrist. Initially it was just pure weight gain enforced on me. Afterwards (now) it's mostly finding another way to cope with my (assumed) failed self and not self-harm by restriction. I guess I gave up being underweight for much less mental pain and much less crying. I'm still working to figure this out and still slipping up and restricting whenever any issue appears. I think I am in a better place now, I just wish I never lived the last 7 years of my life this way which lead to that type of pain.  I cannot give you the perfect advise that will 100% work. For me, being able to start thinking better after being normal weight helped. I only did that because of going to a psychiatrist. They pushed responsibility onto me, and it worked because I have a sense of guilt that's INSANELY HIGH. Still worth it, I assume. On the top of your head, is there anything (other than ED and crying)  that immediately makes you miserable in your life? School, job, apartment? This will sound rough but, work on dealing with that, and you will feel a bit better afterwards. The next step will need to be regulating your eating to be at a proper weight. As for the rest, keep looking for a good psychiatrist. They are out there.",False,False
