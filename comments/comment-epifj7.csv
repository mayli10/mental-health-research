The entries on MFP aren't consistently accurate enough for me and it doesn't track your nutrients as much. Cronometer is great because I actually get to see what I'm lacking and need more of so that I can fix the problem, like not getting enough protein or consuming way too much sodium because soy sauce, instead of just guessing.   But I've also noticed that it's hard not to get *really* obsessive when using Cronometer so I always have to take a break from it every now and then for the sake of my psyche and unwillingness to give my all to calorie counting.",False,False
