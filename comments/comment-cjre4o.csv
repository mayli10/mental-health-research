You can lose and gain whenever. It's not a linear fashion, weight loss, and I hope that this little bump doesn't make you feel like a failure. Because you aren't! You're just a little bloated and feel gross. Take care of yourself in the days to come and eat nutritionally rich foods that are both low in calories to help get your body back on track. I find that binging and trying to restrict right afterwards causes a lot more relapses into binge territory than easing into it. Regardless of what you do! You are important and you matter AND you deserve to be healthy and happy. &lt;3",False,False
