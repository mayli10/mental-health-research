So just if you didn't know! You might want to look into taking supplements or eating foods or drinks high in these. I used to get them in my feet and all up and down my legs until I learned this.

I won't be able to sleep OR I wake up in the night ravenous and exhausted, knowing that if I ate *something* then I'd be able to sleep.

I just found a routine that I stick to every single night. Conditioning works. I used to take up to 3.5 hours to fall asleep and now it's about 20-60 minutes.   Absolutely NOT promoting it, but weed makes me sleep like a baby, although the quality of everything else is shit, and I always binge when I'm high, so I gain weight. This and the fact that it becomes costly just made me stop (I'm a cheap ass).   My routine helps me, however when I'm not able to perform it properly, I just can't fall asleep for hours. And when I wake up during the night, it's usually another 30 minutes to fall asleep. If I wake up after 4 am, no way I'm getting back to sleep.   Restricting never really affected my sleeping, however I noticed that when I'm low on magnesium (almost all the time), I usually have a lot of vivid nightmares. When I eat magnesium-rich food, I have slightly better nights. ",False,False
