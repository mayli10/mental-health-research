Not to your coworkers, especially not to your boss. Your boss might lie to you and give you this whole spiel about how everyone in the company is family but that is bullshit. Your boss is there to exploit your labor. Never forget this. Do your work, be polite but if your boss tries to bring the conversation to personal issues, you can either redirect the conversation or politely set a boundary by saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel comfortable discussing personal matters in a work environment,‚Äù and leave it at that.   Don‚Äôt add any of your coworkers on social media either. People might call you a snob or whatever, but you‚Äôre at your job to make a paycheck, not make friends. As long as you are competent at your job, no one can say shit to you.   I had a boss call me in and comment about how I never go to the social lunches, or stay after work to do their bullshit team building exercises. I cut him off and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm confused. Do you have a problem with my work performance?‚Äù He said no but that I‚Äôm not making an effort outside of office hours. I told him that he pays me to do my job, and I do go above and beyond the job description and bring in more money than anyone else.

He definitely didn‚Äôt like that; but he couldn‚Äôt do a goddamn thing about it and after that conversation, everyone left me the hell alone.

It doesn‚Äôt look good on your resume to have such a long unemployment history and then quit your first job right away. Stay a while, get good at what you do, deflect the bullshit and then bounce when you‚Äôre confident that your experience makes you more employable. Sometimes you have to grit your teeth and deal with toxic work environments to make a living.   I believe in you, OP. Congrats on the gainful employment and don‚Äôt let your shithead boss get in the way of your financial independence.
