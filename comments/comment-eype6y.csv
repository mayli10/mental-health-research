Iâ€™m going through something similar and it sucks. My first instinct was to say fuck it and dive head first back into the only real coping mechanism I know, my ED. There is familiar comfort there. But Iâ€™ve been doing a lot of mental evaluation lately and I know my self destructive bullshit played a huge part in why we grew apart. He felt like he had to micromanage me and it was detrimental to his health and mental well being.  I never wanted that for him, but my therapist told me I donâ€™t get to tell other people how to love me and I guess I found that out a little too late. So now Iâ€™m stuck in a limbo too. Get better for myself, who I hate, or let it kill me once and for all.   We gotta value ourselves, and thatâ€™s something that in all my years I havenâ€™t figured out how to do yet. We deserve to live, and love ourselves and be happy somehow.   I donâ€™t know how but Iâ€™m ready to try and figure it out. Give it a try too, you deserve to be happy and value yourself. ðŸ’™ Give my inbox a shout if you ever need an ear.",False,False
