Starting abusing speed for weight loss and to self medicate ADHD and it just spiralled out of control. Therapy has been very useful for me, is there any way you could access some? Or some kind of free support group? I know how scary the idea of going to talk to someone about it all is but if you can face it it might make you feel less alone and lost. If you want to quit drugs I would recommend tapering down very slowly over a month or so and preferably under the guidance of a health care professional (but I have done it alone before, it's possible).   Wishing you the best, you can PM me if you want.",False,False
