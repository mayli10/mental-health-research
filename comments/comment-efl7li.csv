People kept eating every hour as well. The impulse got to be too strong and had to leave.   I came home and binged anyways but I feel okay since it consisted of a healthy vegetable stew and stuff my body can benefit from.   I think today was a success despite that. It didn't end in self hatred LOL,False,False
