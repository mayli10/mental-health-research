What i meant was that since my meal was already logged i had no idea how many calories were left after the first tastes, so i ended up eating that disgustingly salty meal anyway, it was absolutely inedible!",False,False

Sadly, many parents do their kids a disservice in this way. It's a hard habit to break.   I had an issue with wasting food for a time, that was not influenced by my parents. What I did is I served slightly less on my plate than usual, and left a single bite left on the plate every time. By resolving to never finish, you pay more attention to when you're full. Which, is actually just when you stop feeling hungry, by the way. (Most parents don't teach their kids that either!) Sometimes, these means taking five chip and only eating four. Or if you usually eat 6 Oreos, eating five and throwing one away. By throwing it away, you're telling your brain that you don't need it. Eventually, your brain will give you the cues of when to stop again. Unlike our consciousness, our subconsciousness is very adaptable. ",False,False

I actually hate having the full feeling lol it makes me so uncomfortable (why i end up purging) even if its fucking water; does that stop me from eating? Not always.

I can’t remember the exact mechanics of it, but sometimes with ADHD you crave more sugar and fats which can lead to having a harder time recognizing that you’ve hit the stopping point.   That’s something I learned in class last semester and it really stuck with me.

The only way I can at least somewhat avoid that is by purging until my stomach is empty, but that only buys me a few more hours until I start bingeing again. The cycle only stops at midnight. But if go to bed with an empty stomach because I purged my last binge, I'll just binge again the next day. I really have to go to bed with a full stomach with lots of sugar and fat (yes, I've tried going to bed with just veggies in my stomach) in order to get away from the whole thing and be able to eat normally again the next day.
