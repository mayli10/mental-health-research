Sometimes I've weighed food in ml just cause the scale switched units and I was too lazy to switch back. Oh Lord the inaccuracies.  ðŸ˜±,False,True

However, lots of substances are different, such as mousse, which can contain a lot of air, making it take up more space (measured in litres) while not necessarily reflecting that in weight.   You can do fun experiments with it. Take a container of a given size, fill it with water, and check the weight. Then take the same container, fill it with cutlery, and check the weight again. Should be quite different. The food scale is only considering substances similar to water when weighing ml.",False,False
