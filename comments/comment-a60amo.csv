It can fluctuate from day to day, it's not worth stressing yourself out over nothing. You also might have weeks where you'll seem not to have lost any weight, but you're just holding up more water that week because of your period. Or at least that's what it's like for me :)  Also start measuring your circumferences - chest, waist, hips. It'll give you a better idea of your overall progress, since your weight can remain relatively constant even though you're becoming more toned.",False,False

I try to stay positive, i'm down 1 pound this week but normally I've been losing 2, so it's not quite a stall since I still am going down but it is frustrating. ",False,True

I found that if I do everyday I let the number affect how eat that day, despite knowing there are many reasons for small fluctuations. It helped me to only weigh a couple times a week instead, and on the other days learning to trust the process.",False,False
