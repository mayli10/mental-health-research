Id still switch back to them though cause they‚Äôd probably still help me feel better at this point. If I have 1 or 2 a day, it would still probably be less calories then Im eating in a day atm.      Ive been smoking to much weed lately to get rid of seizures, so I wanna take a tolerance break. That means that Im gonna have barely any appetite though, and sometimes maybe not even wanna eat for a few days, so if I had some ensures then I could just have 1-2 a day to help me through that.",False,True

Supplement drinks like Ensure are such fears for me because of the trauma they're tied to (and obviously the calories)",False,False

The fact that Soylent and Huel have vitamins and mineral in it too is really cool. I swear its about to blow up. Who has time to cook?",False,False

Each bottle has 20 g protein and a lot of nutrients (20% dv) but I guess you‚Äôre supposed to drink 5 a day??? Nope. But the cafe ones are soooo good and I think the originals taste like the milk left over from Cheerios. Tbh I don‚Äôt mind it ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ,False,False

I lost all interest in food but drank whole milk all the time instead. I've stopped all that as well.  These days I drink the berry flavor of a food/shake Huel, which is a lot like Ensure. There is another pretty popular one called Soylent that people seem to enjoy, but I haven't tried it.  I find it so much easier to drink food in general. I don't know why. Seems more efficient to me. ""Eating is cheating"" is my retarded mantra.",False,False
