I go back and forth between eating ""normally"" and fasting. I'm still losing weight though and I'm worried my therapist will see it but I will not bring it up on my own bc 1) I'm not ready to stop this train yet 2) idk if it actually is real or I'm making it up 3) I have dropped hints that I'm ""eating less than normal"" and I don't think she's realized yet the extent of it but I am sort of leaving it up to her to figure it out bc in my mind, I feel like if it were a *real* problem, she would notice and realize that when I say I'm eating less, it means I'm not eating at all but since she hasn't noticed yet, I must not actually have a *real* problem. Twisted logic, I know, but I think that's partially due to the fact that I feel like a fraud sometimes and also if it turns out that I'm not a fraud, idk what happens next, and I'm scared.",False,False
