I've been dealing with osfed for 5.5 years. I was mildly bulimic for a while as in binge purging like 2 times a week, but then ""recovered"" for 4 months and relapsed 2 days ago. Now I've been restricting or eating normal and purging. I've realized I do it when I feel more depressed and alone. I dont have anyone to talk to anymore, so I've turned back to the bulimic part of osfed. It's very comforting for me and makes me feel relaxed. Sorry if this doesn't help but I thought maybe you could relate :)",False,False
