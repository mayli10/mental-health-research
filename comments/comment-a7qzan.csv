I did as many greens as I wanted. Then carefully measured out servings of toppings and dressing.   I miss my salads. Is it bad Iâ€™m so stoked to live on my own so I can restrict without feeling shame. Ima start meal prepping and salads and no temping binge foods allowed!,False,False

But I do give myself some more leniency when it comes to calories in salad because it fills me up so much and I dont feel like shit after eating it. Plus the only salads I like are caesar so the only caloricly dense item is the dressing, which I measure out. Sometimes I even throw a hardboiled egg in there if I'm really hungry and feel it's worth it. ",False,False

Then I made the mistake look looking up the calorie content of one item, then another, etc. and now I add it all up.  I wish I hadn't, but I still eat that frickin salad.  SPOILER: there's barely any calories in salad items and sachets of dressing are so small...  I've never gained from salad (and I eat some carbs with it), and it's a BIG salad.  I tell myself the lemon juice I squeeze on it makes it safe.  Yeah, crazy bitch eh.  I generally stick to pre packed other meals, but I eat my own salad without caring about cals.  Lemon juice though, dressings are icky.  I hate when things like your situation happen.  It'd be great to just let calories go, but...easier said than done.",False,False
