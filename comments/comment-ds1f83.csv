Like just a constant ongoing 'fuck you' towards others and to myself.   But yeah I get those moments ""if you don't run five more minutes you will never be thin"", ""if you don't run up these stairs you will be tired for the rest of the day"", it does seem to mostly come in workouts and not at other times of the day. kind of reminds me of those ""upvote this in five minutes or a spooky skeleton will spook you"".. except more malicious. I used to get them a lot at boarding school when I missed my parents. I had entire rituals of nonsensical stuff that in my head I was sure I had to do or they would die. It went on for a long time.  I'm sorry about your step mom. If it's any consolation it's not your fault. I don't think anyone with an ounce of sympathy would tell you or think it was. I hope you and your family finds a way to get through this stuff. Also you don't sound weak to me, you sound compassionate and strong and worthy of being happy. Even on the days where you feel weak, you're always worthy of that. x",False,False

My sister (who has OCD and anorexia) used to never say the word “tornado” out loud for fear that then one would appear and kill the whole family.",False,False
