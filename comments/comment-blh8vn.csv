It's a new day and I'm sobering up. Waking up and realizing I was drunk last night felt like one of my nightmares coming true. I don't want this relapse to be anything more than this one night.  I've always maintained that an otherwise successful sobriety shouldn't be thrown out because of a broken ""streak"", but man it's hard to not feel like a failure when the counter goes back down to zero.",False,False

Although AN is more my ""ED of choice"" and my personal struggle is with a relentless heroin addiction I absolutely cannot seem to shake for any significant amount of time since the first God forsaken time I got bamboozled into trying it, I can relate to the concepts. Do you do any AA/NA type things? It's ok if not but helps some people. Or therapy? Dealing with an ED and addiction at the same time can be overwhelming, it's gotta be hard to do that alone.   And I know this won't make any difference unless you're ready to be sober, but don't feel you have to throw in the towel because of one relapse. A sober date/sober time is nothing but a number. Itll be easy to tell yourself ""well I already messed up, may as well keep going"" but I'm sure you know the further in the hole you get, the harder it is to come back. And once you've gone far enough that you have to deal with withdrawals, that puts you in a whole other dangerous and horrible situation. Thats one area where opiate addicts and alcohol addicts can definitely agree. It's so hard but know you're not alone.",False,False
