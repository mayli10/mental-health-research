I am not fully asexual but I definitely don't understand the human obsession with sex. It's fine when I'm in the mood, but it isn't life changing and I'm only really wanting sexual anything like, maybe once monthly. It sucks because I know my partner had a vastly different experience with sex... However I am literally ALWAYS voracious! I wish I could be a food hating succubus instead T^T",False,False

Ofc not because of some magical metabolism or anything they were just very used to eating quite small portions and didn't enjoy food so much.

I know a lot of ~natrually skinny~ people and even some who really want to gain weight. It's hard to fathom, because we have eating disorders, but some people... just don't like food that much.
