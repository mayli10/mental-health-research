The only person I know who even owns one is my sister, but it's because she lives in Maui and needs an even tan year-round, but it's only when she's laying on the beach.  When she's swimming or surfing, she wears a surf shirt.  I have one of those high-waisted bikinis and it's so comfy.  I feel like it's so rare to see lady belly buttons on the beach anymore cause it's just not the trend, like bikinis look dated- even urby outty is slinging the high waisted suits.    I know it's easy to get obsessive over \[a e s t h e t i c\] with ED's, but 110% in no universe is it worth it to sacrifice the opportunity to study abroad for an instagram pic in a bathing suit.  Try to find some self-love in the fact that you've gotten yourself the opportunity to go abroad this summer because that is SO incredible, and that kind of thing doesn't just fall into peoples' laps, like you obviously worked and have earned it and your insta pics of you in another country are going to be WAY cooler than one of you at the local beach.",False,False
