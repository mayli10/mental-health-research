Also NSAIDs like Advil reduce the swelling a lot on days where I have a special event or something. The only way I can get them to permanently go down though is to stop for weeks at a time. Sudafed helps too cause it drains your sinuses/lymph nodes but this isn't something good to do regularly.,False,False

I have this problem occasionally as well.   Drink water. Gargle warm salt water or warm water with a bit of baking soda. Years ago, I used to gargle turmeric in warm water. It tasted awful so I stopped, but apparently it’s great for dealing with swelling around the nodes. Running or some form of cardio is the #1 way to get rid of the swelling I find. It’s the only thing I notice truly makes a difference. I know it’s difficult if you are purging throughout the day but try your best to purge once a day.   Remember to gargle with warm water with some baking soda after to protect your enamel on your teeth. Brush an hour later if possible. ",False,False
