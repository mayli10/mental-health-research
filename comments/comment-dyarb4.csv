Like a cup of cereal won’t look like much in a normal sized bowl but in the tiny mixing bowl that I own?? Hell yeah it’s basically a Feast. I think it tricks my mind into thinking I’m eating more than I am lol   (fr tho I know this doesn’t work well for everyone and I even have times where it’s like “nah imma fill up that whole big bowl of cereal and eat the shit out of it” y’know so ymmv and I don’t mean this as a tip or anything),False,False
