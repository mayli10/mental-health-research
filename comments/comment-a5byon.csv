I canâ€™t make it work in the normal way, but I had seen, in a police procedural, a victim realize she had been drugged. She made up a Dead-Sea level saltwater mixture in a wine glass, drank it. It worked. Then I looked up the ratio and, having taken chemistry, realized I should heat the water so the salt would dissolve more. Which I did. Plugged my nose and forced myself to drink it.    Guys, I have never been so sick in my life! It took about 45 minutes to work, but after that, I just couldnâ€™t stop. But, I had thought it would work more quickly, and I was on my lunch break from work. So there I was, puking into a Target bag while driving. It kept happening maybe four more times that day, until my throat was so raw I could barely talk.    Like, I know this is super insensitive to say, but I wish, sometimes, when I overeat, that putting something down my throat actually worked for me. But nooo. Stupid reflexes. It would just be a safer option, if I become desperate enough, than basically poisoning myself.",False,False
