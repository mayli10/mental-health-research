My life has been a binging hell for the past 8 months; it tore me down so much yesterday that I just sat in the bathroom and looked at my ugly binge body and watched myself ugly cry for a good two hours.   You aren't alone in this long journey. If anyone understands how much these few days binge free mean...it's me. You are SO incredible and beyond strong for pushing through like this. Keep it up!!! ,False,False
