I really hate it when I go to places that don't have nutrition menus online. And I totally get what you're saying about the blurry line between an ED and other mental disorders.,False,True

I've lost a whole bunch the last 2 months *and my so hasn't noticed*. On one hand I'm not doing this because I want their attention but at the same time *why haven't the fucking noticed*.,False,False

Wanting attention is totally normal, and nothing to be ashamed of. People do a lot of different things to have their (normal, natural) need for attention met. *Starving* yourself to meet that need is “disordered” because it’s unsafe, and demonstrates how very much you’re hurting. People have different reasons for developing an eating disorder; all the reasons are valid, and everyone deserves support and help.  &lt;3",False,False

I'm an obsessive tracker.   I think where I started to admit I'd moved from diet ---&gt; problem was when I started spending absurd amounts of time anxiously studying restaurant nutrition menus online before going out anywhere. Lost interest in semi-regular weekend hangouts with a friend because they always involved snacks and wine. Got \*very\* hung-up on an allowable calorie range, and then fitting optimal macros into it.  Had a meltdown when during \*one\* day of a family visit vacation, we had a meal (my favorite food, too) that I couldn't figure out a practical way to estimate to log.   Didn't know what to call it but did manage to broach it with my doctor. He did diagnose an ED sans dysmorphic characteristics but I'm in the midst of a referral process to an actual treatment clinic so I'm curious to see if the experts will come to the same conclusion.  (which isn't to say I think I don't have a problem or anything, I just get very confused on the relationship between ED and anxiety and OCD, etc, esp when, like you, the body image and dysmorphia elements aren't so prevalent)",False,False
