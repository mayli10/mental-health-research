In and out in 10 mintes, I've been referred and should start treatment within three weeks. These weeks Will be tough, but I finally got the ball rolling!",False,True

Asking for help is crazy difficulty, mad mad props :)  I’m an anxious person so I tend to consider the “what if” things and in this case I would be worried “what if they don’t help me/it goes poorly/I don’t feel sick enough” - on the chance you’re anything like me, I am just going to throw this out there as a preemptive response to anxious thoughts :P  In CASE it doesn’t end up helpful, realize that that is not your problem, it’s theirs. I have a slew of chronic, genetic problems that my amazing GP happened to identify really quickly once I asked her about things. However, many people with the same issues have doctors who have never heard of them, think they aren’t a big deal, or brush them off. These people aren’t faking their issues or less worthy of help than I am, their providers just weren’t up to speed with these specific issues.   Hopefully tomorrow will set you on the path you want to be on! And if you don’t land there squarely, keep looking for a doctor to set you on it.   Absolute best wishes, I’m rooting for you!! 💕",False,False
