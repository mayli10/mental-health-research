Some recipe ideas [here](https://blog.thatcleanlife.com/one-ingredient-banana-ice-cream/) (although you may need to thin it put a bit with water or nondairy milk)",False,False

Do be sure and give it the recommended defrosting time so let the caramel get nice and gooey. :3,False,False

I found it at Sprouts. So far I’ve only had the banana chocolate one and the chocolate and macaron one. Both were tasty and more flavourful than halo top. I think they might have more protein too. There are like five or more flavours if i remember correctly.  It is better than halo top overall, but tends to be a little higher calorie. ",False,False

I prefer it greatly to halo top, as it’s much creamier and more flavorful. So far I’ve tried  cherry chocolate (favorite) and cake batter (also really good, legit tastes like yellow cake) and I have brownie blast in my freezer. ",False,False
