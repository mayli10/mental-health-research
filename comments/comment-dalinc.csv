Issues that can cause this( from personal experience) are low stomach acid( you take betaine hcl pills) or enzyme deficiency from nutrient loss. I was deficient in zinc so it meant I didn't produce the enzymes to breakdown my stuff. I adressed my deficiencies and also supplement my diet with enzymes. I use this pancreatic enzymes from now foods. I get it on amazon pretty cheap and take some with my meals.   &amp;#x200B;  to help me with nutrients, I eat chicken liver a few times a week. The calories aren't that bad and it has a lot of easily absorbed nutrients like iron and vitamin A",False,False
