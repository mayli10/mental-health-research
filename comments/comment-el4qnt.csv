I think overall the portrayals in the last decade of these ""underdog gets someone out of their league"" are slowly getting better BUT Ive also noticed a trend in where the woman must not only be freaking gorgeous and thin, BUT also highly successful/smart whereas male standards have barely inched forward.  It is also interesting because it is actually easier for men to be leaner than women because women have higher body fat needs for hormonal purposes, but it's literally the opposite in entertainment.",False,False
