This meant a lot to hear thank you. I guess it is hard to separate the fact that someone who needs to care about you in a professional sense might not be able to care about you in an emotional sense. I'll probably just request a different nurse next time. I'm not back for a couple of months anyway.,False,True

If you feel like it, it seems reasonable to mention that you feel her comments were unprofessional and unhelpful.   Healthcare providers who make judgmental comments are definitely one of my least favorite things. They’re in a position of trust and authority so the comment hits so much harder than the same comment from a random person. I totally relate to the surge of “Well, I’ll show you. You’ll regret this.” It’s an understandable response but not a helpful one.    After all, they’re a clinician seeing dozens of patients a week. They ‘care’ about me in a professional clinical sense but they don’t *care* the way friends/family care. They can’t - for professional reasons and for their own mental health. And since they doubtless have way healthier boundaries than I do, they’re not gonna place blame on themselves for my flirting with death.   Don’t trust the voice telling you to hurt yourself more because someone hurt you. Go with the voice telling you to protect yourself. That is the good and true voice. &lt;3",False,False
