I'm sorry that your therapist did this. Regardless of legality, this is a huge breach of trust and it's apalling that they think it's okay.",False,False

Really what happens if a child discloses something like Dad yells at me a lot. The counselor e-mails the parents along with this new disclosure along with anything else said during the meeting. What counselor doesnt know is  the Dad yells every single day at his child. And sometimes gets violent. And the child gets punished for letting patt of the family secret slip. And the child is told that if they say anything about the abuse ever agian that the punishment will be worse. Just not safe.,False,False
