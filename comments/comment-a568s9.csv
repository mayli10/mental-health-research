You can just sort of put the food out of your mind, no worries about planning or obsessive tracking, just water and coffee and tea and diet drinks (definitely feels better without the diet drinks lol, but yeah). And Ultima for electrolytes. Electrolytes are definitely important for safe extended fasting! Hydration too. Dry fasting is just silly imho.  .....I’m not gonna pretend I always feel great when I fast even just for a few days, especially the first day which inevitably sucks, but I usually feel much better fasting than when I attempt to eat very little (and am successful with it much more often lol :/).  There’s some science to support this for sure due to the lack of insulin response that you’d get from eating food and all that, but I’ve certainly seen lots of people say they feel better eating very little... And one could definitely argue that during periods of “high restriction,” at least you’re getting *some* nutrients. So like?? Meh. At the end of the day, I feel like it’s mostly an individual preference thing, and I’m sure it also depends a lot on the general state of your body, how you were eating before etc.",False,False

For me it's easier to not make any decisions. I'm just not going to eat. But restricting is harder because I have to decide so much along the way what I will eat and how much. r/fasting actually has a lot of articles about how fasting is better than low calorie diet. Look up Dr. Jason Fung,False,False

According to the science (on mobile can't link atm, comes up top in Google) fasting is better because eating causes your insulin and grehlin to spike, making you feel more hunger. I personally try to aim to keep around 500. I'll creep up to 700 or 800 if I'm with someone who's watching or feeling too low energy after too long at 500. I have a job the requires a fair amount of 'brain power' and can't really afford too many sluggish days.  I also actually really enjoy food so I eat a lot of veggies for more of a volume or quantity type eating, warm soups and broths for the filling feeling, and protein bars for sweetness. I haven't been able to full on fast since I was in college many moons ago. ",False,False
