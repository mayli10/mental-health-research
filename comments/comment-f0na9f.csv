My issue was the alcohol use - I was unconscious in the ICU for multiple days while having repeated seizures (during some of which I apparently stopped breathing).   So, seconding the suggestion to talk to your doc! They can’t help with what they don’t know about. Let them know about your concerns surrounding weight/appetite side effects. There are antidepressants out there that are weight-neutral for many people. (I never had weight side effects from any SSRIs at least) Best wishes &lt;3 Hoping you’ll find the help that’s effective for you!",False,False
