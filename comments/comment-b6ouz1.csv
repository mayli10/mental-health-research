That is super insensitive of your colleagues though as it's none of their business. I've had problems with this in the past and try to just laugh it off with meh, I had a huge breakfast so I'm still full or it's my body so I'll do what I want. I get a lot of shit for drinking sugar free drinks but still sometimes eating something with sugar. They're like oh I thought you didn't eat sugar and then trying to explain the logic behind it is sooo hard as they never understand. Have another cup of soup and go to bed, you've walked miles and deserve a treat and rest. Aw thinking of you, what a shitty time! ",False,False

Mother was making food four relatives visiting and she put an entire plate of roasted nuts she intended on using as an ingredient on the table. I grabbed the entire plate as a joke and my sister freaked and said ""Don't eat that!"". My mom quickly replied with ""How much do you think he can eat anyway?""  &amp;#x200B;  I got angry and tried to call her bluff. I thought ""I'll show her... I'm gonna eat this entire thing and ruin their dinner."" I didn't make it 1 handfull in until I felt so full I wanted to throw up. I put the plate back looking the exact same and just went to my room. I hated myself for the rest of the day. Moral of the story, never let anyone trick you into eating! :D",False,False
