Like drizzling oil over food that already has oil in it? Why? I never understood that. Like you know what goes good with oil? Some more oil! GENIUS!   I eat nuts, but I'll limit to 5g mixed in my yogurt, oatmeal, or sprinkled on my salad unless I haven't really eaten anything and I have the calories to spare.   Idk I guess it just surprises me how normal people can just grab a handful of almonds and not care how many calories are in it. I have to plan that shit.",False,True
