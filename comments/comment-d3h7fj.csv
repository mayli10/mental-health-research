I spent a lot of time trying to follow intuitive eating but idk what the fuck hunger feels like anymore and just ended up eating mainly carbs and ended up gaining weight over time. I started feeling nostalgic for my ED and came to a lot of these subs trying to trigger myself but just remembered how fucking horrid I felt the whole time I was restricting. I realized it's not actually the restricting I miss, it's the self-discipline. I liked thinking through what I would eat in a day, considering how I'd feel after I ate something before choosing to eat it, saying no to foods that I've already met my goals with that day, and subsequently feeling rewarded when I met my goals appearance-wise. I'm trying really really hard to do this in a healthy way and there's definitely days I slip back into disordered eating habits but I really feel like I never properly said good bye to them when I first tried to recover, I just suppressed them. I feel like I have a whole new perspective on what recovery means to me and I'm hoping that this turns out well :)",False,False
