Usually he makes me feel like I'm being unreasonable so it's good to hear that I'm not. He's been working like almost 50 hours a week because he's terrible with money and never listens to my financial advice and now needs to get out of debt. And I told him that I'd rather he be well rested and have time to talk to me and take a little longer to pay his bills, but he insisted that he wouldn't be too tired... which is just bullshit",False,True

Unless he was literally about to pass out from exhaustion, there's no reason for him to give that response. It's not that hard to care about other people and he should've been there for you ",False,False

I have no money atm, $355 in debt. So I just sneak out as much as I can from my cafeteria, but I feel so so bad for it. I had to break my no sugar thing I started a few days ago because the only food I have is valentines candy. I did have a few single kit kats. And some sour patch heart candies. Made me feel less hungry enough that I can finally sleep.  Thank you for the reply I very much appreciate it",False,True

Take good care of yourself though, maybe keep little snacks (like protein bars) in your bag just in case you need it!",False,False
