Our relationship was toxic and codependent as we engaged our ED behaviors together. It was nice to be able to relate to someone and have a supportive friend, but it worsened our mental health some times. I relapsed HARD into AN after an IP stint and that is when we stopped talking to each other. We didn't speak for about a year and a half. That turned out to be the biggest blessing in disguise. We needed to break away from each other and learn to function outside of a toxic relationship. She is still one of my best friends and we can speak openly, but the relationship is different now - better! We have been friends for about 10 years.  I totally understand wanting an irl ED friend but it's something you need to be very careful about, especially if you are still a teen.",False,False

I have a few people in my life rn who know about this and I can just bluntly say dark things. I find that kind of freeing.   But when someone else is suffering, it is so hard. My sister and I both have the same EDs and had to learn how to navigate things and would avoid trying to trigger one another. We love each other and never were competitive, but these things are contagious.   It‚Äôs only lately that we have been able to be open and support one another, look out for each other; but not judge or pressure.   Anything social, I think, is just complicated by this disorder.",False,False

We aren‚Äôt very easily triggered so we just talk freely, and it‚Äôs nice to have that. We met online and have now been best friends for years, and talk daily.   What is hard, is when they relapse. It can stress me out worrying about them, but that‚Äôs my problem, that I‚Äôm learning to better cope with, and put boundaries in place for.   I‚Äôve had a few other friends with EDs, but I wasn‚Äôt able to maintain the relationship with them, because a lack of self awareness or honesty with one‚Äôs self can be frustrating for me. I don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre struggling - just don‚Äôt lie about it, because I don‚Äôt care either way if you eat dinner with me, or just have a few fries/coffee.",False,False

And the jokes and encouragement became really gross and toxic.   I had every opportunity for that ED friend. I got them on my weight loss app, and they were helping to actively encourage me to eat less   It became rough though. Because just as much as I wanted that ED friend, I wanted people do care enough to stop me.   I cut that person out of my life cause they're actively toxic and a bad person. But sometimes I wish I could have that ED friend back. My ED is worse than it was when I was around them. So now I'm even more swayed to want that back.

But it didn‚Äôt really last long. When your friendship is largely predicated on a shared mental illness, when either of you progresses in recovery or slips into relapse the foundation is shaken.    In my experience, recovery from an eating disorder requires developing personal interests and activities outside of food and pushing yourself to interact normally with food even when your anxiety is at 11 (fake it til you make it). That is very hard to do when you are trying to be respectful and responsible with someone else‚Äôs disorder as well.     For a while, I stayed in touch with other recovering patients, and we were kind of each other‚Äôs co-sponsors (like AA), but I think that‚Äôs a different relationship altogether.",False,False
