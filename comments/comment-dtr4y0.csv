Feeling shameful mentally leads me to wanting myself to physically feel the same.   I also realized I binge in a weird self sabotage way. If I am feeling good now but don't think it will last, or worry about something coming up it will trigger a binge.   Then when it's the opposite, when I want to feel good or when I am feeling more positive then it's restrict.   So weird.",False,False

My binges typically come from pent up stress, and on some level are a punishment. I can't say that I've kicked the habit, but dealing with the source of the stress has helped me binge less frequently. When I deal with these problems before they become so intense, I'm less likely to binge. I hope that helps a little bit. I know what it feels like. It sucks, but we'll get through this.",False,False
