And mine makes me seem like a total ass hole, I have massive anxiety about foods I haven‚Äôt prepared myself. I‚Äôm vegan and keto and this is normally a good enough excuse for not  eating foods people offer me or bringing my own food to social events but some of my friends will go to real effort to make food for me and sometimes then I either come up with some other excuse or just eat a really tiny amount. I‚Äôm also a nightmare when I come to going out for food because to I‚Äôll often not eat that day in preparation so if there is something wrong with me meal or nothing on the menu I‚Äôm comfortable eating I get really emotional about it, not rude at all, just really upset.",False,False
