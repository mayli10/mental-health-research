BMR does decrease when in a starved state to conserve energy. not sure what that has to do with the psychology of binge urges tho.,False,False

Just like eating too little, eating too much is extremely unhealthy. It puts me at risk to literally tear my stomach open. Please don't encourage that behavior, just as you wouldn't encourage my restriction. And please don't criticize, just encourage. Be gentle, don't be pushy, because it can cause a cycle of unhealthy binging and then restricting.""  Please don't just let them continue to be ignorant of the harms of binging. They think it's a good thing because they think it's a solution to not eating enough. If they still don't understand, consider sending them articles or studies on the dangers of binging. And if they still try to make you binge or encourage it, just simply tell them, ""no more talking about what I've eaten unless I myself bring it up"" and dont answer their comments. You have to be firm with boundaries.  Good luck",False,False

He does not understand that overeating leads to restricting or purging. He tells me I deserve to treat myself and enjoy higher calorie foods. I think the way so many people eat and consider themselves normal is binging. So they are never going to be critical of that behavior. ,False,False
