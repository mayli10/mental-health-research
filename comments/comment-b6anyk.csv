I will say I'm better than I was though. Seek counseling if possible. Nourish your body healthily, don't abuse it. I hope you can get comfortable in your skin.  Look at it this way: Care for your body almost as if you are caring for your own child.",False,False

People definitely noticed when I dropped from 137 to about 112 two years ago (I'm 5'3), and like you it started out healthy, but then turned to binging/restricting. I got a ton of compliments about my body and my weight loss. Now that I'm back to about 130, those same friends that complimented me are saying things like ""it's not noticeable"" and stuff like that to try and comfort me. Like obviously it is...? Anyway, I don't know what to say other than I relate to you and I'm sorry :(",False,False
