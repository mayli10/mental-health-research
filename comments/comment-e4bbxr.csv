Eating, even a little, starts up your insulin, raises your blood sugar, and sort of primes your body to eat.   I don't know the whole science behind it by heart, but essentially, when you are fasting, your body is cleaning itself up, minding its own business. When you introduce food/calories into the system, it starts to focus on that.",False,False

Extended fasting has fucked me up like this honestly.   Like now I’m kinda wired to feel like once I start eating, it’s all over? So it’s much easier to just. Not start eating at all.
