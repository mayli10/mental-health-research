It's actually healthier now than it was when I was a kid somehow despite my horrendous eating habits. I suspect it's the coconut oil masks and the tea tree oil shampoo though. I also take iron supplements which is pretty important to hair growth, nails, and skin. ",False,False

However since the beginning of 2019 I’ve been trying to eat more and eat intuitively and tbh I can notice that my hair’s grown a bit more in the past month than it usually does.,False,False

Ails and eat much healthier (even though I range between 400-800 cals). My hair is super shiny and getting long (but I do loose lots of hair, which is semi normal) ",False,False
