For whatever reason, I gain weight in my face first, more than most. Every angle above a certain weight and my chin just seamlessly blends into my neck or I have major double/triple chins. I also just hate having thick thighs/butt/hips as well as chubby arms because I think it‚Äôs harder to hide because of modern clothing trends. Skinny legs and arms are like, the only way to pull off any modern looks. Most women bigger than me really pull off extra weight well and aren‚Äôt nearly as disproportionate as I am. When I gain weight, my chest (A Cup or smaller) stays the same regardless of my hips being at a size 0 or size 14. When my body matches my chest size, I look great! Otherwise, I just look pathetically flat and otherwise fat.",False,False

I'm attracted to all sorts of women at all sorts of weights. One set of standards for them, completely different standards for myself.

I hated not being able to swing my arms freely because the sweaty skin of my upper arms stuck to my torso if I wore a tank top. I hated my boobs getting up to a D cup so I couldn't comfortably go braless. I hated the underboob situation, hated feeling my boobs fold over and stick to my abdomen.  Basically, everything felt wrong. After writing all that out, apparently I have some kind of issue with different body parts touching? All those sensations were beyond annoying.
