I used to be like WHY DO I HAVE ALL THE THINGS. But once I kind of accepted that a lot of my struggles could be feeding off of another - like rapid cycling emotions would change my eating behavior a lot. One week I could be like I AM EMBRACING MY BODY I LOVE MYSELF and the next week I could be like I WILL TRACK EVEN MY CONSUMPTION OF WATER. Like it doesn‚Äôt make the problems easier, but I think laying everything out and being able to talk about with someone helped me understand myself a lot more and be less hard on myself. There are a couple of really great tracking apps for mood and sleep that can help you see patterns and maybe understand your behavior even if it was after the fact. It helped me feel like I had some control, and that‚Äôs really powerful. Plus we‚Äôre already so good at tracking :P I also gave myself non food-related goals like doing brain puzzles (peak is an awesome app that gives you scores and tracks your improvement on different types of mind games.) I kinda forced myself into it by being like ‚Äúmy brain is important too it isn‚Äôt one or the other.‚Äù And that has given me something else to kind of focus on or even be frustrated about that has numbers attached to it. More frustration doesn‚Äôt SOUND good, but it‚Äôs not more frustration it‚Äôs like a more even distribution of it and maybe another example of where (for me, specifically bipolar) might be popping up, so it isn‚Äôt necessarily only fueling some ED habits. It‚Äôs a pattern of behavior that I can see in more than one way. And it doesn‚Äôt have to be mind games - it could be learning a language or a puzzle or learning to play an instrument. There‚Äôs an app for almost anything. Just remember making it through super hard times can make you super strong. Trial by fire and some Diet Coke.",False,False

And, i'm not sure if i even asked if they'd want a cake or what kind of cake, but it doesn't matter. They deserve a cake. The whole process is a blur, but it feels great. Then the cake is finished. i look at it and feel like nothing matters anymore. It's done and there was no one to even make the cake for. i throw it away and lie on my couch.",False,False

Depression - if you do not immediately latch on to something, be sad/apathetic/depresssed for a few days until you fall in love with a new random thing that has you so amped you aren‚Äôt thinking clearly. One time I needed NEEDED to start making my own ice cream that I wouldn‚Äôt even eat and I took out a credit card to buy a fancy machine and designed my own pints on Etsy. I was over it 2 days later.

I have literally no money right now but I continue to spend money on low calorie food options like canned soups and baby food and snacks I discover even though I have enough to last me months.
