My mother will fall asleep while eating a bag of potato chips sometimes.  One time she even left a pint of ice cream on her table.  The two thing that bother me about it though are that I crave them sometimes and she leaves the leftover trash everywhere and blames me when there is a mess.  I barely eat, and if I do, I get rid of the garbage, so why would I do that?  Thanks mother :)",False,False
