Food, why do you do this to us?  Hope you get sanely through the holidays, I'm glad to hear you are enjoying some free time :))))",False,True

If it makes you feel any better, I‚Äôm in the same boat. While I LOVE LOVE LOVE not going to work for the past few days because of the holiday, it really throws me off and I‚Äôve been eating more than I‚Äôd like. I‚Äôm trying not to freak out because it‚Äôs barely been over my TDEE but still annoying to see the scale move up even though I know it‚Äôs water retention/food weight. üòí",False,False

If its going to cause you to spiral I would avoid the scale for 3-4 days to let your body adjust and get back to normal.   Drink a good amount of water and try to add in gentle cardio to get your digestive track moving.",False,False
