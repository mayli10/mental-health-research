Some guy messaged me asking for pics of my ""tiny body"". He said I couldn't have an ED because I weighed 91lbs and that's too fat for anorexia (like wut). I blocked him; he kept making new accounts. Eventually I deleted my Reddit account. ",False,False

Most of the people who do this are adult men, for some reason. Or the common hateful woman. It’s sick and disgusting. They target support groups and will reach out to you individually and use “coaching” as a way to lure you in. Most of the time they’ll end up demanding lewd pictures, to see your “progress”  One time I posted progress pictures in a group, and received a message less than an hour later. It was a guy commenting on my body, saying he couldn’t wait until I was thinner, and that he wanted to “coach” me. I quickly declined and he started to retaliate, saying if I didn’t accept his help I would end up fatter.  It’s SO important for young girls to avoid these scams. They take advantage of our disease, and twist it to manipulate young girls into talking to them and sending them pictures. It’s absolutely disgusting. ",False,False
