I think you shouldnâ€™t worry too much about it if it was a small amount, but definitely do not purge for a few days at least to let it heal if you can. If you donâ€™t let it heal, it will continue to get worse and worse, which is a bad bad outcome. Sending all my love to you ðŸ’ž",False,False

Since this happened yesterday, only in a small amouth tho, I wanted to just stop purging at least for the next time, but then I had a breakdown and b/p'ed about an hour ago and it happened again.

Dark coffee ground looking blood is a sign of internal bleeding and it means you should go to the ER, any blood is a bad sign. Better safe than slowly bleeding out.",False,False
