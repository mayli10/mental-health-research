The appointment is on Thursday and I will let the doctor's know they when I go I just don't want them relaying any info back to my family especially because my family told them every little detail about my ED so they already have this picture of me and I hate it. I will definitely keep you updated thank you for your response/help.,False,True

I'm scared of the doctor I'm seeing saying they want to admit me or honestly just seeing them in general. I don't want them to weigh me, get bloodwork, etc. I feel betrayed that my family would even do this because they specifically told this hospital about my ED and explained it in full detail.",False,True

If you tell they doctor that you don't want to do X or Y then the doctor won't do it you have to consent to all of the medical procedures that they do.  What exactly are you scared of?  Is it just seeing a doctor about your ED or some specific treatment?,False,False

When is the appointment? you could go and refuse to be weighed, have the blood tests, etc. and explain to the dr that you're not interested in help. keep us updated.",False,False
