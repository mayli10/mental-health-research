I got blood work done and my doc told me I really needed to be eating more protein. I attribute this far more to restricting than to being vegan; when I do eat I track my protein even more closely than my calories, I just too often don't eat. Anyway, went to the store and grabbed one of every vegan protein bar I could find as singles.  First off, 22g of protein from a bar is *ridiculous.* Even non-vegan bars tout freaking 8g as ""high protein."" The highest bars (even non-vegan) besides the nocow bars at my grocery store we're only 13g. So in terms of bang for your buck, hell yeah.  Second, less than 200 calories. Here I'm used to protein bars being in the 260 range. So a ton of protein, and far lower calorie than almost any other bars on the shelf?  Some of their bars are as high as 210 or as low-protein as 18g, but still significantly better than pretty much anything else.   The lemon meringue flavor, at 22g, has to most protein, but is at the low 190 for calories, and it is, unexpectedly (lemon-flavored protein bar? bleh) my favorite flavor. They have definitely got that  dry chalky protein bar flavor, no doubt about it, but they're far from inedible and to me it's even sort of an endeering taste. They're no granola bars but I do enjoy eating them.  So yeah. Kind of in love with these right now and wanted to share.",False,False

I had a therapy session today where my therapist went through the diagnostic criteria of AN. I qualified, she saw my Chronometer of the last week which was low restriction apart from a high restriction weekend (I eat more at my mom's place) and am underweight, but I don't purge. I said that made me feel fake, she said no, that it means that I have AN restrictive type. (Or at least, that's what it looks like, she's not an MD so she didn't feel qualified to give that definitive diagnosis). I still feel invalid, bc she asked if I wanted an eating disorder or if I wanted to self destruct. Which feels like she's accusing me of faking it. She didn't mean it that way, but it sure does feel like it. I don't think I want an ED, I have it according to her and I felt like I had it, but now I'm saying it, it feels like I'm lying.   She then said that she doesn't think there's just an ED talking, she thinks there's also a little man who doesn't want to live/self destruct and a little man that's autism. Unsurprising, I got the diagnosis once. I may deny it, but I got the diagnosis. By some people I met once who thought I was almost psychotic, at a point in my life where I was very strange.  Every time I tell a person about it or they read it in my file, they assume I'm in denial, just stubborn. Which is also an autism symptom. I doth protest too much, it's clear I do have autism. I wish they'd just shut up about it. I hope that if I keep silent about it, I never hear the word 'autism' in therapy again. She's a very nice person which actually helped me, she's great, I just struggle with feeling valid and heard.
