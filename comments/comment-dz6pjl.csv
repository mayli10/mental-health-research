I have a scale that I‚Äôve had since I was 14 that I‚Äôve been using and has gotten less accurate with time, it‚Äôs actually a pound or 2 higher than I usually am with my newer accurate scale which also measures my BMI and body fat% anddd a non digital scale.

And obviously make sure you calibrate each scale with a 10 pound weight each time you use your scales.   Then average it all out. :3 the ultimate Neurotic Weighing.
