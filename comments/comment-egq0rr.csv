Or else it'll be harder to brush and you'll lose a lot of hair when you do try to brush out the knots. So brush your hair regularly(and gently!).   - only wash your hair once/twice a week. Obviously this depends on your hair type and how greasy your hair tends to get. Personally since my hair is thin, it doesn't get dirty too quickly. Unless the day was super hot outside(which it isn't currently so that's good).  - take vitamins. Look into biotin and even just multivitamins can help. Taking normal multivitamins didn't necessarily increase my hair growth, but just prevented further hair loss.  - look into minoxidil. I'm not sure how it works 100% but they say apply it only to areas you already don't have hair in and in 4-6 months you'll start noticing hair growth.  - never brush your hair wet. And preferably detangle your hair before you shower. You can use a wide toothed comb though, I find that helps.  - obviously trying to eat as healthy as possible and getting as many good foods in your diet helps a lot. I understand we aren't exactly the healthiest but what I'm trying to say is, when you do eat, go for the healthiest, most nutrient dense foods out there.",False,False
