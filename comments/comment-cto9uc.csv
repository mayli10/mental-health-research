A while back i was with a friend and her husband and we locked ourselves out of an internal door, his keys were on the other side. The frame was super narrow but there was a small gap at the top between the ceiling. The color drained from his face when he realised we were stuck, so I offered to hop over the door if he lifted me up. Got 5 kicks out of that event, one for him lifting me up like I was an empty teapot, two for balancing on this super thin frame and not breaking it, three for fitting through the gap, four for dropping down the 2 meters or so to the other side without a big crash and five for the impressed ‚Äúthat was amazing!‚Äù reactions from them both for me saving the day üòè my curse masqueraded as a superpower that day üòÇ",False,False

I don't have panic attacks anymore and don't really remember much from back when I did, but I definitely feel better sitting with my legs up in some way, such as crossed or with my knees up. I wouldn't doubt that if I wasn't pacing during a panic attack that I probably curled up into a fetal position somewhere. Sometimes I just like to lie down that way still. It's cozy.",False,False

My ED has me obsessed with being the smallest again.  EDIT: Talking about that spot by the couches you mentioned reminds me of my home growing up. I would sometimes crawl under the end table in the corner of the living room where the air conditioner was. There was a creepy clown statue there though. For some reason people used to like giving my mom little clown statues as gifts and I guess one time somebody decided to give her a big one. The hands and face and stuff were made of porcelain and I think a chunk was missing out of the head. It just kind of sat there like a dead body propped up against a wall. The AC made that corner super chill though. And being under the end table made it cozy.",False,False

My husband turns down the AC to 70 when we sleep, so I have to use a sheet &amp; 1-2 comforters depending on my level of restriction... and the weight of multiple blankets seems to have a calming effect. I turn the heat on in the AM right after I wake up because I am freezing, and whenever I sit on the the couch to do my ‚Äúwake up‚Äù routine (caffeine, vape, AM supplements, Kratom), I must curl up with two fleece blankets, and the softest one has to be closest to my body. Once I‚Äôve warmed up, I switch to one blanket that I must use anytime I sit on the couch, especially when eating. When I‚Äôm out in public and anxious, I definitely self-soothe by keeping a loose cardigan on hand and cocooning myself in it.",False,False

I just feel safer curled into a ball in an enclosed space.

Same reason I have to sleep with my full duvet no matter the weather; being fully enveloped by blankets makes me feel less vulnerable. And when I‚Äôm anxious I tend to curl up with my knees to my chest even in open spaces, on couches, in chairs etc. All my friends can tell how much anxiety I‚Äôm feeling by checking whether I have my feet on the ground or on the seat of my chair. Idk maybe it‚Äôs a borderline thing lol",False,False
