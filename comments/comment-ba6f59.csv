The thing is that for a normal person that has gone through puberty with a healthy mindset around food together with no other issues that might've skewed with their hunger to an abnormal degree involuntarily (depression etc) would probably settle on an average weight that works perfectly for them and the life they live. For us? It's really not that easy.,False,False

That would cause the gain to stall. So like if your TDEE right now is 1600 and you always eat 2100, your gain would stall once you reached the point I’m currently at, because my TDEE is 2100",False,False

If you kept increasing your calories to a level above your TDEE, you’d keep gaining weight, but if you just kept eating the same amount of calories every day, you’d eventually reach a point where that level of calories was the same as your maintenance calories.",False,False
