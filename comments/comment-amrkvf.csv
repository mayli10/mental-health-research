Sure a diagnosis would validate me temporarily, but that's about it.  From what I gather, for disordered behaviour to be technically considered a disorder it's important whether the behaviour ""significantly"" interferes with your ""normal"" functioning - does it make you avoid social situations, fail at school, feel depressed etc?  You may not realise that this interference is present and assume that a thing is routine and normal within some ED logic, (e.g. ""I binged hence I must purge"", ""I can't go to the party cause I ate this sandwich""). And also if you can tell that your own reasoning is inadequate but you still go by it, you probably have issues, like you're stuck where you're not supposed to be and probably need help.",False,False

Never diagnosed and I avoid my dr like the plague and since I function fine I just maintain that *it's not really a problem right?*  I'm technically underweight but I don't look it. My swings of undereating/binging/depression/anxiety all seem to cycle just enough to balance that it's not concerning to anyone. So I guess I would have to reach out for help myself (not sure it would result in a diagnosis as it never did in the past) BUT I feel like aside from validation why bother admitting to it if I don't really want to get rid of it? I'm not sure that makes any sense. Anyway curious about those who actually were diagnosed and how it happened. ",False,False
