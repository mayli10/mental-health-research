Like it's intentionally absurd so I can't get upset by it and it's actually kind of reassuring because it's like, oh yeah, if the fashion and beauty industry is trying to tell me that I'm undesirable bc of my size it's like... but hardly anyone actually fits into that size without detrimental side effects so we surely can't ALL be undesirable right",False,False

Martine McCutcheon, Natalie’s actress, had been regularly shamed in tabloids for her weight, most notably her thighs. The film satirises this by showing Natalie get attacked for her size throughout, despite being one of the thinnest characters, demonstrating how ridiculous the tabloids were being.",False,False

I hate when writers opt for stuff like that.   Like in Love Actually I get upset at the references to the Natalie character having “thighs the size of big tree trunks” and “a sizeable ass” and another woman identifying her as”the chubby one”. It makes me want to cry. Like the character isn’t a waif but just....I hate my thighs so much and she’s way more beautiful than I’ll ever be so if *she’s* getting dissed left and right what chance to I have?,False,False
