That can help when it gets you to eat- or hurt if it pushes you into comparisons, purging, and restriction. If you don’t address it and set up some ground rules, things aren’t gonna get better.  Good news is if you do address things, you two can support each other getting better or at least not getting worse! Having someone to eat with and someone to prevent being alone when you feeling like spiraling into a binge can be a real lifesaver. Living with people can cause you to pick up their habits, so make sure that the habits you’re adopting are healthy",False,False
