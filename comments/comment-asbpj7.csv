If you ever want to try b12 it won’t hurt as long as your potassium is ok. It’s worth researching. My levels were A-Ok but I still had nerve damage :/ ,False,False

I had deficiencies in almost every other nutrient though, mainly thiamine, dangerously low potassium, BCE vitamins. Not sure what specifically caused the nerve damage to this day, they kept me in the hospital involuntarily to restore potassium first (heart stopping?) and then thiamine. ",False,True

I completely relate to the not being able to lift foot or toes bit, to this day I can’t wear normal shoes as my toes get stuck. I’m glad it’s healed a little, I hope that’s the case for me too. From what I was told, as long as you take vitamins religiously your condition should improve. I hope you get better soon! It sucks to see how much your body has suffered from the damage, but hopefully it’s restorable because no one wants to live like this x",False,True

I’ve had anorexia for seven years and it took this for me to find out that eating disorders can cause nerve damage. I know when you’re ill, the last thing you care about is taking care of your body. But this is what happens when you don’t. Stupid little things, like thiamine, potassium. They’re so important! Muscle atrophy; my muscles in hands and feet were wasting away. I didn’t know that before. I think it’s just important to check up with a doctor, because you wouldn’t know these things are happening to you if all you care about is your ED. I feel stuck, but it helps to post and talk to people here. So thank you x",False,True

One night I was gaming with my friends, drinking alcohol and having a good time. I got really sleepy and went to lay down for a second and just crashed. When I woke up my right foot was completely numb. My toes were numb and the top of my foot leading up to my ankle was numb as well. I could not lift my big toe at all or flex my foot upwards. Sometimes when I walked I would get a sharp pain and my foot would feel clenched. I let stay that way for 2 months before going to see a doctor. She wasnt the best doctor and when my results came back , I only had really low vitamin D. I ended up switching doctors and got an Xray very quickly after explaining everything. I'm only 25 so they took action right away. My doctor ended up requesting a emg and turns out I had peroneal neuropathy.  I stopped going back to the hospital because my Bills were piling on. But the nerves in my foot ended up slowly healing. I still have some pain in my leg near the ankle in certain positions but overall, it's better. A few months later we got a terrible snow storm and I went out to help my friend shovel snown from around her car. When we came back inside I had a terrible burning pain on the back of my left foot. It almost felt like I had mild frost bite. I was in pain for a little over a week and a small broil had formed. It healed over time but now the heel of my foot is numb. Just as my right foot was before.   I know it's due to how badly I treat my body with restricting, binging, and purging. But now I'm ignoring all the the telltale signs. ",False,False

That’s the thing, my condition was meant to improve over a couple of months or even days with intravenous nutrition, I had so many supplements, had my levels restored - no results. That’s why the neurologist said the damage is possibly permanent. My right foot has improved ever so slightly, probs due to me persistently exercising it, but overall it seems to be getting worse. My hands get numb more often, they cramp up in the weirdest positions and it’s a struggle to hold up a spoon or pen sometimes. It’s deffo so so scary and it’s so odd that I don’t hear about this happening in the ED community more often? The neurologist kept reassuring me that this was textbook malnutrition neuropathy and I just don’t understand what to make of it ?? I hope your numbness gets better x",False,True

I had compression stockings on during a week stay in the hospital last March for something unrelated (GI prob which affects nutrient absorption too) and a week after I got home, I had the exact same problem.  I kept falling and ruining my knees cause of dropfoot.  I considered walking with knee pads cause I was gonna break my knee cap eventually.   Then I was visiting an alternative med doc (unrelated visit) a few months later who noticed bruises on my knee and asked and immediately started me on IV ALA.  I didn’t have much hope for it but I swear the next day I regained about 15 degrees in my dorsiflexion.  Turns out the compression stocking had rolled down to right under my knee and had pinched the nerve there.  I also had an appt with an actual neurologist who told me there was nothing I could do to speed up the recovery and it heals the way it heals and after 6 mo, it’ll be as good as it’ll get, whether I walk normally again or not.  So 6 mo is the critical period within which the nerve has a chance to heal. That was back in July.  I began walking normally within 3 weeks of ALA, and stopped the treatment after that.  Neurologist also said it happens to old ladies who cross their legs over and over again for their whole lives.    Idk if it was the ALA or just coincidence that my nerves fully recovered naturally within 3 weeks of treatment, but I’d look into it if I was you.  I honestly wish you the best and please let me know how it turns out for you.  Xoxox",False,False

I really think it’s related to my ED. I’ve been having what I’m afraid is nerve or maybe muscle issues in my lower back lately. I think there could definitely be a connection.  I have nerve damage in my right foot, too, from over exercising at one of the heights of my ED, and it was so bad at one point, I had an air cast and crutches because I could not bend my foot or put any pressure on it. It’s better now, but it was rough. ",False,False
