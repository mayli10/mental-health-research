What is it that causes them? Boredom? Extreme hunger? Is it emotional eating? Recognize what triggers binges, take steps to avoid these triggers from happening. And if the triggers are inevitable, find healthier ways to cope with them instead. If it's boredom, you can take up a new little hobby after your surgey to keep you distracted. Something like starting a new tv show to watch, a new podcast, a new video game to keep yourself busy.   How do you get your binge food? There are certain foods I can't buy or keep in the house (like packages of chips, cookies, etc) because I know the moment an urge to binge comes on, I'll devour it. I also tend to order binge food a lot, so I have to stay logged out of food delivery accounts or sometimes straight up block them from my computer.",False,False

Don't restrict. If you eat a balanced meal or snack every 3-4 hours you're a lot less likely to binge. Particularly while recovering from surgery, if you'd like to avoid binging, the best way to do that is by eating all of the food groups and by eating enough food regularly throughout the day. I don't know what eating disorder you struggle with. Most people find that regardless, a balanced diet helps with the urges.",False,False

Plus I just don't buy snacks anymore, mainly meals that take 30+ minutes to cook in the oven or raw ingredients that have to be esembled. Helps me figure out if I'm actually hungry or just eating out of boredom",False,False
