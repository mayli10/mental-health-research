The blood test came back saying I'm low in active B12, a vitamin that nurtures and stimulates nerve growth and health.  You may also be low in Magnesium,  with has similar properties and is essential to the proper function of your nerves.  They are simple blood draws that any gp can order and I highly suggest you do. Good luck!  ",False,False

Do you ever get your bloods done?  I used to get the pins and needles and it was lack of B12, and my partner who doesn't even have an ED has it too.  I just take prescribed supplements and he gets a monthly injection.  I don't think the nausea is linked to that though, but I get nausea a lot because I restrict too and I guess it's plain ol' hunger.  If you don't mind seeing a GP or other medic professional, you should probably get your bloods checked.  If you get the pins and needles in just your butt and legs then maybe that's because you've got a bony ass and legs.  One of the things I hate most about an ED is how uncomfortable sitting and lying down.  Wooden chairs and benches are a no no.  If the pins n needles aren't localised though, I'd definitely advise you to get it checked out.  If you'd rather avoid that, at least look into a good supplement . Our nutrition levels are going to be poor with restricting and even though it's not as great as suddenly being able to eat sooper dooper quantities of vitamin rich food, supplements are good for harm reduction.",False,False

Yes, your metabolism slows a bit when you're starving yourself, but you won't gain weight because of it. You may, at times, lose weight a little more slowly on account of the ""low-power mode"" I mentioned but that's about it. Your body cannot just *make* fat out of nothing, so the whole ""eating under 1200 cals actually makes you gain weight!"" line is entirely incorrect. If that were true, anorexics wouldn't become dangerously underweight.   What can happen, though, is that you may become more inclined to binge, and you'll think more about food. Those are old school survival mechanisms that urged early humans to seek out food even when exhausted by famine. Those things can make you eat more, which can make you gain weight, but the deficient itself won't.   What calories are consumed are designated toward things like the functioning of vital organs rather than keeping your fingers/toes warm and regulating a menstrual cycle, or example, and digestion generally slows down so that what energy is taken in can be more slowly dolled out. this is part of why restrictive EDs cause constipation and feelings of fullness.   In short: staving jacks you up, but it can't fatten you up. weight loss is effectively a simple mathematic equation. if you consume fewer calories than you use, you *will* lose weight, but as you get smaller and sicker the weight may come off more slowly, mostly because smaller bodies burn less calories. someone who is underweight would have a lower maintainence calorie number than someone of the same height and activity level, despite the fact that biologically speaking the underweight person ought to be eating more. think of it like paying less for a small fry than you would for a large fry.   I hope that all makes sense. I'm high asf fuck and very preoccupied with thoughts of fries. ",False,False

I‚Äôd love to hear more about this!

The likely culprits are, for the pins and needles-  1) Low blood pressure/poor circulation. This is a big problem when you're restricting. You're body enters a ""low-power mode"" kind of thing (NOT starvation mode, that shit is about as real as the Loch Ness Monster) and begins shutting down less-essential functions like maintaining blood flow to the extremities, regulating body temp, etc. The best way to combat it is by moving around, and transitioning *slowly* from standing to sitting to lying, etc.   2) On a more serious note, this could also indicate an electrolyte imbalance, especially when paired with the nausea. When you're restricting, and especially if you purge, you lose those vital little guys that carry electrical impulses throughout your body, including your heart. Electrolyte imbalance (usually potassium) causes everything from brain fog and those pins and needles, to muscle cramps/spasms, to heart palpitations and heart attack. It's always a good idea for anyone with an eating disorder to have their blood drawn, or at least take potassium supplements, but unfortunately if it's a very bad deficiency stores aren't allowed to stock a high enough potency to correct it. I know going to the doctor is a scary thing for all of us, but unless you have a very, very low weight or express suicidal thoughts they won't hospitalize you, and having a health plan in place (like prescribed supplements and blood monitoring) will also help keep you out of the hospital long-term.   To address the nausea-  This could be as simple as acid-indigestion/heart burn. Your body makes the same amount of stomach acid whether you're giving it something work on or not, so if you're not eating enough, it can make you nauseas. This could also be caused by low blood pressure or a deficiency of some sort, including potassium. If you also notice that you generally feel tired/unwell and sometimes crave strange things like ice or freshly rained on dirt (i thought i was CRAZY when the wet clay on the hill outside my house started looking tasty) that could point to anemia, which is super common in women, especially those of us afflicted with EDs. Try eating more dairy in your comfortable with it, or try antacids. Those things should help rule out or confirm the acid issue, and if you still feel bad I really, really encourage you to get yourself checked out.   Stay safe hun. You deserve to be safe.
