I’m the same height and I always thought mine were way lower. It would be cool to have that higher number for sure.,False,False

Best way to get the way you want to get is strength training, not weight loss,  maybe you already know that though. There is body dysmorphia that can apply to people who build muscle compulsively as well. You sound perfectly physically healthy. If you would feel comfortable you could SAFELY lose 15 lbs, you don't need to whatsoever. I'm certain if you gained weight you would be healthy as well, considering your exercise regimen. Unfortunately I can't say much more, I don't know anything past this.  Ultimately though this clearly isn't about health for you. You are as healthy as can be, you could do with maintaining at this point. The science is there to prove it, but an eating disorder doesn't care about that. The illness skews our rationality to where logic doesn't make sense or it isn't enough. I don't think you need a nutritionist for now and pray that you never do, but you should see a professional about your feelings. You're beautiful because you're alive and individual and fascinating, but me telling you that doesn't do anything. In order to love yourself you need to treat your body with respect and admiration, especially the inside bits. The outside bits don't matter. When somebody really loves you like a partner or a friend or even yourself they will see you as beautiful no matter what because you're you, just an icon that represents your personality. Though, if we're being shallow here, I'm sure you honestly are gorgeous, especially given your height :p",False,False

Your intake seems healthy enough, so long as you're getting proper nutrition. Even though it would eventually slow your weight loss I don't think you should decrease that intake. If you're at a very high starting weight (BMI 40+, per say) then a deficit of 1500 calories is ""fine."" It's really on the edge of ""you should be talking to a professional about monitoring this."" I hesitate to say that because a deficit of 1000 calories (which is considered ""healthy"" weight loss) can be extremely unhealthy in people with low BMIs and TDEEs. In short, it depends on how many calories you actually eat in a day and what the nutritional value of those calories are.  Intermittent fasting, which is what you're unintentionally doing, hasn't been proven good or bad as far as I know. Personally I think small snacks throughout the day is better but I don't actually have any evidence to support this claim. Maybe in the long term it will help you maintain good digestive health because you're keeping it regular? Eating at regular times (IF or not) is great because AFAIK your body loves routines and thrives off of them, ex., Sleeping at a normal time and getting regular exercise.   However none of this can really determine whether or not you have some kind of disorder. What matters is how you _feel_ about it. How do you feel about food and your body image? That's really what sets all of this apart from someone who doesn't really eat right, and someone who should be seeking serious help.  From what I can tell you seem to be on the brink of falling down a very dangerous rabbit hole. Don't let that scare you away from a healthier lifestyle. You have to walk that ""line"" of health. Being scared of restricting might lead you to overeat, though I can't make the assumption that you're overweight as you might just be really active. If you're scared of being overweight you may diet in a way that is extremely unhealthy, even deadly. You need a balance of the right amount of good food, and that balance hinges on your perception of yourself.  TL;DR: Eat as much as you are eating but eat a varied diet. Get more exercise and when you do exercise eat more to compensate for it, keeping it at a 1500 deficit is probably good if you're big, probably bad if you're an athlete. You should generally eat at regular times. None of your habits say you definitively have a disorder, just how you feel. Being healthy is hard but the key is to want to be healthy and wanting to treat your body right.   That's just my two cents anyway",False,False
