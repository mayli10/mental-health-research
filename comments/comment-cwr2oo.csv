When the fat is removed from milk that inherently means you’re not absorbing the same amount of vitamins.  Also, I’m about to be a California hippie and suggest you consider raw milk, if you’re okay with the disease risks (and if it’s legal in your area). I no longer consume animal products, but if I had to consume milk, I’d want it to be totally unprocessed (ie, vitamin C and enzymes intact) and from a small local source.",False,False

What’s more interesting about IGF-1 in milk is that studies indicate that people who drink milk have higher levels of IGF-1 in their bloodstream, possibly indicating that something about milk triggers those who drink milk to produce more of this protein. IGF-1 triggers growth overall: it tells cells of all sorts, be they bone or tissue or blood, to divide and duplicate. IGF-1 is a major contributor to a person’s vertical growth, and IGF-1 supplements are used to treat kids with height disorders.",False,False
