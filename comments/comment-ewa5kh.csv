I certainly do, and I've seen other people posting/talking about that, so it seems like it's not uncommon. I just think most don't actually act on it like the girl in the post did.",False,False

I think often people posting things like this...they’re trying to fill some sort of void. To feel a certain way. Feel seen, loved, important, valid. To tell themselves a certain story of who they are. To sort of ask for help without the risk and vulnerability of truly asking for help. I’m not suggesting it’s estimable behavior, but when I can tie it back into the emotional struggle we all go through, it helps me find the empathy that allows me to...gently detach? They’re a human just as lost in the weeds as I am. Maybe for now something to consider is unfollowing their story?",False,False
