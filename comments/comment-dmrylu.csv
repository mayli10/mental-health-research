A good therapist can ask questions and help you better understand what’s going on and how to acquire skills to start reducing the distress/suffering. They have the training and neutral perspective to see the big picture that we often struggle to perceive on our own.   Though thinking about it, I guess I don’t view disclosing stuff to my therapist as ‘letting them in’...maybe because it’s a clinical relationship? I do find it essential to trust that they’ll keep my info confidential and that they’re not going to mete out judgmental bs.",False,False
