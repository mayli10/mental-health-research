I find myself in almost the exact same situation so often. I hate declining food at peoples houses cause I feel impolite but it always leads to a breakdown later after I calculate how many calories I've consumed. Also not knowing how many cals are in other people's home cooked meals is freaky. Keep in mind that one day of high restricting is STILL RESTRICTING and its impossible you will gain any weight.

It may not be as big as you wanted, but now your glycogen stores are restored and you'll have more energy for a workout tomorrow, or a deficit further on in the week. You're gonna be fine, I promise. Be kind to yourself, you haven't failed today ðŸ’—",False,False
