I would suggest going to those restaurants and trying something you've never tried before! Someone here once suggested asking for a box as soon as you get your food and putting half of it in there. That way, you have a small amount of food for dinner and can have a small amount for another dinner the next night. Saves in calories and money. And remember that going over 300 calories is NOT the end of the world. That is such a small amount, and your body will thank you if you go over, even by a small amount.  I hope it works out for you &lt;3",False,False
