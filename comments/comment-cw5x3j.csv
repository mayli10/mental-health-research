They’ll *call* it help, but it isn’t. Shoving someone full of food until they’re overweight and giving them food-related trauma by stealing their bodily autonomy only makes everything worse for most people. The psychiatric industry doesn’t take eating disorders seriously. All they care about is making you look like you’re fine.  That said, some therapists are good and will help you no matter your weight. I’d recommend shopping around. Yeah, a good bit of them are absolute trash and regurgitate the same ol’ bullshit, but there *are* good therapists out there and there *is* hope.",False,False
