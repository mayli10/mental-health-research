I started thinking I might be bisexual in 7th grade. By 11th grade I identified as lesbian, by freshman year of Uni bisexual again, and now I identify as straight and think that’s who I am. But then sometimes parts of me will explore the idea of women so while I don’t identify as bisexual anymore I know there is a possibility and mostly I just try to not focus on my identity too much with it all, while still maintaining emotional honesty with myself.   I do think sexuality can be fluid for some people and express itself differently depending on the person or circumstances. Maybe you are a lesbian but you are attracted to this one man. There are a lot of anecdotes of women who think they are straight until they meet some new coworker or something who pulls out a new feeling they didn’t know they had in them before.   I think a lot of sexuality comes down to dynamics and some people are more attracted to the dynamics they have with women and some more to men and this can be how some are simply gay, lesbian, or straight. I’m not saying that sexual orientation is completely this, but maybe it is completely for some people, a bit for others, not at all for others.   It’s also possible you might just have a none sexual infatuation with him. I have had some insanely strong obsessions (nothing inappropriate I just mean thinking about them a lot and standard infatuation feelings) with certain women before even though I never would have wanted to be sexual with them. Some people just cast wonder into me for who they are.",False,False
