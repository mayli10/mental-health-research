I’ve been playing around with mine with my psychiatrist for the past 3-4 years and noticed some things that have helped me because I used to have the same exact issue. Everyone would say their ADHD medicine would curb their hunger but unfortunately for years mine led to more binging and even hunger pains to the point where I couldn’t sleep. I understand everyone’s body is different, but personally for me switching from extended release to instant release helped a lot. For some reason, my intense hunger when I’m coming down from the medication dropped immensely when I switched. I also noticed it helped improve my sleep. If that isn’t an option, try possibly taking it at a different time. I’ve also noticed taking mine earlier than I used to has helped curb the hunger as well. Snacking lightly throughout the day helps too!   But just know you’re not alone with this ❤️",False,False
