Bad things that happen to us aren't always bad. I don't know what happened to you, or what the bad news was, but I've had enough bad shit happen to me I think to justify me saying bad things aren't bad things all the time. Bad and good are outdated concepts, the idea that things or people can be boiled down to ""bad or good."" Maybe it's an old survival trick, because obviously some things should be steered away from for being ""bad or good,"" but most of the time our lives aren't in immediate danger from these ""bad"" things, so there's a way to think through it? If you think I'm being cruel or that I sound stupid, or I don't know what I'm talking about, I started off my life with being abused my both my parents (sexually by my dad, and physically by my mom after they separated). I've learned to accept this rough start as a good thing, kind of. It hurt me physically at the time, and years later it hurt me emotionally, but it made me grow. It made me into who I am right now, which is an okay person. So I guess whatever bad thing happened to you is just a learning experience, a way to figure out how to deal with it in the future, because it might happen again. If every time a bad thing happened to us and we starved ourselves over it, we would die (duh). So figuring out a way to think about what happened to make it into a good experience is going to be very helpful to you. With our illness we like to feel like victims, because being a victim means you were wronged and it was out of your control, and now you deserve attention and sympathy. Being a victim is not a good thing, and we know that, but I think secretly we love being victims (we meaning every human, not just us on this subreddit). I have no idea what my point is with saying this, but I guess it's just to find a way to look at what happened from the perspective of someone who hasn't been victimized by the experience. Idk, good luck with life.",False,False
