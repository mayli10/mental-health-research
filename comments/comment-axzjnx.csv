People don’t understand how **fucking** hard EDs are. “Just eat.” At a binger, “Just eat normal.” Would you tell a damn alcoholic “Oh just stop after one drink!” No you fucking wouldn’t because it’s an ADDICTION  It sucks that with EDs, we can’t just cut out all food-related things and never look back. No, we actually need fucking food to live and we have roommates on a diet and Aunt Beckys asking for weight loss tips and hot people being hot everywhere and like it’s not their fault but still it’s a trigger then there’s treat yo self culture plastering pictures of pretty cupcakes all over my feed and our glamorization of productivity that ends in “Wow I’ve been so busy I forgot to eat!”JESUS CHRIST ON A GLUTEN FREE CRACKER CAN’T A GAL JUST ESCAPE",False,False
