All the women in my family have pretty bad periods (heavy bleeding, irregularity, painful cramps, bloating, etc). The only time mine were regular was when I was on the pill, but once I became sexually active, I wanted a form of birth control that I wouldn't accidentally forget to take. Now, I have the arm implant, but it doesn't regulate my period unfortunately.   Thank you for the concern though; it did make me feel cared for :) ",False,True
