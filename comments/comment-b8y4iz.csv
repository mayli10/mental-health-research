Well the sugar free cinnamon dolce doesn’t have any calories in it. The coconut milk in there would probably be about 60 calories as a highball estimate.   The espresso is 5.   I’d say about 65!!!!   It tastes like a sweet cinnamon not a spicy one.   Hope this helped.,False,True

Being around food and drink for 40+ hours a week feels super triggering to me. Always and forget. I e never gotten over it. It’s either a trigger to binge or a trigger to restrict.   I love the job so much. The customers make it worth it. It’s a fun career path. I feel like I’ll do it forever and someday be a district manager of Starbucks.   Working in the environment is very fast paced and can be high stress. I have a lot of anxiety about doing my job perfectly but I can never let it show.   My least favorite thing is when customer comment on my body. It freaks me out a lot. I’ve lost a lot of weight this year so far and I get all sorts of strange comments on a regular basis and it sucks. ,False,True

Very very UW person who gets extra whip, extra pumps of syrup and whole milk. Plus pastries. Then I watch them snarf it all down then scamper to my single stall bathroom.

The funniest thing that ever happened to me while working there recently would have to be when I literally threw my phone like Thor’s hammer into a wall. I’m a pretty professional person at work. I’m on a career path to be a manager in a few years so I tend to be serious at work. But one time I was just walking along and was taking my phone out of my back pocket when it slipped out of my hand and got hurled into a wall.

If your allergies are extreme then make a special request that the barista washes their hands and grabs you a fresh cup from a new sleeve with maybe like an unopened milk of your choice.   I have a lot of experience dealing with allergies due to a previous job- but most partners do not.   Yesterday I did a total station breakdown for a woman who’s daughter hadn’t gotten anything at Starbucks since we changed the blender policy. I sanitized the blender parts for her while she waited and then made a blended strawberry lemonade with ingredients I got from the back that hadn’t gotten as close to the allergen [nuts].

I drank only unsweetened green tea, and got really obsessive about rinsing out the shaker to make sure there was no residual syrup that could contaminate my drink. Over the past five years, I’ve gone through b/p and restriction cycles, and I feel that work encourages both, especially as a primary closer with access to allllll the outdated food. But I can also just mainline six ristretto shots on every break and not eat my whole shift, y’know?  As far as customers go, I 100% feel you.
