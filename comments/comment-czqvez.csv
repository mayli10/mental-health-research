His response? “Well you aren’t hospitalized or at a scary weight so it’s prob just being super self conscious.”  He also is morbidly obese so... he doesn’t know what healthy eating looks like so I think he thinks I’m just health conscious.,False,False

Yes there is times when he thinks all I need to do is eat and then I’ll be fine but the best thing I have found is that if you’re going to open up and be honest, be utterly transparent.   He knows the roots, the triggers, safe food, fear food, my mannerisms (sometimes he can detect a relapse before i’m fully aware it’s happening) and I am so grateful that I did not try to hide it this time.   It seems scary to reveal such a terrible personal secret but you will feel so much better. Just remember to properly educate your SO on what an ED truly is and how to handle it and how yours differs from others. The feeling of being able to rant about the struggles and getting positive and loving responses to bring up your spirit is so much better than keeping a part of you a secret.",False,False

I just moved to college and I had no idea that if I said 'yo I fucking starve myself' they would be obligated to tell my parents. And im sorry you feel that way, it sucks how everything warps our mindset so much. They're so incredibly isolating",False,True

Couldn’t even tell a therapist either haha. Bf and I recently moved in, and I was super fucking stressed out if I should tell him, but I decided not to. I just don’t feel like he’ll understand or believe me. He knows about my depression, but I don’t even think that he believes me, honestly. If he doesn’t believe my depression, then I extremely doubt he would believe that I have an ED lol (normal weight here). It’s not like he’s not supportive or anything.. idk. Maybe it’s just my mental issues making me think he doesn’t believe me lol. I’ll definitely tell him if we start seriously considering marriage (or if I get to my ugw). Otherwise I’ll just keep it to myself for now :(",False,False

I really value honesty in a relationship and I hate keeping secrets, especially ones that essentially dominate my entire life. Thank you so much &lt;3",False,True

I don’t even think my past boyfriends would have thought I was weird or crazy, if anything I can only imagine them being understanding and supportive. But the thing is, my eating disorder is undeniably a part of who I am, and it has had a great impact on the way I act and think. Hiding that from someone is not only a lot of work, but in a way is also dishonest. I felt like I couldn’t really be myself when I was hiding my eating disorder, and it made me feel disconnected from my SO.   I think that if you really love him, it is better to be up front about it sooner rather than later. If he doesn’t react well, then maybe he’s not the right guy. And it’s better to find that out earlier on too!",False,False

He's actually the reason I was able to take a decent shot at recovery. I gained 25lbs and now I'm relapsing, which he's aware of and has been very cool about.  He is exceptionally patient, kind, always wants me to talk to him, and really only gets upset when I'm SUPER hard on myself. Other than that he just listens and tries to make things easier on me. He is an angel and seriously the only person I feel comfortable ""breaking the rules"" with, I am much healthier with him.  HOWEVER I have also had a partner that was awful and controlling about it, one who actually encouraged me, and one who tried to swoop in and fix everything. All of those relationships were low-to-highkey shitshows.   So I'd say it depends mostly on how the relationship is in the first place. If there's a control struggle or some poor communication/short fuse element, bringing up an ED is like throwing a match. But if you're in a healthy place and willing to both be honest and rational, it can be very helpful.",False,False

I've been with my SO for almost five years now, and I finally came clean about my ED at about the two year mark. it's definitely scary opening up and being vulnerable and i was so afraid that he would think i'm crazy or weird and want to leave me.  fortunately none of that has happened and since then he has been the biggest support system ever. he knows now to be patient when i don't eat, and he can calm me down in the middle of binge episodes (thus lessening the damaga tHANK GOD). he knows all my triggers and doesn't push me to eat when i really can't. I'm slowly trying to get and be better and he's been really helpful with recovery too.  imo, if you be honest with your feelings and your needs in a partner (ie. someone who supports you, someone who helps you manage your ED and not force you to recover/encourage your behaviors) that will make your relationship so much better. for so long i wanted to break up with my SO because I felt so uncomfortable going on dates or throwing away the food he buys me, but now i don't have to worry about that because he knows what i need or want.  i hope this helps, even a little, and best of luck if you decide to tell your SO about it. i'm rooting for you &lt;3",False,False
