I feel lucky that while I have a lot of anxiety, it's not crippling).   I feel better when I tell myself that people don't enjoy looking at ugly things and that they aren't staring at me because I'm ugly. Maybe they're curious or tired of staring at the wall so they want to look at something new. IDK. Maybe try to find a different plausible reason for their behavior; it's at least a little comforting for me when I have intrusive thoughts.",False,False

People would look at me and my body dysmorphia would tell me it's because I'm doing everything wrong and because I am a huge failure and because I am fat  and ugly as fuck.   I get this feeling so often in public. Like I am feeling already awful and I am just walking around (to the car or home or anywhere) and someone looks at me and I am instantly tearing up.,False,False
