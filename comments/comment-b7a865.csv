Your posts have been very thought-provoking and I appreciate that.   I'm aware that everyone reacts to ayahuasca differently, but judging by your ED history I think you'll be safe from lapsing into BN. Personally mine began with restrictive AN, and when I started eating again to appease my parents, the hunger led to bingeing which led to purging. I stopped purging when I was 20; my ED morphed into exercise bulimia with periods of restriction, and la purga didn't at all trigger a relapse into that behavior.   Congratulations on overcoming your CS by the way!   My inbox is always open if you would like to discuss the convergence of ayahuasca and ED further, and I'm very glad that sharing my experiences could be a help to you. Wishing you the best on your next journey, may it be introspective and transformative. You got this! 💚",False,False

I never ED purged (tried in the early days, failed and gave up) but after 25 years of AN and a good 10 years or so severe CS addiction I’m so afraid to embrace la purga in case it triggers BN which I’ve thus far managed to avoid.   I’ve purged twice out of eight ceremonies and both times I hated every moment of it. I’ve been reluctant to surrender in case I feel good, everyone talks about how clean they feel after la purga and I’m afraid to get hooked on that and want to keep doing it in daily life, and it becomes an addiction just like CS which took so long to quit 😬  Thanks for your reply it does make sense and I really appreciate it. I will let you know next month how I got on 🙏🏽",False,False

Something I remember about my first experience purging was being hit by ED flashbacks and this profound feeling of deja vu, like this is something that has happened countless times before. Which isn't far from the truth, ha. It helps me to meditate and delineate the processes that spark the ED compulsions; in my case I would purge food in order to rid myself of the dirtyness, shame, and guilt I have come to associate with eating following childhood trauma. But of course it never fixed the issue, just formed a feedback loop of addiction. In the case of la purga, it not only alleviates the strong emotions that bubble up during the experience, but there is also a subtle mechanism, so to speak, that neutralizes and expells the psychospiritual ""parasite"" which drives the maladaptive behavior. There is also the notion that surrender is necessary during a psychedelic experience so that it can unfold to its greatest potential, so that the inner work can be done uninhibited by the worldly ego (once during a ceremony I was having a rough time trying to purge, lots of dry heaves but nothing coming up, I asked the shaman if I could induce vomiting and it was a big no-no). This can be contrasted with the frantic, control-driven nature of the ED purge. Not sure if this wall of text makes any sense lol.   Please do send me a PM when you discuss this subject with your shaman, I am very interested to see what they say about it! ",False,False

I started having them spontaneously and frequently when I was in my teens. But when I tried to talk about them people were pretty dismissive so I just thought they were a fun thing I could do and didn’t think much of them otherwise.  They pretty much disappeared in my undergrad years. Then I started having them spontaneously but not as frequently in my late 20s (maybe once a month). That was when I started investigating and discovered LD and that you could do things to practice. Now (32) I have them about once a week. Def less frequent than my teens, but progress.  In hindsight, after learning about reality checks, I think my OCD contributed to my more natural ability to LD as a kid. I def see a correlation between the severity of current OCD symptoms and frequency of LD because of the increase in checking behaviors. At least something good comes out of it? 🙄  That’s kind of crazy about the light switches and remotes. I’ve never bothered to try but think I’d expect them to work like normal. I usually just think ‘wish it was brighter/darker in here’ and it usually happens. Now I really want to try a switch in my next LD.",False,False

They just started suddenly and soon I was having them every single night. I never practiced for them, I didn’t even know there was a name for them back then. They stopped in my early 20s and I didn’t have a single one again until recently (after like a 15 year hiatus!) after meeting someone who’s an LD pro and she told me about reality checks and tips. I often forget to do checks I check like a few times a week, and I’m having two or three LD a month and astral projection once every six months or so.   Light switches: they don’t work in dreams!
