But it's not like I can actually eat by myself because that will obviously make me fat,False,False

Maybe in a slightly different way but I'm still essentially asking for the same thing. There are lots of foods I will only eat if someone else is eating them, too, and only if they're eating more or the same as me. I love trying new foods I can eat, but if I want to try them and I ask my partner, and they say they don't want to try them, I get really anxious and ashamed and upset because I really want to eat it but I feel like I'm not ""allowed"" to if they don't eat it too. Same for if I want to order takeout but they aren't interested. I don't say or show that to them, obviously, because I don't want them to worry or force themselves to eat something they don't want to, but I still get this gut instinctive reaction of shame for daring to want to eat ""bad"" foods when they didn't.  It doesn't matter if I know they ate just a couple of hours ago, or if they're tired or just woke up and don't feel like eating, or if they're not feeling well, while I haven't eaten all day. If I'm hungry/want to eat and they're not hungry/don't want to eat them I'm a shameful fatty, always wanting food when everyone else is fine, fine, fine.",False,False

Especially if they give me food. I still feel the same way as I did about the food before hand, my desire to be taken care of just overrides my desire to not eat in those situations. It happens soooooo rarely though so it's not much of an issue, lmfao.",False,False

He always tells me that I can eat without him but like what if I eat and then I'm hungry when he's hungry then I'll have to watch him eat and try not to have any cause then I'll feel even worse for eating twice in front of him... Ya feel.,False,False

Thank you for articulating this! And fuck me did it cause me to go from my ultimate body to whatever the fuck this is in two months time. In one month Iâ€™d lost a lot of that sinewy look I was really aiming for. Iâ€™m sure my husband meant well but....I think everybodyâ€™s trying to sabotage me lol ðŸ˜‚ I should have been my OWN compass. Can so relate!,False,False
