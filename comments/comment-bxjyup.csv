I moved in with my partner a year ago and it’s been so, so good for my mental health but the downside to that is I have no ability to restrict anymore. I’m hoping maybe this time I’ll be able to lose the weight like a normal person...",False,False

A few years back I reached my UGW (I was still miserable btw). Anyway, after immense pressure from my mom, best friends, and boyfriend, I decided to “self recover” even though I totally wasn’t ready. Gained 20lbs by just eating and eating. I felt horrible.  Now three years later, I still haven’t even lost 5 of those 20lbs and I’m just so darn frustrated. I put that weight on in 4 months, but can’t lose a quarter of it over 3 years? How does that make sense?  Anyway, I hear ya. I’m sure you’ll be able to lose the weight again. The best way would probably just to take it slow.   Good luck 😊 you can get there!❤️",False,False
