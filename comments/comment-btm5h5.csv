I went to my mates birthday at the end of summer, and was just generally uncomfortable from not socialising in like 2 months and everyone was asking me about my weight loss and I was just smiling being polite so everyone was like wtf is wrong with you and I said I was high but I didn’t wanna be boring so I drank and well idk what happened next but apparently I threw up all over the food and was practically carried home so yeah never leaving the house again.",False,False

I guess because I keep myself hungry all the time that when I get drunk all my inhibitions fly out the window, and my body must Eat. Usually, with weed, I can resist the urge to eat. Drinking is a magic eating tool. I really become a vacuum. Then, the next day I weighed myself and felt like a trash person all day! What fun. I feel you, dude. I just want to have fun. Is that so much to ask for? To want to enjoy myself?",False,False

Just gotta give your brain a chance to regulate. Try to take a nap if you can. That always helps me.  One time, I ended up writing out a long apology to my best friend for getting drunk and acting embarrassing. She was completely surprised I felt that way. She had felt like we just had a really fun night. I still felt like she was just trying to make me feel better but she is usually brutally honest so I think it's just my brain being mean to me.  Unfortunately, this problem got worse as I got older so I really can't drink without feeling suicidal the next day. And being drunk gives me panic attacks because it makes me feel too out of control.   Be careful and be kind to yourself. ❤",False,False

I can't even drink anymore because I get too depressed/anxious the next day. Every time, I was convinced I made a complete fool of myself and would spend the entire next day in bed full,of shame and hating myself. I think my brain does not understand how to regulate hormones properly. Uses em all up while drunk and there's no more dopamine or seratonin or whatever for the day after.",False,False
