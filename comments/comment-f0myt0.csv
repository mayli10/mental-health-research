I wouldn't let that stress you out too much. Continue your recovery with peace of mind,False,False

Lots of times patients perceive a doctor who orders tests to care more and be more competent, so any weight change, up or down, is going to prompt a lot of doctors to order a thyroid panel.    Also, and this may not be the case so take it with a grain of salt, a yearly visit is deemed preventative care and is billed at reimbursed at a lower rate than a more “complex” visit. The minute a doctor ordered labs, the visit is now “complex” and no longer preventive care, so it gets billed at a higher level. Legally, in the US, there is no copay for preventative care, but if labs or tests are ordered, you’ll then have to pay a copay for an office visit.    There are lots of motivations for ordering tests that have *nothing at all* to do with your weight.",False,False

I’m sorry you had this experience. Like, even when I know within myself a change was good...that’s a charged comment and I so do not want to be explaining my backstory and feeling like I’m having to justify something.   And with a medical professional I feel like you shouldn’t have to?! I’ve had some great providers but also some people where you really wonder if critical thinking (not to mention empathy) is at all part of their tool kit.",False,False
