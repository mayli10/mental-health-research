I actually just went swimming today for the first time in 2-3 years. Last night I was agonizing over my body in the mirror anticipating being in my swimsuit. But once it was time to get ready, I put on my suit and forced myself to walk away from the mirror and put my clothes on over it. I don't know how I managed to walk away but it helped. I knew that if I let myself do the typical inspection that I would flake on my friend I'd been dying to hang out with so I just pretended it was any normal day and somehow didn't dwell.",False,False

I've entered a new school (kinda like hs in america) and tomorrow is our second day. During the first two days we move strictly with our new classmates and they make us play some games to get to know each other. During my introduction my voice was shaking and I didn't know what to say, so that was a bad start. It got significantly worse when I  found out that the school booked a pool for us new students to swim at and chat to eachother for tomorrow. I've been crying and fucking shaking and I know if I wont go I'll be alone for 3 years but I just Can. Not. Do. It. All the other people are jocks or super fit girls that glare at me weird and laugh at me. A pool party with the new grade. All the teachers are super excited and other girls are planning on wearing super revealing clothes to show off their bodies and I just wanna cry in a corner.",False,False

I swim. 3-4 times a week. I’ve been building it up for almost a year and I’m doing a marathon distance outdoor swim in 3 weeks. That’s what gives me power.   I hate my entire body. I hate its composition, its skin, the shape of every part. I hate it. I can’t stand to look at it. I cover it up all the time - I’ve never even worn shorts. But when I go to swim, I just don’t think about it. I’m there to do something I’m good at, I have a training plan and a goal, and I don’t care what anyone thinks because I just concentrate on what I’m doing.   If I want to, I can stay wrapped in a towel until I’m at the side of the pool, hop in where no one can see me, and get straight back under the towel when I’m out.   I really hope you can find the confidence to go and have fun swimming. I promise two things:  1. No one is looking 2. When you’ve done it once, you will barely worry about it again   You can do it!",False,False
