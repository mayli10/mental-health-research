Can they even ask that? I don't know if they can, because then they could discriminate based on that. I've worked physical manual labor my entire life, gone through the physical exam screenings (step test, weight lifting, etc.) and never had an *employer* require to know my height and weight, only the examiner, who can't legally share my information. Seems weird to me for sure! And if you happen to not hit your gw, it's not a huge difference you can always say you don't own a scale and only weigh yourself rarely!",False,False
