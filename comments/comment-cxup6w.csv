Maybe suggest that or just offer to help cooking? I understand your feeling and the fact that you realise is a hurtful thing to others makes you not be a bad person. You can't avoid this, is the ed, but it is still hurtful to others as it is for you.",False,False

He said it was fine and that he wants me to talk to him about things without getting upset.  But I also understand and was telling him that I have a tendency to ""blurt"", aka say unnecessary things without thinking about if I should be saying this to that particular person, or how I will affect the person I'm talking to, then feel terrible when they either tell me to stop talking or get defensive/upset/angry. He was trying to tell me I don't but I do and I can recognise that.",False,True

Have you ever pointed out someone was wrong and then they have a major overreaction to the point where you feel like you need to console them even though you were wronged? Having an ED doesn’t give you a pass to say things carelessly without repercussion. You’re not terrible but you said something terrible. Making a post on here to vent is fine but I hope you’re able to get into better headspace to apologize to him.,False,False

You don’t mean harm, what’s terrible is your ED giving you these thoughts bb. :/ it’s truly a curse. I have felt a lot of guilt with the thoughts mine gave me, I’ve had similar. Don’t beat yourself up over it too much. Remember, your coming from a place of fear, not from a place of any actual hate/dislike towards this person. Stay safe luv &lt;3",False,False
