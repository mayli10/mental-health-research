A skinny person isn't someone who just doesn't eat a lot, it is someone who lives life in a way that makes their metabolism keep up with their body fat.  I am a hard core gamer, over 8 hours a day. I am also at BMI 33. I cannot expect to lose weight if I keep sitting on my ass for 8 hours a day.  3 years ago when Pokemon go came out, I was at the local park farming Pokemon for 2 hours a day after work for five months. Even though it was moderate exercise, it was still exercise, I went to the doctors and had both lost 10 lbs as well as reduced my blood pressure dramatically from my previous years visit -- I did not change my diet one bit.  I don't care to be skinny, but if you do, you need to live a lifestyle that will help you be skinny.  When I stopped playing pogo, my weight retuned to normal as well as my blood pressure. Because I stopped living a lifestyle that was more active.",False,False

The ED or you? I recognize all these things you write, I’ve thought in the same pattern. My ED will always try and tell me things like “there’s no point”, “it’s a lot of work”, “you deserve a binge”, “you already messed up”.   The worst is when my ED pretends to be recovering me “don’t log this food; logging is part of your ED” ... then when I don’t I instantly think “oh you didn’t log that, might as well binge”  Another ED mind trick is to lure me into the kitchen “you should refresh your stale water”, “you should check on the oven”, “is the fridge door really closed?”, “that sink needs cleaning”. Then try to coax me into having a bite of food.   The book “never binge again” (free kindle on amazon prime) talks about your ED voice a lot and how to recognize it, it’s been helpful.   Best of luck.",False,False
