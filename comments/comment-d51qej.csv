I really hope he’ll get better and work through this, he deserves it :)",False,False

This is so sad to me, I love him as an actor. But it's great that he's breaking the stigma. People need to know that no one is immune to EDs.   I hope he'll manage to beat his dysmorphia, though.",False,False

Yes, exactly! I don't mean to invalidate anyone's suffering, mental illnesses of all kinds can strike people of all backgrounds, ED doesn't care who you are - I'm a white cis girl as well, but I always think it's so good to have public figures open up about their experiences and help people realise that even if they don't fit a mould their experiences are still v valid.",False,True

I wish he didnt have to struggle but I loved him as a doctor and in other things so to see that it can affect anyone makes me feel more....normal? Less crazy?  I AM a middle glass white cis female so I fit the mold (besides not being a teen) but still, it doesnt matter who you are, just like depression can hit anyone.",False,False
