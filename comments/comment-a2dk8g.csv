I’m bulimic, and I feel like I’m addicted to vomiting. I get physical and emotional withdrawal symptoms when I stop purging, and I have a constant urge to purge when I eat. It really sucks.

(on the bright side- my hair isn't falling out as much anymore tho!)  \-Going through extreme hunger and spending like $50 a day on food lol, plus eating so much more than everyone around you and feeling embarrassed  \-Slowly having to accept the fact that during this time, I have to step outside my comfort zone on ALL aspects of life if I am to fully recover and become a better human being after all this.   \-The fact that I CAN'T FUCKING STOP guessing the amount of calories I ate that day despite uninstalling MFP ages ago. Even though I can do so without judgement (I ate maybe 8000 yesterday bc of extreme hunger and I just laughed it off- but the fact that I KNOW I ate 8000 is bugging me) , the guessing game is literally unstoppable.  \-Constantly wondering what kind of person I will be and what I will think about after I return to normal- part of the reason I decided to recover was due to the fact that it was getting to a point where I literally COULD NOT think about anything else and had no other personality besides food and it was driving me insane. I'm still thinking about food a lot and I cannot WAIT for the day that I become completely apathetic to it.",False,False

I think that's the basis of it.  I WANT to recover so much, but my damn brain just won't allow it.  A nice on/off switch would be great!
