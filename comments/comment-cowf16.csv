Couple years back I purposely put on something like 5-7lbs when I starting to feel curious about looking curvier. At BMI 16 I wasn't even worried about it because, ""I'll still be really fn skinny anyway."" Most of the commentary on my body weaned off except for a few crude comments about that butt filling out my jeans.  Then I cross-trained on more strenuous jobs which lead to a lot of Adderall abuse and all of that sloughed off. Suddenly people were going out of their way to tell me I've been looking great and wanted to know if I did something different with my hair or have just been getting enough sleep for once: they genuinely couldn't see the weight I lost from an already underweight frame but the difference was noticeable and they *liked* it. That really says some shitty things I don't like to think about.",False,False
