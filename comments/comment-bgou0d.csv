For me it really was a miracle cure: from the moment on I honestly got a new perspective on life. I now had a mission larger than life; to make sure my child grew up without a care I the world, with a confident, strong, healthy human as a mom. And it happened. I got my shit together, got an education, a job and my life sorted out (sort of, but that’s a whole different sub story). I honestly didn’t think much about my weight or how “less light” my steps were or how I had to change size in clothes. True recovery I thought- Until my child was about 4 years old, approx 6 months ago when my mother and siblings starter to make comments - bare in mind: they are all heavily overweight, while I’m in the middle of a healthy BMI.  It triggered something. For a time I shrug it off. Pretended I didn’t care- which I didn’t at first. But then small things started to change in my perspective: the pants I loved suddenly feel clingy on my thighs. The dress I used to feel fabulous in felt ill fitting. I noticed my reflection I mirrors, windows, everywhere. You know where this is going- at any given moment of the day, I feel some kind of fat and skin touching on my body: my thighs rubbing when I walk. The skin on my upper and lower arms touching when I’m on the phone. The “fat” above my knee wobbling when I walk. Everything just moves and wobbles when move.  So for the past couple of months I’ve been back in a vicious cycle of restricting, binging and purging.  So yeah, that’s that.  A nightmare turned fairytale- and back to horror.   But the only thing I can honestly say is- I can’t wait to be skinny again...",False,False

My baby has some food intolerances (soy and dairy) and I’ve totally used that to my advantage to fly under the radar at home. I eat a separate meal than the rest of the family because of it and my husband doesn’t ever think to question why I’m having 150 calorie soup for dinner after a plain salad for lunch. Every. Day. I hate myself because it feels like I’m using my baby to hide my disorder.   I honestly thought I’d be able to get over this once I had kids, but the way my body changed after giving birth just made my dysmorphia worse. It’s so weird getting used to an entirely new body when you hated the last one you had too.",False,False
