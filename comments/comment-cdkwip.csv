Unfortunately, I don't get to see any results at all.  It covered genetic links to mental illnesses and was asked if I'd be interested because of my ED/depression/anxiety.  No way would I say no even though I feel giving people my DNA is a bit dodgy.  I was surprised they had funding for it and god yeah I hope it helps everyone in the near future.  I hate how few places deal with EDs and how crap their recovery methods are.  &amp;#x200B;  Thanks for the link  x",False,False

I'm just super excited to see that it is being researched as a physiological problem now. Maybe this will lead to some sort of treatment besides ""just eat more!""",False,True
