It might help you understand both addiction and maybe even your ED (I liken EDs to addiction). It's called In The Realm of Hungry Ghosts.   It's not a book to convince you to get better. But it's a book that maybe might help you understand why you can't stop why you can't find the will to change right now and why these addictions can be so enthralling to matter the negative consequences,False,False
