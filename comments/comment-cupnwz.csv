But now that you mention it, that makes sense too.",False,False

I've eaten too much fruit at times too but I feel worse when I eat four cookies. She seems judgmental about the food she eats and how much of it she eats from what I see.,False,False

I've noticed that non-disordered people who only eat a little bit don't tend to feel the need to justify it unless someone asks first.  Meanwhile, disordered people go out of their way to ""explain"" the eating habits they're kinda self-aware of, usually with the same few excuses.  Not criticizing or judging - been there, probably still do that.  Sounds like you're onto something tho. Imo.",False,False

I haven’t watched the day in her life video, but it sounds like she engages in a ton of ED behaviors.",False,True

However like you said you don’t burn that much in soul cycle, she is almost definitely restricting.",False,True

Her day pretty much involved buckets of black coffee, multiple workouts, and avocado toast. The twins were like wtf were gonna have a heart attack from all this caffeine...the whole thing was just one classic Ed move after another",False,False
