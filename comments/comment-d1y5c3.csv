But sometimes I feel really lonely and chat  with strangers online, about everything, life, university, movies and music... and sometimes food/cooking comes up and when I tell people that I have an ED, at first they're like: ""oh no, in what way? Why? What are your symptoms?"" and sometimes they're really nice people and we're talking for weeks, but after a while they get SO annoyed with me, because they realize it's something that is on my  mind CONSTANTLY.... It's like they thought about an eating disorder like a cute personality feature and not something that consumes you, all of you, until you only consist of those thoughts. It annoys me to the point that I don't  even want to tell strangers online.",False,False

I'm skinny and people make comments all the fucking time although I have my shit together now and eat healthy, I just feel better at a bmi of 18-19. But my friends, who are not as thin as me, they binge, purge, eat absolutely nothing a couple days etc. Nobody cares about them. I often go to a youth club and a worker there often makes comments about how thin I am and that I probably eat nothing and when I told her about my friend (who she knows) who actually has very fucked up eating habits (even I wasn't like this at my worst), she said ""yeah, but she's normal weight and not as thin as you"". Wtf? Yes, she's not as thin as me but she was in the fucking hospital because of pains, probably related to her fucked up lifestyle and she continues to destroy her body but hey, she is not skinny ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",False,False
