It kind of coincided with when I was pretty sexually active so maybe it is hormonal. It felt to me almost like 2nd puberty, nowhere near that drastic but certainly some noticeable changes. Maybe there's more developing that happens mid-20s?",False,False

Think: binge cycles where you have a sudden influx of calories. Since you never mentioned recovery, a binge cycle could trigger the same effects even if it only lasted a month. Even high vs low restriction can cause an impact if you changed it at one point or had more high calorie days than low calorie days.  Stress can release hormones (cortisol) that also effects body fat distribution. If you had stressful periods of binge cycles they could all play a part in body fat distribution changes.  Overall my guess would be a factor of all the above plus natural genetics, definitely suggest checking out the links below, they are actually super interesting reads on the subject!  https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/81/6/1286/4648747  https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2000/11/001120072314.htm",False,False

I also had a thought, it could be muscle mass related, if you got more muscle it would make things like hipdips appear more prominent.  I also know that get distribution can change after recovery and likely other circumstances too.",False,False

Though that would make the most sense.. my weight has stayed the same throughout the years. I haven’t gained or lost any weight.  But, even when I have been at my skinniest, I never noticed hip dips.   And the weirdest part: at the same time I develop hip dips, I also experience other bodily changes like random fat distribution in my arms and inner thighs (weight still stays same, though), and bloating. So, I feel like it is a “whole body change” type thing that is just affected by hormones or something. Is it possible that hormone changes can affect bone structure!?  Also, I am at an age that my body shouldn’t be going through “a growing stage”. I am older now, no longer a teen.",False,True

That would make the most sense as gaining some weight would make them disappear, losing weight would make them come back etc, instead of magically coming and going.  Secondly it could be more situational, if you’re not done fully growing yet your bones are still changing so it’s possible that if your still growing you’ll see changing such as those.",False,False
