But they're also v sickly sweet and I can usually only drink half a can at a time before feeling ill.  Coca cola energy (no sugar) is v bland but is good to drink in the mornings BC it's not all that sweet and it goes flat fast (too much fizz makes me feel ill).  Doctor Pepper Zero and Pepsi Max (original, cherry, and raspberry) are all great (honestly, I hate Coke Zero and diet coke. They taste like pure sugar even if they don't have it).  Beanies coffee is wonderful (hello there, cookie dough coffee thats 2 cals)",False,False
