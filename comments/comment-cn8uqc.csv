There is a higher concentration of the fat-soluble vitamins so taking the multi with a little dietary fat might help you out. Also, the Walgreens generic women's multivitamin I looked at didn't seem like it should be targeted toward women at all. Its missing key nutrients that women need more of such as calcium, iron, and folate. Sorry if I went too far into detail, but I hope this is helpful!",False,False

I always recommend finding supplements that are [USP verified](https://www.usp.org/verification-services/verified-mark) and trying to take them with a little bit of food. I hope you feel better!",False,False
