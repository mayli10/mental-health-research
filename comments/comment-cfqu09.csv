The real important factor is overall intake in any given ~24 hr period.  I'm on mobile rn but there are studies showing that muscle growth in bodybuilders was about the same regardless of meal timing.  This destroys the common bro-science theory that one must chug a protein shake every 2 hours to avoid going catabolic.  At the end of the day, meal timing should be organized in whatever manner is most likely to help you adhere to whatever dietary goals you have. Use meal timing as a tool rather than an obligation that must be met.  Personally, that means I save most of my calories for right before bed. I'll usually eat like 500 calories of lean chicken, cheese, and broccoli for a late dinner. It works for me.",False,False
