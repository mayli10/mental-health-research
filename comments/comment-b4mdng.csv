I make my husband lie on top of me, like with his full bodyweight. Not like sexually or anything, but somehow his weight would ground me. Both what you and I do reminds me of those weighted vests that kids with autism use to calm down. Something about pressure and proprioception that’s calming (? not fully sure). But yes, not an option in public lol. In public I just try to distract myself (usually with reddit) but not with triggering material, or if you can, go for a quick walk. Outside is best but I’d even wander the halls of my office building for like 5 minutes and maybe visit a coworker who didn’t annoy me to chat for a few. Basically distraction with good/happy things until the feeling passes :)",False,False

I know I need to jut give it time, but hearing that from others, and often, really does help.    Did you do anything in particular when the ""huge"" feelings crept up?  I find that my legs are my biggest source of that, and the only thing I can really do to get my mind off it is to lay down on my stomach (sounds weird, I know!).  But that clearly isn't always an option what with work and it not being socially acceptable to lay down in my office.  LOL",False,True

I have been there, when you’re underweight and reach a normal BMI, you just feel huge. I don’t really have any advice except just keep on doing what you’re doing, it does get better. Those thoughts/feelings diminish with time, and, for me at least, become fleeting. Eventually an ED thought would come up, but I just didn’t focus on it, it didn’t have power over me as it had in the past and the awful feelings would either not come or dissipate almost immediately. Time is the only thing that distanced me from all this. However, even though I was “ok” for almost 7 years, I’ve recently relapsed due to going through some massively short things in my life, so be vigilant of that. If you notice that you’re going back to your behaviors, get support/help/therapy immediately so you don’t return to a full blown ED. Sorry if this wasn’t helpful, but I do feel like time is the only thing that helped me distance myself from all those obsessive/disordered thoughts. ",False,False
