It helps the stomachache/cramps, works quickly (like 4 minutes or less), but won't stop you up, so everything will still flush out of your system as per usual rather than get reactive constipation like some stomach meds can do. Highly recommend it.",False,False

Once it gets to your system everything happens faster too. I hope you feel better! And make sure to drink lots of water the rest of the day because lax will dehydrate you like crazy.,False,False
