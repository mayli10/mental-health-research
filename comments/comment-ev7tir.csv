It was in the -40s a little while ago and I was THRIVING. I love bundling up and going for a nice long walk while everyone is complaining about the cold. Not that it makes me feel better than everyone else... but yeah it totally does.    The only thing is that it really makes me question whether cool-sculpting actually works. I’ve had multiple instances where I’ve been so cold that it feels like the cells in my legs are dying but I was still fat lol.,False,False
