I started out overweight before a really bad relapse last year, am now in the high end of the ""healthy"" (HA HA HA) range for my height.   &amp;#x200B;  It's a shitty fucking bind. I think fatphobia is very real. The food environment we live in is fucking nuts. And people with EDs, who are in a way among the most victimized by societal fatphobia, have to take on the onus of fighting that stigma in order to recover. Especially if you never become underweight or develop BED or an ED when you're overweight.   &amp;#x200B;  OP, if you're early in recovery or consider recovery at any point, I do recommend logging off and or blocking any ED sites you might interact with, including this sub. There's a lot of lovely people here, but I know at least that my recovery was aided by talking to sympathetic people who weren't in the ED ""echo chamber"", so to speak.",False,False

It’s hard to vent about your worst thoughts when they are so hurtful to others at the same time. But there is a way to do it. It’s a tricky middle ground that sucks,False,False

I have skinny friends, chubby friends and obese friends. Never have I once thought bad thoughts about their bodies. Never. Once. I look at them and all I care about is that they are my friends at that they make me happy and that I want them to be happy. I could not care less about their weight. I have nothing nothing nothing against people that are on the heavier side I just wish everyone to be happy, be it someone close to me or a stranger on the street.",False,False

I think what really makes it affect me so much is that it is a written real proof that fat=gross isn't only in my head.  I think I'll force myself to think of it like that from now on and maybe it will help. I do realise it comes from a sick place but I don't actively think about it that way.,False,True

I also believe that everybody I see when I'm outside could have the same mindset. My therapists keep telling me that people whom think 'fat/overweight/biggerthanme'=gross and disgusting do only exist in my head.      This sub and basically speaking with other ed patients proves every time it is not in my head but it is a quite real ed thought.  So therapist denying it doesn't help me. Best thing for me is to embrace the fact that it exists, to be able to walk the streets. I acknowledge it ánd I know the 'fathate' comes from a really sick place. From a projected place of selfhate. Cause when I think like that I am mostly stressed and filled with anger towards myself. Just lashing out. When I am relaxed I don't feel disgusted by the appearance of others.      Remembering that the hate I read here (and I feel or imagine around me, had it a lot when I lived and was among other ed patients) comes from a sick place helps me to put it beside me. Helps me to go outside. Not sure if this helps you.. Took me long before I found a way to not let myself get touched so much by others' opinions. Maybe it helps you too.",False,False

It hurts reading you punish yourself over this. I just saw a similar post to the ones you're talking about and it must hurt.
