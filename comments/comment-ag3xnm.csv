So as long as you are getting the correct nutrients, it will return. It may take a while for your body to repair damage before it regains that function, but it should return. If it hasn't come back in a couple months, I'd ask your doctor or treatment team to get a medical opinion. You can never be too safe when it comes to body health.  I wish you luck &lt;3",False,False

It wasn't regular at first and I'd only really get it because id have a huge binge each month and then get it the next morning lmao.   I got pms symptoms like I normally would, so i definitley noticed signs of it coming back. I wouldn't say it was more difficult to deal with than usual, if anything it was still lighter than usual.   Wishing you the best in your recovery ❤",False,False
