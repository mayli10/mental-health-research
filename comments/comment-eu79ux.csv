My insurance is weird with what they cover but very helpful and I'm going to call their case worker line and get someone who I can talk to that can help explain to me these options and the financial results of each one. The US has such a weird approach to health care honestly it has to be this convoluted purposefully, honestly I will never understand how mental health care is the absolute hardest thing to find a doctor in despite it being the medical field that should be the easiest due to the nature of the patients.",False,True

I contacted renfrew finally and they told me they have no availability for the next 2 months. I'm going to get notes from my GP and therapist and psych and dietitian that I need help immediately so I can get my insurance to cover the out of network costs. Wow thank you again,False,True

Seriously though I just work. A fuck-ton. I am not a big sleeper and I have no social life so I just work a lot with the extra time and use the extra income to pay for treatment. Hopefully it will make a difference because holy shit it’s expensive and I’m tired of being broke af, mentally and financially.",False,False

I've had such a pain-in-the-ass time with insurance. This is just spitballing from my experiences, but some things to possibly talk to your insurance company about might be:  * Is there an out-of-pocket limit on out-of-network costs. If that cost is something you can manage (though it's often atrociously high) then once you hit that $$ everything after might be covered. * If you can thoroughly document that everywhere you can geographically reach that has the services you need is out-of-network, sometimes that means they have to process the claims as in-network. Definitely document this really really carefully though if you try this route. * (Since you mention significant physical symptoms) If you have an emergency admission to a facility that's out-of-network that can be another case where they have to re-process the claim as in-network. I was taken by ambulance to the only hospital with psychiatric facilities in my town. It was out-of-network, but because of the circumstances, they re-processed it and it was covered. * At one point my therapist went to bat with my insurance company about my need for additional services. I wasn't privy to that convo but they extended my stay at a higher level of care.  The times I've looked into it, the requirements to qualify for need-based financial aid were crazy restrictive (as in, basically need income low enough to qualify for Medicaid anyhow) but asking about any assistance could be worth it. Nothing to lose, right?  The US system's approach to mental health care seriously has a long way to go. I'm so sorry you're caught in that place of needing help, *wanting* help, and being unable to get it because of bean counters.",False,False

You just need the treatment center talk to your insurer. I even got Medicaid to pay for my treatment out of network. Good luck!",False,False

How do you manage the out of pocket fees? Im deep in the hole myself w student loan debt and credit card issues so I really cant let myself rack up medical debt as well. Does your work allow for sick leave or at least allow you sick and vacation days you could use? Thats what im trying to use when I find an inpatient is using the sick and vacation days to a lot for about a month of work off and possibly taking sick leave. Ive never sought treatment for my ed before but god i remember it was so much easier when i was seeking it for depression.,False,True

So I pay out of pocket for my treatment, the medical portions are at least covered (the labs and medications just not the mental parts thanks insurance) and I’ve recently been sent off to another psyche to deal with my non-Ed issues so now I’m paying for four to six out of pocket psyche appointments a month. I am literally going to starve to death trying to pay for treatment to stop myself from starving to death lol the irony.",False,False
