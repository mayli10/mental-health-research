So naturally, I didn't realize how wrong I was in my beliefs.  I was in my mid-twenties, having a conversation with a friend, explaining how waking up and not feeling physically 'light' because I know I overate yesterday makes me an emotional wreck. She immediately called my ass out lol. But I really don't think I ever fully questioned or realized it prior to that.",False,False

I’d read them over and over again like “these are all good tips.” I think I knew it wasn’t normal, but it was addicting. I would say I started viewing myself as disordered around then because that was the outcome of the books. I’m in my late-20s now and I still own copies of a lot of them.",False,False
