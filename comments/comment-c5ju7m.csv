I personally know the dietitian at my university because I am a dietetic intern, and she works with a lot of students who have eating disorders. Her costs are a lot lower, so definitely seek help from your school's medical or wellness center! I think dietitians are the only people who can help you learn what it means to eat normal. They will ensure you have all the proper nutrients so that you don't deal with that anxiety while still helping you form a normal relationship with food. I am obviously biased because I'll be a dietitian in a year, but I also have 2 years experience with a full eating disorder treatment team. Its also important to have a specialist you vibe with and are comfortable being vulnerable with. Always remember that dietitians are not polarized to an all-or-nothing viewpoint (especially not when they work in eating disorder care), so don't be intimidated by them!",False,False

Mine did and I was able to see her free of charge. I was way too sick to really be able to do what she asked of me, but I did manage to take some baby steps with her help. Plus, my appointments with her essentially felt like a bonus therapy session. I didn’t make much progress towards recovery, but I still think seeing her was beneficial and I would 100% do it again if I could. I think it’s definitely worth trying!",False,False
