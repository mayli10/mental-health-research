You all are right though, it was most likely anxiety. Hoping not to have a repeat of it tonight. Thanks for the advice ðŸ˜Š",False,True

If you are getting hot flashes, I'd consider getting tested for low ferritin and if it comes up positive, getting iron pills and vitamin c if you don't already have them. If you do, ask your doctor how much you can take to resolve your issues w/out getting heavy metal poisoning. Good luck!",False,False

And I was actually getting hot flashes last night too sooo thatâ€™s something else to consider. Thanks so much for the advice.",False,True

Thanks!",False,True

Generally, a spike in HR could be due to a blood pressure drop but that seems kind of unlikely if you were in bed. Like the other commenters said, it might be a good idea to check the side effects of your meds and make sure you get some salt/electrolytes in your diet.",False,False

My RHR has been up by like 10 this week and I was curious so I googled. Itâ€™s like 40 degrees Celsius where I live currently and my period is due in 2 days. I was like...oh. ",False,False

Your electrolytes could also be off but idk if that actually causes elevated heart rates. I know for me, I have low ferritin and it causes heart palpitations and hot flashes. When I get the hot flashes, my heart rate goes up so much that my Fitbit counts it as exercise even when I'm laying down. This also happens with stress and anxiety attacks. An anxiety attack does not necessarily mean that you cant breathe, are shaky, or anything else. If you're having racing thoughts and an elevated heart rate, it could be am anxiety attack. What helps me sometimes is figuring out exactly what I'm stressed about. If I can do something to fix it but it has to be done later, I make a detailed mental plan of when I will fix it and how. If I can fix it right then, I force myself to get up and do it.   I hope you feel better soon",False,False

Iâ€™ve found that each time my heart rate was thru the roof, it was caused by anxiety. However, I would check the side effects of some of your sinus medication. I know bronkaid can cause heart palpitations so maybe sinus medication can do the same thing. ",False,False
