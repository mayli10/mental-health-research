He knows I have a tough relationship with food and I think I told him I had an eating disorder in high school, but he hasn't quite put together the pieces yet. I do plan on telling him soon! My main roadblocks are currently that he's so stressed out with work that he's literally started therapy for it, and I don't want to ADD to his stress, but then also selfishly I haven't gotten to weigh myself in a while so I don't know if I've hit my goal weight....also, an UW BMI would greatly help me get better treatment, I feel!",False,True

I don’t think you should get married without him knowing such a big part of your life, that’s not fair to him. I can only imagine how scary the thought of having this conversation would be but if he is going to be your partner for life you really need to ask him for help or at least let him know what you are going through.",False,False

Many of these things could definitely be playing a factor- he's aware that I have a complicated history with food and I think I mentioned to him that I had an ED in high school?? But of course, I'm 23 now so it would make sense that he doesn't realize I've relapsed.  I also do eat fairly often around him (he's a night shift nurse, and I definitely tend to eat less in the hours he's asleep, so when he's on his night shifts and day-sleeping he might only see me eating dinner, so he's not always aware when I work out or skip meals. I also eat decent portions of the food he cooks.  I personally don't think I'm good at hiding it, but it may just be hidden enough that he's not sure and doesn't know how to ask if I'm having issues. I may be setting unfairly high expectations due to him being a nurse!",False,True

I have lost a very very large amount of weight (I struggle with binge eating so I am still overweight) and neither my husband or ANYONE in his family (5 sister's and 1 brother and his mom) have said even 1 word about it.   And I mean it's a noticeable amount to the point multiple people I have known for years have said they didn't recognize me.,False,False

For example, if I know I'm meeting my boyfriend later, I'll fast until then so I can always allow myself to eat around him. So even though I'm losing weight, he's constantly seeing me eat full meals. * He's worried, but also knows it can be really hurtful to comment on someone's weight, so he's stopping himself from saying anything. * He thinks it has more to do with walking than restricting, and so doesn't realize how dangerous it is. * He's not familiar with EDs and so it just isn't his first assumption. * He sees you often, so the change has been gradual. The people who tend to react the strongest are those who haven't seen you since X amount of pounds. * He just doesn't know how to bring it up, which I kind of understand. When I was worried about my sister's weight loss, I had no idea how to bring it up with her, but luckily it turned out to be accidental + stress-related and fixed itself. * He's in denial. EDs are dangerous as hell. He doesn't want to admit to himself that you're in danger.  I don't know him though, obviously, so I have no idea if any of these apply.",False,False
