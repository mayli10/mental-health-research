I deal with the face dysmorphia issues as well. I go through weird phases where my face doesnâ€™t feel like my own. Like I donâ€™t recognize it. I see it in pictures or a mirror and I know itâ€™s mine but itâ€™s like Iâ€™m seeing a stranger. It always scares me when that aspect gets really bad.,False,False

Iâ€™m 24 and I donâ€™t think many people would consider that old. My chubby cheeks are gone and if I wear shitty makeup it settles in my smile lines and looks like WRINKLES!   I never really thought about my nose until my boyfriend mentioned he loved my nose (unprovoked he just randomly said it) and now I hate it lmao. How messed up is that? I just keep thinking about it, what if itâ€™s so ugly that he ASSUMES I donâ€™t like it and randomly complimented me on it?  Itâ€™s probably not true but thatâ€™s what my brain likes to tell me sometimes.   I have moderate cystic acne from PCOS so makeup over it just looks god awful. Itâ€™s all I can see on my face is my acne. Even with makeup on. People really underestimate the toll acne takes on your confidence and mental health.",False,False
