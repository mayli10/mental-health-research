Pro tip, if any of your friends have old vape juice lying around that they don’t want or that you could offer to buy off them, im pretty sure you don’t need to be legal age to buy the batteries online. It’s just the juice that’s age regulated. (That’s how it works where I’m from anyways, check your specific state rules just to be safe!)",False,False

But you're no longer addicted, at least on the chemical level. I know you want that sweet nic but you're going to be thankful that you didnt get it later. Sorry to be lame. I was rolling ciggs last night in my dorms bathroom. I'm about to have my morning cigg rn. Nic addiction doesnt play.",False,False
