So what differentiates Tumblr from any other platform now? This seems like suicide for them. At this point since reddit still allows porn reddit is a huge step above them as far as content diversity.,False,False

I only go on tumblr for porn anymore, so many artists who do nsfw commissions use tumblr to promote their livelihoods, and I feel like they're just going to burn themselves in the end with this decision.
