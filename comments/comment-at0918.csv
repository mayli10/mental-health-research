The way my body reacts to that is so spotty. I used to take it around 8pm to help me at 7am. Worked for a while but then it wouldn’t ‘kick in’ till 10 or 11am while I was at work.   I got the genius idea to take it at 4pm at work so it would kick in around 7am! Smarty pants was wrong, I got trapped on the toilet at my house at 8pm while I was expecting guests. ",False,False
