Subway footlongs tend to range between 400 and 1200 calories. The ones that get over 1000 calories are extremely fatty though. Deli meat with some cheese and veggies tends to be much lower.,False,False

Recalculated down to 880 which is still massive but not 1100 bad. A solid 5cm thick of various meat and a ton of mayo on some weird bread with cheese baked into it.,False,True
