This is written on the mirror at a barre studio near where I live and I fucking hate it. Why arbitrarily pit skinny and fit girls against each other... And why pile more and more standards up for us to try and achieve??,False,False

That‚Äôs not okay to say to anyone, because the job of a personal trainer should be helping you be your best no matter what your size. She shouldn‚Äôt have judged your looks by your weight. That creates an unhealthy environment in an already stressful place for people who aren‚Äôt super fit.",False,False

They train and lift like crazy. They eat ALOT of protein. They likely are taking steroids too. I‚Äôve seen girls who lift more than men and just look like normal girls.,False,False

At the end of the day, they‚Äôre sales people, who usually tend to be scum of the earth. Some PT‚Äôs fuel their sales by making people feel bad about themselves and acting like the hero that can fix all their ‚Äúproblems‚Äù.   Keep doing whatever you‚Äôve wanted to at the gym and just ignore whoever the hell that person is.  Ps. I would even complain to a manager anonymously bc her comment could even be considered borderline harassment. Imagine if a male trainer said that to you.",False,False
