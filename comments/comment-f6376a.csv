This makes me a bit worried for you, I know that severe restriction also takes energy away from the brain and then actually can cause longer-term brain impacts, including damage. I know that's a scary thing, don't want to scare you, but also want you to have the best chance at life that you deserve. I recommend going to someone you trust, especially someone in the medical field or counseling and let them know what's going on. You don't want to lose yourself",False,False
