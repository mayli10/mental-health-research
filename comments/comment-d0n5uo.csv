One of my biggest triggers is when my friend either cancels or does something(s) while we’re hanging out that remind me of how gross she thinks I am and that I’m just her fat friend and “why the fuck is she even friends with me”. Makes me feel so alone and unwanted. Guaranteed binge. On top of nearly always being weak and eating bad food with her *during* the hangout. Yet despite all of that I’m too much of a wuss to end the “friendship” cause she’s the only “friend” IRL I have left and she’s known me for years. Oh hey another trigger 🥳  Loneliness sucks 😭,False,False
