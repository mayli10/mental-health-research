It might seem like “a lot” if you’ve been restricting lower, but after years of this, I’m pretty hungry on 1200, so I compulsively exercise to bump up my TDEE.",False,False

I am very underweight and active at 5’0” and rarely eat fewer than 1600. It’s all relative. When people are on a very low intake it’s usually for a short period of time (and many omit discussion of binges...), or the extreme deficit just occupies their thoughts more, so they end up w more posts about it. People who restrict higher don’t talk about it as much but there are a lot of us! I think with your activity levels 1200 is good at least as a minimum, more would even be better. It’s not about “will” or “being a pig” (which you are def not), it’s about what’s sustainable and realistic for your lifestyle.",False,False

Taking better care of yourself and acknowledging that you need more energy even if you are still restricting is a very difficult thing to do.  1200 calories seems to be the standard recommendation for a weight loss diet nowadays. This is for non-active “average” people who have a much lower TDEE than you.   Look at the deficit you create, not just what you consume. As an active person, eating 1200 calories per day would leave you with a 800 - 1000 calorie deficit. For myself, as a non-active short person my TDEE is 1400. I would have to eat 400 - 600 calories a day to have the same deficit as you eating 1200 calories!   People on here posting are all different sizes with different activity levels. Just seeing the numbers you might feel like you aren’t trying hard enough, but everyone restricts differently to suit their lifestyle.",False,False

You will feel so much stronger for realizing that an active body needs fuel to remain healthy. I'm also 5,4"" and very active and sometimes 1200 is just not enough, so never feel guilty for having more calories to fuel your workouts or activity. I'm really proud that you're thinking about consuming more for your body because that can ba hard to realize for many.",False,False
