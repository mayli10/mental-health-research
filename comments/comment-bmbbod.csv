Coke zero is good, but I go to many different convenience stores for my 44oz soda fountain needs, and coke zero across the board does not get enough syrup in the mix. Bottled it's well enough, and it's okay from a machine but it's missing... something. But any convenience store with pepsi max on tap is. the mix is perfect. full-bodied, not too fizzy not too little, just right. Bottled pepsi max is quite good too. However, my prefence towards vanilla coke zero puts at #1 and I'm also a slut for sprite zero and diet fanta ðŸ¤·",False,False
