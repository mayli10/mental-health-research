Personally, I would rather have a firm grasp of the facts than stress about what \*might\* be. Even though I'm prone to ortho tendencies, I find reading the actual studies helps to ground me in reality.",False,False

Anecdotally, in my experience, I've definitely noticed that I lose fat far faster eating a largely unprocessed diet vs more processed food even at the same overall caloric content.  YMMV, obviously.",False,False

It looks like there might be some footing to the claim of differing energy expenditure. I'll keep looking for replications and larger renditions of Barr's study (Barr's study was only n=17). If Barr's claims turn out to be true, that will open up a whole new level of my disorder.ðŸ˜•",False,False

I tried to follow the author's link to the study supporting their claim but got a 404 error.   While it's true that processed foods (like high fructose corn syrup and starches) are more easily absorbed/stored (and thus take less energy to process or ""break down"" into bio-available constituents), that reality is reflected in the estimated calorie content of the food.  So a 'whole food' cheese sandwich worth 250 calories and a 'processed food' cheese sandwich worth 250 calories will have the same net effect on weight regardless of how easy or difficult they are to digest.",False,False
