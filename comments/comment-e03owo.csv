But if it makes you feel any better, literally nobody notices when people gain or lose small amounts of weight and I doubt your boyfriend really cares about 8 lbs (and if he did he's a dick anyways lol).",False,False

I actually gained like 40 pounds in a year and was super insecure about whether or not my boyfriend was still into me, and yeah he found me slightly less attractive physically, but it really didn’t have any impact on his attraction to me in general. I’ve finally been able to convince myself that he still thought I was sexy even when I was almost obese, since he’s an incredibly sincere person. You’re not even close to that, and for most people without EDs, 8 pounds isn’t much. Your boyfriend might like thigh gaps as a general trait, but that doesn’t mean his love and attraction for you will really change based on that one thing.",False,False
