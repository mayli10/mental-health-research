My roommate didn’t eat them and no one else in the suite ate them and neither did I so the cakes just basically rotted and we had to throw them out. That wasn’t really an issue but my roommate wouldn’t do her dishes after she baked her cakes (she made a huge mess because she used a bunch of utensils and clogged our small sink and then disappeared for days because she’d sleep over at her friend’s place etc). Since she was my roommate, all my suitemates ranted to me about her behavior and it was awk af. Living with other people can be a pain in the ass lol.",False,False
