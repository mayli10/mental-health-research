My parents aren't very good financally either, but I'm not going to therapy for 2 main reasons. I don't feel like I deserve it, and it's too much money. I just feel like I'm spoiled enough, and this is just going to add to it. I also feel like I don't deserve to heal from this, even if everyone around me is. I just feel spoiled and privileged.  I'm happy to find someone else who feels the same way.",False,False
