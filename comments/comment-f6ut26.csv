I started seeing a therapist initially for my anxiety and depression without the intention of even bringing up my eating disorder behaviors. I also struggle with feeling like those issues are valid and a legitimate problem.  But seeing her to just talk about the things I struggle with (which the eating eventually came up because it really is consuming) was so helpful. I really appreciate learning different ways to change my behaviors through therapy and even having someone listen to me and validate my feelings that I can't validate for myself is so so so useful to me and encouraging.   I think you will get a lot out of therapy and I'd encourage you to go if you're at all able to!!!,False,False
