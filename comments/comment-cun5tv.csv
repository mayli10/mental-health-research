I told my friend who has a little brother with diabetes about the sticky finger test because it would be so horrible if he got the wrong drink!

I went a local coffee shop that has a drive through and ordered a veggie breakfast burrito and an unsweet ice tea and she handed me my order. When she closed the window I tried the tea and it was so watered down (it looked basically like green tea) and it was obviously sweet!! Another employee saw that I was still there so she opened the window to ask if everything was okay and I asked if this was for sure unsweet and she asked the other girl. She just shrugged and said yeah. I wasn’t really expecting her to admit it was sweet but at least give me a new tea or realize it was so watered down.  I drove away and went to the closest gas station and threw away the tea and burrito and got myself an Arnold Palmer zero. Like nope, not today!!!",False,False
