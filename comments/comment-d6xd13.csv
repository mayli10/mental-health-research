The more you drink, the happier the little guy gets.  I find it also helps to have a bottle you like drinking from.

But I also find drinking helps me avoid food easier, so I make an effort to drink more. I used to be terrible though, sometimes I'd go a couple days without drinking anything and wondered why I felt so shit.",False,False
