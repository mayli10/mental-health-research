I’m very happy I could help just a little. You’re doing amazing, sweetie!! I swear. The number doesn’t mean anything. I personally just use my clothes to keep myself in reality. If my clothes still fit comfortably, there’s no way I gained a million lbs overnight like I feel. I know when you see/hear a certain number you literally feel your body changing to match what your perception of that number means. It’s a cruel trick your brain plays but you don’t have to fall for it.",False,False

It's easier said than done but making one small change at a time to make your lifestyle healthier might help? I hope you find happiness wherever you end up &lt;3",False,False

That’s amazing that you managed to make it this far already. Your body and your life did not objectively change in the microseconds before and after you learned that number. Try and tell yourself to hold off on “getting back on track” for one day. If tomorrow it still feels urgent, put it off another day and repeat until you realize you’re actually on the right track by feeding yourself properly.",False,False
