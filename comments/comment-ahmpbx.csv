I literally say out loud ""Purging is not an option.""  It was shifting the way I think that helped. Before I was just telling myself ""I won't purge!"" But that still sort of leaves it as an option. Changing it from ""I won't"" to ""not an option"" takes the power away from the drive to purge and gives it back to you.  Sometimes I had to do it multiple times. I don't always succeed, but I haven't done it since November. The urge is still there, but I don't follow through.  Good luck, friend! üíô I know how horrible this feels. You can do this!",False,False

Like a public park with no restroom. And just staying there until I know logically that no calories at a significant amount will come back up. Obviously that may not help you but it's the only advice I have. I'm also struggling,False,False
