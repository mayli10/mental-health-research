Thin, yes, but not necessarily underweight... It's similar to telling men they probably want a &lt;10% body fat. The user was annoying and still being anti-medical advice but she explicit stated to only using a lesser amount of calories until she was in the lower end of healthy range. Meh.  I think that sub sucks and get things twisted sometimes, but honestly it wasn't that bad of a situation.",False,False

That person either definitely has an ED and is in total denial about it (I don't necessarily believe that they are hovering at a perfect 18.5 BMI and never lower, but even if they are, obsessively keeping yourself at the lowest possible BMI you can maintain without being considered underweight is basically orthorexia) or - drumroll please - they aren't even thin.  People can say whatever they want to about themselves on the Internet and you would not BELIEVE how many posters on that sub are as fat if not fatter than the people they mock. It's because they think if they participate in fathate they'll be one of ""the good ones"" and the things the others say about fat people won't be true for them - that they won't be seen as the same disgusting, detestable people by the users in that sub (protip: they definitely would be). Just think about how many OW ppl watch My 600lb Life or Secret Eaters or something and say ""well at least I'm not that bad!"" After a while, they even start to genuinely believe what they're saying. This could be some obese rando who genuinely feels like they have an 18.5 BMI because they've been claiming it online for so long.  Maybe this user posts a lot of photos or proof or whatever, I don't know. It IS possible they maintain an 18.5 BMI with zero fluctuation and it IS possible they do so without being disordered. But this just sounds like some troll who Googled ""lowest possible healthy BMI"" like teen boys who look up the biggest penis size they can claim to have without breaking a world record or something. It just sounds fake, fake, fake.  Sincerely, another obese rando",False,False

I used to post there when I was first falling into disordered eating and it encouraged me.

They act like they donâ€™t hate fat people because they donâ€™t officially allow name-calling but it slips through and itâ€™s obvious even without that. I stopped subscribing there after a post about some random person on tumblr turned from being about their â€˜fatlogicâ€™ to about them being trans and I got shut down by a mod for saying thatâ€™s not got anything to do with â€˜fatlogicâ€™. Kind of cleared my vision and i realised theyâ€™re all just bigots and not very nice people, and that me participating in it had been a not very nice thing to do either.",False,False

I remember her commenting on a (probably Troll) post of a gal complaining about her ""belly fat"" (which she barely had) while being nearly underweight (two kilograms away) and that user STILL commented ""Well, you could lose another kilogram!"". For her being at 18.6 BMI is probably ""the pinnacle of health and fitness "" because skinnier=healthier to her (even though you probably won't reach that when you build muscle mass to begin with and NEVER SHOULD REACH WHEN YOU ARE ABOVE IT!).  Wouldn't surprise me if she was an active r/fatpeoplehate user in the past.  &amp;#x200B;  All that Subreddit is is a huge circlejerk and echo chamber that isn't afraid to shame people with ED in recovery (or generally people that have BED). I think a lot of people are in denial about their weight or eating habits on that Subreddit. I have seen so many comments about weighing your food and using MFP as a normal, healthy thing to do, it's uncomfortably familiar.  A lot of people there also seem to feel the need to announce that they are ""GeTTinG SkiNny and HeaLtHy, NO WORRIES EVERYBODY!"", because they know they could get shamed for being slightly overweight or above BMI 22.  &amp;#x200B;  I know it's hard, but try to avoid that Subreddit altogether, it took me a while to not use it as a trigger but it helps.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Please don't worry.
