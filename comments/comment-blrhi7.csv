So we just do practice experiments (which are repeated by each new class) in them and then write reports. What is unfortunate is that they line up very poorly with the class materials.,False,False

When I worked in a wet lab it was so easy to not eat all day. Not eating or eating in a rush in the hallway was so normal that no one notices if you skip lunch. Now I work in an office and while I like having a 9-5 job, I just sit on my fat ass all day and spend all my time trying not to eat like a piglet.",False,False

For pure sciences, like bio or chem you really need to get a PhD to be more than a pair of hands in the lab. I was a chem major, and basically got lucky to get a managerial position in a lab after paying my dues in a wet lab for 2 years or so. Then got my masters in chemical engineering and a world of opportunities opened up. Engineers donâ€™t need a PhD to get far, the ceiling is was higher than for a BS in a pure science. I suggest that route, unless youâ€™re planning on getting your doctorate. Which I still wish I did, but settled with the engineering masters since my job paid for it.",False,False
