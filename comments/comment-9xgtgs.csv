The meals are huge (to me). They‚Äôre my OMAD.    A few meals ago, I made marinated Alaska salmon filets with Maryland-style crab cakes (1 for each of us) and a side salad. 563 calories. And the person commented on the ‚Äúsmall‚Äù meals I make. In my head I thought, like ‚ÄúSmall meal?? An entr√©e and two sides is a small meal?! What the fuck is wrong with you???‚Äù    Then I realized.... at 563 calories for dinner, esp for an OMAD... what‚Äôs ‚Äòwrong‚Äô is me :(",False,False
