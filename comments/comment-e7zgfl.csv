The harder it is, the more likely my ed will talk me out of it and the less likely I‚Äôll have the energy or motivation to cook. I never learned how to cook. My dad tried you teach me but would just yell at me and do it for me. I also was vegetarian for 3 years and vegan for a short time. Just started adding meat back into my diet because I wasn‚Äôt getting enough nutrients as a vegetarian. Mostly because my sensory issues keep me confined to a small number of foods. I eventually want to be able to cook more but I‚Äôm mostly working on actually eating right now.",False,True

Those are really easy, you can do it with the chicken + whatever veggies you want, or you don't even need a protein. Also you don't have to use any oil if you can't, the soy sauce will work to grease the pan and add flavor.    You could try quinoa-based dishes, quinoa isn't any harder than rice!    Or savory oats. Prepare oatmeal as normal on the stove, but add onion/garlic/soy sauce and put the prepared chicken or egg on top.    Turkey chili, I can give you a recipe that's fairly simple if it's something you'd like",False,False

I pick a protein (chicken, turkey, jerky, sardines), add some veggies (sliced tomato, carrot or celery sticks), handful of pickles or a cheese stick, fruit....just a bunch of nibbles. Bonus for me is it looks like a lot of food and takes awhile to eat.  I meal prep so if I know I'm doing this, I just have containers of cooked meat/cut veggies all ready to mix and match.",False,False

With the chicken nuggets, you could do roasted potatoes if you‚Äôre ok with them. I just cut up a Yukon gold (I leave the skin on, but if it‚Äôs another kind of potato you might want to peel. Sometimes I do sweet potato and I peel it then) into cubes, and I mix them with a little salt, pepper (sometimes garlic powder) and you could add some olive oil if you‚Äôre ok with that otherwise you could just use non-stick spray. And then roast them on a baking sheet at 425¬∞ for about 30-ish min. I just check on them at around 15 min and flip them and then leave them in until soft. I always cover the pan in tin foil and use non stick spray because I‚Äôm lazy with the clean up. üò¨ I also roast broccoli or carrots this way.   Do you have a Trader Joe‚Äôs near you? They have a lot of easy frozen things you can just throw in a skillet and call it a day!",False,False
