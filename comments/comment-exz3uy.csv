When I was there there was people who were very severely overweight and severely underweight. If you're diagnosed with anorexia, your insurance may take your weight into consideration when deciding whether or not to cover you for an inpatient stay and there are usually lower limits for BMI for when PHPs or residentials will accept a patient rather than sending them inpatient (like... a partial program isn't going to take someone with a BMI 11), but for any other diagnosis weight doesn't really make a big difference. Other things that impact whether you'll be sent to inpatient or another level of care include but aren't limited to:  * Your vital signs * Your bloodwork * Your success in lower levels of care (like, I was in resi with a girl who was sent inpatient because they couldn't stop her from B/Ping in resi)  And those things matter more than weight from what I've seen regardless of diagnosis.",False,False

And a number of the girls there (bulimics) were not underweight. The severity of your symptoms is the determining factor, and for bulimics, that's how much you are binging and purging; that shit can kill you even if you're not underweight.",False,False

That’s totally not true. It’s also not true that insurance won’t cover you unless your anorexic. I was 230lb  at 5’8 when I was admitted. 6 months prior I was at 304lb. I was diagnosed with anorexia. You don’t have to be underweight to be anorexic, nor do you have to be overweight to be bulimic or have BED. Weight has nothing to do with how insurance covers things, and no residential will turn you away simply because you are not underweight (there are some exceptions I’m sure, but for the majority). Eating disorders come in all different forms and can be just as deadly as each other when left untreated and I would hope any insurance you have wouldn’t say no to helping you just because of a number.",False,False
