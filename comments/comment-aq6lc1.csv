If you had a seizure, it’ll be okay. You got the warning sign of feeling dizzy beforehand (a lot of people get warning signs before they have one), so if/when that happens again, tell someone who’s with you and sit down or lay down in bed, just somewhere away from any hard surfaces you could hit your head on.  In the meantime, pleaseee try to eat. I lost a significant amount of weight by eating oatmeal for breakfast, greek yogurt for lunch, and veggies for dinner. You’ll still lose a lotttt of weight and be able to tell if you passed out due to a lack of food or a seizure.",False,False

How can I tell if it's a seizure and not just some weird episode caused by low blood pressure? It really did feel like just a normal blackout taken a step further... now I'm really scared. Can seizures be induced by restriction or low BP?,False,True

And maybe a bit like a wake up call?  If it is related to eating, puhlease eat something . Because next time you could be super unfortunate as to pass out on a hard floor and hit your head or while driving. By eating something, you can also see if this truly IS a seizure. I didn’t know that I had seizures until I was 12 years old, so it can hit you later in life. It’s really terrifying but easily treatable, so you should really see if this is due to lack of eating or some other medical issue.  Stay safe! xx",False,False
