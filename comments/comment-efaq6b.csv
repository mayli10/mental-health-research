Being home for the holidays has really affected my eating habits and I’ve been binging so much. It’s usually just on cookies and other sweet shit I don’t even want.  I’m trying to start over though. I’ve planned my meals for today and I think it’s a reasonable about that I can stick to. I hope we both can get through this and stop binging. Best of luck friend,False,False
