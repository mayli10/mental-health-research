Apparently itâ€™s not a very popular kink. The recent videos (as far as Iâ€™ve see ) have all been kink/BDSM related. Itâ€™s only something I even think about, after having spent a few years in a community myself. :)   If thereâ€™s somebody force feeding their partner then posting videos I hope that sucker rots in jail.

If either party wants to back out, they immediately can, or have a safe word to convey such. In an abusive party, the submissive participant doesnâ€™t have the right or ability to stop - making it a matter of genuine (versus feigned/role playing) control, which is when itâ€™s abusive and should be fucking punished!

People enter kinky dynamics (which is what the feeder/feedie dynamic is...) because they find it to be a turn on, and pleasurable. Just like some people like having their hair pulled &amp; some people like being spanked, some people like having somebody control their food intake/being forced fed.  Itâ€™s not sick, just because we donâ€™t understand it. Now, I think that itâ€™s a Heath concern, but I donâ€™t think itâ€™s fair to conflate with things that sound abusive. These dynamics involve communication, boundaries &amp; respect of such.   ((Iâ€™ve spent time in BDSM/kinky communities... and while I never saw or encountered this kink in person, I understand the underlying dynamic)) ",False,False

I honestly feel so bad for them, I hate when the feeders dont even mention anything about loving the person, they only say things like ""I love seeing him/her get bigger I find them fatter = sexier"" its fucking sick how manipluative it is ðŸ˜ž",False,False
