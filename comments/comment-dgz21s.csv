I’ve never looked actually bony even when I was 17-18 BMI but I’m a lot healthier now and look slim ish sometimes when the dysmorphia isn’t hitting lol.",False,True

I don't think that method works lol",False,False

I don't think I know how to do it. Small-medium seems about right. Well we're all unhappy with our appearances here no matter what haha. If you had a small frame then you wouldn't look as bony at a lower weight. We all suck",False,False

So you put your arm straight out parallel to the floor, then bend it at the elbow perpendicular to the floor and measure from the inside to outside of your elbow with your fingers. Then, put your fingers against a ruler.  https://www.myfooddiary.com/resources/frame_size_calculator.asp this is the one I used, verified with a different one too :3  Sort of wish I had a small frame because I'd have the potential to look like a cute petite fragile girl rather than a 'shrunk' short girl, I'm sort of a 'viking' frame but short.",False,True

Need to know for research purposes...  My wrist puts me right on the border of small and medium. I wish I weighed more than I look. Then GW would actually be goals,False,False
