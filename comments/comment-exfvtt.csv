Once my mandatory therapist told me I was “The Most Severe Case They Currently Had”^(tm) because I was in for a suicide attempt and I was like 😎 strutting up to make a new appointment like it’s me, The Most Fucked Up Person Right Now^(tm) here to grace you with my mania, bitches",False,False

I think this is part why EDs are fundamentally maladaptive (?)  They whisper congratulations even as they’re stealing life away. The things that feel like gold stars are actually red flags. It’s just...it’s a whole paradigm of suffering where to win is to lose in a deep sense of the word.   But it’s not like I can just say ‘oh, I will choose to change my perspective on life and worth’ and *brushes hands together* wham bam, I’m cured! I can’t think my way out. I can’t magically swap to a perspective I’ve never known. Changed actions are the path I’m finding to changed thinking and changed feeling - it’s just very hard to take new actions when all the old feelings are there and the old thoughts are screaming that I’m a weak failure for choosing a path of recovery and self-compassion and a future. And it’s hard when the mental ruts are there sucking me back in, so the new choice has to be made over and over and over before it begins to feel like the new Truth. My brain tells me I’m weak. I ask my brain...if this feels like the hardest and scariest and most vulnerable thing I’ve ever done yet I choose each day to do it anyway, how is that weak?   &lt;3",False,False
