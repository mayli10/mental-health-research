I know it‚Äôs not the correct definition per se, but for me a binge is anything I didn‚Äôt plan on eating. For example, last night I had 4 bites of the dinner my roommate spontaneously made for us and I was awake for HOURS at night, obsessively thinking about it. I know it‚Äôs not a binge, but in my head, it kind of is.",False,False

I‚Äôve never posted about my binges on here but I‚Äôm in a support group and I‚Äôm afraid to give calorie ranges of my binges for that reason. That ill sound like I‚Äôm trying to one up people or something. So I just listen.   But in the end, all binges are scary because of the feeling of losing control. It‚Äôs like ‚Äúyes, you binged only x calories and you‚Äôre still skinny. But the number on the scale is never low enough. Seeing that number rise means you failed.‚Äù",False,False

I have MASSIVE binges that I plan in advance, three days and 30,000 kcal, eating everything I could ever dream of.   Then I‚Äôm in periods of intense restriction and I eat a BabyBel I didn‚Äôt meticulously plan out in advance and I get EXACTLY the same feelings as you describe, like suddenly I feel my stomach expanding and my jeans getting tighter.   They‚Äôre obviously radically different experiences, but I refer to both of them as binging. Like there‚Äôs no way you could objectively look at one of my long weekend feasts and not call it a binge. But if I eat something impulsively it feels like I lost control and that‚Äôs what I consider to be the primary factor in defining a binge.   I mentioned that about the control loss here once before though and somebody made a separate post on the BED subreddit calling me out so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",False,False

You get a lot of gatekeeping in this community, a lot of 'well mine's worse so yours doesn't count' And eventually you get to the point where you just roll your eyes and scroll past. Those people just Don't understand that eating disorders aren't one size fits all, and when you have that restriction mentality, going over what feels safe for you can make you panic.
