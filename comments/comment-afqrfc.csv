I only made it to the gym 5+ days in a week when I was so depressed I wanted to die. Trying to find some balance where I’m handling the depression and not letting my eating get away from me is tricky. Meds are mostly working, and my stomach problems have made restricting easy lately. That’s all nice, but I need to work out to get muscle to not look gross and self-loathing was such good motivation. Nothing else works as well as hating myself. :/",False,False

But I don't include my S&amp;M play either so.... maybe I'm deluding myself lollllllllll but no. I kinda classify cutting myself as a totally different coping behaviour, because I'm kinda in recovery from that for like +5 yrs   &amp;#x200B;  I do often swap/mix and match vices... like sometimes 'll drink more, sometimes I'll get more into ED behaviours, sometimes I'll spend irresponsibly etc. So, I guess I class most of my issues as ""coping strategies"" so someone could argue that all my choices are self-harm. Dunno.",False,False

Not seeing a therapist sooner when I knew I needed to? Self harm. Berating myself for eating too much and fasting or purging to compensate? Self harm. Impulsively spending money I don't have? Self harm.   In a way it makes sense. Yeah, its shrill to call it ""self harm"" but is it or is it not harming myself in one way  or another (either financially, physically, mentally, emotionally ect...)? Its bizarre how much sense it makes when you think about it.",False,False

Every time I enter treatment and can't restrict, self-harm urges intensify to fill that void.

I cut for quite a while before my eating disorder showed its full power, and once it did, the faint feeling, the actively denying my body nutrients, purging etc, plus the time consuming task of counting calories and overexercising made my cutting decrease by a lot.

I honestly don't feel much about my body (beyond thinking I'm the ugliest motherfucker who ever lived) I just want to punish myself for being a fuck up.
