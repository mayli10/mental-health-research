From what I can tell, eating is such a big part of the culture and usually the food is pretty carb heavy and I've noticed all my family in the Philippines are overweight. When I go there they are a little shocked, I get many comments about being so skinny, and they try and feed me up, even though I'm a normal bmi in the UK! I think Filipinos are not shy when it comes to weight comments, whereas in other places it can be a more sensitive topic.   Also I think any weightloss particularly at your height is probably just noticeable to them, especially if you don't see them often. ",False,False

I get the same reactions that you do where I'll lose 15 to 20 pounds which isn't that dramatic but people will be shocked when they meet me and say how thin I am. I think it's because on our short bodies even a small weight loss makes a big difference. Even I notice my weight loss very quickly in how my clothes fit my waist even if it's just 7 pounds. My face changes noticeably with 5 pound loss or gain. So for us shorties losing 10 pounds could make as much of a difference as losing 20 would in a taller person. That's the conclusion I've come to. Conversely even a small weight gain makes quite a noticeable difference when you are short so it works the other way too. I've had comments about weight gain when I've only gained 5 pounds. Even that little extra weight is obvious to other people.,False,False
