You are saying a lot of things that sound like you may be engaging in the mind reading cognitive distortion.   &gt; I can **imagine what everyone is thinking**, and it's either ""What's wrong with her,"" or ""Gosh, I wish I looked like that.""   Were they thinking this? You imagined, but that does not make it fact.   &gt;The wives don't want to talk to me, and the men aren't allowed to--**you can see it, the glares** or the 'already knowing I can't socialize with you even though we talk daily' [**wife shit, I'm cute]**.    This is more of you saying how you **think** others feel, but you can not know unless they told you their wives discourage them from socializing with you, or if the wives said this to you.  Well adjusted adults in marriages do not forbid things like talking to another women.   I think you may be romantasizing your dissorder. Its not ok to project thoughts or emotions onto other people, and very likely the people around you are not thinking those thoughts about you. Your ED is making it seem that way. ",False,False
