Did you know that oral megadose B12 supplementation is apparently as effective as shots? https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4993789/ So she doesn't need to be on shots necessarily if she is willing to take a pill daily.",False,False

She is anaemic and is supposed to get vitamin b12 shots that she rarely does. Don't know if her anemia is pernicious anaemia, she doesn't really like talking about herself.",False,True

In any case, it's not a nutrient sufficient diet so unless she's consuming a multivitamin and either a protein shake or a meal supplement/replacement shake I have more urgent concerns than ARFID or anorexia nervosa.",False,False

I just make sure to buy bananas whenever she visits so I know she's at least eaten 1 thing that day.",False,True

There are many more signs that make me think she's far from recovering but only mentioned what she eats in public.  Are those typical things someone with an ED eats/drinks would have probably been a more appropriate question. Thanks for answering nevertheless!,False,True
