I bet you look amazing, I'm always so jealous of people that can pull off super short hair!   You're right, I realised recently that my confidence is at an all time low and the hair cut might just save that but I guess I am scared it'll go the other way and I'll lose what confidence I have left. I will definitely go for it, possibly next week if I'm brave enough!",False,True

I've been rockin' a short undercut for nearly two years now and t's so... liberating! I actually feel physically lighter (I have naturally thick, curly hair and to be honest I think it added bulk.) The shaved sides bring out angles in my face I never noticed I had before. It definitely took some getting used to but just a small change like a haircut can do wonder's for one's self-esteem.  Change can be scary sometimes but it is so rewarding to take a positive risk!  Even just a few inches can make a difference to your self-esteem. Who knows, you may even get some compliments. And if you don't necessarily like it, it'll always grow back.   I'm sure you'll look absolutely stunning! :)",False,False
