Then the clean up.",False,False

Iâ€™m in a better place (definitely not recovery lol) than I was a couple years ago, but this used to be me. Whole afternoons and evenings lost to the kitchen/bathroom cycle.

I notice that when Iâ€™m stressed and hold out on the b/p I generally end up with a very explosive episode. My last one came at the end of a very stressful week, and I just couldnâ€™t stop. I ended up eating even more after throwing up, and then back to purge again.  It took multiple trips to achieve that peace ðŸ˜•",False,False
