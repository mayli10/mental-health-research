I was committed around this time last year and couldn‚Äôt wait to leave, my whole time there felt like hell. But it also did help, despite not being able to see it at the time, it allowed me to finally gain more of an insight into myself and actually start of loosen the constraints to the ED.   Anything to do with fighting back against an ED can feel excruciating and you‚Äôre absolutely valid in the way you feel, especially when you‚Äôre being made to do it, but try to keep in mind that this in no way defines you.   I‚Äôm sorry this is so all over the place I‚Äôm just trying (poorly) to convey that despite how utterly helpless this can make you feel, it will end, hopefully having made a positive difference of some kind.   Stay strong.",False,False
