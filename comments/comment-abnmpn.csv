I bought a table salt that's 75% potassium and 25% sodium, which is about the perfect balance for actual rehydration solutions. After drinking half a teaspoon of it diluted with 2-3 glasses of water my lips get soft, undereye circles fade, face slims down and I stop having headaches that I would have otherwise.  Drinking 2-3 glasses of water on their own without any electrolytes would just flush straight through in 30 minutes, where as with electrolytes all that water is actually being absorbed into the body to rehydrate it. I also think that supplementing combined with hands-free is why my face is never puffy even though I purge so often. The majority of people who purge don't supplement their electrolytes at all and get really dehydrated as a result, leading to their face holding on to water from chronic dehydration.",False,True

It has made my ED way worse though: the high I get from bringing isn't as intense as I'd imagine it to be for most people with bulimia, I just b/p for fum because it's so easy. If I had to use the gag reflex I would only do it extremely rarely. I'm still actively ruining my teeth and wasting money no matter how easy it is though. ",False,True

I assure everyone oh I just like to count my Cal's, I don't wanna go over a certain weight, I don't have a serious problem I just like my Cal's at a certein number. Only about 3 friends know I purge one I think has forgotten . I don't really talk about that at all. I find it so much easier to go through life with no one asking if you want this or that and no one pushing food on you and everyone being at an understanding of hey this is just how I prefer to eat. It's also a lot easier to hide the worst stuff that normies flat out don't understand when you're kinda open about it too. Like you tell them ""yeah I count calories and stress about my intake but it's not serious I have no interest in dying or being at a freakishly low weight everything is fine and it's really not as big of a deal as people think it is"" etc. It's easier than flat out lying which people legit get straight up mad at you for after a while.

She makes comments about me not eating enough almost every time I see her, to the point that I actually get worried that she does know. I don't think she suspects I purge though, because I've never done it with her anywhere near.  Besides that, I don't think so.
