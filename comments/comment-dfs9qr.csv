One fish burrito isnâ€™t going to do anything to you if youâ€™ve been eating like you say you have (or not eating) - collapsing in the shower is not safe and your body needed some nutrients and energy. Itâ€™ll be okay. I know itâ€™s hard.,False,False

I really appreciate what you said and that you took the time to write that out.,False,True

But what's even more okay is the burrito you ate! It's your ED brain vs your body and your body was screaming ""please, please take care of me, I need this.""  That burrito could have been the difference between you being okay right now, or you passing out and hitting your head on something dangerous. You got some great healthy nutrients and vitamins- fish is good for your hair and nails! Think of the burrito as self-care. Think of it as an apology to your body for putting it under so much strain. Think of it as the energy you need to get out of bed tomorrow morning.  You are wonderful, you deserve to take care of your body!",False,False
