I actually like them in Asian stir-fries. Iâ€™m eating them right now lol. But as a replacement in a fettuccine, for example, I find them a bit sad.",False,False

At the moment I'm trying to cut out refined carbs, and letting go of pasta/noodles has been the most upsetting blend of liberation, and that sinking *tee hee, I'm in danger* feeling. I'm already obsessing over minuscule amounts of wheat and whatever in Banza chickpea pasta, and I feel like now that I'm in this mode I'll never be able to consume pasta normally again. sO hYPeD for this new orthorexic phase /s",False,False

I made them with this [skinnytaste chicken &amp; broccoli stir fry](https://www.skinnytaste.com/chicken-and-broccoli-stir-fry/)   My fiancÃ© didnâ€™t like the texture of them though and a whole bag seems excessive for just me so I havenâ€™t made them again. I did just buy a bag last week though and plan to maybe make a ramen type dish or make this dragon noodle recipe that we like (but Iâ€™ve been too scared to eat bc of the udon noodle calories even tho udon noodles are my fave) and just use shirataki for mine and suffer watching him eat the udon lol,False,True

There is a [skinny fettuccine Alfredo ](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/skinny-fettuccine-alfredo-recipe/) recipe that I make sometimes and add shrimp too. Using light butter (50 cal per tbsp) instead of the oil &amp; skim milk. I have to weigh it out though and give myself a very certain amount   Thereâ€™s also a lean cuisine that is linguine with ricotta and spinach meatless meatballs thatâ€™s good but such a small amount of noodles  When I make meatballs at home I just eat garlic bread with the meatballs bc the amount of bread I want is like 140 calories compared to the amount of noodles I would want would be wayyyy more.   I recently tried spaghetti squash and like that but not sure Iâ€™d do it with marinara sauce or not. I need to try zoodles soon  Itâ€™s hard bc I cook for my fiancÃ© &amp; toddlers so I canâ€™t always weigh stuff out exactly so I just donâ€™t eat noodles bc Iâ€™m not eating them if they arenâ€™t weighed out. And the amount I would weigh out would be unsatisfying anyway,False,True

I made my favorite, angel hair spaghetti and cheesey garlic bread for my family for dinner (I live with my mom both because I'm broke and because she is sick and needs a caregiver).
