Low calorie, but takes a while to get it all down. For example, soup. Get some progresso light and fill your spoon with 1 solid peice at a time, along with the broth.  • Or have veggies! Broccoli is my fave. Steam it. Onion/garlic powder. Boom. Then, since its made up of “branches” cut off each small branch off the big ones (not the little rice-grain bits, I mean the smallest segment where theres still a stalk). Should take you at least 5 minutes to finish a big stalk (50 ish cals) • Whenever eating with knife/fork, cut the food into pieces no wider than your fork points. So about 1 square inch. No need to have a perfect measurement, but try to aim for that. • try to make the trip from plate to mouth as long as possible. Bagel? Cut it in half, Tear one piece off at a time. (Ive also notices this prevents the whole thing from being squished down when you bite it, so what you have left to eat looks bigger than it would!) Do this with as many foods as you reasonably can • ideally, do not eat anything that you take an actual bite out of, like a sandwich. Thats too easy to wolf down quickly. If you are eating a traditional “finger food” rip pieces with fingers •this last tip applies to any kind of food: drink something between bites! If you feel yourself getting a little too frenzied as you eat chug down a few gulps. Even if it doesnt slow you down you’re more likely to take a breather before you get too carried away because your stomach will fill up faster ",False,False
