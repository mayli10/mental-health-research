To reduce water in the body you can  -drink less and limit salt intake as much as possible -drink a lot and keep salt intake the same: you will pee like crazy  Ofcourse I""d recommend the second one.  Also, avoid carbohydrates because they cause a lot of fluid retention. That's because the carbohydrate-digestion process needs a lot of water to function. If you limit carbohydrate (so sugars etc) intake, you will lose a lot of water weight.   Try to stay clean from purging for a week , see if you can observe difference. I find it hard to point out the difference at first but recently it suddenly clicked in me that the days where I had purged, I was the least secure about my facial broadness. After a week of withholding purging , I have been asked by people if I had lost weight because my face was thinner. The  difference is so small but oh so significant.   Also also, put something cold on your face like a wet towel after purging , it may relax the skin and saliva glands (located on the sides of your jawline).",False,False
