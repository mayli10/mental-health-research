Five years is a really long time to suffocate in the embrace of such a maladaptive coping mechanism. Anything that causes analgesic effects can be addictive though. Maybe itâ€™s time to give in to discomfort and face the emotional pain head on.",False,False

Reading this breaks my heart, because I am in a very similar situation. I've been struggling with binging, used to tell myself if I ever hit xx I'd kill myself, thinking that was such a high weight that I'd never even come close, but I went 25 pounds higher. I was obese. I've recently lost ~30 pounds and am restricting again now and over exercising. EDs suck, and I'm sorry that you're struggling. My DMs are always open",False,False
