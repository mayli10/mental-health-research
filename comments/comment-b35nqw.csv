Idk how to make it better other than to say try your hardest to focus on your sport.    I’ve gotten into running as an adult and I’m currently working on my 5k time. I logically know I need to properly feed myself to do that but sometimes it’s so hard to see the numbers on MFP. But I know if I under eat my workouts will suffer.   That said the little disordered voice in my head has been MOSTLY behaving itself lately largely due to focusing on sport.    Hugs and I hope you do well! Triathlons athletes are so impressive!!  ,False,False
