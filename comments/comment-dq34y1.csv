Dinner was late tonight and my SO had something scheduled with his WoW guild but failed to tell me that until after I had a massive meltdown over being told to just go eat alone so now he thinks I am a huge baby who overreacts about everything and he hates me.

I don't think that my parents and my sister suspect about my orthorexia, but they have a very relaxed attitude when it comes to eating, so I never feel pressured to eat more or less than what I want. Also they're just really nice people and we're extremely close.   If I'm having a meal alone I tend to be extremely restrictive, but it's even worse if I'm eating in front of strangers (like in between lectures in college). In those situations I just can't eat. I have little snacks at most, like an apple, or a handful of almonds, or a few cherry tomatoes, but never anything substantial. Which is insane and super inadequate for my energy expenditure. I feel... Watched? Which makes no sense, because why would people care about what or if I'm eating? But still, I can't help it, even though I should really try and work on this issue as it's destroying my recovery efforts during the semester.  Weirdly enough, I restrict even when I'm with close friends. They don't know about my ortho, and while they know that I am very into fitness, they don't know that I burn over 3000 calories in an average day.
