But, I agree with you it feels like he does it mainly for money these days. Sometimes he just argues for the sake of arguing without understanding others' perspective you know. Though, I admit I don't know much about Jameela's content, she may be FA for all I know, but it's just this specific post of hers and his response that hit a nerve with me",False,True

Like, yeah, there is a vocal majority that constantly yells about how being fat can be healthy and uses fat logic, but they're the MINORITY.   Also, it seems to me that Jameela's post was specifically aimed at people with eating disorders or people at risk of developing them. I also don't see a counterpoint to anything she said, it's all good stuff. You can lose weight without getting sucked into unhealthy ""diet culture"".",False,False

There were times that I was rolling my eyes during his recent video tbh. Like you said he seems to take everything as FA logic but like... body acceptance and anti-diet culture isn’t inherently healthy. Especially when it’s specifically aimed at people with immense guilt and issues with food. I really think he needs to step back and think about whether he really needs to comment on things sometimes. But I think he needs “content” to make more videos (and more $$$) so he uses anything he can so that he can make a 10 min video and get paid.,False,False
