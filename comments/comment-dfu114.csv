You said that you are vegan for ethical resasons and not becuase of the ED but I think that when you have an ED everything you do is always in a way related to it.  I can understand the guilt of binging on something you are ethical against.  You said you found some non vegan safe food and so I think you should keep eating them for the moment.  Animals and the planet are important but you are more, if being vegan makes you binge on non vegan food maybe you should try to not force yourself on eating vegan and you shouldn't feel guilty.  when you'll feel better you'll be able to eat vegan again but for now don't be hard on yourself  I also was vegan for ethical reasons and I thought it wasn't ED related and I also started non vegan binges. now I try to eat what I crave without feeling guilty and since lately I'm feeling better I automatically started to eat more vegan. I just stay away from meat and milk because I know that I will feel guilty for sure after eating it.",False,False

I drank more coffee because I was able to drink it with soy milk now, which suppressed my appetite. So I started eating less than normal, and of course ed brain came in and praised me into relapsing, which is why I'm here now",False,False
