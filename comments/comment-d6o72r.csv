Your weight is not disgusting.   As you restrict, your body will start going into [Starvation Mode](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/starvation-mode#section2) which will literally fight your attempts to lose weight by causing metabolic damage. What that means is that your metabolism will slow down to stop burning as many calories because it sees it is starving and is trying to protect you. This will trigger the cravings, and the ED brain that wants to binge.   Remember, the more you restrict, the more your body will try to rubberband back to what it feels is normal. think of it as a pendulum - the more you restrict, the more you will binge later. You don't want that because it fucks your head and makes you feel fucking terrible.    So, what do you do?   Your body needs fuel so it can burn. You need to gradually lower your weight so your body/brain doesn't think it is starving and starts conserving energy. Generally, 1kg /2 Pounds a week is ""normal"" but frankly, I know how manic I get about weight and I have never felt that 2 pounds a week is normal.   You will not lose 50 pounds by the end of the year safely. If you are exercising, you will build muscle and muscle weighs a lot. As you lose more weight, you will burn less calories, and you will need to exercise more/restrict more to keep the levels up.   Also, unless you are in the Southern Hemisphere, you are heading into winter and you will be less active anyhow, and with the holiday coming up, you are putting yourself into a situation where you will hate yourself at every food interaction. Either you will hate that you will eat, or hate that you are not eating.   My suggestion is to stay at 1200 \*at the very least\* and keep with your workout regime. slow and steady will win the race, and check in with your mental health every 15-20 pounds and figure out what *feels* the best for you.   Remember, you are not a number, you are so much more excited and more important than a number.   &amp;#x200B;  hugs",False,False

These really help speed it up!,False,False
