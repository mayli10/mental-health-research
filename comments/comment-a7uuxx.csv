I ordered a ""large"" (which I guessed was either regular or two regulars!) and ate half of it. That way if regular was 520 I ate 520, or if they just give me a regular and let me call it a ""large"" then I ate half that, haha. Then I counted the full 520 because I can't take any risks.... thank you so much for looking in depth! I appreciate it so much!",False,True

It seems like everything they show is a regular fried rice side or a kidâ€™s fried rice side. I wonder if these the different sizes you mean (if they say small but mean a kids side) but from what I see, the only regular size they have (9.3 oz) is 520 calories and the kids size (6.2 oz) is 350 calories. If all else fails, just order the kidâ€™s sized side of fried rice since at least itâ€™s listed with the size and calories correctly lol. Good luck! ",False,False
