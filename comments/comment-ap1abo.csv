We have some shared groceries (the basics), but mostly we buy our own food. I get blamed every time the milk runs out and I can't defend myself without admitting that I haven't eating (or drank) anything. So now I just buy extra milk, even though I don't drink it and will still be blamed if it runs out. They also know I don't eat bread, yet my sister still tried to blame me for eating half a loaf a few weeks ago, even though I bought the loaf... honestly can't wait until I can move out.",False,False
