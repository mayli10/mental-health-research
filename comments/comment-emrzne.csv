No idea what my bf% was but it was at a weight I'd always had trouble losing past for whatever reason so I feel like my body needed time to sorta 'regroup' to maybe change fat distribution or adjust hormones or something like that? Like to fix the things that go out of whack when you lose weight too quickly,False,False
