I too have lost almost 50 pounds now, and I think I disliked other fat people more when I was heavier than now. I mean sure, I'm still against the whole extremist HAES movement, but I think I have a larger understanding of the reason behind why it started in the first place, before it was convoluted into the shitshow we have now.  Honestly though, no one would spend that much time worrying about hating on other people without an issue that they have with themselves.",False,False

Most of family is overweight or obese, and since high school I've gone from an obese to high end of normal bmi (80 lb loss). When I was bigger I really tended to try to ignore the obvious health and mobility issues I saw in people around me, and was a lot less judgy. Since losing weight I've kinda turned into a bitch about it tbh, like I would never say anything to anyone's face but it's so hard watching people make excuse after excuse for their unhealthy habits and live in complete denial about how bad their weight and health are.  The ones who are constantly on new stupid fad diets that never give them real results are the worse imo. No understanding of how weight loss works, thinks there's some magic bullet that will just let them shed all the pounds without putting any real work in. I roll my eyes so much listening to some people I know talk about weight loss, they're just so ridiculously misinformed and it's obvious they'll give up within a month or two.  Also, the made up thyroid issues/big bones/slow metabolism/obesity runs in my family so it's just genetics crap. Especially when you see how they eat on a regular basis, and it's obvious the reason they're fat is their diet, plain and simple.  I know a lot of why I'm so bitchy about it is I'm just mad at myself for ever getting as big as I did in the first place, but still. Also, when I was at my HW I 100% was in hardcore denial and didn't want to accept how much of it was just my own damn fault, so I think that's where a lot of my anger on that comes from. Losing weight was hell for me, but I dedicated myself and fucking did it. Listening to other people's crap excuses just really sets me off I guess, lol.",False,False

My worst childhood abuser was a morbidly obese hoarder and my anorexia was a direct response to her. Her life was the embodiment of chaos and I tried to compensate with iron-fisted control.   At this point I feel a visceral discomfort being around morbidly obese people because I associate it with chaos because of my abuser. I use shows like My 600 lb Life as reverse-thinspo because I am running from my abuser even long after she died.   But that MY problem because of MY baggage. Those people did nothing to me. Your friends and coworkers (I hope) are not abusing you. Don’t let your own emotional turmoil affect your ability to connect with others if you can help that.   I highly suggest you seek out therapy if you haven’t already. It’s good that you recognize this shift in your behavior and thought patterns, you would probably do very well in a therapy setting with that kind of self-awareness.",False,False
