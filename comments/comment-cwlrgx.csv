BMR tells you the calories you would burn if you laid very still in bed all day.  Your normal daily activities add a good chunk on top of that.,False,False

None of us ever got better from being force fed",False,False

You go on the treadmill daily AND go to the gym 3 hours a week.  Me, a 5'4 low-healthy weight woman, burns 1,400 calories by being alive. I don't know your height or weight but this is probably less than you, as males have a higher BMR usually.  So let's say your BMR is 1,500, for example purposes. You would burn 200-300 calories on the treadmill if you SLOWLY walk for an hour. That already ups your TDEE to 1,700-1,800 a day, without the gym time. At the gym, you may burn around 400 calories. Spread that out over a week, that adds on an extra 150 calories a day -- so your TDEE (this is an underestimation) would be 1,850 -1,950 a day.  Yes, it may not be 2,200, but it's definitely not as low as you think it is either",False,False
