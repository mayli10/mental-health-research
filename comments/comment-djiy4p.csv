I mean, I think we both still have a skewed view of what's okay but no you are definitely not alone in thinking she doesn't look ""that sick"" currently. She does, but she's looked way w worse so to me it looks like she's getting better. She's definitely not, but that's the point of all getting all that work done.",False,False

She's had a lot of work done, veneers, etc. This isn't confirmed but I know many other Youtubers do it; I believe she uses filters on her videos and thumbnails to look more healthy and professional. You can see exactly where her cheek fillers are because she's so skinny. I think she's gained some fat (def less lean now) since becoming vegan and basically eliminating all fat and most protein from her diet.  Admittedly, I always thought she was ""goals"" despite knowing to everyone else, she was very shocking to see (more so a few years ago than now). She wears tinted moisturizers now too when previously she never wore face makeup, so you can't see how discoloured her skin actually is. She has veneers so you cant see how damaged her teeth are.  She's a fake. While she doesn't owe anyone her life story, I'm disgusted people like her can make a living off marketing their illness. No, it's technically not her main grab but people with EDs naturally gravitate to people like her.",False,False
