I don‚Äôt want to go back down that road but it really does mean a lot to know that there‚Äôs a less dangerous method to the madness üíï  I was also tested a couple weeks after the light headedness began and they said my blood work was healthy. I even asked to be tested specifically for anemia and that came back healthy. I think it has more to do with my blood sugar as I would just eat a small snack and would feel 10 times better after a couple minutes but I have no idea. Thankfully it‚Äôs gotten better and (unfortunately) my periods are more regular but i thank you anyways for the warning,False,True

My goal is also to exercise and have a healthy view on my body. I just have to get past the lethargy first.  I‚Äôm glad that you‚Äôre on a healthier path! That really is wonderful to hear   Thank you so much for your kind words and support üíï",False,True

You can get calorie free electrolyte additives to add to water. Especially use these if you‚Äôre working out and make sure to add salt to whatever meals you eat.   2) get checked for anaemia. Honestly the light-headedness and period loss you mention sounds a lot more anaemia-related to me than standard eating disorder fuckery.   3) volume eating. You will feel more satisfied and less unwell if you focus on eating bulky low-calorie foods. Avoid things like protein bars and granola and other ‚Äúhealth foods‚Äù because you will just find yourself eating less of it and feeling more miserable.,False,False

I really do sympathise.  I often see pictures of people who are underweight and feel really envious (and feel really bad for feeling envious cos they‚Äôre clearly struggling and I know I shouldn‚Äôt want that!) and look back at my own period of being underweight (I‚Äôm now slightly overweight) through rose tinted glasses....  But the reality was I was totally miserable.  I felt physically awful and was so stressed and anxious all the time, and tired!  And I wasn‚Äôt satisfied with my body at ALL.  It was never enough, I saw myself as worse and worse and was more and more critical the thinner I got!  So even though it‚Äôs totally easier said than done and something I still struggle with, it‚Äôs worth trying to set a new goal.  Now I‚Äôm aiming for being lean and petite but through exercising and getting lean muscle, so I can be healthy and feel good and be a healthy BMI but also look less *lumpy* as I always wish I did... it‚Äôs a long way off for me but I‚Äôm much happier having that as a goal.    Good luck and you can always DM me if you need support x",False,False
