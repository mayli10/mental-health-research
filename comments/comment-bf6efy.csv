I can understand he has a specific type, as does everyone, but encouraging you to be underweight and keeping a strict weight for you is really messed up.

Especially keeping my body a certain way and going out of my way to make sure I was ""better"" than other girls he found attractive. I HATE that I was meant to feel that way for a time, it is such a horrible and ugly feeling. I am happy to see females as beautiful again and in no way competition.   &amp;#x200B;  I am ranting now and hope everything I said is okay. Don't disappear. The fact that you feel you can recover maybe means immersing yourself in positive atmosphere with support. I know a few girls who went through treatment and it was very liberating for them when there. Not going to lie, they still struggle, but it was positive and unconditional support that got them through that really tough step. I wish you all the best and hope that you can overcome this situation and find a place of peace.   &amp;#x200B;  Also, someone posted on here earlier a documentary on Netflix called "" I am Maris"" I watched it and found it really beautiful and actually a non triggering ED watch.
