I started restricting hardcore again when I lost my little sister this year to cancer.    For me, there’s a lot in my life that I can’t control. My parents are divorcing now, and it’s a messy and vindictive divorce, from both of them. The loss of my sister hits me at unexpected times and just makes it hard to even breath. My 3 kids and husband still need me to be present and I’m working 2 nearly full time jobs mainly as a distraction.    For me, the food obsession is just another distraction. I think about and obsess about food because if that is occupying my mind I don’t have to think about the real problems and the real pain and loss. I can’t control cancer, but I can control my food.",False,False
