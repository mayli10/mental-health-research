Honestly it spurred me on because for me AN has always subconsciously been a way of externalising my mental pain. So when I was in the worst depths of AN but was being told I looked great with no one noticing I was disordered AF and in need of help (despite it really being pretty obvious) I was just like OK well I guess I'll just have to go full pointy alien aesthetic before anyone will take me seriously when I say I need help.,False,False

But like guys, you validate me and then all of a sudden worthy of your praise and then you get mad at me for fearing what I was before?",False,False

Like many of is are aware of hiw over-restriction can trigger uncontrollable binge impulses.   The way we (as a society) eat today is so so so new to the human experience.,False,False

It’s kinda like alcoholism I guess, sure our culture has an unhealthy relationship with drinking, but it’s a very small part of other people’s lives. But to an alcoholic it’s huge, maybe even the biggest part of it. They may see everyone else binge drinking on the weekends and think “wow everyone is so fucked up with alcohol” and while that’s kind of true, it’s blown out of proportions by their own fixation on alcoholism. Symptoms don’t make a diagnosis and all that.",False,False

Like yes, they are horrible, but given that it feels like EVERYONE is weight obsessed and talking about weight whilst simultaneously being surrounded by easy access, shit quality foods that are basically designed to be addictive why is anyone surprised!??  Like up until I starved myself to ""scary"" in my previous bout of AN I got frequent unsolicited comments praising my weight loss and ""discipline"" - then one day it crept over an arbitrary line into ""too thin"" and suddenly everyone's speaking in whispered tones about why anyone would do that to themselves. ARGH.",False,False

Gluten free, sugar free, keto ect... of course, i was a girl scout and we had cookies in the house.
