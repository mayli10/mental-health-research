Mine is different every time I am measured. I really freaking hate it, but at the end of the day it just isn't easy to be precise.   It depends on your posture, the time of the day (you shrink throughout the day), the doctors measurement method, and the doctor themselves. I'm sure there's even more factors that go into it, so 2 cm isn't a big difference in the scheme of it all. Just because that is what you were measured at today doesn't mean it is your actual height and the previous measurements are wrong.",False,False
