Tell her you don't like her commenting on your weight and be more sensitive about these things. You need to teach her a lesson because if you keep forgiving her for something unforgivable, she will keep thinking those types of remarks are okay and will continue to be an asshole. Weight is not a measure of self worth! Kind words, respect, and knowledge should be valued. She apparently does not have respect and is not helping anyone in any way. It is pretty sad someone as old as her would say something so rude and insensitive like that.",False,False

I don't think she has an ED, she's only very recently started eating ""healthily"". By going thru it I meant that she's a hormonal teenager, and i remember how much I hated being a teenager lol. sadly, no clue how receptive she'll be to talking T\_T",False,True

Like my older bro is a lot bigger than me, and ofc Iâ€™m an anorexic girl, but I would NEVER use my smaller size against him. I canâ€™t say itâ€™ll fix everything but you should definitely talk to her about how it makes you feel. Good luck ðŸ’–",False,False
