I grew up really poor with three older brothers so I'm still not used to the concept of ""leftovers"" now that I financially support myself, and my whole family's livelihood has stabilized a bit. What do you mean normal people have food leftover from meals?? And that they just throw it away if they don't want anymore??? Wild.   I know, it's so hard tho. I skipped the gym this week because my projects were weighing down on me and I know it's my dumb ED but seeing that jump on the scale is. Wowee it's a doozy. It's hsrd to be kind, but I'm trying. Thank you for your kindness.   I laid out a spread this morning of all my leftovers before I left for my seven hour shift and told my roommates and our guests to eat all of it. I'm hoping they've demolished it all and I can do the dishes and go back to my happy, empty, and clean shelf of the fridge. Ugh. I'll just feel so much better knowing I don't have to throw away perfectly good food. I'm lucky I work all day and have been pretty distracted, thank you so much for your nice words ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I just am freaking out. It will pass, it will pass.",False,True

I never understand how my bf says ""I'm full"" and leaves food on his plate. I practically lick every morsel off my mine and I would eat his too if he didn't stop me. I ate a massive plateful of just plain rice and baked beans on Friday, just because it was leftovers and I couldn't bear to see it go bad. And rice is one of my fucking fear foods?!!  Honestly hon you'll be fine. Considering that you were restricting and liquid fasting during the week, the numbers on the scale are just water weight. You haven't undone everything just with these two weekends. Please don't be too harsh on yourself.  Tomorrow is a new day. If you're worried about self-control maybe you can give some of the food/ice cream sandwiches to your roommates/friends? That way it won't go to waste but you don't have to eat it.  For now, just make sure to keep drinking water or some herbal teas, maybe take a walk or nap or binge watch a TV show to distract yourself from the bloated heavy feeling. It is a horrible feeling but it is temporary and it will pass. ðŸ’•",False,False
