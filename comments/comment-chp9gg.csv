That's actually pretty common advice we give in class, alongside getting enough sleep and making sure there's balance between homework and fun. Though, I can totally imagine why you felt singled out, every time anyone mentions bulimia in my psych classes I feel like my ears are burning lol! Pretty sure it was just a coincidence and your prof didn't mean anything by it, though it's hella understandable why you felt that way.",False,False

It just felt that way. It could also just be a guilty conscience. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯,False,True

The professor didn't single her out, didn't name her, nor drew direct attention to her. Further, OP doesn't know if the professor has any clue, so putting it on the evaluation would be very confusing.   &amp;#x200B;  And what would you say anyway? ""I have a secret eating disorder and I think the Professor knew and they may have sent me a hidden message in class in an indirect way to let me know that they know, that made me feel uncomfortable.""",False,False

In high school there were several times a teacher would ""subtly"" say something while looking at me. Never as personal as ED-related (but still related to academic performance). Maybe it's a way of nudging students or something? Idk but because I have experienced it, I don't think you're crazy. But you also might be reading more into it because it's so relevant. Regardless, it's jarring and stressful.",False,False

I would have been petrified if I were you. That reminds me of the time my director and I were discussing everyone's New Years diets and I joked that everyone should try mine since I lost so much weight and she was like ""what's that? puking?"" and I shit you not, I had just purged not long before that conversation so I was afraid she could tell either from my bloodshot eyes or the smell of stomach acid on my breath...",False,False
