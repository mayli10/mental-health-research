I have most of those powdered things at home already (and toasted black sesame seeds are my favourite high-cal, nutrient-dense treat!) so I'll try experimenting a bit.  I will definitely hunt for gochujang, thanks for the tip!  And yes, I count Sriracha as 5cal/tsp because it is soooo sugar heavy;)",False,False

Last time I went it was mostly me checking out sauces and putting them back after looking at the nutrition labels. lol. I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve found a magic low-cal product yet, but I do the following for my stir-fry sauces: low sodium soy sauce (10 cal per tbsp) with Sriracha (allegedly 0 cal per tsp, so probably more like 5 cal per tsp) as a base. From there, you can just add some seasonings or powders to bulk up your sauce or add directly onto your food item for flavor.   Some ideas that might be exclusive to your Asian grocer are capsaicin powder (if you like REALLY spicy like me üå∂) and rice seasoning (this comes in many varieties, but I got one with shredded dried seaweed, bonito flakes, and sesame seeds. yum!). Other ideas are powdered peanut butter, nutritional yeast, and garlic powder. These kinds of seasonings have much lower calorie counts (10-20 cal per tsp with the exception of powdered PB) than oil-based sauces.  A slightly higher cal option is gochujang, a spicy Korean sauce. It‚Äôs a pretty dense paste, but you can make it go further by using it with liquid (soy sauce, water).   I‚Äôm not really an expert since I just started cooking but I hope this is helpful! üòä",False,False
