Personally (even though I tend to overeat and am overweight) I find eating on my plan to a complete pain in the ass. I'm all like why the fuck am I hungry again? Then I realize its lunchtime and an appropriate time to eat again. Or on my days off I find eating breakfast particularly annoying. I just want to go about my day without food then I wonder why my knees tremble while I'm walking down stairs. ,False,False
