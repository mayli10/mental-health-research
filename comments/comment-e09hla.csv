I will either eat cereal dry or put it in yogurt if I don’t have any coconut milk but cereal with milk is something I see as a treat and I refuse to mess with actual milk.  The big draw of some cereals like Cheerios to me is the crunch and that it’s fortified with iron and since I don’t eat much cooked meat or a lot of meat + don’t have as good access to frozen vegetables like spinach anymore (I hate living with the family I had to move in with sometimes but the circumstances are going to change eventually) so I want to at least try and get enough iron,False,False

I don't understand why supersize vs superskinny keeps recommending cereal as a good breakfast choice. It's  extremely sugary (which makes it so addictive) and the amount of fibre in even the moist fibrous 'healthy' cereal is still far inferior to actually fibrous products like bread , veggies and fruit.  A bag of cereal has never lasted more than 48 hours with me, I'm never buying this crap again.",False,False
