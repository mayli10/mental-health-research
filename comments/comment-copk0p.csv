I will drink a whole box of tea in one day because to me, what I binge on is much less important than just obsessively consuming something. So Iâ€™ll make myself a cup of tea to drink while I watch tv at night after the kids are in bed then have some carrots then have 4 popsicles so it feels like I had a lot of food but in reality only had about 50 calories.  For me itâ€™s just going into the kitchen and coming out with something to consume. I always need a food or drink or I feel very anxious.",False,True
