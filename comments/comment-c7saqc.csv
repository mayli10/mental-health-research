After the first couple bites, I realize the money I wasted, the setback, the physical pain, all of it. It’s only been 3 days but it’s stopped a months long cycle.",False,False

And taking it one day at a time is perfect too, not overwhelming. I am going to try to incorporate that when I am struggling.
