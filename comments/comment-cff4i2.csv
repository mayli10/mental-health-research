I mean, at most, its been shown people like symmetrical faces but its not like a deal breaker lol. I kind of wish and objective machine were invented as well. Would be helpful. Could probably change my appearance and go back for a higher score lol. (Also, can you imagine? ""Sorry, i really like you, but you're not symmetrical enough for me"" üòÇ)",False,False

There‚Äôs different standards based on culture, time period, and individual preference. I‚Äôm sure there are some people who don‚Äôt look twice at you but there are others who think you‚Äôre stunning. There‚Äôs someone for everyone.   And beauty isn‚Äôt just physical. Some people are ‚Äúaverage‚Äù looking but they have a smile and magnetism that draws every eye in the room to them. I have a cousin like this. No one would look at a picture of her and declare her to be beautiful but in person, she gets all kind of attention because of the way she carries herself. I think the secret is not caring how others perceive you. People are attracted to that freedom you have when you feel this way.",False,False
