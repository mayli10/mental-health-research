It's about a subjective binge vs objective binge.   A subjective binge is more about the mindset -- your mind thinks it's a ton of food, but in actuality, it's an adequate amount of food for your body.  An objective binge is where you are eating to the point of stomach pain or discomfortable and it is a large amount of food.",False,False
