HAES gets such a bad reputation because it has been coopted by so many obnoxious people. HAES means you don‚Äôt have to be a 19 BMI to be healthy because healthy looks different on every body. HAES doesn‚Äôt mean that binge eaters with a 40 BMI are healthy!!!! To me, it‚Äôs more that you can‚Äôt determine health based on someone‚Äôs size alone. There are so many factors that go into a person‚Äôs health.     I‚Äôm sort of okay with HAES and body positivity. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything wrong with meeting yourself where you‚Äôre at and loving yourself as-is. Sounds like a pipe dream to me, but if someone likes their body, that‚Äôs awesome.
