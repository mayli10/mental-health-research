I think Dominos is usually around 250 per slice. So an 8 slice pizza would be around 2,000 calories.  Also, you are right that Dominos is absolutely garbage pizza, but I got a bacon and spinach pizza from them recently and I was actually sad when I ran out of leftovers. It was shockingly good. I kinda wish more pizza shops would make spinach an available topping now. I'm sure that a small mom and pop pizza shop instead of a chain restaurant would make an amazing bacon and spinach pizza.",False,False

Although I donâ€™t envy the feels I can almost taste the heavenly soft dough and salty rubber pepperoni disks. Whatâ€™s life without cheap pizza anyway? Do you really want to live in a world like that? Itâ€™s all good we all do it sometimes ,False,False

My go-to binge is a garlic cheese pizza and a garlic bread. I so nearly ordered it last night but got mad wasted instead. Probably drank as many calories :/,False,False
