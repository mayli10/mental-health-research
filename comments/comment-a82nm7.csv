If I drink without eating, yeah the alcohol hits me quicker but it makes me a much sloppier drunk and makes for a worse hangover. Also more likely to feel nauseous. Depends how old you are though. When I was 20 I used to drink on an empty stomach all the time and I guess it was okay but I'm 27 now and drinking on an empty stomach always ends in disaster for me.",False,False

I can’t gauge if one slice of bread is enough, but it’s worth finding out what works for you if you regularly go out drinking. Hopefully a slice is enough for you. ",False,False
