But the plan already contains free days, but not too many because it's not possible. It's &gt;100 days of full studying and about 25 days to recapitulate all the learning matter. So I have less than 25 free days within those 150 days... And it won't help. I know myself. I started 16:8 intermitted fasting and it kinda helps at the moment... But I still eat a lot within those 8h. We'll see what happens :/",False,False

I too am challenging standardized tests, and due to a bureaucratic mess, I've spent most of the past month not knowing WHEN.   Now I know that the practical one will be on Tuesday, and I'll likely have upwards of a week (if not close to a month) to study for the theory one. So I just have to get through to Tuesday, and if some takeout/extra booze happens between now and Tuesday, it won't amount to much gain. I've yet to genuinely binge and don't think I will.  Since you have 150 days, maybe take one or two days to not study and re set? It'll probably help you get out of binge mode.",False,False
