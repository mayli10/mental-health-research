I didn't have a sex drive though, but I saw that as a positive. The only thing that freaked me out was that I would get what I can only describe as bone pain in one of my legs if I put a lot of weight on it suddenly.  At a BMI 16, I got cold more easily. My resting heart rate was in the 50s. I'd get tired easier.  BMI 14 I would feel faint occasionally. One time I almost blacked out just from getting severe anxiety one morning. I felt a bit weaker. Body felt very ""light"". I remember feeling like I'd fall over when the wind was particularly strong. Sitting hurts because you're sitting on your tailbone, so you lean forward usually. Standing up is hard, so you use your arms a lot. I also slept less, with 6 hours per night usually in 3 hour intervals.  The scariest side effect was how pleasant I felt at that lowest weight. I just felt at peace with the world. I even became okay with dying. It's hard to describe.  Anything below a BMI 17 seems to be where the health problems begin. Even at a BMI 17 you'd really want to focus on nutrient dense foods and possibly supplementing with vitamins.",False,False

The thing is they'd then maintain there without a change to their eating habits, whereas no one is going to maintain their weight on 400 calories. I'm 5'5"" and active (20-30 hours of dance per week, at least in the on season which it currently is not) and would maintain at like 105lbs on a 2000 calorie diet, so long as my activity levels didn't change.   But that example was more to illustrate the ""getting to underweight"" part. If I were the doctor of a person who was maintaining a low weight without disordered habits, I'd probably want them to gain a few pounds just to be on the safe side. ""Eat a spoonful of peanut butter before bed"", etc. The thing is that this IS really unlikely. This would really only happen to someone who had fallen into a food routine and who was not prone to eating low-nutrient foods. It'd also be more likely to happen to someone who is for example on medication for ADHD. I think it's smarter and closer to reality to view being underweight as unhealthy by default, because although there are exceptions, there's really no reason not to weigh a bit more and be out of that risk zone.  Honestly, and maybe this is hypocritical of me, but I really don't think there's a ""good"" reason for anyone to be underweight intentionally. It might be better for you to scaffold yourself into seeing a BMI below 19 as a wake up call. That's going to be smaller than average in most Western nations, but keeps you at a better risk level. ""What you need"" is enough calories and nutrients to function optimally at a healthy weight. I tell myself this, but at the same time... I want to be able to get a job, lmao.",False,False

I’m curious if you think the person in your example that eats 2000 calories and is active until they reach a BMI of 17.9  is healthy despite being underweight (although I realize it’s not by a lot). I’m wondering how realistic it is that a woman who starts out at an average weight, BMI 21-22 or something, would get to an underweight BMI without some disordered habits or unhealthy obsession. Maybe athletes like yourself are a good example, (but then EDs are elevated in athletes as you know).   Also not even gonna pretend this is not totally personal...I don’t restrict anymore like I used to but I’m so active I have continued to very slowly lose weight - I’m very rigid in my thinking/obsessed with my body/have some binging/purging which are the bigger issues but I eat at least 2000 calories a day. I struggle with knowing how thin I can get before I’m unhealthy I feel like until I’ve reached the lower limit I’m somehow failing or just want an excuse to eat more than I need..",False,False

If you supplement your vitamins and keep your hormones in check then I don’t personally see the problem with it. Heart health is another thing. Steady state cardio can keep your heart healthy. I think there is a way to be underweight and still be a healthy person, as long as it’s not extreme",False,False

But I think, being slightly under (BMI 17 or even 16) isn’t that bad. I’m healthy I feel healthy.

My nails were blue and my limbs would fall asleep so quickly. Id wake up in the middle of the night because my limbs were asleep, and being underweight ruined my ability to sleep.  Not to mention hormones. For women especially, having low body fat ruined my hormones. My period was gone, which is super unhealthy especially for bone health. My breasts were way smaller, not just because I had less fat overall, but my hormones generally just were out of whack so my fat distribution had changed . I had more body hair. This is all examples of damage to hormones. My body temperature was low, my metabolism was low.   You lose your period/ hair/ heart rate slows/ etc because when you’re underweight, your body tries to conserve energy to survive. Hence being tired all the time, low energy. Having a menstrual cycle takes energy. So does growing hair and keeping warm. That’s why this stops, these functions are shutting off to help you live my dude. Yeah, it’s unhealthy.  In recovery I gained 6 lbs in 3 weeks due to extreme hunger (which is less than I thought considering how much I was eating) and my resting heart rate is now at 60 and my limbs don’t fall asleep. My bmi is now 17.8, which is still underweight but I guess not significant enough (for MY body personally) for my functions to stop as much",False,False

When I first became underweight I was okay for a while, but then as time went on my body just started getting weaker. I can make it through a day anymore with just half a bagel and even when I do eat enough I can't process the food properly which means I get sick and don't get as much energy out of it. I'm currently waiting to see my doctor so she can recommend me to a specialist so I can find out if I inherited something from my mom or just destroyed my body. I have a few symptoms in common with my mom, but I also have times where I'm literally in so much pain or so tired from my illness that I can't even leave my bed. Even if I did inherit what my mom has there's probably something more going on as a result of being underweight for a few years.",False,False

Female swimmers, soccer players, powerlifters, surfers, lacrosse players, rowers, javelin throwers, snowboarders, horseback riders? I would assume most of them are in the normal weight range. Have you seen that Howard Schutz photo series of top athletes in peak condition? Lots of variation in bodies. Many fitness gurus exhibit what me in my armchair suspect is disordered behavior, so even if their bodies are doing all right, their minds may not be.   There is a reason there is a normal weight range. There is also variation within overweight and underweight ranges. Someone with a 17.5 BMI is at less risk to develop serious problems than someone with a 14.5 BMI — and same with 25.5 and 28.5.   Your risk for serious health issues increases at a lower weight, and your body has less ability to cope with health issues. Underweight is actually riskier than being overweight in some respects — there is far less wiggle room to lose more, whereas young overweight people can gain quite a bit before experiencing serious issues.  And ""getting to"" an underweight body is almost certainly an unhealthy process if you use disordered methods to do it. If you are highly active and eat 2000 calories a day for two years until your BMI is 17.9, and then you maintain there, that's different from eating 400 calories a day and reaching that same point in a much shorter time. 2000 calories is much more likely to provide enough nutrition to maintain healthy body processes than 400 is. No one with an actice eating disorder is under optimal health conditions wherein getting to and staying underweight ""isn't that bad"".  But like, I get it. My goal weight is underweight. I'm a ballet-focused dancer and chose my goal because of this. I am aware of the risks and have chosen to do this anyway, which is doubtless affected by my eating disorder. Because if I reach my goal weight and get cancer, I've got less of a chance of survival through treatment as I would at my current weight or my weight a year ago.",False,False

I know a few underweight people, all guys, who are almost always tired but seem to be holding up okay at least for now? There's no doubt it might cause issues down the road though and I do remember one toned yet emaciated woman who was on the show that was told she could die at any moment from something heart related, I can't remember.
