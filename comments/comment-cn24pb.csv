Of course, the rebound weight gain common in recovery stints might be even greater for someone who has felt psychologically deprived of highly palatable foods (barring other factors), but for the most part it's true that for many, becoming thin (as in, not if you were already underweight and feeding on small amounts of junk food like some of those on SS vs. SS), and *staying* that way for years and years will be challenging on only pizza and chips. I'm sure you eat a vegetable here and there, but I'd think that when the amount of food stops feeling like ""enough"" and even a moment of delicious food is only fleeting anyway, it's easier to turn to being able to eat and chew for longer even if it's not AS tasty (then again, maybe there are those who actually force themselves to eat healthy foods they don't even like, but I wouldn't know)  I can relate to both sides, and more. I wouldn't say broccoli is necessarily a safe food even though  I like the taste because of 1) the fullness it creates (unless I'm about to go to bed, in which case it won't make me panic quite as much) and 2) it's perishable and I keep thinking about how I have to finish it before it goes bad. Any food that makes me think about it anxiously for too goddamn long isn't a safe food. That's why I also had Poptarts as a safe food at one point - I could take note of the calories without obsessing over it, because I'd just take nibbles here and there until I finished the packet and think, ""okay, 400 cals by 3 pm."" I could keep the box of 8 for a few months and never feel pressured to finish it. Safe foods go beyond calories as a criteria - it's about what won't send you into a hoard of negative emotions for whatever reason",False,False
