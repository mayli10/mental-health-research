I think it's ultimately unhealthy but I'm trying to transition my tumblr and reddit to more of a recovery space. It's just been a slow transition because being a part of this community is part of my social life (as sad as that is) and so I'm trying to find others who are also currently recovering,False,False

Ten years is a long time. I want to be unafraid of being an adult, of making hard choices, and of being unapologetic for taking up space - physically and emotionally.
