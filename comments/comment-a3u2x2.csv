I wanted to go on a diet at 13 so googled some stuff. Came upon those really toxic sites from 15 years ago. Didn’t know it was an eating disorder page or even what that was. Just knew I wanted to lose weight. By the time I figured out that those methods weren’t normal I was already fucked. Hiding food, lying, throwing food away, and claiming a higher weight that I was. Never been the same since! Funny how hardcore I was when I was 13. Fasting for 5 days lol couldn’t never do that now. That’s good though I guess!",False,False

I've never had a healthy relationship with food, my mom is a severely obese woman with an unhealthy relationship with food herself so I never really learned proper nutrition or serving sizes or anything. She did try with her limited knowledge, for instance she knew that ""salads were healthy"" but her version of a salad was ranch soup with a few leaves of lettuce floating in it.   I can't eat ranch to this day.   For me, I just started cutting things out. I picked up somewhere that red meat wasn't good for you, so I didn't like it anymore. I cut out pizza, potato chips, fried foods. I made excuses for not being able to eat them. These lies of having a sensitive stomach have been carried for decades and I've almost forgotten how it started.    It wasn't until just after high school, after having moved out, that I started actually restricting. I'd been binging for years because eating so much until you were physically uncomfortable was just so normalized at home. So naturally I just kind of swung the opposite way.   Now I have a hard time with both, it's either eat everything or attempt to eat the bare minimum and either way I end up feeling guilty, ashamed, and like a horrible person. Middle ground? Never heard of it. ",False,False

I struggled for year and years with my weight. Something about being called chipmunk girl for years growing up really damaged me. I’m not saying that was all, but it’s certainly a big part of why I get giddy when I can see bones that you’re not supposed to.   In terms of restricting, I did 1200 for a bit then slowly decreased it to 900. After that it was like I was bit by the ED bug and I started restricting sub 450 for a bit. It varies now depending on how life is going, (Usually stress= restrict and sadness= binge) (those are basically my only emotions anyway) but ever since that weird day I feel every single calorie more than I ever used to.

Then in college I roomed with some girls that were weirdly obsessed with my diet and weight. I was really depressed at the time which killed my appetite but they became really mean about it, talking about my diet in detail when I wasn’t in the room (loud enough for me to hear though). Calling me anorexic bitch and such. So I took the poor coping mechanism route and started tracking my calories, over exercising, and weighing myself every day. I watched them weigh themselves all the time and complain about their weight so one day (because I didn’t have a scale) I used their scale and found I was close to underweight so I kept going, just to spite them.
