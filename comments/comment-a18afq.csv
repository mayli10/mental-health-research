She struggles but is very positive and caring and I feel like her discord would be very supportive, I’ve never been on it tho so it might still be triggering because it’s probably a lot of people who need support because they’re still struggling deeply. If anyone has used it they could probably tell you more but that’s all I got. Maybe if enough people want one we could all make one then we can have a recovery space there for everyone:) good luck w your recovery, that’s a big step you should be proud:)))",False,False

We were just discussing this in a discord last night, that although ours has a recovery channel, we understand it would be somewhat triggering in the main channels at times.   It's not too hard to start your own though, PM me if you would like a hand getting started!",False,False
