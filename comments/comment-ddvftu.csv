I hate myself. But I adore my sisters and my parents and my partner. I love them, without a doubt. Yes, recovery should be for the person recovering, first and foremost, but just because someone is struggling with self-love doesn't mean they're incapable of loving others and having good, supportive relationships.",False,False

Crushes come and go. Maybe you could reframe your motivation? Think about how you can’t have a healthy relationship with someone else if you can’t with yourself and your body first.   I think this is a very dangerous mindset and could cause a lot of problems. What happens if you get dumped by your crush, or rejected? You could have a major relapse and be even worse off.",False,False
