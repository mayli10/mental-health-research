Like dammit body I'm treating you like shit, can't you see? But it's a good thing, probably protects our hearts more too. I just will feel like a fraud, that I conned my way into an inappropriate diagnosis.   And yes, ballerinas and gymnasts are at high risk for AN and they're strong af. I just wish there was more understanding that AN looks different in everyone",False,True

I am a shop foreman for a wood shop, so i keep muscle mass on no matter how little i eat. I don’t mind it, think it looks alright on my body. But definitely makes me feel like a fake ana sometimes.",False,False

I’ve attached veins showing with strength in my mind.  For veins you need physical power (to build muscle) and mental power (to restrict).  Maybe that might help?  Idk.  Our brains are weird.  I have literally no room to talk.  My most pronounced veins (on my left bicep) are shaped weird and I hate them.,False,False

Even when my psychiatrist made blood tests, he even was surprised I seemed so healthy. And again I was happy and deeply mortified. I both thank my body for being so resilient and hate it that I won't never be sick enough. I guess many ballerinas can experience this, people see them as cute delicate beings but they have to be so strong  yet stick skinny too.",False,False

It just always seems so contrary to what everyone says anorexia is. Like you're not allowed to be strong and at the same time be anorexic. It always makes me question if it really is a disorder since I seem pretty healthy and stronger (and faster) than most other woman.",False,True

I started strong lifting program when I was better at some point, but I have always been going to the gym and in several sports teams since I am about 5y.o. I, since then, keep lifting heavy and I am pretty strong and muscular regardless of having an underweight bmi.  I am proud of lifting twice my body weight amd that I am a great acrobat but at the same time I feel that I should not, that I will never be skinny as I want and have my bones showing. I go from wanting to fuck up to become a skinny legend to try to become as fit as possible, so I never get to one or another goal and I am stuck in a frustrating limbo.",False,False

I know the benefits of keeping my muscles far outweighs the cons (literally just aesthetics for me) and I know the effort I won't through to get the muscles. It's just really hard when strong is often used as an antonym of anorexic,False,True

Most of the time I do protein fasts where I have nothing but protein shakes.  I just say I’m considering competition and no one questions my eating.  I do a lot of weight training.  I do a lot of fasting.  I occasionally binge and then go lift for 3 hours while I swear I’m never going to eat again.  I’ll never be underweight unless I stop training.  But if my bodyfat could get dangerously low, that’d be great.  I want lots of veins.    Also, no.  I don’t think I’m a real Ana.",False,False

Yeah, turns out you can if you don't have any protein. And the I only way I can get that in my diet is through shakes, but I only managed them for a week before getting scared. Did notice I didn't feel as weak during that time and I wasn't in constant pain.",False,False
