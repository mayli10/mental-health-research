I just feel.. unsafe? I hate each and every comment about my eating habits: ""oh how little you eat!"", ""How much you eat!"", etc. They make me sick. One time we were talking about what we eat, and I don't eat meat, bread, pasta, sweets and a girl blatantly asked me ""WHAT DO YOU EAT THEN??????"" and .. in that moment I just froze. I guess I assumed it was in vain to try to explain my dietary choices. Or another time, when my binge cycle started, I was eating something sweet for the first time in my classroom, and a girl walks past me and exclaims "" OH WOW u/witchhere eats! "" I just left school early and ran home crying. I don't know why I am so sensible when it comes to food.",False,False

There are people I really want to catch up with but I’m such a fucking psycho weirdo freak around food and other people.   Not around everyone though it’s random certain people and I can’t predict it entirely :/,False,False

I think most of my fights with my mom have started bc I'm agitated she's invaded my space when I'm eating. just as true for when I'm binging secretly at night or when I'm meticulously weighing shit for a planned meal or just eating on a semi normal day. I also constantly have to have distractions when I'm eating...it's like not worth it to me to eat unless I'm watching a TV show?? I guess bc it's not enjoyable otherwise since my thoughts are completely focused on eating and hating it,False,False

I get soo angry if I’m eating, and then someone walks into the kitchen. I literally have to stop eating until they leave. I also hate eating out with friends because eating is supposed to be a time of relaxation for me and I can’t do that with other ppl because then they see how and what I eat and it’s just this whole thing :/",False,False
