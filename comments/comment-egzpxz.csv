Eating healthy is good for stopping the urge to binge though. I found that when I started eating healthy foods that any cravings I had were almost totally gone! My cravings were mostly for salty foods, so I have to assume I was low on electrolytes. Definitely not sodium, but potassium for sure and probably others. I can't say that I actually binge, but when I have been restricting for any reason and then eat a normal amount of food for a day in one meal (*typically all I would eat those days*) it can feel like a binge. Taking supplements and eating lots of veggies really helped a lot.",False,False

I mostly buy stuff like candies, and store brand snacks. Even though they're store brand, they're still expensive for the amount they don't fill me up.

It's hard though. I'm not really able to cook for myself much so I eat out a lot. If I wanted to live on stuff like croissants and instant ramen I could easily manage, but the lack of variety would be such a drag. Still, I am trying to make an effort to incorporate cheaper foods into my diet more frequently. Like getting value meals at restaurants or eating stuff like I already mentioned above. I also use this app Ritual that lets me save up points to spend on food. The options are rather limited even though I live in downtown Toronto, but they often have deals like 20x or 25x the points so a $10 meal could get like 2000-2500 points. It's 5000 points for $5 off a meal, so it's a great way to save money. I'm not sure where you live, but living on just CAD$10 a day for food is tough. It is doable though. If you mean US$10 I'm sure that will be much easier also! ðŸ˜„",False,False
