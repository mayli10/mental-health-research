It was just a term told to me when I was told that the amount of calories you burn chewing and digesting is more than the amount of calories in the celery. Obviously the calories in the celery are still going to be broken down and used by your body. But I‚Äôm not a nutritionist. I‚Äôm willing to admit I could be wrong about this. I don‚Äôt know what the difference in energy needs is when chewing/digesting versus not eating at all. But I agree that the difference is negligible.  What you and I are saying is basically the same once we get around the semantics. ,False,False
