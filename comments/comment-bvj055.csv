The people in the 18.4-17.6 range just didn’t meet the requirements for an anorexia diagnosis, but that doesn’t mean their health isn’t in trouble due to being underweight or that they’re not struggling with another ED.",False,False

Of course I had also lost 80+ pounds in 5 months, but I don't think 17.5 as the criteria necessarily holds fast in an actual treatment setting, it depends a lot more on your specific symptoms.",False,False
