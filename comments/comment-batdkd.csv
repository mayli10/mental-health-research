I tried to prepare some once, and the results were so weirdly chewy and crunchy that it actually ruined my favorite 7.5 kCal/tbsp red pepper sauce indefinitely for me. Whatever you do, cook that shit long enough.",False,False

Then fry in a pan with only frozen stir fry veggies and lite soy sauce, and sprinkle with asian spices (I found one at walmart that's a mix of a bunch of spices for 0cal/tsp or something). Delicious and super filling, and I actually think it tastes pretty close to normal noodle stir fry.",False,False

Shitty low effort options to add:  1) broth  2) laugh cow wedge (This is my fav. I microwave two light Swiss and stir. it's low-key gross)  3) pasta sauce  4) mustard...,False,False

I use them when I'm craving like, a calorie-dense pasta meal, because I can cut out a significant chunk of calories from the pasta but still get to have the creamy pasta sauce. Like yeah the sauce is still calorific but I'm focused less on a low-calorie meal and more not having to sink calories into the pasta AND the sauce if that makes sense.  I recommend that you ""fry"" the noodles in a dry frying pan after you've rinsed and drained them to get all the moisture off them so they stick to your sauce better, otherwise they will make your sauce watery.  You can use peanut butter powder and soy sauce to make a pretty low-calorie satay sauce that goes great with shirataki noodles tho. I don't have any specific recipes, just experiment with different quantities and spices.",False,False
