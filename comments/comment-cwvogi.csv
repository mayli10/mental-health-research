In college I lost weight (from losing muscle) and got to about 13 lbs underweight. I still didn’t have an eating disorder and I just ate when and what I wanted.   Now that I have an eating disorder I’m a lot more underweight. I so badly wish I could go back to how I was before and just maintain the weight I was at instead now I’m obsessed with food and terrified of calories   My fiancé has always been underweight and might be at the bare minimum for normal weight now bc I’ve been trying to make sure he eats more. But he just doesn’t care about food. He eats when he wants, stops when he’s full, if he has a big lunch he just isn’t hungry for dinner. He isn’t huge into sweets but he loves fried food and unhealthy food. He just eats for fuel basically and knows how much his body needs",False,False

People who are unintentionally skinny don't realize how little calories they eat long-term. I have a cousin who was put on a meal plan to gain weight but constantly complained about feeling full, and didn't keep up with the diet. Obviously if she didn't keep that up she wasn't going to gain weight but insisted it was because of her fast metabolism.   The last bit was spot on, but the guy in question is only slightly underweight so I cannot see how that would have severe consequences. I'm wondering if people who eat far below maintenance and have BMIs of &gt;17 can still be healthy, though. At any rate, being underweight is not ideal, in the same way being overweight isn't.",False,True

That said, if your question was: can some people be underweight without having an ED?, then the answer is obviously yes, just like there are many people who are overweight without having an ED.  Let's just take the random example of a 25-year-old guy who is 175 cm (5'9'') tall and weighs 55 kgs (121 lbs), which would make up for an underweight BMI. Let's imagine this guy does light activity.  His TDEE for maintaining would be 2100 kcals a day, which is quite a lot. He could eat up to 2200-2300 kcals a day and only gain weight veery slowly. If you saw this guy eating you would probably believe he has some sort of magic fast metabolism or whatever. Instead he's just eating to maintenance according to the plain laws of thermodynamics.",False,False
