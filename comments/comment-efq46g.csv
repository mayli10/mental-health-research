It means being comfortable in your own skin and trusting your abilities. I’d really like to be more confident and be less a slave to the whims of other people’s opinions (or what my paranoid brain thinks other people’s opinions might be).   *But* I do relate to the gut punch when I realize someone has maybe judged my appearance more harshly than I myself judged it. As if I‘ve been caught having the temerity to think for a second maybe I was ok.   Here are the things I’m trying to teach the part of me that is still a scared bullied 12-year-old: I *am* allowed to think I’m ok. To feel I am enough. I am not required to survey the world and set my opinion of myself as 10% worse than the harshest feedback. I do not have to make myself small in the service of attempting to please others or protect myself from judgment. I do not have to hate myself until I become perfect (which is to say, hate myself forever). I am allowed to embrace the duality of saying both “I am ok” and “I want to grow”.",False,False
