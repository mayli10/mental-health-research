My birthday is next tuesday and although i don't have co workers or friends asking me out to lunch or getting me a cake, my family is and i'm freaking out. I've done a bit of reasearch and found a frozen pizza that is 130 cal a slice so i'll just budget for that pizza and say i'm too full for cake.   Shame since it's a major birthday and my sister is getting the local bakery she works at to make me a really nice cake and i won't be eating any of it.  Not exactly sure how to help but if your co workers don't know you well enough could you say your allergic to certain things or that they make you feel sick? If not then try suggesting other activities to do that don't involve eating (for the lunch part). For the cake, i'd recommend looking up low cal cake recipes and tell them that that is the cake you want. You can also get a store bought cake that lists calories.  If you do go out for lunch then pick a chain restuarant that has calorie info on it and try to budget something into your calories.   Worst case scenario you go out for lunch at a non chain restuarant that doesn't list calories or nutrition info then just wait until you order and say you 'don't like anything on the menu' or that it makes you feel sick. If all fails then just eat half the meal or something and say you're keeping the rest for leftovers. Same with the cake.",False,False

Have a few rum and diet cokes, and hopefully since they’ve gotten you to celebrate with them, they’ll drip the other stuff too?  And about the cake. Its your birthday. You’re allowed to take as much or a little as you want. Maybe take a realllyyyy tiny peice and tell them you’re not a sweets person? ",False,False

Things I’ve done in the last are: claimed to have already eaten, drank anything but wine and beer, played the type 2 diabetic card for sweets avoidance and taken a small serving and nursed it throughout the whole event.   You’ll get through this and thankfully it’s only once a year. ",False,False
