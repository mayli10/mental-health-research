When I was in 6th grade I was still pretty thin but eating a ton of these muffins.  One time I told Mom I weighed 96 pounds and asked if that was normal.  A long pause, followed by ""I think you should eat more apples and less muffins."" Welp.  Also, more than once she has told me I should wear a M size shirt, when a S is almost always fine.  Thanks alot",False,False

As a mom to 2, I just can't imagine ever, EVER, saying anything like that to my babies. Never in a million years would  I ever want my son or daughter to have my messed up relationship with food. If you were my kid, I would just hug you for days and tell you that you good enough and the best thing I ever did in my life. Because that's what I tell my kids everyday, and goddamn, every kid should hear that from their parents. Please take some mom hugs from an internet stranger. I am so sorry you had to hear shit like that. Please be kind to yourself.",False,False

It started when I was a little girl, when I look back at the pictures now I feel like I was normal way but my mom was constantly saying that I was chubby and fat. I started getting ashamed of eating around my family because they would constantly comment on how fast I ate, so that was when I started hiding and eating food. My brother would constantly call me a fat ass, and my mom would just agree with him or not say anything and she would always give me less food than him at meal times and tell him that he needed to help me lose weight. My whole extended family is extremely shallow, on my mom‚Äôs side and they started making comments about my weight when I was really young as well. I honestly think my family is 90% of the reason why I developed an eating disorder. So I totally can relate",False,False

She always compares what she was like at my age to me, and was sure to tell me in the run-up to my wedding how much she weighed on her wedding day and how small her dress was. Well joke‚Äôs on her gnarly ass, I beat her by five pounds.   I eventually got sick of it and asked my SO to make her stop, so he and his dad tag-teamed her and she did for a while. Her new thing is fake concern where she takes my SO aside and tells him that I‚Äôm too weak and frail to do anything and he should stop letting me leave the house because I‚Äôll, idk, collapse on the street or float away on a breeze or something.",False,False

I remember when I was about eight and I stood in front of my Mum‚Äôs floor length mirror telling her I was fat. Her first response was to say I was fine, I told her that I wasn‚Äôt and I was huge and fat. She said ‚Äúokay, you‚Äôre fat,‚Äù and left me stood there.   I remember she‚Äôd always send me to school with salads in my packed lunch, and would give me slimming world ready meals at night time. I know for a fact she never really ate herself and would run up and down the stairs whilst I was in bed at night. When I was about 13 I was hanging around on our porch with some friends, I came inside to grab some drinks and she blurted out ‚Äúyou‚Äôre going to have to stop eating so much, it‚Äôs getting silly and you need some control.‚Äù I never went back out to my friends and just cried in my room for hours.   I wasn‚Äôt even a fat kid!!! I had a chubby little face when I was little and I‚Äôve always had a larger chest and wide hips so I looked fuller than some of my friends. My Mum absolutely kickstarted my issues with bulimia and binge eating. Now I‚Äôm an adult I can see how disordered her own relationship with food is, she‚Äôll probably eat a sandwich a day but on the weekends she‚Äôll gorge on cake and take-aways and share bags of crisps. I‚Äôm trying very hard at the minute to teach myself how to eat normally and have a good relationship with food.",False,False
