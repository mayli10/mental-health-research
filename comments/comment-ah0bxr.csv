Most of my meals are just a ton of roasted veg with some protein tossed in. Stick veggies (fresh or frozen, i usually buy frozen so they last longer) in the oven or in a pan with some 0 cal spray oil (just enough that nothing sticks), do the same with some low cal protein and call it a day. Veggies topped with a runny egg is great and easy, plus its filling and low cal.  Like an example for me is I chopped up some green cabbage and Brussels sprouts and added a diced apple to a pan and cooked it till everything was just slightly soft. Apple, cabbage and sprouts are all fairly low cal (just measure everything obvs), and I added a chicken sausage that I sliced up on top. It's around 300 calories for a big bowl of it, and it looks normal if you're eating with others!  Shrimp, chicken, and lots of fake meat are pretty low cal, and there's always eggs/egg whites.  You could also look into some low cal wraps/torilla shells and make wraps? Portable, quick, and you can stuff them with veg to fill them out. I know my local grocery has 50 cal shells and I can make veg and turkey wraps for around 200 cals or so.  For snack like items i usually go with berries/tangerines/small apples, jack link meat snack packs (I've seen some range from 50-80 cals), string cheese, and 100 cal packs of nuts (not the lowest cal option for snacks but they usually keep me from feeling hungry for longer then most other things).
