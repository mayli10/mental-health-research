What I mean is that I “feel perfect” in the sense of it feeling natural and safe and like I’m at home - it’s much more along the lines of “this headspace feels so perfect to me” then “I am more perfect t than other people because I am thin.”  I can see why it might be interpreted in another way though, and I’m self aware enough to know that I’m not well mentally and could be negatively affecting others so I’m glad someone stepped in. I just wanted to say I’m sorry to anyone I might have triggered and thank you for answering my questions when I was confused at first.",False,True

Of course I appreciate that you didn't set out with the intention to be triggering. There are certain aspects which I noticed that warranted removal in my eyes.  1. You say that you outlined the negatives of your ED in your post, but (please correct me if wrong)  I can't find anywhere in your post where you acknowledge the downfalls of being anorexic. You state you felt and looked ""genuinely perfect"" ""perfect in every way"" ""on top of the world"" etc. If an impressionable pre-ED person or on-the-verge-of-relapsing person read this, the lack of a balanced representation of life with an ED can be triggering. On top of this, statements like ""I love the bones, the bruises, the kids’ clothes, the sunken eyes, every little worrying detail"" feels like it glamourises anorexia, not unlike the ""heroin chic"" aesthetic that of pro-ana websites. 2. Your tl;dr implies you'd rather die skinny than live old and not skinny (to put it crudely I know). While no one can tell you or force you to change how you feel, you can see how this can be triggering to others and could be seen by reddit admins as encouraging self-harm indirectly, and it is posts like that which caused the demise of proED.  3. I would hate to think that I would make you anyone feel that they shouldn't feel good about their body at any weight, and I'm sorry if you understood it that way. It is not the underweight part I am worried about but the anorexic behaviours and mentality. If you were a healthy, overweight or obese weight but talked the same way about feeling euphoric about anorexic behaviours without acknowledging that ED's are harmful or showing that you're self-aware that ED's have warped your perspective, I would still removal the post because it would seem to ""glorify"" anorexia.  I hope you can see it from my perspective. I can talk with the other mods and maybe let this post stay up to gauge how the community feels about this. Let me know if anything else needs clarifying, stay safe :)",False,False

I respect that you chose to remove it but I don’t understand.  I didn’t write that post with the intention of being triggering, I just rambled out my thoughts, including my opinions (positive and negative) about my ED and its effect on my life. Having an ED sucks a lot of the time, but I do feel good about my body, like really good. I feel like it’s rare for an anorexic to love their body, but I’m one of them I guess.  Surely on a supportive community, posts about people loving their bodies should be accepted and appreciated? I see many posts from people talking about how much they hate their bodies, surely the fact that for once someone with an ED is lucky enough to like theirs is a small blessing in a dark time.  If you think it would trigger others then I accept that, but I really think that it was unreasonable of you to remove it. It feels like you’re trying to police the feelings of ED sufferers, and that you’re saying people with eating disorders are only allowed to love their bodies if they’re not underweight. If I had been at a healthy weight - in fact, if I had become very overweight or obese - and had made a post talking about how much I love my body then nobody would have an issue.  Anything regarding food and weight and body image could potentially be triggering to someone if they have an ED. I’m sorry if I upset anyone but I really just wanted to actually openly feel good about myself. I feel like there’s an expectation for me to be miserable and self hating just because I’m anorexic.",False,True

I'm doing this from a perspective of ""would reddit admins approve this?"" and the answer would be no.   Posts about enjoying being at lower weights is generally ok as long as OP states that they are aware the behaviour may be problematic and may be triggering to others - which you haven't done in this case. Thanks for understanding. ",False,False

This way, the more muscle you gain, the more calories your body will burn just from walking around and especially during exercise, and you will be able to eat more food without gaining any fat- solves both problems if you truly prefer eating normally if you still like the way you look, and you will look more traditionally ‘masculine’ with muscle while maintaining a flat chest and narrow hips. Keto diet is really good for this and you won’t experience the side effects toward your health, energy, temperature, schoolwork, etc and will likely still feel ‘special’",False,False

My ED is caused by the fact that I'm a transgender guy, but it definitely doesn't help - and even if fatness was considered superior, I'd probably still rather be thin and 'undesirable' if it meant a flatter chest and narrow hips.  I'm not sure whether I'm happy with my situation or not to be honest. I mean, I'm happy in the sense that I feel no sadness, but I'm physically not in a very good condition, I wish I could enjoy food like a normal person, and my schoolwork is falling behind pretty badly. I wish I could be 'anorexic sized' without having to, you know, maintain being anorexic, because I'm exhausted. But unfortunately for me no matter how exhausted I get, I'll always end up choosing something destructive but satisfying over actually looking after myself.  I just don't know how many times I can go through the cycle of losing weight and getting more and more high from it, then nearly dying because I've gotten into such a bad state, then getting to a healthy weight and feeling empty inside, then losing it again. It's been like, ten fucking years. I'm so tired, but I can't maintain being a normal size without being suicidal.",False,True

Honestly I’d like to bulk up and have a stronger, more athletic figure, if I was going to factor my gender identity into how I have my body. So I don’t think it’s that. I mean I know that one of the reasons I restrict is to maintain quite a flat chest and not many curves, but I don’t think that looking weak is very masculine. I’ve been drawn to the way that bones and very small bodies look all my life, I just find them hypnotising to look at. Maybe being trans is a factor but I don’t think it’s the leading factor at all.

You believe that having bruises, cheekbones, etc. equates to being glamorous, elite, special, etc. You believe that having a medium sized body equates to being average, not-special, etc. When you're underweight, you get to have all of these heady, exhilarating thoughts about yourself every time you think about your body. ""I'm elite! I'm beautiful! Special!"" Etc. If you have NPD, that means you ""need"" these kind of thoughts even more than the average person, though we all need them to some extent. (Whereas others might be ok with the thought that they are average, such a thought is anathema to a person with NPD.)  So it makes sense that you prefer to be underweight! And if you're ok with the negative side effects of that, then there may be no problem. In fact, your thoughts about those side effects may even be pleasant to you if they are thoughts like,  ""I'm so tiny and cold and fragile and that means I'm special.""  The only thing I would point out is that it's the positive thoughts that you are truly after, not the body size. If you found a way to have those thoughts while inhabiting a larger body, then you wouldn't care about being thin. Like if you lived in a culture where fatness was revered and held up as morally superior, you would probably be pursuing fatness instead of thinness. What you want are those heady ""I'm special"" type thoughts, not a particular body type per se.   The reason I point it out is that if you ever get tired of being cold and whatever other effects you experience of being underweight, then there is a way out, which is to find another way to think the thoughts you like thinking. Given enough time, you can probably find something else that makes you feel elite, special, etc. Anyway,  sounds like you're happy with your situation now and if you're happy then there's no problem, but for anyone in a similar boat who doesn't want to have to be underweight, just pointing out that body size is somewhat arbitrary, and it's the positive thoughts about yourself that make you feel excited, exhilarated, etc.",False,False
