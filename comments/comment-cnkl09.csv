Other people having it worse in no way invalidates your need for help. Besides, it‚Äôs a really good thing you‚Äôre getting help NOW, and not when you‚Äôre in extremely dire straits. It gets harder to treat EDs the longer they go untreated. So, you seeking help? That‚Äôs you taking a stand and saying, ‚ÄúI will not let this get worse!‚Äù That‚Äôs very brave and I hope things go well for you!",False,False

Try not to overwhelm yourself with it though, and try to focus on smaller decisions in day to day life to try to be healthier than feeling like you need to address all of it at once - because you don't. Recovery is a process. One step at a time, and you've already made the first step by making an appointment.",False,False

My brain is telling me that other people have it way worse and I'm doing okay at controlling it at the moment. But in all honesty it's a struggle, I think about it constantly, i loathe the feeling of being full, I'm terrified of gaining all the weight back, I still feel like I need to lose more. But I want to be healthy, I don't want every day to be a struggle. So I am going to go, I'm just nervous. I mean I'm already seeing a counselor for self esteem and other issues, but she doesn't know much about ED and recommended I talk to my doctor about getting a referral for a clinic nearby.   And you're right about it being an unhealthy behaviour no matter how often. I convinced myself a long time ago that it wasn't a big deal but the longer I go on, the more I realize how not normal it is. Thank you for your comment and support. :)",False,True

It doesn't want to leave. Don't let it control you this time. In writing this you already know that you need to go, you know you have an issue with food. Resist the ED, telling you that you don't have an issue, because you know that you do. B/P is an unhealthy behaviour no matter how infrequently. You know you need to do this. I hope the appointment goes well and you get what you need from it ü•∞",False,False
