I never used to get them. As annoying as this may be, and as counterintuitive as it may seem, eating more throughout the day has actual curbed those cravings a ton. For instance I used to save basically all of my calories for dinner and even after dinner because I was terrified of being hungry when I went to sleep but being out of calories (funny enough this meant I was feeling hungry most of the day anyways, but that's neither here nor there). Once I finally started to allow myself to eat a little more for lunch I have noticed that I don't feel a massive urge to binge anymore. I don't mean to say it's entirely gone, but it at least feels controllable now. Anyways, hope you find what works best for you.",False,False
