My scale weight has been high and I look kinda bloaty. Makes me want to give up on this bulk cycle I'm in, even though my math has seldom been wrong before (and when it has been, it's been an underestimation of calories/gain).   Busted out the tape measure. Obviously measuring my belly will be no good, because dysmorphia aside, I know I am genuinely a bit bloaty. But I measured everything else- actual fat doesn't tend to go right to my gut. I know this about myself.   Yeah, I'm fine. I'm not getting fat. Gonna keep right on chasing those gainz",False,False

Looooool GW turned out to be GW1 and not anywhere near small enough, ya bitch is relapsing. Can't eat less so gotta exercise more.  How do you build an exercise routine on just being small? I know I should avoid obliques because they can make your waist less contrasting.

One hotel had a great gym, and the other one, well it had a poorly attended stairwell, so that worked.   And some old fart had to stop and tell me how terrible my blue hair looks.
