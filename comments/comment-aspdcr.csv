I guess I’m an ED veteran and I think I’m finally figuring out that the path to recovery (for me) is accepting ED brain as part of me, negotiating with it and finding a balance. I’ve tried the full on traditional recovery path so many times and it always led me back to the beginning. This way seems to be working out. For the first time in three decades I’m weight restoring and I’m ok with it. ",False,False

I need my brain and my body to work. I occasionally purge still. I did last night because my stomach was killing me and I didn't want to have a bad night of sleep, so I threw up and felt better. I still restrict, but I make sure to take all my vitamins with the right foods. I'm scared my heart is a bit weak from years of purging, so I do low-impact workouts until I can go to a doctor and have my heart checked.   I still enjoy the amount of control over food that I get from my ED. But now I know it's a coping mechanism and not some ~*~*aNa ButTerfLy~*~* coming to rescue me.  Having an eating disorder is like being an alcoholic. Even if someone doesn't have a single drink in 40 years, they are still considered an alcoholic. I don't expect my ED to completely leave me, but I'm learning how to work with it. ",False,False

I understand that if I am a little heavier than I want, I can lose that weight with a bit of effort and time since I’ve done it before. I also try to remind myself that most people don’t really see the weight gain at all. When I was younger I assumed everyone noticed it.",False,False

So I’ve grown to accept I’m not one of the few lucky ones and that I’ll never not obsess over food or calories. That doesn’t mean I’m giving up on life altogether. I try to be responsible with my restriction and not let it affect my life too much, though I’m obviously having good and bad days. As u/jakisaur said, it’s sad to think it’s gonna be like this forever but it is what it is. It has also given me a weird peace of mind to realize that trying to be as healthy as I can be is okay, too, I don’t have to aim for absolute protection (bring cured) all the time.",False,False

I’ve only been out of treatment for a month and I’m in that place right now. I hate the way I look and I’m completely overwhelmed with school and work, so my go to for solving all my problems is to control my food intake. I’ve been very careful about not going back to full blown counting and restricting, but I definitely eat less than I should be. ",False,False

I know I can't fix 100% the stuff that's wrong with me but I try my best to manage.   I'm the same way, when things start to get crazy in other parts of my life I lean on my ED tendencies to retain some level of control and organization in my life. Yes it isn't the worlds best thing to do to myself but I've moved through a lot of harmful outlets in my life and by far it's one of the least problematic. At least so long as I'm able to mange myself and not slip too far. ",False,False
