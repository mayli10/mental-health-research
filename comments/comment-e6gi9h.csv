Alcohol is first metabolized by ADH into acetaldehyde, which is extremely toxic and a known carcinogen.  Then, ALDH metabolizes the acetaldehyde into acetate, which is non-harmful.  Issues arise when alcohol (toxic) and acetaldehyde (toxic) manage to make it past the stomach and into the intestines.  This can happen one of two ways: you can run out of enzymes because you drank too much, or your drinks manage to bypass the enzymes because there's no food in your stomach to stop it from slipping right on through to your lower digestive tract, where there are no enzymes available.  What happens when you have a bunch of toxic aldehyde in places where there are no enzymes to metabolize it?  Hangovers!  Hangovers are caused by acetaldehyde poisoning.  It's super bad for you.  It's basically homegrown formaldehyde.  So yeah, if you're gonna drink, eat something.",False,False
