I think it's more unusual to remember every single thing you've eaten that day, tbh. Or when people are like ""I've barely had anything!"" then list a bunch of stuff that is, again, easily 1000cal and it's like... you really think that's not much, huh? How are you skinny still!!!  But I WAY prefer that over feeling good about sticking to my cals or doing a lil fast or something like that even though it was hard and I'm battling cravings or binge feelings or whatever when one of my skinny friends is effortlessly like ""I should probably eat something all I've had today is half a slice of bread"" or something and I KNOW they're serious because they actually are one of those people who forgets to eat. Like... even if I've only eaten 300 cals that day or something I immediately feel like an out-of-control whale even tho BOTH OF US are messed up in that scenario and it's normal to remember to/anticipate eating :T",False,False
