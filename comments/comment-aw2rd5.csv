Lol) and I end up binging.     I really like your ideas regarding keeping drinks in your room. I definitely do that. I bought 2 massive 32 oz Nalgene bottles off amazon super cheap a while back and I always have them filled up and in my room at night.     And I always have had positive outcomes from being honest with my therapist. Even if the positive outcome was ‚Äúneutral‚Äù or nothing came of my honesty/I wasn‚Äôt ready to make a change. Just being real seemed to help. I hope you figure out what is best for you and your situation!   And regarding you breaking your fast- it sounds like you made good choices on your snacks which is something I struggle with. And hey, officially the month doesn‚Äôt start until I wake up tomorrow (for me anyways üòä)",False,True
