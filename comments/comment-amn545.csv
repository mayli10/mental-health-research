It takes me FOREVER to cut back and stop eating sugar to the point that the cravings are still there but easier to avoid/ignore. But if I do cave and eat something sweet or with sugar then the cravings come back ten-fold and it usually spirals me into a binge phase.  &amp;#x200B;  Sorry about the stressful situation. I know you want more but fight it. Have some fruit maybe though that often makes it worse for me so I suggest just keep fighting it. Find some distractions. You are worth it &lt;3,False,False
