I thought I did really great on thanksgiving, ate like a normal person, did a thanksgiving race, relaxed and chilled with the family, next day back to my normal routine, no freaking out at all this year... Then I go to my counselor Friday, and she reminds me that I am still eating a diet amount of food even though I am close to underweight, I still feel the need to exercise every single day even on holidays, I still am trying to compensate for overeating. Is that not what normal people do, keep on a regular exercise schedule and manage their weight?? I swear I canâ€™t tell if itâ€™s really my brain that is shitty, or if I just have a shitty therapist and everyone worried about me is deluded.",False,False

I had 2 dinners (we went to my family's, then had my husband's family over in the evening). I ate a healthy amount of food without restricting or going overboard. Before bed I went for a run, but felt dizzy for some reason so only ran 2.5 miles. I planned to run this morning before work but decided against it as I didn't sleep well. I skipped breakfast and had a salad for lunch, a snack, and a salad for dinner (somewhere around 1200 calories for the day). I didn't have any huge emotional feelings about eating more yesterday or the weight gain today - it almost is reassuring to me that I don't have an eating disorder regardless of what the therapist told me on Tuesday? I feel like I should feel worse.",False,False

That and a bit of ham and half a pie to share over the rest of the weekend shouldn't be TOO bad. But dammit, I just broke a plateau this morning. Guess I'll have the pleasure of seeing that number again, after I bump up and then back (pls bby Jesus) down again next week.",False,False

Iâ€™m proud of myself for eating a plate of food and not melting down or sneaking off to compensate in some way. Iâ€™m compensating now with restriction but Iâ€™d do that anyway. Iâ€™m also just trying to forget how much wine I drank and move on haha  my family was a lot nicer than I expected and the diet talk was minimal (for once) so most of my ed thoughts were me and my own.  how was yours, OP?",False,False
