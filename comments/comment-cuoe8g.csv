I can understand that feeling of doing body checks and just being SO frustrated   Sounds trite but try to make sure you are doing some loving things for yourself in your daily routine   I know you are not a fan of how your body is at the moment but try to remind yourself of all the good work it does for you day in day out   That bloating you get after carbs is probably water retention, as carbs have a habit of doing that, try drinking a bit more water when you eat carbs if you can it might help   If you are very upset about it the dandelion tea has a mild duretic effect and will help if it is bloat just don’t over do drinking it (you won’t, it doesn’t taste too great lol) or eat some celery it’s also a mild natural fix for water retention",False,False
