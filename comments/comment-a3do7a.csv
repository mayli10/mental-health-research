I haven't weighed myself in like 5 years and really it helps prevent my ED stuff to spilling into my anxiety/depression. Also, for doctor appointments, I just tell the nurse weighing me, ""I have a history of disordered eating, so I'm going to step on the scale backwards. Please don't tell me the number."" In the years I've been doing this, it has never been an issue.     You're amazing!!!",False,False
