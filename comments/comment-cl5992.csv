It was at 5 instead of the healthy range of 30 to 50. Been taking vitamin d and it's getting better.  I was actually very smug when I found out, cause people had been telling me that my restrictive eating was causing it. But you can't get even nearly enough vitamin d no matter how ""healthy"" you are eatingü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  Restricting calories can't cause hairloss in itself. My point is, demand a test for your vitamin levels and don't let them bs you about it being ""stress"" or some other nonsense.",False,False

They definitely didn‚Äôt mention it when I had the info appt or when it was implanted. That‚Äôs such a great idea, I‚Äôm a vegetarian and struggle to eat enough protein so I bet I‚Äôm missing some vitamins too; I‚Äôll look into which deficits are most likely to cause hair loss and start there.

You might look into some vitamins? Or re-evaluate your diet and see if there are any major nutritional gaps? Also for what it's worth, I've never heard of that kind of BC causing hair loss, so I think you're alright on that one. Again though this is all just my personal experience, it might vary a ton from person to person. Hope this helps!",False,False
