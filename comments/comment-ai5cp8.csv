It's weird how my ED has warped time, because it feels like it was months ago that I last purged, not 3 weeks. I feel like a different person. The way I react to overeating is different and I don't feel as much guilt. My instinct isn't to self-destruct anymore when I do something bad, it's to try and make myself stronger. I don't know if purging was messing with my brain chemicals or something, because it sure feels like it!",False,True
