I‚Äôm a psychologist and have received ED specific and other types of CBT before. It is really helpful, but challenging. You will be asked to retrain your thought pattern and challenge your anxieties.   Think of it like you‚Äôre all alone on a deserted highway and your car breaks down. The only thing you can do is call a mechanic and describe the problem and what you see in the engine to them as best as you can and then follow their tips and instructions. It only works if you do your very best to describe the problem as best and as honestly as you can. And then to follow the mechanic‚Äôs (your therapists) step by step advice as best as you can. Even though it‚Äôs hard and difficult and dirty work.   Schedule aftercare time for yourself because it‚Äôs hard work! But very very effective, proven scientifically over and over again. Good luck!",False,False
