I was maintaining a healthy weight for years before I started recently started restricting more seriously. And I really don't think I was eating 2,000 calories a day that whole time. Maybe on a 'bad' day. But definitely not consistently. Yet I weighed the same for years.",False,False

I'm really tall and on any kind of calculator I do it always says I need 2400+ for maintenance and my bmr is always around 1800+ and it confuses the fuck out of me because sometimes I get this like motivation to recover and ""just eat normally"" bc according to my maintenance calories I should still lose weight but still... even when I eat like 1400+ I gain weight and I have a physical job too so it literally makes no sense",False,False
