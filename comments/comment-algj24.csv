But really, it's typically 2 or 3 nights and once in a while gets up to 5 nights. But even then I'm a light user on the nights I do it.   It's just so weird tho cause I live in a small hipster city where everyone here does it everyday and goes on week long benders where they don't sleep at all (which I don't, most I could do is like 30 hours of no sleep) and they're all maintaining their weight pretty well.   A lot of ppl I know have even managed to gain weight with daily heavy use. I'm the only one I know that has been consistently losing weight.  But yeah, the only reason I even do it is because it makes me forget about eating. Unfortunately, even though I have people telling me constantly that they're amazed at how much weight I lost, I still look exactly the same in my opinion. The praise makes me feel good, I just wish I could see it.",False,True

I have a coworker who commented on how thin my face looked one day and it felt so good coming from her cause she’s shared with me that she was anorexic in high school. Sometimes I wonder if I trigger her cause I use the excuse of IF and she knows I don’t eat all day.,False,False
