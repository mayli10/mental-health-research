His job is in a very dangerous line of work, so I think about what I would do if something happened to him a lot. Honestly? I don’t know. It’s my worst nightmare. He is not the only source of happiness or stability I have in my life, but we have planned our lives out together for the last 6 years and it is difficult to imagine a future without him.   I am glad that you have your boyfriend to keep you going. Significant others can be a huge support, but it is not a healthy thing for your wellbeing to be dependent on someone else though. Are you currently seeing a therapist of any kind?",False,False
