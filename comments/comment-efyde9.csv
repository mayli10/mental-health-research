I really struggle to increase calories after decreasing, so a 3+ day break in intake is super hard for me to come back from.  I guess it depends on your goals, but super low restriction is definitely not my goal and it's where fasting lands me, so it's not beneficial for me.  But your mileage may vary :)",False,False

Fasting is not helpful for my ED urges, It is not helpful for my instinct to be destructive and punishing. It is not helpful for my relationship with nutrition. It is not helpful for my social interactions. It is not helpful for having energy to do the activities that keep my depression at bay. It is not helpful for my health.   Do I do it anyway sometimes and tell myself it’s going to help me get what I want? Yup. But it’s well established my brain is a fucking liar.",False,False
