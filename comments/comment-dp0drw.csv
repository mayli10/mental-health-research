Every year I try to eat less and only eat the vegetables or sides, and every year my entire family pressures me into eating more. One year I didn’t have any appetizers and my grandmother asked me, a voice full of genuine worry, “are you anorexic?”. No grandma, I’m not. I’m just not hungry today.   I’m vegan this year for thanksgiving, I’m hoping that will give me a valid excuse to not eat anything since my family constantly cooks with butter, milk, cheese, etc.",False,False
