Almost every single girl I know in the ballet world has at some point had disordered eating habits. It‚Äôs just kind of a given. Looking at yourself in a mirror for 2-5 hours every day does shit to your brain!!   People ask me if I‚Äôll ever put my kids in ballet. I think I‚Äôll probably let them if they want to, but I won‚Äôt encourage them to continue up to a rigorous pre-professional level. Ballet has given me a lot of great life skills‚Äìdiscipline, work ethic, respect for authority, professionalism‚Äìbut honestly, enrolling your kid in martial arts will do the same thing. No regrets on my end, I love what I do and I love the beauty and expression that ballet has enriched my life with, but I also wish sometimes that I didn‚Äôt have to think about how I look and feel in a leotard and tights every day.

My school's cheer and dance team attracted a lot of really talented girls but also girls who were just there because they were extremely thin, hot, and rich and felt that that's what thin, hot, rich girls were supposed to do lol. I haven't seen many of them in 5+ years but I still think about them often because they were just so glamorous and beautiful and I remember feeling like an ugly duckling.",False,False

I stopped because I started puberty before everyone else in my class and became obsessed with how fat I was. I wasn't even fat, I just had those little pre-boob boobs.

I have always been extremely short and I was really thin too until ninth grade. I was cast as Clara, which was amazing, then directly after the shows hit puberty.

I was told to take some time off a few times and come back when I could gain some weight and was in a better place mentally. Our studio owner was incredibly accomodating and very very careful never to tell a dancer they were fat. There were strong suspicions in the school that she had had an ED herself and so was very protective of her girls. What was more damaging for me was my mother's insjstance that I was fat and lazy because I never played ball sports or went running or anything, despite the fact that I did fifteen hours of dance a week.   Obviously it would not be a good environment for me to be in now,  and I couldn't anyway because of my knee. Someone else recommended belly dancing if you're looking for a new dance environment, and while I can't speak to that,  have you considered pole? Starting pole has been the best thing for my self esteem and how I view my body. My classes are bodies of all shapes and sizes, men and women, and I'm realizing that my body can do some really cool things! Plus it all feels a bit cool and sexy, and a lot of the choreography is really soft and pretty. Youve got a lot of freedom I never found in ballet - I would suggest YouTubeing Carli Hunter if you're interested, she runs my studio and she's one of the best dancers in Australia. ",False,False

I grew up in all kinds of sports because my parents were terrified of me getting fat - I've always been small, but sturdy, and even in preschool I remember entire dinner conversations carried on above my head about how much exercise I needed &amp; how many calories I'd had that day. (Meanwhile, my brother who is also short but has leaner lines was encouraged to finish his plate and never forced into sports.) I hated dance until I took a class with a different teacher, realized I COULD like it, then absolutely loved it. I began teaching classes in high school to get free lessons (&amp; to get away from my family every evening after school), and dove deep into gymnastics, contortion, aerial arts, yoga, Zumba - just, all of it.   High school &amp; college I was mostly okay weight-wise - never okay in my parents' eyes, of course, but men liked me and women were friendly. I could keep things under control, as long as I was dancing professionally 20 hours a week &amp; teaching 30 more. When I got to grad school and slowed down, though, I kept the dance but gained the weight. üòû  Being a ""fat dancer"" - even when ""fat"" means you know your BMI is healthy and your size 2s still button - is excruciating. Some dancers are awful. LOTS of teachers are. There's a lot of performative femininity in ballet / modern / jazz dance circles that can create a lot of toxic pain that gets spread around like a nasty flu, &amp; no one gets to avoid it altogether. For example, I should have a degree in dance - I finished everything required, except for the performance credits our program called for - but my instructor swore she would never give me a lead role until my thighs were less wide than my hips. I got down to 96 lbs (about 18 BMI) but STILL my sturdy thighs were wider than my strangely narrow hipbones. She passed me over for roles that I was sure I was talented enough to handle; in one case, I was dancing the same role in incredibly similar choreography in the same exact ballet professionally while I was still her student.... But I wasn't good enough to dance that role in her version. She could never explain herself, but would just ask me if I remembered our conversation about conditions. I still have nightmares about her and she's been dead almost ten years now. Many more of her dancers have stories like mine, or worse. Not having the degree changed my trajectory and pushed me towards other interests, &amp; while I'm mostly okay with how my life turned it out is bizarre to realize that the career I spent my whole life wanting was taken from me by someone who hated the fat on my thighs.   What I would suggest to you, if you have interest in &amp; appreciation for movement, is to get on Facebook and dig around a bit until you find your local belly dance community. My technical dance background helps a little, sure, but women with no movement experience also walk in and learn and move together. My current dance troupe in a small Midwestern town includes 22 genuinely phenomenal women: doctors, PhDs, computer programmers, a former mayor, a current judge, three published authors, amazing mothers, even two sweet little grannies with purple hair. (They met at class and are now roommates!) You'll see bodies, move yours, &amp; honestly, the more I interact with the community, the more I can truly say that I DON'T see mean girls in belly dance. They drop out or, in our case, one mean-spirited dancer was asked to leave immediately after her second snide dig about a belly that wasn't flat like hers. Belly dance hasn't 'cured' me of my disorder - I'm still here lurking! - but it's helped me frame concepts about grace and beauty onto body types that our culture says are inherently un-graceful and un-beautiful. If it's movement you want, and if dance is your joy, seriously: go bask in the company of happy hippie women shimmying together and embracing all the good things about stereotypical femininity (coyness, adornment, grace, beautiful makeup and costumes), while holding firm to principles like strength, growth of skills, &amp; confidence. I've danced it all, but man, belly dance really is a home to me now, &amp; I hope you'll try it if you're open to it!",False,False

I danced ballet competitively/semi-professionally from age 3-18. My ED is something that developed after that age but like another user noted, it's an activity that potentially attracts type A personalities (i.e. me) and the emphasis on getting the smallest movements done perfectly and of developing one type of body only, is something that I think shaped the way I view myself and physical goals.
