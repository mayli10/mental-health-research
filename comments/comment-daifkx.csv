Can you drink prune juice instead? I say this because I have a sibling who used to take laxatives a LOT in her younger years. She has a belly that protrudes even though she's tiny! She always tells me how much she regrets doing that to her body. She also gets asked all the time by rude fucking people if she's pregnant. She can't get rid of her belly now even with a lot of exercise ‚òπ,False,False
