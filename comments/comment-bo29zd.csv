A couple of weeks ago I binged one day, thought I was going to fast the next, ended up binging. And I did the same thing the third day.  Luckily in the fourth I got through my fast and succeded in doing 48h.  The problem is that we're stuck in this binge/fast cycle. The reason why I fast afterwards is because I feel like I don't deserve food after the damage I did and I want to make up for it.  The best thing would be to just move on. Yesterday I reached my 1 week binge-free after months. I'm heavily restricting so I know I'll fuck up sooner or later, but for now I'm fine.  What is helping me to not binge these days is the fact that I'm finally starting to lose some weight and I don't want to mess up,  I'm so close to my GW.  I wrote a letter to myself a couple of weeks ago after a binge day, reminding myself how shitty it feels.   Sending love. â™¥",False,False
