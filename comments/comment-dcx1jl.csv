Benadryl will. Sudafed (which does contain pseudoephedrine) will have mild stimulant effects like ephedrine.,False,False

It has a side-effect if loss of appetite; but it’s not as potent as bronkaid or primatine that are made with ephedrine guaifenesin. They’re expectorants that help loosen mucus in the sinuses.   Real ephedrine is always going to be more effective than pseudoephedrine; but has been going through a lot more regulations due to its abuse as a weight-loss drug. Thankfully the “asthma relief” side of it hasn’t been bothered.   Sudafed ~~Benadryl~~ types can be used in a pinch; ~~but mostly for how they knock you the fuck out. Can’t eat if you’re asleep 👍🏻~~  Source: I used to do a lot of drugs, pills specifically  Edit: fixed my dumb dumb",False,False
