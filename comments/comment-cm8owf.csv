Rewarding yourself with a binge after restricting for a long time becomes a super addicting idea (because you're starving, duh, and your brain latches onto it). But it just perpetuates an unhealthy relationship with food and IME you get frustrated with yourself over the cycle eventually.",False,False

So don't see thing too big about the portions and everything should be alright !",False,False
