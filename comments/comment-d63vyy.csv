It is possible that you have disordered eating since losing weight can cause that, especially coming from an obese bmi to a normal one. But the binging can also just be a physical response to dieting for so long. And the fear of gaining weight can also be because you lost so much weight as well. It can be terrifying for anyone to lose &gt;!33!&lt; kg (&gt;!72!&lt; lb) and start gaining weight (water or not), because you fear you'll end up back where you were before and have to start all over again.  I'm not sure if binging automatically equals an ED--I really have no idea. But it does sound like you have disordered eating habits.  I think these questions would help:  * &gt;!How many calories were you eating while losing weight? While binging?!&lt; * &gt;!How do you feel before, during, and after eating? Binging, restricting, and eating normally.!&lt; * &gt;!Do you exercise? How often and how long?!&lt; * &gt;!How is your body image? You're close to your goal already. How do you feel?!&lt; * &gt;!Any intrusive thoughts about weight/body/food?!&lt;  Feel free to take them as rhetorical questions if you aren't comfortable answering : )  If you look through this subreddit and other ED forums, you can see if you can identify with any of the posts. It might help give you some reassurance. Of course, you may not identify with the posts and still have an ED. Everyone is different.  If you're comfortable seeing a therapist and talking about it, then I would suggest that, especially because it can be reassuring to get an actual diagnosis and not just guess about it all the time (even after 4-5 years of having an undiagnosed ED, I still second guess myself ALL THE TIME, it's honestly so frustrating, exhausting, and pointless. But I'm terrified to talk about it with a therapist, so I'm undiagnosed still).   And if you don't want to see a therapist, that's fine, and you are more than welcome to talk with us here!",False,False
