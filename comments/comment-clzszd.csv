But in terms of the anesthesia I wouldn’t worry too much if it’s really not mentally possible to eat at maintenance. Last year I did ECT which meant having anesthesia done twice a week for 8 weeks. The medical team was aware of my eating disorder and it was never something they brought up as a concern for the procedure, despite the fact that I was losing weight the whole time.",False,False

You really don’t want to wake up during the surgery or have something worse happen. If the protein drinks and oatmeal are the easiest for you to have right now then by all means have only them but PLEASE consume an adequate amount of calories. More than normal by NORMAL people’s standards bc like everyone else said, surgery is very hard on your body!!",False,False

Even minor surgery is a huge toll on your body and restricting can lower your ability to heal and fight infections. The LAST THING you want with surgery is a compromised immune system.  Liquid calories can make this process easier, like pedialyte or health smoothies (not just sugar bombs).",False,False

Please give yourself permission to eat to give yourself fuel before your surgery and during your recovery. Your recovery will actually increase the amount of calories you need to heal. If you’re not eating enough, it’ll take much longer for you to recovery from your wounds and anesthesia. You can worry about your weight after it’s all said in done, but for now please feed yourself.",False,False

I'm not at  all a professional on anything but I just want you to stay safe, especially with a surgery coming up!",False,False
