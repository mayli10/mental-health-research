The reality is I don't even want to lose more weight, it is nice to not be overweight anymore but even that was mainly because other people made me feel uncomfortable in my skin.    I just don't want to experience all these difficult feelings. To me starving isn't as much about food as it is about not feeling. Not being alive enough to feel. Cause I am not capable anymore of complex thought or feeling right now.    But I do know this isn't a way to cope and it isn't a way to be alive. Actually being alive includes feeling and 'complicated everything'.    Hope you have a good day!",False,False
