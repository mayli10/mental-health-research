I met my husband when I was 19 too. During my last round with my ED 6 years ago, he came to therapy with me several times and it was definitely helpful. I haven’t gotten to the place where I want to start therapy but my PCP will probably make it a soft requirement for me to see a psych if I’m going to go back on meds, so I guess that’ll be helpful. Thank you for your reply, it really helped me ",False,True

I asked around and many people experience the same. So it's not too crazy to think OCD could be triggering your ed.    You should talk about that with your therapist.,False,False

It’s really, really super hard for our loved ones and they’ll never truly understand, but it makes it easier on them if we are as open and honest as possible. If we don’t do this it makes them feel isolated, frustrated and helpless, and also looks like we don’t want to help ourselves or care about them. Also makes us feel isolated and helpless too. Working together makes it easier for both parties.  I feel you, it’s really difficult, especially as an adult and as a parent. I met my now husband when I was 19, in the middle of my first relapse. I got better but relapsed again after our first child was born. We’ve been together for 18 years now and we’ve come close to breaking up several times, most of it either caused by or compounded by my mental health issues.   If you find it difficult on your (plural) own, I would highly recommend marriage counseling, or family ED counseling. Sometimes it gets too hard for a couple to work things out and an objective third party can provide that buffer and mutual support that you both need.  It can be hard for our loved ones to understand how we can want to get better but how their „help“ if they push too quickly can backfire and make things worse. This is something that therapy can help them with, because just hearing it from you can be misinterpreted as stubbornness.   Try talking things through openly, and if you find it too difficult to be completely honest or your spouse seems to be struggling to understand then please consider going to therapy together.  Good luck, you can do this x    ",False,False

Relapsed recently had a panic attack and spilled everything to my partner. At one point he laid on the floor and was just so quiet and exhausted and he was like "" you frustrate me sometimes because I don't know how to help you"". I've gotten to where instead of thanking him or apologizing to him for having to do things for me like nudge me during meals or walk with me for an hour before I can eat an ice cream. I tell him he's being helpful.   Your husband loves you and the ED  tells you you're not worthy of that or that you're not sick enough for that or that NOTHING IS WRONG AND THIS IS ALL YOU NEED. But let's not be bullshitting. You know something is wrong and it's tearing from you everyone and everything you love. Your demon was asleep and something woke it up. But demons thrive with closed doors and darkness. Don't be afraid to let him in. Don't be afraid to let the people who care about you in. Is only been a few months. It's not impossible to at least catch yourself steady or at least build the safety net of your treatment team and social support. ❤❤❤",False,False
