I would say to get used to eating 800 every day instead of sometimes just to start and then as you get comfortable with it and realize you can still lose weight like that and that it won't make you fat you can slowly work up to eating more until eventually you reach an amount where you stop losing weight.  I would also recommend planning out meals to make sure that you make healthy choices. I recommend [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/) for this because it tracks a lot of different nutrients which your body relies on. If you're getting all of your nutrients you will at least not be quite as sick as if you're severely nutrient deficient. I find that it's very difficult to do this while eating less than 1200 calories per day, but I think that eating healthy and not quite getting enough is at least a lot better than not getting nearly enough nutrients.  I understand that getting started with this can be difficult as you probably don't know what foods are good sources of what nutrients, so [here's a list of foods that I like](https://imgur.com/8AlcRHI) which I just happened to write up this morning. I'm posting as a link so that you don't have to click on it if you don't want to see it. There are few unhealthy foods on this list, but most of them are things like fruits, vegetables, nuts, and other healthy foods. If you ever need help coming up with other sources of nutrients in the future it's usually pretty easy to find this information. I figured out what foods are best for me just by searching ""Foods High in \[X Nutrient\]"" and clicking on links from websites like Healthline and Mayo Clinic. Sometimes when I want to include a certain food in a meal plan, but I don't know how I just search for recipes where that's the main ingredient.  I hope this helps you out in some way :) I have other stuff I can send you if you really want it. Like meal plans I already made and stuff. I'm not sure if they'll all suit you, but I can post them if you would like me too.",False,False
