(i can't sleep anyway and this somehow resonated with me) I think many of us feel undeserving of love since we find it hard to even love ourselves. You should totally work on yourself and feeling better, but maybe having a bit of dating fun could be a part of that! Who knows what might happen. Go you &lt;3",False,False

I ofcourse got scared to actually meet up and i figured i would just ghost him until he left me alone(confirming i dont deserve love). But that didn't happen. He was so interested in me he basically did all the work and here i am now, in a relationship after three years of being single.  I told him about my depression, i told him about my struggles and tbh, this is the first boyfriend I've ever had that makes me feel at ease a little. Normally i would push people away when feeling down, but this guy is teaching me by being understanding that i can open up when feeling shit without feeling bad about it.  He is the person i talk to when I'm feeling bad about myself or life in general and does everything right. He doesn't try to fix me, he's just there for me while being as positive as possible.  I dont know where im going with this, but i would encourage you not to give up on finding love. It might take a while, but somewhere out there is a person for you that is just as understanding as my current boyfriend. Somebody who's chill and doesn't judge. Somebody will love you, even though you might not function some days. I'm learning new things through him about myself and I'm grateful to finally have support in my life.",False,False
