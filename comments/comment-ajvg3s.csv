And its not even out of a goal to lose weight really . I cant get myself to eat . Eating feels wrong . Putting food in my mouth feels like a sin . Eating makes me feel out of control , dirty , and gross overall . I don‚Äôt know . I just don‚Äôt care anymore . Went for a workout this morning felt great .. starting cooking lunch as I‚Äôm doing so my mother starts being an abusive asshole yet again for no reason . I had had enough and I finished up my lunch . At first before the argument , I was getting super impatient , couting every minute until the food came out . I was extremely hungry . As the my blackened tilapia came out . I start preparing my ovenbaked fries . Subconsciously knowing that I will feel better about myself if I wait one more minute or hour before I eat . Anything I can do to push eating for later and later . And later . Thats when the argument took place . I had had enough . I rushed to my room with tears streaming down my face . My mother loves bringing back my past as I am currently doing amazing in the present . She is never content and loves picking fights for no reason . She is a narcissist. I take a second to calm down . I head back upstairs and all of a sudden . Hunger is gone . Preparing my food becomes more and more enjoyable then eating it . Most hate the preparation , they are hungry and are more excited to eat . With me its the opposite . I focus on every little detail of the dish . Perfecting the dish as much as I can .   So the blackened tilapia was ready , I took it out of the oven and popped my golden fries in there . While the fries are in the oven I make my own tartar sauce . Slowly , with care and attention to the recipe . Being very mindful of the whisking motion during the preparation of this sauce . The potatoes are ready . I take them out of the oven they look amazing . Golden and crispy . I set them on a cooling rack .   I start arranging my plate . I grabbed a wooden cheese platter and carefully placed my blackened tilapia . In the corner , I squeezed a dollop of yellow mustard and the tartar sauce right next to it . I then placed the oven baked fries on the platter as well . I sliced a lemon into quarters and placed it on the opposite corner from the sauces . It looked great . Then I made a side salad with romaine and parsley .     Then I grabbed the biggest tupperware I could find . Put this beautiful wooden platter of fish and chips into it . Sealed it tightly , placed it in the fridge and told myself I would eat it ""later"" .
