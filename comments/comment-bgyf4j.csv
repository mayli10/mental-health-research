I understand where you're coming from but this is really not a healthy idea, even tho I know it's just a hypothetical.  I think what should actually happen is that there should be stricter limitations on the amount of sugar/fat/etc that a pre-packaged food is even allowed to contain. Food has become more and more sugary and fatty when it doesn't NEED to be. We are raised on garbage food and it gives us a taste for sugar and fat, so we get less sensitive to it, so we need more to get the same experience. There doesn't need to be a metric shitload of sugar in cookies for them to taste sweet and honestly North America is a trip and a half compared to the rest of the world because capitalism figured out people buy more things if they're sweeter and companies have no morals.   If people want sugar cookies with 5 cups of sugar in them they can make it themselves - in the meantime, convenient, cheap, easy-to-binge-on-and-feed-children foods should absolutely be more tightly controlled. IDK if I fully believe that sugar is addictive or w/e but people do NOT need it in the amounts it gets pumped into food.",False,False

Yeah no don‚Äôt use this when advertising to children. Just on the packaging for shit marketed to adults-the same way the cigarette packaging is only really marketed towards adults. Like. Don‚Äôt put pictures of 500lb people on PawPatrol gummies; put it on the hungry man microwave meals or Atkins ‚Äúprotein‚Äù bars that are 200 calories of pure sugar. Lol,False,True

Just leave Tollhouse alone because kids fucking love cookies. Maybe only put it on adult sized meals like bigmacs and baconators.,False,False

Yeah I don‚Äôt want to advocate for EDs in children, but to be fair, overly processed, sugar laden junk food is a direct cause of obesity and cancer and diabetes. I dunno.

I know a 4 year old who already tells me to stop eating fruit because it has so much sugar &amp; makes me fat.  WHAT.
