When In reality, I didn’t even eat that much. Like the other day I “binged” when all I really had was a cheese stick, and a corn dog. Just because it was unhealthy food, I felt l had binged hardcore when really I just ate a normal amount of food.   I try not to beat myself up all the time. But sometimes I just can’t help it. Anyways all I’m trying to say is that I know how you feel! I hope things go well for you!",False,False
