Regarding what I mentioned in my own comment, when I was really bloated I thought maybe I actually gained weight because I haven't been recording my calories lately and felt like maybe I ate a lot, but my measurements were the same as always. I find that if I gain weight my waist measurement will go up, but if I'm just bloated or if my stomach is sticking out because I just have a lot of undigested food in me still that it will be the same.",False,False

We see our body in these distorted ways even when nothing has actually changed. The good moments for people with EDs focused on losing weight tend to be when we see ourselves as thin. In these moments we have a clear view of what we really look like.  If it's not BD it could always be bloating though. Like last week I bought a whole bunch of nacho Bugles because it seems like nacho are never in stock and they're my favourite flavour. Plus, only $1.50 for a family-sized bag. Ended up eating all three bags in one week and I was drinking with my friends and we went out for all you can eat sushi. I was so bloated after all that, but I hadn't actually eaten enough to gain weight. Still, I could swear my stomach had never been bigger before. Maybe that was also a little BD, but bloating is definitely an issue sometimes too.",False,False

It's horrific. Every time I see a photo my friends took of me I look like a different person every time. I don't really see a difference jn my weight loss except about every 30/40 lbs. I wrnt from being horribly obese to on the cusp of a normal weight in a little under a year, and my mind hasn't caught up yet. This morning before getting into the showet I looked at myself in the mirror and I was shocked at the sight of my collarbones and shoulderblades piercing out. never used to see those bones. i almost started crying because it's very very weird to see yourself in the mirror, but it doesnt look anything like you, if that makes sense.   It's not just my image either, I have no clue how much space I occupy anymore. I still scooch way over in chairs to accomodate people sitting next to me bc I'm worried about my fat squishing over onto them, I never walk beside someone going thru a doorway, I always turn sideways to move between two objects, and people always look at me weird. Life is weird. ",False,False

I definitely have times where I think I look pretty good and other times where I think I look like a whale. The only way I've found to combat it so far is to go by the numbers. Basically I'll know that at X weight I look thin/pretty good, then if I'm having a bad body image day I will weigh myself and if I'm still X weight then I know it's all in my head and it helps me to calm down a bit. Also a tape measure to measure circumference of waist/hips/legs or whatever area is the one you panic about the most. Sometimes getting hung up on numbers can be a bad thing but they can also be helpful in bringing us back down to reality.  Another thing to remember is that our bodies are not inanimate objects, they are constantly in flux and can be influenced by any number of outside factors. If I eat high fibre foods like broccoli or apples I know my stomach will stick out more for an hour or two until I digest the food more. I know eating high sodium foods or doing a heavy workout session can cause water retention, especially if I've been drinking a lot of water throughout the day. So I'll feel puffy or weigh more that day but it'll go away later. Another thing is high sodium foods or binges. If I binge on pizza or fries I know I'll be carrying a lot of water weight from the sodium for at least the next 2-3 days even if I high restrict on the days following the binge. I just have to be patient, accept that I'll feel fat for a few days, and if I don't binge again then the water weight will go away.  This was long sorry but ya just because you're all of a sudden seeing all your flaws again it doesn't mean you look bad to anyone else.",False,False
