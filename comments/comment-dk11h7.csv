But even if you cross that line you can creep back behind it and try to not do it again.   I'm trying so hard to not to start purging again. It's been at least a year.  Last night I was going to do it like five times but I just kept reminding myself of how awful it is and how I'm going to get sweaty and pukey and burny. I thought about how the bloated feeling will pass by the morning, and that next time I just need to not binge. I'd rather punish myself with feeling heavy and bloated as a deterrent against binging next time. Also I'm taking way too good care of my teeth to fuck it up by barfing.  I would say I used to be bulimic now I've just got bulimic ideations :) It's possible to take a step back (forward?). Yep.",False,False

Remember though, just because a threshold has been crossed doesn’t mean you can’t walk back.   Just like there is no essential change in yourself as a person from never swearing to the first time you do, from never having sex to your first time (these can be momentous events but they are mental and emotional ones), so too are you not forever marked by these changes.   Thresholds face two directions and you can retrace your steps and close certain doors behind you as you go.",False,False
