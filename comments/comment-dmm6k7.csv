I think if they had done the stethoscope first they probably could have not done the EKG and X-ray, though maybe they would have done the second just to be safe. But I said I was having cardiac pain specifically rather than chest pain so I think that‚Äôs why they started with the EKG.   I‚Äôm still glad they did it though it, it put my mind at ease.",False,False

You most definitely need to get checked out and be honest so you can be properly assessed. I recently went to a cardiologist to get my heart checked out for something unrelated - it wasn‚Äôt scary at all - I actually enjoyed the experience!  I know it‚Äôs hard but I think you should prepare what you are going to say before hand (write it down and practice even if you think that will help you).  I personally would just blurt out ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt told anyone this before but I think I have an eating disorder and I have been experiencing some chest pains so wanted to get checked out‚Äù.,False,False

Your heart is a muscle. It makes sense that if your heart is becoming weaker than it previously was that you may feel discomfort or pain as it struggles to function correctly.

Last time I mentioned that I'm trying to ""eat a little less"" my doctor reacted pretty annoyed and told me I don't have to look at my weight.

Better safe than sorry. No one here knows your body, what it can handle, what it can‚Äôt. After a month of restricting, I was having (luckily benign) cardiac symptoms, orthostasis, organ issues, lost my period (I think from stress), and on top of that, my weight was still on the high end of healthy.
