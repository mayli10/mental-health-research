Hard.  &amp;#x200B;  For example, every time I see r/progresspics pictures in my ""recommended for you"" section while browsing I know I will hate their achievement and shouldn't look at it. I still click it every damn time. Even when they weigh far more than me in their ""After"" pictures I am eaten by guilt and jealousy and want to cry.  &amp;#x200B;  It's their life and business. I shouldn't even bother nor care, but EDs are very competitive, I think a lot of us here know this feeling.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  I wish you the best!",False,False
