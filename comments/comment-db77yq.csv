My cat used to run to the food bowl but sometimes he will sit like 5 feet away and slowly walk over and he isnâ€™t old or anything. And then slowly eats. Not even the whole bowl. He will want some of my food somethings but I donâ€™t really give him any because I think heâ€™s so used to his food because it makes him sick sometimes. Iâ€™ll him him like a tiny bite sometimes. A true inspiration.,False,False

I'd like to invite you to spend one day with my cat. She gets free fed dry food and a can of wet food AM and PM. She thinks the dry food is for peasants, so whenever the wet food dish is empty (ie. 30 seconds after I've filled it), she *screams* at me. If I even *look* towards the bowls, she screams. Lol honestly shes an inspiration",False,False

Only gets two meals on a schedule (I don't free feed him at all). He's in great shape and eating doesn't really excite him all that much. Sometimes when I give him his food after the entire day he doesn't even bother to come down and eat it until later in the night. If it was me, the bowl would be demolished in 30 seconds. Wish I was more like him.",False,False

Only two portioned meals a day that you are given. No more or less. You canâ€™t complain or really do anything about it. Side note: Iâ€™m not a weird cat girl who wears cat ears or something.,False,False

If it helps, Iâ€™ve fostered many kittens over the years and the feeding guideline for kittens (under 1 year) is to feed on demand and not to restrict food. They grow so much in the first year. Enjoy being a cat mom!",False,False
