Believe me, his behavior is not normal. *He*'s the problem in this, not you.  You're not an animal because you eat, or make your own food, or whatever. And your value in this world has nothing to do with your weight.  If anything, it's the kindness you have for others that impact your value.

He's said things before about me being a piggy or I'll get fat, but that's when I've made my own food, which I anticipate now and can brace myself for. It really took me back when the comment was made about food he had prepared for me. It just reaffirms the idea that my value is based solely on my weight.",False,True
