Biotin, magnesium, and Iron supplements help future nail growth as well but the nail that’s already there can’t really be helped dramatically. When I cant afford a gel set I use Essie’s Treat Love &amp; Color strengthening nail polish to cover the peeling but I imagine all it’s just *less* drying than other polishes",False,False

I have a gel set right now and it’s a hard protective layer that prevents my nails from peeling right down to the skin so I can grow them out. I’ve never had issues with using gel to protect what’s already damaged from malnourishment.",False,False

Op is asking how to get healthier nails. Op needs protein in their diet. I’m not sure what you were trying to get across in this comment?,False,False

It gets a little better when I’m eating around my TDEE so I think it’s an issue with getting enough vitamins. Maybe try taking a multivitamin, I’ve also heard Biotin is good for your nails but never tried it myself.",False,False

When you get acrylic nails they file off a few layers of your nail bed. when the acrylic nails are eventually removed your nails are paper thin and peeling, so just tell the nail salon you had acrylic nails for a while and just removed them at another salon and that’s why they are so brittle.",False,False
