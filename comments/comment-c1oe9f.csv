In the past I've been compared to one of my co workers alot. Shes had kids but has an almost flawless body. She came to me to ask about how she could lose a few pounds.

I've been on the heavier and low end , weight wise. I was basically ignored and treated sub human when I was obese. Now that I am back in the low end/healty I get treated sooo much better!  I am super bitter and I dont really care about getting treated better. People that treated me like trash now want to pal around and I want nothing to do with them.
