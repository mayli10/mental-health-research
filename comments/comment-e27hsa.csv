It’s the only way to deal with any kind of stress. I don’t know how to cope with stress any other way for 6+ years now.   It makes you too tired to feel anything, and that’s good enough for me.  Oh, and I don’t want my body to develop incorrectly, so I keep myself in a suspended developmental state.",False,False

Restricting is less dangerous than my other ideas, so \~harm reduction win\~ lol. And because I'm afraid I won't be able to do the graduate program I am supposed to start next fall because of the pain and getting too sick to go in the first place seems preferable than taking yet another medical leave. Also because I can't purge anymore without making whatever is bleeding in my stomach worse/possibly causing the stomach bleeding.",False,False

It seems like it is so hard for other people to fast or restrict and I guess I get off on knowing that I can literally go for three weeks without eating while Karen is caving in to that cupcake. I do it for so many reasons. I restrict when I go through break ups or really hard times; my appetite just automatically disappears. I restrict because I genuinely love being tiny and I know that will never change. I love being called delicate, even if I can't see it myself. I love being ""90 pounds soaking wet"". That's a phrase I read in a book when I was in high school and it just stuck with me. I restrict because I'm fucking good at it. I was scared for my wellbeing at the beginning of this relapse, but now I just feel like this is who I truly am. I am a restrictor. It's just something I do.",False,False
