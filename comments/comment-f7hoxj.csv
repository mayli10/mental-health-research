If you took the recommended dose, you should at least drink something. If you haven't eaten in a while, it's possible that nothing will happen. Alternatively you might just get a dirty water type poo. How long it'll take to kick in and how long it'll last depends on the type and quantity that you took. Something like mag citrate or bisacodyl should work pretty quickly, whereas something like senna is usually designed to be overnight. It can last anywhere from a single poo, to a couple of hours, to about the next 24 hours. The higher strength laxatives will usually last longer, especially if you took above the recommended dose",False,False
