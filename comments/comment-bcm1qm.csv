Whenever I plan to treat myself, if the thing I want isn‚Äôt available, I freeze up and don‚Äôt know what to do. It feels like a waste to pick something out, but if I don‚Äôt eat it today I can‚Äôt until next week and what if they don‚Äôt have it then. I hate it.",False,False

That used to be my internal mantra.  I fully convinced myself I hated being full. And I did (at that time). And I would sort of congratulate myself for feeling sufficiently hungry. Finally, years later, I'm no longer stuck in that cycle. But every time I want to lose 10lbs (I try to stay mid to low healthy bmi) I have to fight those disordered thoughts and coping mechanisms. Even though they are still there, it's not a constant. I just want to reassure you that healing is possible and hopefully someday you'll get there. It takes time and it took a lot of mental healing in my case. Personally, being bipolar and depressive was a huge catalyst to my ED. Now that I've been able to overcome that, it's been easier to overcome many other things. Best of luck! It will get better. Don't be ashamed. You're only human and we all get overwhelmed.",False,False

Crunching the numbers to make everything fit together is a bottomless rabbit hole and I would literally spend all day, every day doing it if I could. I can c o m p l e t e l y understand how if you'd budgeted for that one thing and gotten comfortable with the idea with eating that one thing (and keeping it down!!) and then had to get something else you'd freak out. I've found myself getting irrationally angry at people selling me food if they don't have the item I want and nonchalantly ask ""what do you want instead"" because I forget that for non-ED people, there wouldn't have been hours of work that went into making the original decision.  Anyway, I don't really have great advice except to say happy birthday and I hope you feel better as soon as possible. Also, I'm taking a university class on ED right now and we learned in the family based therapy unit that a central part of ED is that it takes over your thoughts and behaviors. You're not irritable and inconsiderate, erratic, or shameful. You have an eating disorder, and those are its traits. Please don't feel bad about yourself, because it isn't your fault.",False,False
