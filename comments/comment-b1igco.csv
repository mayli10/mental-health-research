Those things frozen are the best way to have them. If I leave them out and they get all melted is when I dont want them. (Then again, I live in Florida so I guess in normal weather places they wouldn't get melted..)",False,False

She was so adorable when she told me ""momma my goal is 50 boxes. Is that doable?""  Darling, not only is 50 boxes doable but no less than 25 of those boxes are being bought by me.   So now I have 25 boxes in the freezer where I can't easily consume the entire stash at once. I've done good so far. My daughter gets 1 cookie for dessert every night. I redistributed a few boxes to my friends who missed the cookie selling period and the rest are preserved for periodic gifts throughout the summer (hostess gifts, baby shower gifts, random ""win brownie points at work"" gifts, etc).   Between my work and me being a university student, she sold 275 boxes. We literally just stood outside the exercise and sport science degree building for about 15 minutes before class and raked in orders from my classmates ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚",False,False
