My ED started in middle school (like mid-September of 7th grade). So now, the cold weather triggers a weird deluge of fond memories of that time, and the nostalgia strengthens as I restrict more heavily. Idk, I was happier then‚Äì‚ÄìI was more than just hopeful; I *assumed* that my future held boundless opportunities.  ...Not to sound melodramatic or anything. lol. That's just how it be.",False,False

Winter layers = being able to do whatever to my body and not getting comments about it. Like somehow I will enter winter fat, and when spring comes and I take off all the layers, I will be a beautiful thin butterfly.

In summer I like to be a nudist at home and I'm forced to see reality more and show more skin so I don't burn up and in winter I love eating warm, cozy foods and comfort foods.
