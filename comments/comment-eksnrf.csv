I mean, I can zip them up but at what cost lol. I've actually gained muscles throughout my weight gain. I have more muscles than before I became sick. My body shape in itself hasn't changed much though, it's just more muscle-y and slightly more harmonious.",False,False

As I said though, muscle loss. Even still I seem to have quite muscular legs despite my weight loss, so I probably have less fat than normal for my weight and body shape. I'm sure that an average person at my weight and height with such small boobs might have bigger legs. Or maybe I just don't know what a woman of my height and weight should look like.",False,False
