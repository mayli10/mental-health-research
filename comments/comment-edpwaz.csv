I can't imagine now what my motivation for it was, but at the time it seemed like a reasonable thing to take from that song lol.

I'm so used to disappointment with songs talking about Hunger that I didn't even hope that it might be about an ED. Then it was like oh shit okay  P!nk also has a similar song called Happy that has me crying the other day if any of y'all are into those vibes,False,False
