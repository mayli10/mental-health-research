Might be worth checking out any other brands you have",False,False

I personally think that with my eating habits a meal replacement shake, some potassium citrate powder, a vitamin D tablet, and some protein powder would be enough to make it so pretty anything I eat would be healthy enough. It could be that you personally need different stuff based on your eating habits though. If you restrict to a really low calorie-intake you might find a multivitamin to be very good for you.",False,False

They also don't provide any calcium or potassium which are important to bone and muscle/brain health. People who are lactose intolerant may struggle to get enough calcium and only 5% of people get enough potassium in their diet. It would be nice though to be able to just take all your vitamins so easily like that and not have to worry a out eating healthy. I guess if you did rely on these things though that you could just eat a few bananas every day and some junk food. I actually checked out the nutrition facts for a Big Mac combo and with a couple bananas on top of it you would actually get a lot of potassium. Their fries have a shocking amount for some reason.",False,False

I am really bad at this, I have only taken vitamin b, collagen lmao, fish oils, and iron for an iron deficiency in the past. now i drink a 0cal vitamin jelly every morning but I feel like pills would be much more potent.

Although if you lost 5kg in a month that sounds likely. Meal replacement shakes might be a good alternative. Can be costly, but they do count as a food and tend to be better balanced than multivitamins. Something I dislike about multivitamins is that they tend to be very high in folate and calcium while being low in other important nutrients.",False,False

At the hospital I was told to purchase the Tespo, it’s like a Keurig but for your vitamins and it puts them out in a shot glass style that you just drink quickly and it’s so much easier than pills. You can customize your monthly vitamin packs that you need and frankly this is going to be kind of a lifesaver for me, maybe it can help you too.",False,False
