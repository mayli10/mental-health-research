I‚Äôm so proud of you :)))  I felt a weird mix of pride and strength for challenging my food brain, but also guilt.   Overall, despite not being 100% okay, I know it‚Äôs good that I did it. It‚Äôs never a bad thing to challenge yourself (in a healthy way) :)",False,True

Before my current bout of restriction, I went to Starbucks. Every. Day. I would get a pumpkin cream cold brew, and often times a grilled cheese sandwich (540 cal, yikes!) along with that. Their sandwiches are good but became a fear food really quickly for me. About a week ago I challenged myself and got a sandwich, I was able to eat half in the morning and half later that night! I felt shitty as well but it‚Äôs small victories and we should be proud of ourselves for going out of our comfort zone. Maybe someday soon I‚Äôll be able to allow myself a coffee. Baby steps.
