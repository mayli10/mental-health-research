It is not a luxury or prize. The reason we restrict is not to later binge, it is simply to eat less or nothing. And I know we are ALL in a restrict/fast and binge cycle, but that’s not the flaw exactly. The flaw is when we’ve restricted so well we actually lose, just to “thank” or “congratulate” ourselves with food. Do not do that.   2) buying clothes, spa days like waxing or a facial, or concert tickets, is wayyyy more rewarding. And you’ll feel that too. Think about how much a binge adds up to money wise. Maybe you live at home so maybe this doesn’t apply to you, but ordering food is at least $20 each time. Over and over that’s enough to buy whatever you want and TRULY deserve.   3) you’re not ruined nor must you begin again after a binge. Take a step back. Weigh yourself. Understand we all slip up. Every. Single. One of us. There is no perfect Ana. From this binge forward, put into action what you want to happen next time.   Ex, “next time I reach my monthly goal, I will take my best friend to the movies” (your best friend could be yourself, that’s probably what I’d do lmfao)   Do not think in terms of “can’t wait to lose 10lbs so I eat 5000 calories in one sitting” because you’re going to hate yourself. The movies can even include a slushee and some popcorn. Maybe pass on candy. Or go for it. But that’s still so much less than a binge. And you’ll feel happy to get out and do something and show off that -10lbs. HOLD YOURSELF ACCOUNTABLE. Not regrettable.",False,False
