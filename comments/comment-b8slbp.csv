Ranging everywhere from ""you don't need to be drinking diet soda"", ""a little bit of 'x' won't kill you"", ""you look gross, gain some weight"" to ""I thought you were eating healthy?"" ""Wow, that's a lot of food for one person"", ""you look healthy, you've filled out a little since I last saw you"".  DON'T COMMENT ON MY BODY, FOOD, OR PERCIEVED LIFESTYLE, THANX   I tend to read way too much into everything and I have to remind myself that:  1. Other people don't know food is a problem for me.    2. From their perspective, the comment is benign. As if they said, ""did you get a haircut?"" Or ""are those shoes new?""   I hope comments from other people don't dissuade you from recovery. ",False,False
