Anyone that thinks they're somehow good or beautiful has clearly never had one and knows nothing about them. I feel like I'm living 2 lives because I hide that part of me when I'm around my family. I have to work my fasting schedule around them so I don't raise suspicion. I have to lie when people ask me how I've lost weight. I have a few close friends who know and I feel like they're getting tired of me. Having an ED has not made me a better person. It has consumed my mind and my life and I fucking hate it and myself, but I can't stop. And losing weight doesn't satisfy. You think you'll be happy when you reach a goal, but in reality you still fucking hate yourself and make a lower goal. I've lost 45lbs and I still see a fat pile of shit. Compliments make me incredibly uncomfortable and sometimes even angry because I'm convinced they're lying to me. I can't enjoy a meal without knowing exactly how many calories are in it and planning my whole day around it. That ED voice never shuts up. It it's like a jealous or possessive partner that seeks to isolate you until it is all you have left.",False,False

You'll fluctuate rapidly between feeling like a failure for giving in and eating/purging/etc. and Stockholming yourself into thinking you're in control when you're suuuuper not.  When you have an eating disorder, you can focus, but only on the eating disorder. And not in a self-discipline way, either. Your weight, sleep, and eating habits will be all over the place- your focus will be entirely spent picking apart everything you did that went wrong. Will you stop doing those things? Nope! You'll just keep obsessing over them while your connections to reality slip away.
