I personally think you were not in the wrong to reply/comment on what she was saying, but of course a more kind version would be just as fine.

I remember this one time a cashier tried to ask a little bit about why I was buying a condom. My friends were too embarrassed to get it themselves, so I offered. I don‚Äôt get embarrassed by that sort of stuff. I honestly think it‚Äôs important to encourage a more neutral or supportive view on protection, depending on who is saying what. (Cashier vs parent)   They told me I looked like I was too young to be needing a condom. I was like...?   ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you think if I was too young to be having sex a condom would be the perfect addition? Y‚Äôknow.. so teen pregnancy doesn‚Äôt happen?‚Äù   Then they got silent after that.   At the end of the night my friends didn‚Äôt even have sex lol.",False,False
