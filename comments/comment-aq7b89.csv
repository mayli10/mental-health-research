""Super Creatine"" was invented by the CEO, a former high school science teacher. Testing on it shows it doesn't even contain creatine. No one knows how ""Super Creatine"" affects the brain, muscles, heart, liver, or body in general. * Bang has hardly any BCAAs or CoQ10 - Testing on it shows that there are minimal amounts, not enough to have any meaningful effect on the body like Bang falsely advertises! * BANG DOES NOT HAVE A PATENT! They advertise a patent on their cans and on their boxes with a number! The patent office has rejected and cancelled this patent! * Watch the link to see the Bang CEO say ""Bang can cure mental retardation"" just because it's fun to watch. He says everyone becomes mentally retarded as they age, and with Bang, you won't become retarded. Ok...  Anyone who drinks this is officially falling for a scam and putting some unknown chemical into their body. **BANG = DUMB**",False,False
