That sounds a lot like what you're experiencing. It's something so many anorexics go through once you start really eating again. You can eat 5000+ calories a day, even healthy stuff, and still feel hungry. And of course *everyone* thinks they're never going to stop and eventually get obese. But honestly, looking at others' experiences, it seems like if you just give into the hunger it eventually goes away.  It makes sense, you finally start listening to your hunger signals, your body can finally get food, so it's ""anxious"" to get as much as it can in case you starve again. If you just go with it, eventually your body should realize its not going to starve and doesn't need to stockpile any more. If you try to restrict you're literally giving your subconscious a reason to binge. If it helps, I'm going through extreme hunger also and I'm just trying to relax and enjoy it - restriction and obsessing over food only made me anxious and miserable, and I'm sure its damaged my real passion (computers) too.",False,False

I'm not advocating restricting really, just pointing out that the effect of seeing the nutritionist might not be so bad right now... Could actually be helpful??",False,False

I’m finding I’m caring less and less about being healthy because nothing matters if I’m not thin  Because “if I’m fat I can’t leave the house and people can’t see me looking like this”",False,True

Binging is still an eating disorder behavior, and you deserve support to be free of those behaviors too. Good for you, though, for working toward recovery. You'll do great at your job if you can stay healthy. :)",False,False
