Also, last time I bought more cashew milk and greek yogurt they didn't have any vanilla cashew milk, so I got regular cashew milk and vanilla greek yogurt and I think that was a slight improvement. They don't seem to make 0% fat vanilla greek yogurt though. I bought 2%. I also couldn't find the tiny measuring cups (one of my roommates probably used them and didn't put them away) so I just put the spices in from the containers and I thought I would try approximately doubling the amounts and it was really good. Plus, only like 2 extra calories.",False,True

I think not telling her would make it less likely for her to feel guilty, but there is still the chance that she would feel guilty anyway, so I really don't what to do. I don't want her to feel pressured to drink the smoothie and I don't want her to feel guilty whatever decision she makes, but that's a possibility no matter what I do unless I just don't bring her a smoothie. **But** I'm trying to help her recover and I think it's very important to get her into healthy eating in a way that should be easy for her and I kinda really doubt she'll make the initiative to do that on her own unless I give her a little push by literally bringing her food. And like when we talked about it she really does want to recover and she sounded really interested in the meal plan I suggested for her, I just also feel like I'm telling her ""*you just need to eat more*"" by doing this and that wouldn't be helpful at all. I really just want to give her the tools she needs to figure this out on her own and I want her to know that there is a way to do this that she might actually enjoy. I'm just really worried about making the wrong decision and making things awkward for her and having that negatively effect our relationship and then things don't work out and we stop talking and she never gets better and she dies.",False,True

I wouldnâ€™t let it sit or anything because that might just be a waste or ingredients may settle weirdly, but I do like the idea that someone else had of making one big one for yourself and offering to share a bit!

We're probably both going to take the subway. I'm a little bit worried about the smoothies getting warm though. It is winter, but if we drink them after the movies they'll likely be warm by then.
