It took me a while to realize this, but we notice because we see ourselves all the time. So knowing that other people can't notice helps me cope.  Also, Try fresh cut lemons in water for bloating. It always works for me.",False,False

Sometimes I also tend to self sabotage by bingeing before important events that cause anxiety, but even if I manage not to binge, be sure stomach will pop out and scale will show a higher number. Every time I have dietist or personal trainer appointment, a shooting, or start a new nude pose (my job), for not to say on the beach. Though I'm genetically very rotund on the belly, I can tell the difference and it's so embarassing.",False,False
