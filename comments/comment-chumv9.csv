I often feel like my ED isn‚Äôt ‚Äúreal‚Äù because it‚Äôs not much to do about losing weight or being ‚Äúskinny‚Äù, i don‚Äôt look at thinspo or fantasies about my UGW.   my 4 year old daughter has cancer and we basically live in hospital. my life has spiraled out of control in every possible way. there is so much guilt because i know my kids need me to be strong and healthy but i am in so much pain that i don‚Äôt have it in me to try recover right now. i just try stay healthy enough that i have energy to spend time with her.   the only thing that makes me feel better is restricting. i hate that i‚Äôm like this.",False,False

It has been the reason the whole time. I don't have body dysmorphia and I do not have depression. Or anxiety. I am just an crazy control freak. I like setting goals and working toward them. I like the feeling of denying myself sustenance. To see how tightly I can control myself. To battle with my instincts and conquer the one thing that people have the hardest time besting- *food.,False,False

Its weird but like most people are saying, its the one aspect of my life I can most easily control. Granted I still binge from time to time. But yeah, most times its deeply centered around my body and weight but sometimes its not. It all depends on how my life is going.",False,False

For the most part, I'd say it still is. I do have body dysmorphia and think I look like a disgusting, fat, piece of shit and want to reach another GW. BUTTTT, with a slew of MH issues that leave me feeling worthless, helpless and out of control, it is a coping mechanism to be in control of SOMETHING. I've never really thought of myself as controlling my food, but controlling my body.",False,False

But the point of weight loss for me has changed.  In the beginning, it was about losing fat and becoming slimmer like I used to be. Yeah, I like that I'm slimmer, but it's not about that anymore. Now losing weight is about confirming I'm in control by seeing the number continuingly decrease. It's about becoming small to the point I'm invisible and people won't notice me.  I don't think I'll be happy at my UGW, and if I was rational I wouldn't torment myself trying to get there. But I don't care about the weight loss because it'll never be enough so long as my life is chaotic. I cannot control people's reactions around me, but I can and will control this.  Your ED is valid, regardless of the reasons you engage in it. But you're not alone in using to for control.",False,False
