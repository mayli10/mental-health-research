I hope that I can find peace in my weight and stop trying to be lower and lower because reaching goal after goal hasn't actually done anything in my life other than hitting a mental goal. I'm working on it and hopefully you can find happiness in where you're at too. The dysmorphia is real ðŸ˜­",False,False

What Iâ€™m desperately warning you to do now is get help for your ED. Because where your at is (Iâ€™m assuming) perfectly healthy and losing more will only put you in more danger. (Not that YOURE healthy with the ED tho- thatâ€™s the problem)   Iâ€™ve been absolutely miserable since surpassing two GWs. Iâ€™m super underweight and my relationship with food is awful to the point where eating ANYTHING puts me in a depression. Iâ€™m in danger medically. Please take my advice and seek help now before you end up being forced to gain weight via intervention of others.,False,False
