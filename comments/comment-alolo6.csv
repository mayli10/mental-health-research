But butter... FUCK BUTTER. People put that shit on everything and it doesnâ€™t add anything to the quality of the meal. And one stick of butter has 800 calories in it.",False,False

I was scared of it for years but I thought the calories in oil was unnecessary and gross, but it's only after years of using those (controversial) shitty 1cal sprays that I've started to slowly get over my fear of olive oil. I love cooking, and sometimes even a healthy recipe really needs a little bit of whole oil to stop things being dry / sticking / whatever. I agree with this as a whole, but I feel a big part of it is psychology. I want my low calorie eggs in the morning, and I'm past the fear now and realise a small teaspoon of butter still has calories, but the fat will keep my satiated longer and my eggs turn out much better.
