The curly fries, all the different flavors of fried tacos, the breakfast jack with ham, the breakfast jack with bacon, the buttery jack burger, the chicken strips, the chocolate cake, and S H I T that OREO SHAKE.  Unfortunately I still live kind of near a Taco Bell. I started making the half hour trek a several times week to spend $20+ on $1 food items, so I finally told my mom I was struggling with binges and to please call me to keep me accountable if she sees Taco Bell charges on my card. I literally have a Taco Bell sober coach lol. Don't be like me.",False,False
