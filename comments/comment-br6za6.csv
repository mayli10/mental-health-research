I've had friends like the ""Kate Moss lookalike"" girl in the past... just never thought this type of thing could apply to *me*.  Maybe it's time to reevaluate some opinions/perspectives.",False,True

Reading this really put some things in perspective.    I honestly never even considered this possibility, but what you've written makes so much sense.   Funnily enough, at 140lbs I wore XS and would regularly get comments on how ""skinny"" I was. A (short and size-0-wearing) friend even asked if I weighed less than her.    At the end of the day, I think I (and many of us here) want to be content with our bodies. Maybe this train of thought will help to get there.",False,True

She said that whether it was validating or not, it‚Äôs okay to ask people what they think because it‚Äôs a reality check for my dysmorphia. I mostly think I look like a balloon animal, and she said she thinks I look very ‚Äúfrail‚Äù. The result of these check-ins with her and my SO sort of balance out so instead of thinking I look massive all the time (like my reflection says I do) I mostly think I probably look average.   In college I lived across the hall from a girl who looked like a professional Kate Moss impersonator. She used to always tell me she was so big, etc, and I thought she just had some dysmorphia going on or was fucking around or whatever. I went clothes shopping with her once and in the fitting rooms she proved to me she was a size 10 in most stores. I was gobsmacked.   You can have a BMI on the higher end of normal and still LOOK slim. Especially to non-disordered people. It depends on how and where you carry weight, how you carry yourself, how you dress, what your frame is.",False,False

I did powerlifting in high school and I carried my weight well, people were completely blown away when I told them how much I actually weighed because there's really no frame of reference for weights for tall girls. I'm at a healthy weight now and I'm sure people would still balk if I told them how much I weighed because in a lot of people's minds, no woman weighs over 140lbs, obviously üôÑ.    I think there's a lot if different colloquial slang terms for body shapes. Skinny, tiny, thin, slim, average, healthy, thick, chubby, husky, fat, etc. They can be looked at as a hierarchical scale almost. So you probably are slim! I'm just an inch taller and it's taken me a long time to get used to being called ""slim."" For normal people slim usually means you're visibly a healthy weight, and your weight is well evened out. Is that where you want to be? Probably not, we are on an ED forum after all, but take solace in the fact that there's proof your body dysmorphia is lying to you- normal people don't see you as fat at all.",False,False

What you said about the frame thing  could be the case. I'm 5'8, have a lot of leg muscle and carry most of my weight in my thighs/ass. Even my doctor (without weighing me) confidently announced that I'm ""definitely not overweight"".   On the other hand, if she was trying to comfort me... *why*? I didn't complain about my body. I didn't explicitly call myself large. She just said it out of nowhere and without any provocation. She was even surprised that I started crying in response.   It just doesn't make any sense :(",False,True

I won't want to sound rude, but I think you're right that a bmi of 25 isn't thin, unless it's coming from the type of people who are overweight and don't know what a normal weight looks like.  either way what's important is how you feel about it and how your therapist can help you through it, and you totally have the right to ask her to not say things like that in the future if you don't believe it helps you",False,False

It's definitely good to know that I'm not the only person experiencing this.  The problem I have with her comment is that it is so outlandish and disingenuous that I feel like she is lying to me to make me feel better.   I could have (skeptically) accepted ""normal"" , but ""thin"" or ""slim"" is just too far from the truth.",False,True

BMI is pretty unreliable for appearance, doesn‚Äôt factor in a bunch of stuff. also her idea of thin might differ from your (disordered) idea of thin, but in the general consensus of thinness, she‚Äôs probably telling the truth.   idk if that helps at all. you‚Äôre definitely not alone.",False,False
