My parents have always been militant health foodies, possibly even verging on orthorexic. They even ghost wrote a diet book for someone that, even at the time, I could tell was extreme, highly restrictive in type and quality of food and drink, and obsessive aboutâ€˜clean eatingâ€™ and minuscule details.   Most of the food we ate for most of my childhood was... kind of yucky/boring/weird. I did not enjoy our diet. And this is coming from someone who enjoys raw veggiesâ€”just not *only* raw veggies, when I didnâ€™t have a choice in the matter, and never a â€˜treat.â€™ Ever. Mom tells people that she always said â€˜everything in moderation, even moderation,â€™ but that was a lie. We never got to have anything that wasnâ€™t â€˜clean,â€™ organic, or â€˜natural.â€™ And yet I still overate, and my dad shamed me for it by comparing me and my metabolism to my younger sister.  People outside of our family treated us strangely because they thought we were weird because of all of it. Relating to peers about food and childhood is hard. When I got free reign to eat what I wanted I went crazy.  And now Iâ€™ve had an eating disorder for about 7 years. Go figure.",False,False

And that maybe that's abnormal.   Like, I think my first food-related memory is of a preschool teacher confiscating my little lunch baggie of craisins. Because sugar content. And because ""unhealthy.""  In the greater context of my childhood, adults blithely talked in front of us about empty calories, diets, sugar, carbs, ""clean eating,"" raw whatevers, juice cleanses, vitamins, macros, proto IF stuff, etc etc. Or talked to us about these things directly. And I mean, they did also educate us about nutrients and balanced diets, and I am glad I got a grounding in that practical info. But like, damn. What is it like to grow up (for at least a little while) not knowing that bagels are boiled rings of sin, darling, that should only be spread with the barest sneeze of creamed cheese - whereas rice cakes with hummus are the virtuous, pRaCTicaLy iDeNtiCaL, obviously preferable alternative??  But I do also remember Super Size Me, yeah. My parents had us watch it as a family. Like...why, even? We didn't even eat fast food?? Honestly what goes through people's minds when they decide Super Size Me is a great thing to show kids. I'm sorry it fucked with you, OP, I really am.",False,False

And"" in retrospect, no doubt many of them were lowballing because they were embarrassed. I remember one girl had tracked like, nothing unhealthy, and yet she was always the one eating hot cheetos and drinking full-calorie monsters in the morning, and yet those breakfasts were never reflected. It was both a slap in the face for being fat- and honest. At least I got a few good years of cultivating a healthier lifestyle and habits after the shame of that... until it spiraled into an obsession with numbers and refusing anything I thought was deemed ""fat people food"" (i.e. my favorite foods)ðŸ™„",False,False
