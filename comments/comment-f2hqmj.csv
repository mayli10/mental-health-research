But good job stopping the urge to purge. Seriously, that is the hardest thing to do!  I don't know if you have ever taken therapy classes before, but when I learned that after purging sends our brains sends relaxing sensations throughout our bodies - and is therefore addictive because it is like a drug. It made so much sense for me why it was so fucking hard to stop. It was why I always did it late at night, and why I was able to fall asleep afterward. While it is addictive, it is also incredibly hard on your body to go through those actions continuously.  You, by stopping, gave yourself and your body a big win.  With having no support system, I started really making headway in my treatment when I started opening up to my friends and family about my ED. (And at that time, I had ED for about 7 years when I finally shared with them). I forced that secret into light and I really worked on that core feeling of being ashamed. I was fortunate enough to have friends and family that were supportive.   Everyone has a different story, and I'm sure you have one too. Either way, I hope you find the comfort you need in real life. Not just on reddit :)",False,False
