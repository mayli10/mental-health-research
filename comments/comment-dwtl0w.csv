Of course there's also the usual ""stomach shrinking"" so you physically feel full more quickly, but when you add in the fact that your body actually needs more food because you starve yourself, it usually accommodates much more food than someone who usually eats a normal amount  Whenever I eat a normal volume of food for a few days I'm always surprised by how much easier it is to feel ""satisfied"" (again, does take a few days to get to that point though, also because I don't usually restrict severely anyway). Plus, more nutrition means that hunger is more bearable (for up to 3 hours, say), not something where I struggle to walk after only an hour",False,False
