And had another (evil evil evil bitch) roommate who was always trying to hurt us and i never realized it.   Like shed walk into the prev ment roommates room and purposely trigger her or when me and her would order food shes just talk about how many calories are in it and ‚Äúit makes no sense why youre eating i thought you were AN‚Äù   the effects of seeing someone with it worse and someone purposely hurting me has left me feeling like ive made this disorder up and im dont have an ED. But i know if i tried to quit right here right now i couldnt.,False,False

I eat 1600 daily and although it's for recovery i still feel like i'm eating too much to have an ED. Luckily it doesn't trigger me to restrict but the feeling is still there.  I also don't exercise much which adds to it,False,False

It's more like ED's are along a spectrum, and if you are eating 200-300 calories regularly,  then you're definitely on the anorexia spectrum. But I feel like those fears you have, might be caused by worrying about what other think about you. Dont worry about what others say or think. Just try to focus on yourself... which I know is easier said than done lol.",False,False
