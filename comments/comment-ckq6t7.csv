On the other hand, i can make a pretty decent and massive drink for about 100cal, like an iced coffee, or a big sugar-free hot chocolate, that will keep me occupied and not thinking about food for longer and keep me satisfied with a liquidy-full tummy without feeling bloated for longer, too. Also, much lower chance of salt retention lol :P  Also I hear you on the sugary drinks thing. Full-sugar versions of any drink make me feel like my teeth are rotting out of my skull. It's kind of horrifying that this is just what we're taught is the ""average"" amount of sugar. Even in the midst of my worst binging I still can't do full-sugar drinks.",False,False
