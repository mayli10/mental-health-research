It’s no magic pill but there is science behind it! https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/peppermint-tea#section1,False,False

The nurses shoved it in my face nonstop after my most recent surgery, because apparently it helps with the bloating you get from having air trapped in your abdomen.  It’s not magic, but it’s 3 calories and certainly can’t hurt, and is definitely safer than purging. I put a *little* miralax in if I need to, but I’m not a purger really so there’s no slippery slope for me with that.",False,False
