This happens to me way too much. You know I think our brains are trying to sabotage us into eating more? Also, this reminds me of the first time I ""binged"" after starving myself. It was actually reactive eating, I took a loaf of bread, jar of peanut butter and a knife, into the living room, then proceeded to cry while eating slices of peanut butter bread and having no idea why the fuck I couldn't stop.  ED breakdowns are exhausting. There are times where if I can't have my safe food, I'll just miserably eat everything because the safe food is ruined.",False,False

I've never had a full on ED, but I have gone through some pretty tough periods of self-loathing and I have starved myself, so I feel like I can relate to some of the experience. Maybe there's something small and nice you could do for yourself that doesn't involve food?  When I was depressed and trying to climb up out of it, deciding to get myself an expensive haircut was that for me. It was really hard to do because I kept thinking how undeserving I was while I was sitting in the chair, but when I came out of the salon I felt a little bit more attractive and valuable, even knowing it was just a minor change in my appearance.  It really went a long way when I proved to myself that I cared about my own well-being and happiness. Maybe there's something similar you could give yourself after such a shitty night. Think what you would do for a friend who went through that and then do it for yourself.  Wish you well!",False,False

But in the midst of the breakdown I was like ""this is it, this fucking 120 cals worth of bread, some mustard, and a few pickle slices are my undoing. All my suffering, for nothing.""   It was all very dramatic.   At the time I was ranting to my cat and I'm fairly sure the words ""Shakespeare would have written about this, you know!"" Left my mouth.   (It's not that far off tbh though. He did write mainly smart ass meme-y bullshit thinly veiled as tragedy. So imma defend that statement said in hysterics despite its ridiculousness.)",False,True
