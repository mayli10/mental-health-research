Iâ€™m trying to go to nursing school, and people like her make me sick. She should NOT be a nurse, especially around impressionable kids.

Itâ€™s especially sad because she is a school nurse. So she worked with young kids and teens who are impressionable, and before that she worked in a hospital. To top it all off, she also stole my ADHD medication (on top of my safe food). But there is some karma: word on the street she was fired from her job at the school.  Really made me believe that you canâ€™t be putting bad energy into the world &amp; expect nothing in return!",False,False

I have these really low cal yogurts that I absolutely love and my mom never took an interest in, until she realized they came in berry cheesecake &amp; key lime pie flavours. Like, why the sudden interest in MY food, you have your own. It puts me into a fit of rage when she asks for one. Sure, eat them all so I can starve I guess ðŸ™„",False,False

My last roommate ate all my food I had just bought the night before. Grocery shopping is really stressful for me for obvious reasons. I pick my food very carefully since I have certain foods handy for when I feel like I am gonna binge similar to you (in the sense that theyâ€™re low cal, low carb etc.) I bought those along with some food for meals for the week (I try to plan my meals since that gives me some confidence &amp; control). My roommate &amp; her friend ate everything I bought that wasnâ€™t nailed down. When I brought it to her attention, she didnâ€™t give a fuck. It was really selfish. A week later I moved out - and now I am living in my own studio apartment. I am trying to avoid roommates from now on for this reason. It triggered me to holy hell especially because I was raised in a very unstable &amp; food-insecure environment. Luckily, I am living in a studio apartment by myself so it wonâ€™t happen again.",False,False

I lived abroad for a while and returned home to realize my sister has been stocking the pantry with ED foods for *years*. She doesn't have any issues and eats super caloric dense foods on top of everything, she's just been into rice cakes since she was a child and low-cal soups fit into her super lazy approach to eating.",False,False
