I live in LA and I PROMISE you not everyone on the beach is some crazy hot model you’re imagining. They have some pretty “normal” bodies. It really depends what beach you’re at but a lot of the time it’s just parents with kids. I know this may not help but coming from a resident here (I don’t really go to the beach just Bc self hatred so I understand) your body won’t be the main focus at the beach if that makes sense. Everyone’s focused on themselves and having a good time together while they can over their break. ,False,False
