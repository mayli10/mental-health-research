She said the same thing when I said I like dancing at clubs instead of sitting down, and when I said I hand write my notes. It's really annoying and doesn't even make sense. She literally brings it up constantly and is so preachy about everything. She tried to shove a granola bar in my mouth the other day because she assumed I hadn't eaten yet. It's all so ironic though, since she confessed to me that she makes herself throw up when she gets self-conscious, and over exercises to the point of passing out. But it's fine, that's not disordered eating because she still likes pizza (/s)",False,False

We have less patience for each other and neither of us can understand why the other won’t just get their shit together and stop embodying their condition. It’s rough. ",False,False

Especially with people in treatment. Like when I was IP, *every single fucking dietitian* was out for my blood the moment I mentioned I was vegan. And like you, I'm very strongly vegan for ethical and environmental reasons. But of course nobody would believe a pathetic little anorexic!  I've gotten pretty lucky with an outpatient team that actually listens to me like an adult. I think they realize that I'm on the verge of independence and I need to make my own choices.

Like literally anything I'd say they didn't like or want to hear they'd completely dismiss and tell me it was the 'ED voice'. It was so belittling and drove me insane. Even if they thought 80% of what I was saying was from an evil gremlin in my head, surely you'd think they'd try to fix it and help get rid of it? Nope, just used it as a reason to ignore most of what I said. ",False,False

I'm not sure how you responded to what your dad said, but I would not have handled it gracefully.   I personally hate most pizza and pasta because red sauce gives me crazy heartburn, but I still get looks from people when when I explain this.  ""You of all people shouldn't worry about eating pizza!"" no Susan, it's not even the calories right now, it just upsets my stomach!  It's like 1 facet out of the 1000 our personalities contain has an ED component, and therefore the other 999 parts of ourselves are suddenly invalid. It's dehumanizing, and why I rarely tell people.

My mother calls me crazy stupid and abnormal for having illnesses, and has said she wants to put me somewhere she never has to see my crazy face again. Thanks mom!  Regarding being invalidated...I actually don't like pizza anymore. No, it's not because I'm avoiding the calories. I fucking LOVE vegetables and always have (my mother knows damn well broccoli, strawnerries and tomatoes have been my favorite foods since I was a child), no its not because I'm trying to eat healthy. I don't want to eat that mac and cheese made with milk and butter, or the food fried in oil because I never liked oily greasy food and it will make me feel sick. No its not because I hate your cooking and I want an excuse not to eat.   I hate it, I really do. My mother has even tried it with my OCD, asking if I do xyz that she thinks is weird because of it and I didn't even know how t respond. She only even acknowledges my disorders when she's trying to blame, discredit or control me. ",False,False
