I take Dulcolax and last night I took six or seven and this morning I took four. That was at most eleven laxatives and I (tmi) had horrible diarrhea. I was so bloated I looked nine months pregnant.

Not trying to freak you out but I'd definitely be concerned. So yeah water is your bff rn. Charge your phone too so you have something to do on the toilet lol. I took my laptop in because I was sitting there for sooo long. ",False,False
