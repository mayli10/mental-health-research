You'd think people who had no first-person experience with successful weight loss wouldn't try to give anorexics advice on weight loss, but then again, anyone with a drunken scrap of a sense of decency would think *nobody whatsoever* would try to give that advice to that audience, so...hey.....",False,False

People shouldn't be encouraging you to lose weight. At a surface level I can see how eating more and exercising more is better than starving yourself because you're at least getting nutrients you would miss out on by restricting, but either way you're losing weight with an unhealthy mindset that should not be supported.",False,False

Imagine if people met agoraphobics and were like ""oh it's okay, all you have to do is get a job at home and never go outside again!""  (do people do that tho? some crouton somewhere probably does that.)",False,False
