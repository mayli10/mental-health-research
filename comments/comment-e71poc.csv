And I can really relate. This morning I spent a good 25 minutes pulling at the loose skin and fat left on my body. I dislike the current fat on there and the fact that I was ever big enough to get loose skin. Which I can't do anything about, I can't go back and stop myself from gaining weight in the first place.  You're not alone in your feelings and you're not bad or wrong for expressing them to others. Express away, I'll read it and commiserate! It helps me feel less alone too.",False,False
