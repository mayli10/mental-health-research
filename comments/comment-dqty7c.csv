You couldn‚Äôt have consented properly in the state you were in, and even if you said yes it is still on him‚Äî no one in that state of mind can properly agree to that. Also, there‚Äôs the fact that you woke up on the floor, not a bed, and if anything him ‚Äúhelping‚Äù you in the morning could simply to have been to throw off suspicion, so that you wouldn‚Äôt figure out the ugly truth of it all. My love, I am so, so sorry you had to go through this. It‚Äôs awful. I went through something very similar several years ago and to this very day it affects me. I am just now working through it and trying to get my life together. It breaks my heart that you went through this, too, and that other subs have been unsupportive and cruel. You did not deserve this, any of it, and it is not your fault. I know these feelings that arise because of what happened are scary and confusing and very, very overwhelming‚Äî but please don‚Äôt run away. It will always catch up to you in the end, demanding power over you and you won‚Äôt be able to escape it. It will be felt, all of it. Seek help, as soon as you are able, and if you feel it would help you heal, seek the justice you deserve. Doing this will make it more real, yes, more tangible, but through this it will lose its power. You are strong, and you have our undying support when you need it. Please feel free to message me if you need, I‚Äôm always here to talk and help in whatever way I canüíú",False,False

If you couldn‚Äôt consent (which you couldn‚Äôt, because you weren‚Äôt conscious/sober) you WERE raped. definitely find a therapist or another professional to work through this with and ignore what random people on the internet in other subs are saying. your feelings are valid. what happened to you was horrible and wholly undeserved.

Speaking from my own personal experience, you may be able to pretend it didn‚Äôt happen for a period of time, but eventually it will spill out. When I was attacked, I took plan B (which you may be able to get free of charge from Planned Parenthood) and got checked for STIs then followed up in six months for an HIV screening too.  The feelings are extremely difficult and there are anonymous help lines, support groups, and heck, you are more than welcome to shoot me a DM. I am sending you so much love!",False,False

Take a morning after pill, you might get pregnant if you aren't on birth control. The morning after pill can work up to 120 hours (5 days) after having sex, but it's most effective the sooner you take it. I would also get screened for STDs and STIs, if you have either of these the earlier you catch it the better.  My friend had to deal with the questioning herself, too. She was raped by someone while she was blackout drunk. Let me tell you, it took her a long time to finally accept it was rape, even though it didn't seem like rape to her, even though she felt violated. I'm sure she'll have issues with this experience in the future (relating to trust she had put in someone very close to her).  I don't know what to say other than you aren't alone, and you never will be. This experience has happened to other women, it's just not talked about because the only person experiencing shame in situations like this is the person who was raped. You have nothing to be ashamed of, the guy who raped you should feel ashamed. You were taken advantage of, and he probably knew this, since someone who is blackout drunk is always VISIBLY drunk. And you didn't do anything wrong, not by being in a park and not by drinking. HE is the only one at fault here, don't try to tell yourself you did something wrong by drinking too much or being out late at night. Sure, drinking a lot is putting yourself at risk, but does that mean you deserve to get raped? NEVER. Same for being out late at night; it's dangerous, but you are NOT at fault for being RAPED. I hear my friend say, even after admitting to herself she was raped, that she could've done better. She thinks it was her fault for being that drunk, for being in his apartment, for trusting someone untrustworthy. It hurts me to hear these things, because even though they're not true I can't convince her no matter what I say. HE raped YOU, you didn't rape yourself no matter what you did beforehand. I hope you can learn to accept this.",False,False

Like wtf? Also she must‚Äôve clearly seen you were drunk and not in a normal state. Why would she abandon you randomly? Second: random 40 year old dude you have never seen before is another red flag. I think he dragged your unconscious body back to his flat. You see those random videos posted online of guys trying to take passed out drunk girls home and strangers stepping in to prevent that from happening. Since your friend obviously wasn‚Äôt there, I think this man stepped in and basically took you. File a police report and have them review the security cams in the subway!!",False,False

Just because he helped you in the morning doesn‚Äôt mean he isn‚Äôt also a terrible person. So sorry that happened to you and in no way is it your fault. There are resources out there to help you.
