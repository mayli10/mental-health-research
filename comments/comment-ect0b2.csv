Even without reading that it was a comment on a private snap I already knew this was a purposefully mean, targeted comment specifically meant to play on OP's insecurities from someone who knows her. Not to be stereotypical but I'd wager the person who sent it is more than likely female, similar age, most likely struggles with their own body image/weight/self esteem/something along those lines, and has some serious pent up resentment (maybe even envy?) towards OP. Absolutely no way this was someone who didn't realize they were being rude.  I'm sorry this happened, but you have a very catty snake in your circle somewhere. Honestly if I were you, I'd talk to your friends about it, the ones who would have the ability to post that, and see how they reply. At the least, all your other friends will side with you if they have any heart at all and will rightfully tell you how horrible that is and what a nasty jealous bitch whoever the commenter is, and maybe that will make them reevaluate their behavior even if they don't come forward and apologize. But that's just me, I can understand if you're too upset by such a rude comment to want to repeat it to others. You are not chubby, period. Whoever wrote that is clearly angry and you can feel the toxicity and resentment radiating off it. I know it hurts but it is 100% a them problem and not you.",False,False

I highly doubt this was a flippant thing said from a well intentioned perspective. There's a reason it comes off the way that it does and that's because whoever did it most likely meant for it to. People usually have tact. People are usually logical. People slip up and say bad things sometimes when they genuinely didn't mean for it to come out that way. But this is a blatantly mean thing to say, whether you suspect someone of having an ED or not.   The only possible way I could see this not being a purposefully mean comment is if this is the type of person that self-proclaims themselves a ""realistic"" and thinks they're just being blunt because they can't differentiate between constructive honesty and cruelty. Or the type of person that jokes a lot and thinks this is funny. As much as I'm trying not to play Devil's advocate here, I could see someone thinking this is clever on an Amy Schumer level.   I'm not saying this is the case. I really think that this person's intent was to hurt you and they most likely knew how. But the latter half of my comment is just coming from a different angle on the chance that I'm being too presumptuous since there are not particularly self-aware people and this person could be one of them. Either way, feel better soon, although know that'll be easier said than done.",False,False
