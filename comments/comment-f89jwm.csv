Normies see skinny people with ED's and think we're sO hEaLtHy, not seeing the physical/mental struggles. Or they see larger people with ED's and assume they're constantly/mindlessly eating, or praise them for losing weight in unhealthy ways. Again not seeing the physical/mental struggles.  I kind of hate the expression ""relationship with food."" The best way I can describe my relationship with food is codependent, and food emotionally manipulates me ;(",False,False
