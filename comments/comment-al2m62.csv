It’s just so very against every instinct I have! I did just order chia seeds which I should be able to manage, and protein powder. Going to keep oil in mind though in case I get really desperate.",False,True

I generally feel a lot better physically when I have a day and get some real calories in and lay off the speedy stuff. Plus it shut people up. I'm not trying to not lose because i psychologically can't do that, but it helps keep comments on your body away. Nuts and nut butters help beef up the calories and so does dried fruit. They keep things moving in the digestive department too. If it's gonna be a bunch of calories I at least keep it healthy and not inflammatory.",False,False
