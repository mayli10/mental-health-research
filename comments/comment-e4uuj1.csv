That makes me happier to hear that as we age the things that pressure us a lot when were younger will lessen. I get a lot of pressure from my family now in my early 20's as a newlywed to maintain appearance and health, and I still get concerns regarding my weight but not so bullying. I think at this point in college that people will just ignore you or act like you don't exist, maybe talk behind your back away from you if they think you're fat. But gosh was growing up here super hard. I can't be confident or feel pretty unless I'm really thin, and a size 4 sounds perfect. Honestly a 0-4 would be the greatest thing to have again. I'm especially concerned about entering the career world after graduation :/",False,True

When I was in elementary school and middle school, I was bullied mercilessly for my weight. Shit like people telling me I should just kill myself because no one would ever love someone as ugly as me. I got negative talk from my mother (who is very obese...) and my grandparents (older generation, also immigrants). I cried after going to the doctor's office once because of how forceful she was about me losing weight. I was like 11 or 12 years old, so that was really on my parents and not fair to scold a kid about.   Throughout my life I got a lot of positive reinforcement for losing weight, no one ever asked me how I did it or seemed to care. My first year of high school I had my first ""taste"" of an ED and fasted my way from a 30 BMI to a 27/28ish BMI, which was enough that people stopped making comments about my weight. I even had a very good looking boyfriend (like Keanu Reeves good looking) for a few months. When I was a kid/teen visiting Europe, people made comments to me or my parents about my weight. But it did seem more like concern than bullying.  I definitely have had the experience where I had much more trouble dating at an overweight BMI than a regular weight BMI, and I got way more positive attention when I was thinner (size US 4 but still nowhere near underweight). I have gained back a lot of weight (I'm low obese again), but I am also married and almost 30, which I think the world sees as like...my weight not being important anymore. I spent most of the past summer in Milan and parts of Spain, and while I think people are definitely more likely to make mention or criticize people's weight in the US, I did not get any of that directed at me now that I am past marriage age. Even my foreign relatives don't make comments about my weight anymore. I dance/do a sport that requires me to bare a lot of my body, and people are very accepting and positive about it (even if they judge me silently or think my body is gross). I think I am the only person who sees myself as not fitting in as a pole/exotic dancer because of my size/body.  This is a lot of back story, but I think there is definitely an age curve that comes with how people see your weight. It seems especially ironic that kids/young teens get it the worst because at that point it is really the parents' fault if a kid is overweight or obese since kids can't make their own food choices or play sports without adult supervision. I think there is also a big difference between being bullied and people just being rude about your weight. I think being thinner and more attractive could benefit me professionally, but I don't think being average-looking or chunky is a detriment.   I still really, really want to be thin though. So obviously there is something there.",False,False

Much of Europe, Eurasia, and Asia prefer thin and idolize the smaller you are. Societies there aren't afraid to tell you you're fat, thinness is a health thing, fat is seen as lazy, and you won't have as many opportunities. I moved to the US and had many negative experiences because I gained weight upon moving here from all of the changes. Having lived in many countries and traveled often this is the strangest experience about weight here, but the bullying was in the south east region of the US so it could be just that.   Kids and Teens are meaner but I noticed that the chubby considered would be bullied and not the moribidly obese or fat.  And depending on your social group, background, and person ideologies will be how you review weight.   What was your expeirence like? And I will check out the show, thanks!! :D",False,True

Kids and teens are meaner (or at least more open with how mean they are) than adults 2. Society seems to have really changed in regard to how fat people are treated and approached. Like I think about Chunk in the Goonies or Fat Monica in Friends, or the movie Shallow Hal, and like, those kinds of jokes seek really dated and inappropriate. There is still plenty of pressure to be thin in society, but socially I think shaming is really out. Plus way more people are overweight/obese now than they were in the 90s.   It’s kind of silly, but I think about the show Gilmore Girls really representing these sea change as well as how the meanness of kids fades with adulthood. Sure Rory and Lorelei are perfect looking, but Sookie and Babette and Miss Patty are all larger women who date/marry/have sex, and their weight is never the butt of any jokes. But then Paris, who is thin but not rail thin, is jealous of her athletic roommate who is goals thin.   This example was way too convoluted. I just think it has more to do with age and social norms changing than the difference between being overweight and obese.",False,False

I remember people saying I'm so close to being perfect I just had to lose a little more so maybe my brain was trying to rationalize irrational perceptions. I like what you said though and I feel like it's more realistic thinking. And I'm sorry about your grandmother, mine was hard on me too and always compared me to my cousin's and made me the least favorite. Thank you for your kindness. &lt;3",False,True

I have a BMI of 19-20 but I'm also 152cm so fat always looks more prominent on me :/   I can definitely see where you're coming from!! I feel like it's because when you're actually obese people don't feel like they have to say anything because you're already obese?? but being slightly overweight, it's as if people are trying to stop you being obese?? I don't really know if that makes any sense haha, sorry if it doesn't   I'm so sorry you had to experience that, I hope you're doing better &lt;3 sending love~",False,False
