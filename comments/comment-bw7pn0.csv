I can barely even ask my boyfriend for the vaguest support because im tired of hearing the disappointment and tiredness in his voice when he tells me eating is good. I dont wish i never had my ED, i just wish i never told anyone. Or that anyone could be 12% less of a piece of shit about it.",False,False

Not even a little. Do I feel sad and regretful for wasting 80% of my brainpower and effort on this disease? Absolutely. Who knows what kind of life I'd be leading if that energy was dedicated to other thoughts. I also feel quite angry that society rewards me A LOT for maintaining my underweight status. But am I ashamed that I have a mental health problem? Not even for a minute. I might find myself ashamed of things I've done over the years bc of it, but I'm not ashamed to have it.",False,False

I am lucky(??) that I carry my weight proportionately, though, because even when I was 230 my last therapist was shocked I was struggling with food. 230 pounds. At 5'3"". Somehow no one ever believed me when I told them those numbers since the lard is always evenly distributed. I have managed not to purge since I had some crazy dental work done that was so painful it kinda scared me out of doing more damage, but as someone who hasn't been a normal weight for a very long time, I really don't want to bring it up with, well, anyone. Some of my favorite restaurants hold weird memories for me from sneaking off to go yeet my delicious dinner. I guess this makes me bulimic, but I've never gone in depth enough with a doctor to get any sort of eating disorder diagnosis. The only times I've lost weight (even now, kinda :/) haven't ever really been healthy. I'm still a fat fuck so my weird eating habits and restrictions just look like someone on a diet, to most people. I wouldn't say I'm anorexic, by any means, but I've got a very bizarre, unhealthy relationship with food and my body image.   I guess what I'm trying to ramble on about is that none of this really makes sense to me, but I'm self aware enough to realize this just ain't right. But I'm too embarrassed to really share with anyone, and I even reeeeally like my current therapist. I sincerely hope this time around I'll really just get to a healthy size, stay exercising and eating well, and not keep obsessing over ever morsel going into my mouth, but only time will tell.",False,False

Just because you don't look it doesn't mean you don't suffer from it. Maybe the rest of the world only just knows the one image of the super skinny 'rexie' but all EDs are valid.

I also have depression and even though I'm more open about it people don't know I take meds for it.
