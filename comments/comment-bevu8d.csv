I‚Äôve learned to tell myself that my size 11 feet make me stable. üòÇ.    Being tall is a mixed bag, I love that my tdee is high but I lament that I can‚Äôt be a tiny size pant and be healthy. It‚Äôs stupid but I wish I could be a size 0 or 2 and be healthy. I can‚Äôt and I need to be ok with that. Sucks and some days it‚Äôs a struggle.",False,False

As a short-ish girl I've always found no matter how much I lose, I still don't look like I'm unhealthy at all (not what I should be aiming for really, but here we are), whereas I've felt if I were even a few inches taller, there'd be more of me for my fat to distribute to and I'd look so much slimmer and dainty. It's interesting to hear it from other sides though, I guess we're all wishing we were something else :(",False,False

I was at the gym yesterday and watching a typical spy movie with a beautiful actress who's an double-agent (lame). While watching, I was just thinking for a long time about another poster who was sad because she saw 2 pretty tall girls and was jealous of them even though the OP was 5'7"". I'm here at 5'3"" and I felt bad for myself. I wondered why I even bothered dieting and working out. I felt like I'm somehow at a disadvantage because in our society, taller women are considered more more beautiful, genetically blessed, elite, etc.  Then I thought about one of my current clients who is a rockstar and he's married to a tall AF former model. Like, if she was my height, I couldn't see them being together. I know I'm wrong, because women can be beautiful at any height and have their own advantages.  J/S the grass always seems greener on the other side.",False,False

I‚Äôm your same height and I absolutely hate it - I have huge legs and bigger shoulders than everyone else. Like, being tall isn‚Äôt just being the same width and stretching out like a noodle into oblivion (dear god, I wish), you‚Äôre bigger other ways too and it‚Äôs ass.

You get to have a TDEE above that of a guinea pig and the long legs but boys aren‚Äôt going to let their fragile masculinities keep em from dating you bc they don‚Äôt feel ‚Äú‚Äùmanly‚Äù‚Äù or whatever around you. also I think the grass is truly greener bc I wear a size 4 shoe and I constantly wish I could like stretch my toes out further.
