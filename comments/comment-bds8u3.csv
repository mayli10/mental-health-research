I’m sorry she did that to you. She probably doesn’t realize what a big deal it is but I know what you mean when you’re only getting thru the day knowing that this one specific food is waiting for you and you hype it up in your head. Ugh.,False,False

He used to eat everything we left in the fridge. He never got us anything, but he always got himself food and hid it in random places. I remember my brother and I making bets on who’ll find more hidden stuff.   It’s so fucked up honestly",False,False

Parents with eating disorders, especially food addiction or binging, are tricky because sometimes their lizard brains with justify behaviors that erode trust between them and their kids and then they end up blaming their kids, or wondering why their children have food issues.   When I was teenager I started hiding snack food, because my dad would eat every single crumb of any treat or snack that I bought myself if it was out in the open. Whenever my dad would find my stash he’d FREAK OUT and be so upset that I’d do that, and say I had a problem and he was worried and upset and horrified....then he’d also take it all, and eat all of it in one go, claiming the whole time that the food was either “crack”, or “not worth the calories” but stuffing himself with it either way. To this day he hasn’t made the connection that his behaviors are partially to blame for my ED, but then again he doesn’t see his eating habits as being disordered, only mine.",False,False

I have the same issue with my dad, he’s a food addict and will destroy an expensive pint of low cal protein ice cream, that I was planning to portion out over a month, in one go then be upset with me for bringing it into the house and “forcing him to” binge on it.   In response I started eating foods I knew he’d been saving. After some huge blowouts between us over it, we agreed to label any food we were specially saving, and for the most part it’s respected that you DO NOT eat someone else’s food if they’ve labeled it to not be eaten. It’s funny though, only the label will stop him. If I ask him verbally to not eat something but I forget to label it, he’ll eat it anyway, despite giving me verbal confirmation that he wouldn’t. With a label though, he’ll leave most things alone (except cookies, I could lock a batch of cookies in a safe and he’d tear into it like a grizzly bear).",False,False

Shes trying so hard to lose weight but no matter how much shes trying to restrain herself and go on a diet she always ends up binging on junk food. I'm still pissed off though, she knows I'm sensitive when it comes to food so why even do that??",False,True
