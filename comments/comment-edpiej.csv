Right now im 15 days away from going home (outpatient) and I have gained 6 kg (I was already thin before anorexia) but back to the point, I understand your worry since my Orthorexia turned to anorexia and now it’s Orthorexia again😣 I count macros and calories, walk 6 km a day, train sometimes when I feel like it and I eat frickin healthy.... (I’m 12) so please take control of your anorexia and don’t let it turn into Orthorexia. Be strong and take control of your life again!",False,False

There are a lot of experiences on all ends of the recovery spectrum and I’m sure the experience differs greatly depending on when you first got sick, how long it’s been etc... idk I just get bummed when I see someone writing it off as a possibility, sorry if this felt preachy or dismissive.",False,False

To all that are healing from anorexia: I went through recovery, went from 65lbs to 165lbs over the course of two years (I am 5'3""). At first, feeding my body felt unnatural and I had to force myself to do it, but eventually my body and mind worked in unison to refeed and nourish, and my appetite returned - with a vengeance! (Hence the 100lb weight gain). Eventually, my appetite normalized and after 5 years my body has finally returned to a healthy weight (125-130lbs). According to my nutritionist, this intense weight gain and an ultimate return to a normal weight is typical for those recovering from anorexia.  The road is long and hard, and bulimia and the temptation of relapse were definitely there, especially in the beginning. But changing your mindset for the betterment of YOUR life, YOUR future, is absolutely possible and so very vital. Much love to all of you. Life IS beautiful...Hugs to all...you've got this!!! 💜💜💜",False,False

First, my anorexia turned into bulimia. I tried to eat healthy and purged. This went on for a while, but slowly I stopped purging as much.  Then I stopped throwing up as much and started running. The weight came on during this time and I got to a healthy weight (on paper - I didn’t like it). Then the running got out of control. 20+ miles a day, tons of classes, stationary bike, etc.   One month ago I checked into treatment for overexercise and bulimia. It was hard seeing others who look like I used to before I restored. It was hard being the normal weight person. It was hard eating those meals. It’s been hard not exercising. I had to grit my teeth and just do it. You know what’s harder though? Being in the thick of the disorder. That hopeless feeling that you’ll never escape. The endless back and forth between wanting recovery and wanting to be sick.  For the first time in my 25 years with this disease, I feel like I can do it. I have another month of intensive outpatient and years of regular outpatient ahead of me. I had to finally admit that I couldn’t fix this on my own and that asking for help was the bravest thing I’d ever done. And, I only gained 1 pound in treatment despite not running 100+ miles a week. I actually have a metabolism again after eating regular meals and I’m not starving and binging. I had to see it to believe it.
