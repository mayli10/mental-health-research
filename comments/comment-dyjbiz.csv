It’s extremely dangerous!! I used to do it and would pass out after throwing up a few times. And it won’t even get everything up. It’s definitely not worth it tbh.,False,False

At our tv. Right next to the bathroom. So I spent an hour feeling full and nauseous as fuck and not even able to purge,False,False

I hope you’ll be ok. Like was already mentioned, the danger is probably not zero depending on your health, hydration, and electrolyte balance prior to chugging the salt water. The body fortunately has ways to process and excrete extra sodium, but if you’re feeling ill, consulting poison control or a medical professional would be prudent. Best wishes.",False,False

This can be quite dangerous, though. No one here could tell you if your safe or not in this situation. Might be better to phone a medical pro for advice and let them guide you. :(",False,False
