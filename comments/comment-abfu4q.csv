We were doing okay previously on this combination but then we moved right before the holiday season which are probably 2 of his biggest stressors.   Logically I know it has nothing to do with me and that it'll resolve itself soon now that the holidays are over. But it's easy to find excuses if you go looking for them. Especially once I've drank. ,False,True

It's just hard to listen to him talk about how he's worried about gaining too much and him getting insecure about how he looks as the weight redistributes. Also tbf I know logically that the not touching me part is due to his medication but since when are ED triggers logical lol. ",False,True
