You have a mental disorder. People aren't stupid for being depressed or whatever else. You are not immature for having food issues.

So I understand he is frustrated but no. I am shutting down this down. You are not immature. You didnt choose this. It's not like you woke up one day and decided ""you know what's cute? Being miserable with food issues."" You need some kindness in your life. Unfortunately, that can be hard to get from other people. So please be kind to yourself. You do deserve it. ❤️",False,False
