Having the right therapist for you is the most important thing in my mind. I went through many to find the one that fits me best.,False,False

Talk to your ED therapist. Ask her to do this differently and be open about how it's affecting you.  You can look at losing weight safely under supervision, if you want to for healthy reasons. Same goes for if you'd wanted to become vegan, or get into bodybuilding.  But this doesn't seem like that.",False,False

If you and your doc agree that it is a good idea for you to lose some, they might be willing to look over your meal plan or refer you to a dietician.  When I went through this process they really encouraged me not to get too serious or meticulous about it. No weighing food, limited measuring (I would measure out tablespoons of butter or salad dressing but they encouraged me not to measure out less caloric things like half a cup of cereal or milk, etc). I weighed in once a week, at the university clinic because I wasn't keeping a scale at home for mental health reasons. If you have specific things that used to trigger you I'd guess they'll tell you to avoid those too.  I also think it will be important to practice mindfulness if you go through with this, like being aware of how it makes you feel and stopping immediately if you notice old ED patterns.",False,False

If you do choose to look into it, OP, just keep an eye on it and be honest with yourself to watch for warning signs and make sure it doesn't turn into another self destructive obsession. If it begins to, take a break from it to step back and re-evaluate. I would def talk to professionals openly, about why/what kind of diet you're thinking, that are aware of your current problems as well and get their input.",False,False
