He didn’t give his exact weight since he usually just says “me and the scale don’t get along” (he’s a recovered anorexic I believe) but he said that he DIDN’T gain 35lbs pretty reassuringly. He followed this up by saying that there hasn’t been ton of research about calories and fat when it comes to calorie challenges. It made me feel a lot better",False,False

But not today damn you.   There’s all these YouTube videos of people eating 5k calories a day and going back to their original weight in just a few days because of the body being cool. When I read other threads the advice is don’t worry about it just don’t binge multiple days in a row aka me ,False,False

You will maintain or slow the rapidity of your weight loss, depending on the severity of your restriction.   At least that's how it works based on what I've read.",False,False
