My weight is so high I can’t even announce it here. I lost 80 lbs a couple years ago and freaking gained it all back in a year-long binge.  I need to finish re-losing that 80 to even look remotely human, then keep going for a long, long time.",False,False

I’m the type to always go to extremes with my diet. That’s part of the reason I’ve struggled with an ED so long. If I fuck up once, I’m binging the whole day. If I work out, I’m working out until I literally can’t move. It sucks.",False,True

I try to read more information on proper diet health and look at research and shit but all it does is make me feel more ashamed of myself for doing the wrong thing.,False,False
