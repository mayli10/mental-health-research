What i *want* is some stupid ed fantasy about being tiny and light and fitting my hands around the biggest part of my thigh. But I also know that it's disgusting and I shouldn't do that. I can't do what I want, because in the end- what i want will kill me. I have to do the opposite of what i want, which is try to be at least semi healthy and feed my body enough that I don't keel over. Hell, i've already made myself anemic. It's like positive/negative reinforcement. They don't know they're doing harm...",False,True

Being able to lose fat requires discipline, but so does being able to build up muscle - sometimes almost as much. People are good at some things and not as good at others and figure out how to manage the things you're not good at has always been the trick. Figure out what you want from your body to maintain a healthy life and make that your goal instead of letting outside feedback distract you. Yes, it's harder than it sounds, I know. There's people out here who believe in you, though.",False,False

People will probably just respond by saying they wish they could lose weight so easily and then put that conversation to rest.,False,False
