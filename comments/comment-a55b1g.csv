I hate her as a mother though. I dont love her, and I think she‚Äôs blind as to how the way she acts is wrong. But I know she will figure out a way to make it living hell for me if I do remove her from my life. And try to stay on her good side.... nothing more.  ",False,True

FML I can't remember the name of it right now. But I think you need them lmao. Your mom sounds like a fucking piece of work. And they might be able to help you ease into no contact (because imo that's what it sounds like you need),False,False

I can relate to this post 150%. My mother has also always had a negative view of her body since I can remember. I have a memory from when I was ~8 years old and my mom was holding her belly in the mirror and she looked at me and said ""you did this to me."" so like, no wonder I have an ED lol.  I just got put on priority status for housing (fleeing familial abuse) and I'm really hoping I can leave soon. Because she's made my life awful and I honestly sometimes wonder if it'll kill me  The worst part is that I feel guilty for leaving because I love her as my mother, but dislike her greatly as a person üòï",False,False

I have no idea how to get her out of my life..... But she's so stressful to be around and if I removed her from my life I would 100% end up losing my little brother and my step-dad as well, because she is an expert in manipulating the people around her, and convincing people who's bad and who's good.  I thought that my dad was an asshole, a bad person, and a bad father for many years... Until I grew up and realized that my mom was really the bad one. My dad has always tried his best, but she turned us against him and did everything to make it impossible for him to take care of us the way he wanted to. And that makes me so ashamed now. I've treated the only one who always took care of me so badly. But at least I woke up and grew up, and now I just try to treat him well and show him that I want him in my life..... ",False,True

It‚Äôs tough and sometimes lonely, and there were some bad years, but it overall for the best. I stopped self-harming, stopped being suicidal and legitimately turned my life around by not having her in it. You got this!!",False,False
