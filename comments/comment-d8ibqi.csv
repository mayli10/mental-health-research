He said it doesn't have anything to do with calories unless you want it to, which I think just means have an idea of what you want to eat and when. Even if you just want to stick to having 3 meals a day, it's just having a plan.",False,False

For me it just means prepping my meals on Monday for the week and not ordering fries while I’m bartending.    I agree that dieting can be restrictive and unsustainable, but a diet is just a way of eating.",False,True

Like, people who completely cut out either carbs or fat. Totally unhealthy. Even stuff like keto is unhealthy for the average person. Keto was designed for people with a certain illness that causes seizures. It was restrictive in order to prevent a worse health problem from occurring. It's not healthy for ordinary people to eat a restrictive diet. What's best is to follow a personalized diet in which you consider how various foods, nutrients, etc. influence how you feel and work around those things while still getting all of the necessary vitamins, minerals, fats, proteins, and carbs you need to function efficiently and effectively.",False,False

Even though he comes off as brash and I don’t eat up everything he sells, his “just do it” attitude and hard75 challenge are dope!! I’m gonna start up the challenge again.
