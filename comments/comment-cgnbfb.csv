(Ex: 350 calories for a burger / pizza = fine, 250 calories for 2 slices of bread= not fine). I have to be able to justify eating it or its not worth the stress.  Any food that is just ""sprung"" on me no matter what it is, I deem unsafe. Doesnt matter if its a black coffee and salad or a whole cake. I dont like the anxiety of not knowing, on top of being hella neurotic outside of food unplanned things tend to upset me when i dont have time to think about it first. It gets worse when im out in public and can't get out of not eating because I dont want to seem unwell (even though most everyone I know knows I am anyway, its still really embarassing for me).",False,False

Unfortunately with my job I go to a lot of work dinners and I fucking hate   it. My boss thinks it’s a reward to be brought to a  Michelin star   restaurant but all I can think about is how many miles will I have to run the   next day.   I always eat by myself cause I am   sick of the comments around my portions and the need to justify myself to   comments of “you’re a picky eater” or “is that all your eating”.   This Friday I have a leaving party for a colleague. We worked together for   the last 11 years. I am freaking out in case they have finger food. I am   taking Friday off and I will go for a ten mile run (I like even numbers.) Then   I will go to the party. I know I will end up binge drinking though.   A few people won’t be drinking and they will be asked once, do they want a   drink. I know I am going to be asked a 10-20 times to have food and I am   dreading the moment the cake comes out.  I know if I wasn’t pressured   into eating I won’t end up binge drinking. Funny thing is I am going to leave   this well paying job and take another job where no one knows me. I can fast, eat   my small portions &amp; exercise in peace. I can’t understand why EDs aren’t   treated with the same  professionalism  as substance or other addictions.",False,False

But I think this intertwines just perfectly with me just wanting to be in control about something. Food.   Weight is also only a second to that. It a means to measure if I am doing good. But I don't have a goal weight. I don't even feel much better about the weight loss. Now my body is attractive to other people and I kinda hate that.   I think the only reason I fell so deep this time is that I live alone. But I also really love nice food and the reason I am still eating something is that I can choose. I can choose to eat some rice with sauce. To eat bread the other day. To eat a piece of pizza every month or so. To be able to chose myself. To not have to eat the same schedule every day like I did in ip years ago. I hated that. It made food even more of a task. A waste of calories. I like food, I really like food. That's why I punish myself by not allowing it.",False,False
