A few years pre-anorexia, I did outpatient treatment for EDNOS, and I swear, getting on a reasonable meal plan with moderate (not excessive) exercise did much more for my weight, health, and general self-esteem than the binge/restrict cycle ever did. Like, if I'm ever going to be ""stuck"" at a normal weight, I'd much rather be there by virtue of healthy behaviors than disordered ones.  That said, restriction can fuck you up at any weight. Blood sugar issues, fainting, lightheadedness, headaches, and digestive distress can happen anytime. And the dangers of purging are well-documented.  Another fun fact: I developed not only IBS, but IBD. I have no proof that this was caused by 15 years of disordered eating — and mostly subclinical, at that—, but I am sure that wreaking havoc on my gut microbiota cannot have helped.  Tread carefully.  Edit: Forgot to mention osteopenia/osteoporosis. You'll never know you have it until a doctor sends you for a DEXA scan. It's not great finding out you have the bones of a 70-year-old in your twenties.",False,False
