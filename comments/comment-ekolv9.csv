Lots of walking; I personally dislike working out right after a binge because of the discomfort so walking is nice. Coffee for mild lax effect (make sure you don't drink too much), also sleeping/lying on your side will make digestion easier -&gt; faster.   For the mental aspect - I personally am not in recovery atm so I can't say much except don't stress it too much and stay safe with the dangers of purging/laxes/overexercising out there. Like I said, walking is great for post-binge and will make you feel a lot better than doing 1000 crunches.",False,False
