And honestly the downsides of seeking treatment are far less then the downsides of untreated mental health issues. If you can see a therapist once a week now that's far better than a couple years from now being forced into an involuntary hold. It's always better to treat any illness as soon as possible.,False,False

Untreated EDs (untreated mental health in general) can become something that has a significant impact on every single day of your life. Seeking help earlier can also mean that a lower level of care is effective. For example, there’s a big difference between seeing a therapist weekly versus hospital inpatient or an extended residential stay.   My understanding of **organ transplant** eligibility is that they’re looking out for significant current health/lifestyle issues that would increase the odds of a poor transplant outcome. So, that’s going to be somewhat independent of whether someone is seeking treatment for an issue. An alcoholic whose liver is failing but who is still drinking isn’t going to be a great candidate, for example.   **Gun ownership** regulations can vary by state so if that’s something that matters to you, your best bet is to research the laws for your state. The ability to own a gun is mostly going to come into play if you’re assessed as a “danger to yourself or others” or put on some sort of involuntary hold. When I was put on an involuntary psych hold in California (5150 and 5250) I had to sign a document waiving my right to own/purchase a gun for one year. It could be contested in court but since it was only a year and since at the time my only reasons for owning a gun would be bad ones...I was fine with signing. In comparison, I’ve also been on involuntary holds in Nebraska and laws about gun ownership have never been mentioned.   **Health insurance** is admittedly a confusing mess here in the US, and plans vary so wildly that it’s hard to say for sure what accessing care now and in the future would be like for you. I’ve changed health insurance several times since my first psych hospitalization and my medical record has never seemed to effect the availability of plans or my rates. Inpatient and residential treatment is insanely expensive if insurance won’t cover it (potentially thousands of dollars a day) and insurance companies are often pretty stingy about when they’ll cover those levels of care and for how many days. Even with insurance covering the bulk of things, I still paid a few thousand dollars until I hit my ‘out of pocket maximum’. Fortunately, getting individual therapy and medication management has been a relatively affordable option on all the plans that I’ve had. You have to jump through the hurdle of finding someone that’s “in network” and also a good person for your needs, but it’s usually been $20-$40 a visit for me. My plans haven’t put caps on how many therapy appointments per year I can have, but I have heard of plans that do this. There’s supposed to be parity between mental and physical health care in insurance plans, but that’s not necessarily the reality.   If the ED is something that’s having a significant impact on your life, I think it’d be worth looking into what options would be available to you. &lt;3 Best wishes.",False,False

If they’re an ignorant turd, possibly. If they’re not stupid and realize it’s actually necessary, they’ll likely just see if there’s a med that’s workable. Or just leave it be.   Going through p much anything that’ll cost insurance a lot, especially on a consistent basis (like psychiatry doesn’t always “count” because it is *so* much cheaper than IP) is what makes it difficult. Essentially they’ll know they’d be losing money with covering you. If you’re just getting therapy and meds, it’ll likely be fine. Again, depends on the provider.",False,False

And insurance is completely up to what insurance you personally go through; mine wouldn’t up the rates, but there is a good chance it would boot me out early in the treatment (they go off of physical health stats, not mental. Also if you don’t improve after the treatment or improve too slowly, they won’t cover it again) and it would be very, very difficult to change providers due to having a “pre-existing condition” because Assholes.
