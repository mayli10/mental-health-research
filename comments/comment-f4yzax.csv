But remember that a big part of anorexia is having a sense of control. Having little to no control over housing makes total sense as a trigger.  Not sure what the options are where you are, but is there a social worker you can talk to and find out if any free counseling/ mental health services are available to you?",False,False

They are so much more than just about food- so I’m not surprised that being in such a rough spot isn’t altering the disorder. I really hope things get better for you soon, and I think you have a lot of insight and that is a powerful ingredient for change and healing",False,False
