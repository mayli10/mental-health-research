I’ve always struggled with binge eating, especially emotional eating, and restrictioning. I think your plan is great, I would also start doing some exercising, nothing too intense, because IME it made me hungrier. Also, find things you can do when a food craving pops up. I’m 5’3’’ and down 50 pounds. I’m too embarrassed to say my current weight, but my goal weight is 115, maybe lower. ",False,False

I binge ate myself to class 3 obesity (highest BMI 46.3.) And now I have been diagnosed (3 years) and I am more cognizant of my choices and triggers. Down to just overweight at this point and not far to go until I'm at a normal BMI. It's amazing what just being diagnosed did for my mentality.,False,False

I get where you're coming from. Not sure if its dysmorphia or what, but I don't think I look good bc I have no muscle, just fat. I have a family with busy schedules so getting to the gym is damn near impossible.  I'd love for you to keep me posted on how vyvanase works out for you. Is vyvanase a stimulant? I have to keep caffeine and ephedrine low bc they intensify my anxiety.  What was recommended to you in therapy for BED? My current therapy is DBT for BPD and I'm wondering how to bring this up with my therapist without getting grilled. She's a safe person to talk to, but I feel like I'm just adding another layer of bullshit on top of an already massive pile. I want to be able to handle it myself. But I said that about depression and it turned out to be a personality disorder, so idk. ",False,True

Though I'm a little fatter than you, and I was overweight for most of my ED.  I have lost some weight, and I do have some occasional purging behaviors that might help in that, but I've had at least 7 straight years of BED and only one of bulimia, and I've been trying to lose weight for four years with minor success, so yep, I consider myself to have BED.  I've been trying to treat this for years, and a new psychiatrist I just started seeing two days ago was nice enough to let me try vyvanse. I'm only on 30 mg and my next appointment isn't until like three months, and yesterday was my first day on it, but goddamn do I love it already.  I tried phentermine last month for 11 days and didn't have a single binge (record amount of time for me [I quit because it's probably really unhealthy for me and I think I got it from a sketchy online doctor]), so that's why I thought vyvanse would work for me despite never trying any other medications.   Though, one day is definitely not enough time to know if I like it, maybe try that?",False,False
