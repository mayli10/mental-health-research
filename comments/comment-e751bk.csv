I definitely already knew the first one but for some reason it dawned on me like a piece of magic information I've never seen before. I really appreciate this, thank you and I wish you well too in continuing to recover",False,True

Restricting and even losing weight has never brought me genuine, long-term happiness.   \- the more I restrict, the more I'll binge. And I'm terrified of bingeing! I'd been gaining some weight from a binge-restrict cycle, so sometimes I tell myself that my 'recovered set point' weight might even be lower than what I'd weigh if I endless try to restrict and hence endlessly continue to bingeing.   \- I should think of my own values -- not the ED's! I value kindness, courage, health, etc. It's only the ED that's obsessed about numbers and appearance. That's not me. And that's not the life I'll have to live.   \- it's possible to rewire my brain through deliberately doing  things that are against disordered urges. for example, I used to be terrified by peanut butter, but I've been letting myself have some during breakfast and it's gradually getting easier each time I do it. I want to try this for my other food rules/fears as well.   \-  if it's tough, it's probably working!!  \- not weighing myself.  \- wearing comfortable clothes -- can't stress this enough!!  I also recommend follow recovered/recovering people on social media!  I personally love Tabitha Farrar and Megsy Recovery -- they're on youtube.   all the best!! &lt;3",False,False

I know that I should stop counting calories but it will probably be one of the last steps I take. this is my third time round with a relapse, I've been a healthy weight while counting calories and I've been underweight, my goal is to one day not count anymore, but that feels incredibly distant. anyway, thank you again so much, your support and tips are really helpful!",False,True

If you do, letting go of that and just eating whatever your body wants/ until your body is satisfied is something that could help you. If you feel like you‚Äôre doing the wrong thing it‚Äôs probably because that‚Äôs what your ED wants you to feel.Not you. It wants you to feel like recovery and eating enough food is bad because it needs starvation to survive and thrive. Don‚Äôt listen to it. I also felt like shit when I started eating again. It was like immediately when I started going against my ED it made things hard for me. I saw myself as HUGE. I felt like shit too. My body dysmorphia was super bad. In reality I wasn‚Äôt huge. At all. It was my ED trying to get me back by making me feel like eating enough=feeling like shit.   Sending you hugs and support. You got this!üíñ",False,False
