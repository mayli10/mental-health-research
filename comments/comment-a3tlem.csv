There are very few treatment centers in the US and even fewer health professionals that actually specialize in it. As long as you do your research, you can find someone who can help you and hopefully properly diagnosis you!! It’s funny I ran away from my diagnosis for a very long time because I felt I was just exaggerating everything and I didn’t have a problem. But some days it really helps when I don’t understand why I’m crying over food / feel guilty about eating / whatever disordered behavior in engaging in. 😂",False,False

This might not make sense but at least having a label would be something final, like a validation that it’s not all in my head (even though technically it is lol) or like I’m making things up for attention. But I don’t want to specifically ask “hey wanna DX me?” Just not sure how to go about it. Thanks for answering 💜",False,True

Like you said with one doctor acting like certain behaviors are normal and the other telling you you have a full blown eating disorder. It’s all just confusing. Thank you for taking the time to answer 💚,False,True

Like okay I fit under this category, now I know I’m not just imagining things or making things up. ",False,True

She told me that i was anorexic but i didn’t believe her. I did an assessment for treatment and got diagnosed as anorexic by the clinician.   On a side note, my pcp isn’t very well versed in eating disorders to diagnosis them because when i first told him about my eating habits he said they were normal. LOL. when i came back to him to get testing for my disordered eating, he was surprised and told me to go to a psychiatrist. 🤦🏿‍♀️🤷🏿‍♀️",False,False

I went to my GP at 16 and she asked all the questions and sent me to a psychologist, but I don't remember her opening the DSM and saying 'you're bulimic'. ",False,False
