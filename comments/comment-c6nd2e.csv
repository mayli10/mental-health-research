People who aren’t disordered don’t spend a lot of time thinking about their weight, and don’t realize when they gain 5 lbs in a year... then they gain another 5 and another 5 each year. They might passively notice that their clothes don’t fit quite as well, but don’t think anything of it because the gain is slow and incremental. Plus there’s kind of an unconscious motivation to brush t off because no one wants to think “oh shoot, I’m getting fat!” Then at some point it hits them, maybe medical advice or maybe they just wake up one day with clear eyes. This is very common for midlife adults who have never spent much time thinking about food and weight. Their external behavior is kind of disordered, but they don’t necessarily have the underlying disordered thought patterns (though of course some do).",False,False

Instead of doing that they continued to eat. This shows that they are allowing their habit of caving to food cravings to negatively impact their health. It is not healthy to be overweight yet they continued to eat too much food despite knowing they probably shouldn't.    I guess the exception would be someone who is overweight because they HAD a poor relationship with food and has fixed their relationship but is still losing the weight they gained. That may be the exception.,False,False

Not morbidly obese, but most people that are 10, 20, 30 pounds overweight are that way because they just eat a little too much for their activity level. They gain weight from portions that are a little too big, an extra snack or dessert here and there, or going out to eat/drinking alcohol a little too often. It's so easy to gain weight in the Western world that it's super easy to end up overweight without binge eating or eating unhealthy junk all day.",False,False

Fat people have it ""rough"", because for the most part no one has ever ""taught"" them about the single most destructive thing they put into their bodies. Something that even most of you ignore and look past. Liquid Calories.  Would you believe me if I told you that you consumed nearly 1,000 calories a day in liquids alone? Most of us are NOT drinking black coffee, that cream and sugar? Gulping down 300ish calories to start your day! We all know soft drinks and fruit juices are disgustingly bad for you, but there is so much more that we consume without even realizing it.  Now, let's bring up another deadly combination. Carbohydrates and aspartame. Did you know that fake sugar found in, well, almost everything ""diet"" completely nukes your digestive system and slows your metabolism to a near grinding halt? Combine that with heavy carbs that you body breaks down into sugars and well you basically have a cake sitting in your stomach for half the day.   We are disgusting pigs as humans now. Access to food has never been like this, EVER. You've never been able to get literally every single cultures food choices under a single roof before, but now we can. Our options are wide open to our flavor pallets, but no one really pays attention to what they are eating. There is a good solid reason why the 1900s ""fattest man alive"" looks like your average 12 year old American child now. When you destroy your body with processed foods, don't be surprised when you're unhealthy and struggling to figure out why.  Meat, greens, proteins, etc you get the deal. Eat natural. Cook your meals. Set time out of your day to take care of yourself. If your fridge is full of crap, we both know where it'll end up, the toilet 30 minutes later. But, force yourself to cook every meal, and cook small portions with NO LEFTOVERS.",False,False
