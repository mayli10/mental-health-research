Instead, it says something like ""error backlog at capacity."") It tends to do this every couple of months or so. I've heard that people will try to email the devs to say that peach is down, and that the app is back up relatively quickly after they get the email. I think the dev behind DogBot is one of the last peach devs still semi-active, but I'm not sure. So don't worry too much if there's a peach outage; just send an email to the devs and they'll fix it.",False,False
