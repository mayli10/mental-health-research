I have reason to suspect her mom/my grandma was too, and passed on the mindset to her. And she's become more explicit/brazen in describing or explaining or letting us witness her disordered habits as we've  gotten older, but when I or my siblings tried to point out the disorder behind it all, she waves it off as a generation thing. ""This was normal when I was a kid, the fact you think *this* is what an eating disorder looks like is exactly why everyone your age is fat!""  I'm so grateful that education about and awareness of EDs has increased enough to I and all of my siblings are able to identify it in our mom, but the cultural focus really remains on young people having EDs. The idea of EDs being so deadly that if you had one when you were young you either died from it or recovered, not accepting that people can and so live with EDs for *decades.* The idea that behaviors we recognize as disordered in young people are waved off as ""they grew up in a different time"" for older people.  Like, as a normal-weight bulimic man, I'm glad that increased awareness has included the message of ""anyone can have an ED"" in the sense of not just women have EDs and even not just underweight people have EDs/anorexia is not the only ED. But for the love of Christ can we extend it to *anyone* can having an eating disorder?

There will certainly be cases of classical eating disorders, but I think the majority of eating and weight problems  among are unintended and have a different cause then in younger people.   When people get older the ability to taste and smell, and feelings of hunger and thirst often decrease.   Loss of a partner can also be a big factor. Imagen having dinner together for more than 50 years and suddenly having to shop for food alone, cook for one, and sit at the table next to a quiet empty chair.  When meals were always a ""moment together"" I can imagine some people rather skip it than to be reminded of it.  Other factors can be problems with jaws, chewing or swallowing, depression due to loneliness, medication (loss of appetite or nausea) or difficulties buying and preparing food.

In all honesty? When she calls me from time to time, I am terrified it's her husband calling to tell me she's passed.

She was literally on her death bed, struggling, seemed to be spiraling out of control... yet had to fly half way across the country for a program months later, that ended up not even being a good fit, and traumatizing her more.  I was helping her look for treatment though (we met through a support group so we're quite open and I try to help her within reason if I healthfully can) and in her area? If you were 25 or younger and struggling, you could basically get residential, php, top, nightly top, etc., treatment programs, with scholarships. But once you turn that *magical number of 26*? You're on your **own**. It makes me really sad, because ED's don't just magically go away, if you don't tend to them, and/or the other factors causing them! They are - like you said - the most deadly of mental illnesses, yet so often neglected.  Ironically? EDNOS/OSFED is the most deadly (or at least was, the last time I checked) - not because of the physical risk factors of Ed behaviors.... but because people are able to ""get away"" with more extreme behaviors/habits/etc., due to the fact that professionals dismiss anybody who isn't stick thin/emaciated as ""healthy"".
