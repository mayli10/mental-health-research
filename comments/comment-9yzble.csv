For me I make sure I keep my protein up when I restrict. Last time I got down to my current weight I just cut everything and I was weaker for it. Now I keep my protein around 130g a day to avoid the wasting and the rest of my cal are carbs for energy. I'm still getting bony and losing strength but it's a lot better then last time.,False,False
