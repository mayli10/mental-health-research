Like your back/shoulder muscles atrophy (esp if you lose a lot of weight quickly?), and it can lead to a hunched posture.",False,True

I try not to hunch that much anymore but I always slip back into doing it. idk if it is an ED thing for me,False,False

My mum/friends are always reminding me to relax and put my shoulders down but it‚Äôs almost a subconscious thing I have of hunching over my stomach while sucking in my tummy that I think subconsciously just makes me feel smaller idk? Definitely gets much worse when I‚Äôm anxious or in tricky social situations. It‚Äôs pretty weird lol glad I‚Äôm not the only one with this!   PS. Who is this cryptic TS in your post???,False,False

I think it might have something to do with weak muscles or something? Just a hunch (lol),False,False

It is definitely not a natural thing I started doing it for that reason.,False,False

I have rounded shoulders which I'm 90% positive is from being a gymnast from age 5 to 14. Apparently it's common with gymnasts. The one time I had a massage I noted to the therapist during our brief pre-massage consult that my muscles around my shoulders are pretty tight and she was like, ""mmhmm ok"", and when we actually got to the massage she did say, ""wow your shoulders are pretty tight!"". I was like yea gurl I know.  I have tight chest muscles too.   I'm very self-conscious about my posture and actively have to remind myself to roll my shoulders back and try to bring my shoulder blades almost to touch but in my natural relaxed state they are hunched. I hate it. :/",False,False
