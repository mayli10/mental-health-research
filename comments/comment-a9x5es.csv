I feel successful when I see the number go down, and itâ€™s reinforced by almost everyone around me since Iâ€™m still at a (low) normal BMI. My mom is happy Iâ€™m losing weight, my sisters are jealous, I get compliments from random strangers sometimes and that all feels nice",False,True

This is my ultimate self-discipline test. There are so many things I hate about myself but all of them are intangible, self-disciplinary changes. This is the one I can see and feel the success from.",False,False

My ED actually makes me feel extremely out of control. Being a slave to calorie counting, forcing myself to take stimulants every day to control my appetite, if not then uncontrollable binges, the compulsion to purge, yuck lol. But I have a very ""no pain no gain"" (or in this case, loss) attitude towards it and at the end of the day in addition to being able to validate myself by saying ""I'm skinny"" with confidence I've also reaped a lot of social rewards from dropping the weight (the common privileges given to ""attractive"" women in society). Personally I think having the success mindset makes it way harder to stop! Because you've spent so much time seeing pounds lost as an accomplishment :(",False,False
