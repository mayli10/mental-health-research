I have thrown out hundreds of dollars worth of food. Some I made, some I bought and couldnâ€™t sleep at night knowing it was in my house. I canâ€™t even throw it away in my normal garbage because Iâ€™ll literally crawl in and eat it out of the trash. So I have to throw it away OUTSIDE. My god. ",False,False

Or if I manage to eat any of it Iâ€™ll have like a 1/4 cup of it before I donâ€™t want it anymore. Waaaay to often I meal prep in an attempt to ensure that I stick to recovery but then end up never touching them and having to empty out a bunch of containers from the fridge constantly. I love cooking but I think Iâ€™m really craving some idealistic picture of enjoying food and not having an ed than the actual food itself. Like every day I imagine myself going home, sitting down, and enjoying this delicious healthy meal that I made, but when it comes down to it it just sits there on the plate mocking me for not having the strength.

Yesterday I made a mug pizza from a recipe I found on Pinterest. I made the whole thing, and it turned out great! Taste wise, not so sure. I just played around with it using my fork.
