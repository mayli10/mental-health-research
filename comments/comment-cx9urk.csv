I really appreciate hearing how people handled such large life events with eating disorders since they consume a person so.   I‚Äôve always hoped that if I got pregnant I would take care of myself for the baby‚Äôs sake, but I worry that I won‚Äôt due to the lack of control you have when being consumed by an eating disorder.",False,True

I got pregnant for the first time when I was 20. I had been recovering slowly but surely from my ED, was at a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù weight but still ate very little and my diet was limited to a few foods. Had four miscarriages that year. Didn‚Äôt know why, doctors couldn‚Äôt figure it out. Blamed it on myself, on my ED, on my fucked up eating habits. Have never hated myself more.   Age 22, carried a baby girl to 34 weeks. She was born the congenital defects and died when she wasn‚Äôt three months old. We found out it was because of a defect in my gametes and there was nothing I could‚Äôve done to prevent my daughter‚Äôs death. I still blamed myself and hated myself and absolutely spiraled into a bizarre pattern of behaviors that, looking back, might‚Äôve been a mild psychosis. I had no sense of time or even where I was most of the time. I binged a lot and would cry until I puked. Once the ordeal of my daughter‚Äôs sickness, death, and funeral was over I started seeing a therapist and managed to crawl out of the little hellhole I‚Äôd made myself and sort of receded into a numb state. I don‚Äôt remember a lot about this time.   She 24, I found out that I can safely get pregnant through IVF. I literally jump at the opportunity. We do one failed round of IVF but I manage to retain my sanity for the next round, which is successful. I was obsessed with eating healthfully during this pregnancy. I sought out a dietician to advise me on pregnancy nutrition and paid for it out of pocket. I followed that plan to the fucking letter for thirty eight weeks. No cheat days, ever. I was convinced that any deviation would kill my baby. I thought I was doing well, by I can tell now that this was very very disordered.   My son was born healthy at 38 weeks. Doctor said he was ‚Äúperfect.‚Äù His birth was one of the few proud moments in my life. I hate that some of the pride came from how ‚Äúgood‚Äù I was with my eating habits during my pregnancy. This disorder really can‚Äôt let me have anything, huh?   I do well mentally and physically for the next two-ish years. My ‚Äúbaby body‚Äù bothers me a little but I can ignore those feelings by throwing myself into being a mom. I can hyperfocus on being a perfect mom now, and I don‚Äôt have to worry about how much I do or don‚Äôt eat. When my son is two, my husband and I get custody of his sister‚Äôs 18 month old son, then two months later we get her newborn daughter. I love them as my own. Things continued to go well.   I‚Äôm not sure what triggered my relapse. I think the constant combination of feeling fat at pool parties and feeling heavy and slow when I play with my kids and being bombarded with MLM weight loss shit all over my social media might‚Äôve done it. It started off as a ‚Äúquick fast.‚Äù Like ‚ÄúI‚Äôll eat below 500 for a week and then I‚Äôll be where I want and I‚Äôll be done.‚Äù It never goes that way, does it? Fuck.   That was a lot to unload. This is maybe the first time I‚Äôve thought all of this through chronologically in the perspective of my ED. Sorry if this is too much. My kids are now 4, almost 4, and 2. They‚Äôre not going to remember their mom as a half-person who cared more about food and her weight than them. I won‚Äôt let it happen. Guess I‚Äôll be searching for a new therapist tomorrow.   Again, sorry if this is too much.",False,False

It was literally the thing I knew I wanted most in the world from a young age. Originally I was told I couldn't have them, so when it DID happen, my ED brain kinda called a truce during the pregnancies. It always hit back full force after delivering, but it let me be during. I will say that it helped that I carried very well (esp with my first) and didn't really show/gain much until about 6 months in.  Both times I got pregnant were during what I refer to as my ""disordered eating times"", rather than my ""eating disorder times"". Where I was still restricting, still keeping a deficit, etc, but technically eating more 'normal' than when I'm in the middle of a ED period.  Kids are 3 and 4.5 now. I still yoyo back and forth between DE and ED periods. I work very hard to keep my weird behaviors from them and to make sure that they eat healthy and well, in order to develop a healthy relationship with food. My brain is still crazy and fucked, but it let me have my kids in peaceü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.",False,False
