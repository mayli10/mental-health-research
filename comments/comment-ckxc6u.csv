Ugh my friend isn't really a normie, they have their own eating issues but they're not consciously trying to restrict, but they'll still be like ""oops I haven't eaten all day teehee"" or ""oops the only thing I've eaten in the past couple of days is one bowl of pasta teehee"" and I'm sitting here like... I WISH restricting could be that thoughtless for me. Like when I'm restricting, even if I'm enjoying it, I'm thinking about it ALL THE TIME. I'm thinking about what I'm going to eat next, and when, and what I'll do to compensate. guh. I know it's kind of fucked up to be jealous of someone who has acknowledged their eating patterns are messed up but...  Also, on the flipside, normies be like ""ugh I've hardly eaten at all"" and they've eaten at least 1200 calories of food and it's not even dinner time yet. And they still don't gain any weight. Like, I'm so glad this is working for you, but dhgadfmghadfgm when I think ""I've hardly eaten at all"" I've usually eaten like 3k worth of food LOL",False,False
