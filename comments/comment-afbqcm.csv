The worst part is I work a night shift DESK job. 12hrs from 6pm to 6am and by the end of my shift, doesn't matter if I walk around, stand for a bit, or wear compression socks, my feet and ankles swell. I do know that it's mainly because I consume diet coke throughout the night and day. But it's the only thing that I can drink to curb my appetite. Uuuuuuuughhhhh. I hate bodies.   But thanks for the insight! It does make me feel a bit better. ",False,False

Add on top of that eating (as you should be) and sodium intake which all cause some fluid retention. The rest of us see that extra pound at the end of our day. Your “day” just happens to be at night. I don’t know what kind of sleep you’re able to get, but try weighing yourself after you pee when you first wake up. I will also say that working the night shift fucks with your hormones in a real bad way, which can affect all kinds of things (like weight fluctuations, inflammation, sleep patterns, mood swings.... you obviously know this already because you live it). When I switched from 3rd shift to 1st shift, it was worth the slight decrease in pay. My health improved immensely. ",False,False

Some days I’m excited because I know I didn’t eat much and the number will definitely be lower, and other days I dread weighing myself the next morning because I’ve eaten something heavyish or I’ve eaten too much and know the number won’t be lower ",False,False

I try to calculate based on the volume I ate, bms, sodium, how much water intake, exercise and sweat, piss, and the list goes on.  And then you start fixating on how to eat tomorrow in response to your arbitrarily calculated future weight.  Super fun, 10/10 would recommend if you want to hate yourself even more",False,False
