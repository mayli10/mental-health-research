She already knew how shitty itd be if she did that and locked herself in her car before calling. But how she phrased her introduction made it seem like she was in the car with her friends.  I made it a bigger situation than it actually was and feel like a dumbass. I blew up and cried my little eyes out over a misunderstanding.   Her being her, she was ready to hold me and make sure I was okay 😌❤✌🌟",False,True
