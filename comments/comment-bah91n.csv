I also feel strong   I understand is hard. Its not easy to let yourself be vulnerable in front of people, but you can try talk to someone you trust. Maybe they can help the way a doctor does, but feeling like someone listens means a lot. And usually, other people can see the things ""in a healthy light"", and put things into perspective.   You are worthy and you are strong, not because you can take cut after cut, but because you are being aware of your behaviours and doing something to change them. Not everyone can do what you are doing now.",False,False

Lots of people with EDs (including me) get high off the feeling of starvation.   If you want to know what's going on chemically; adrenaline, noradrenaline and growth hormone spike as soon as you go an extended period of time without food. You'll also spike dopamine from the feeling of 'success' or control that restricting brings.  In terms of harm reduction please please please make sure you're getting electrolytes (potassium, sodium, magnesium) or your body will quickly start breaking down your organs form stress (this is irreversible damage and if you're underweight it will do this regardless of electrolyte balance). I'm definitely not trying to scare you, but a lot of people just don't realise this stuff until their doc tells them their heart is in atrophy.  Whatever you do, I'm rooting for your safety and remember that you deserve to be healthy, always &lt;3",False,False

I cut as well, and what you're saying is incredibly relatable. I also feel strong when I harm myself, like I'm atoning, like I can finally achieve *something* and bear pain.   My doctor's appointment is ages away :( but yeah, I'll try to talk to my therapist about it next I see her.   Thank you so much for your reply and for the kind words. Take care too. ",False,True

Yeah when I fast, I start getting hungry after a few hours (around the time my body starts expecting food, I guess), which is the part I enjoy the most. And then I start feeling faint, which is sometimes accompanied by nausea or headaches. I like it too, for some reason. I guess I just enjoy feeling like I'm running my body to the ground.   Thanks for clarifying on the relationship between eating disorders, weight loss, and self harm as well. I'll be sure to keep it in mind. ",False,True

Fasting feels a lot like what it felt to cut yourself. When i used to cut, i used to feel ""powerful"" when i could take cut after cut. When i fast a lot, i feel the same satisfaction of feeling like im powerful and can control myself and everything that i felt when i cut. I dont know if you are seeing a doctor for you bipolar disorder, but if you do maybe you can tell them what you are going to. Take care of yourself, you are worthy.

Everyone's experience is different, so I wouldn't think about fitting into the stereotypical mold of an ED that's portrayed in the media. If you have disordered eating patterns, and they're prolonged and persistent; then you have an eating disorder.   Fasting doesn't usually induce hunger while you're actually in the fast. You'll get cravings, and maybe waves of hunger around the times you would usually eat, but overall you just feel exhausted, sometimes high but mostly just numb... oh and cold.   The hunger hits once you stop restricting / fasting. And it's unbearable. Often people will binge eat to try and stop it, then fast again as a form of punishment, or as a form of purging. The cycle continues and life becomes a horrendous blur of binging and restricting.  As for exercising while fasting, I have literally no idea how people exercise while fasting. I pass out pretty quickly if I try running on a long fast and lifting just makes me throw up my multivitamins and diet coke. ",False,False
