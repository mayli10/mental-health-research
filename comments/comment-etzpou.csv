I always say “well, irregardless of how you feel about yourself, I will still love you.”  Usually they feel like shit after that",False,False

I'm sure she was just trying to help, but her wording was way off.   I'm sorry you had to hear that, and wish you seek a professional that could guide you through building up your self-esteem and how you view yourself.",False,False

She says she’ll hold space for me to love myself until I can. I tell her she will be holding that space for a long time. My therapist is great and I normally like my dietitian but yesterday really set me off. Plus now she is having me pee before every appointment because I gained weight last week and she was worried I water loaded. It’s hard,False,True

I liked the way you phrased it much better - about how we struggle to accept and to feel the love others give us.   Many women in a recovery program I go to told me “We’re going to love you until you learn to love yourself.” I remember thinking, “you better be ready to love me for a damn long time.” But they never lost hope in me. They just kept offering love, even when I was too scared to let any of it in. I think those women had the right of it. When we’ve forgotten out worth, when we’re afraid to give and receive love, we need people who will help remind us, give us time, help us feel safe, and show by example how it is done.",False,False
