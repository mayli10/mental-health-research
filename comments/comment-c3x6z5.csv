I used to use my job (12-15hr days regularly) as an excuse to not eat before or during my shifts, and when I finally got home, nothing in the house was safe.",False,False

I end up with bad ass stomach pain and i purge like regardless. I know i have slow stomach emptying from my b/p tendencies so I guess to say YMMV,False,False
erupowu,t3_c3x6z5,t3_c3x6z5,ForeverFlexin,1,2019-06-23 07:23:31,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/c3x6z5/do_you_guys_find_omad_beneficial/erupowu/,I’m prone to binging in the morning so I often just tell myself that I’m doing OMAD and then won’t eat the rest of the day. Sometimes I might cave and have a snack but overall it ends up being less calories than if I were eating more consistently. At least that’s what I tell myself - I know the key to not binging is actually eating regular meals. But my hunger/fullness signals are fucked and I don’t feel satisfied until my stomach feels like it’s going to burst. So I’d rather feel that once in a day and be hungry the rest of the day than to never get that too full feeling.,False,False

Sounds weird, but taking a photo of the meal ive prepared, arranged nicely, helps. I have a folder full of photos of my meals and when im hungry, i look at what ive eaten and think 'that's inside me right now!'. I eat at like 8pm every day, because i just CANNOT sleep when im hungry. I consume a lot of coffee, tea, diet soda and vitamins though, which i dont count the calories for.",False,False

I felt guilty breaking a fast, so if I ate a bunch of apples and felt full, but it only added up to 700 calories or so, I'd feel exhausted the next morning and hungry but unable to eat because it wasn't ""time"" yet. It felt way too disordered and had me stuck at a normal BMI of 21 for years and years, just fasting and then binging on enough food for 3 people. Chalk that up to eating freely since I was just barely underweight when I got into it, but after 6 years of EDNOS, I tried it again, and still couldn't get over how food obsessed it turned me into within a single day. I'd say it kept me alive though, because once I broke that habit and worked my way into eating little portions whenever I wanted, every hour or two, my BMI dropped down to 14 even though I felt completely ""normal"" being able to eat whatever I wanted (mostly healthy food though). A lot of people find it helps cut calories, but for the purposes of weight loss or wanting to at least have a more neutral mentality toward food (though not toward weight), it didn't work for me",False,False

I just do it first thing in the morning so I'm not building it up in my mind all day and craving stuff,False,False
