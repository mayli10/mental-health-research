You’re absolutely right about needing more people in the medical field that understand ED’s, and the potential health consequences they bring along with them. I’m in school studying psychology myself at the moment actually, looking to work with kids and adolescents:)",False,False

I was fine purging and restricting, and I was losing so much weight every week and I remember how exhilarating that  was. But like the saying goes, when one thing goes it all goes. I was fine, and then everything went wrong. Everything from muscle cramps to losing my hair and period, to passing out regularly. I never had any problems until everything was wrong.  I have an ed doctor and a dietician now. The dietician is my favorite doctor to see because she gives me these goals to meet every 2 weeks when I see her. Like one of my goals the first time I saw her was to eat protein at at least one meal, and when I did that for dinner one night and told her i was praised and she told me what a good job I was doing and it made me feel so happy!!!! So now I always try to meet my goals :) this week it was to try to have a snack in the morning especially on days I don’t eat breakfast (which is everyday). I’ve done that a few times and I’m excited to tell her on Monday that I did that!!!!  If you EVER need anyone to talk to, I’m here and I can help you through this terrifying process of starting to talk about your disorder to professionals and get help &lt;3  &lt;3. You are so strong and I believe in you :) please keep us updated about your progress!!!",False,False

I think I put off for a while seeking help because I wasn't experiencing any drastic side effects - even now my blood pressure is normal, and all my tests came back fine except for a slightly low white blood cell count. One thing the doctor did say, which I have known for a while, is that I'm very nearly running on empty. I know that, at my current weight, it might take just a single bump or bout of illness to trigger something far more serious. I want to get better, I just need help taking those necessary steps - hence why I reached out in the first place. I hope the dietician can help.",False,True

Optometry seems really interesting to me and I would love being an eye doctor with my own practice. But at the same time I really want to go into psych or become an ed doctor for people like us. No one who’s normal about food can relate to us as well as we can to each other. I still have some time to think about my career, but I think we need more understanding and knowledgeable ed doctors &lt;3",False,False

I felt fine most of the time. Except one day I purged, looked at myself in the mirror and saw my bones and concave stomach. And my crotch was literally just the bone, no fat covering anything anywhere on my body. I got in the shower, and a few moments later my hearing and vision went out completely. I ran downstairs the best I could blind and deaf, covered in a towel, chugged a cup of black coffee I planned on having after the shower, curled up and laid on the downstairs bathroom rug with the door closed. I thought I was going to die. At this point my hearing and vision was completely gone, but I was still (barely) conscious. I remember saying about 100 Hail Marys in my head just praying I didn’t die. Eventually my hearing came back and my vision was restored but that’s my lowest point. Naked, afraid, alone, scared, terrified that I was dying. Shaking and shivering in the cold air, feeling feather light almost like I was floating because my head was so messed up from purging and restricting.   I would say that was my lowest point, where I knew something was really wrong with me. Between that and going to sleep at night and waking up with horrible Charlie horses in my feet and calves. The pain was horrible. I can still feel the squeezing, clenching, muscles in my legs and feet. Terrible pain!!  Please please please seek help before you have to experience anything like I did. If you already have had some of these experiences, you are overdue to get on the help bandwagon. Please reach out to someone you trust. If you have no one, then trust your college or school counselors who can put you in contact with better resources. You need to get help NOW! Do not wait until you are laying naked on the bathroom floor, shaking and swaying in and out of consciousness, with no vision and no hearing. Please get help :) feel free to talk to me if you need an accountability partner, or just someone to talk to or ask questions. We all want to help you get better!!!! You can do this :)",False,False

You definitely look underweight. And clearly you don’t FEEL physically good which should matter more anyway than your appearance. Jesus.

Isn't it a pretty well known cliché that intelligent overachieving young people are the ones most likely to develop an ED? I say get another doctor ASAP.

She did actually refer me to a dietician, which I think will be helpful.
