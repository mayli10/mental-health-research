Your body will become unused to digesting normal amounts of food and you will probably get very constipated.  My tips:   do not take stimulant laxatives because your bowels can become dependent on them. Míralax is good because it draws water into the stools, softening it.   Drink lots of water and stay hydrated  You can try to take psyllium, fiber supplements, or increase fiber intake  Also, you can try sugar alcohols (erythritol, maltitol, etc) like in sugar free candies or gum because they often make people poop",False,False

I can't stand the powder tho so I take the psyllium husk pills morning and night. That plus my Drs Best high absorbtion magnesium  supplement pills keeps my digestion moving.,False,False

Mineral oil. It doesn't stimulate the bowels or soften the poop like other laxatives. It just sort of lubes the tube so to speak.     It is not uncomfortable. It is safe to use daily. It does take a while to take effect though. I take a couple tablespoons about a day in to restricting.,False,False

Do not recommend. Definitely recommend a fiber supplement (bulks up your BM so it gets pushed out.) or a magnesium supplement (works like an osmotic lax I think.) maybe up your fluid intake  a little too.,False,False

It’s just psyllium husk powder. All it does is bulk up and soften your stool so it doesn’t **make** you go but taking 1-2 teaspoons every morning has solved my digestion issues.,False,False
