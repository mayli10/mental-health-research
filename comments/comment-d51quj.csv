Like we're not people, but humanoid cryptids that *probably* exist.   This isn't helped by the weird accompanying photos that you've pointed out. Instead of showing humans, those pages show pictures of objects like measuring tapes, scales, and ~symbolic~ apple cores. (Okay, sometimes they do show a thin white girl staring into a mirror. But that is an even worse image choice, for so many reasons.)",False,False
