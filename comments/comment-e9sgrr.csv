Not sayjng that to brag just so u know its possible with an ed I weigh all the ingredients on a food scale in grams so its extremely accurate.   Theres so much preservatives and lack of nutrition in like frozen and other empty food that my ed hits me the other way and refuses anything like that. Its the orthorexic in me. Sometimes ur body needs simple foods tho, like plain corn.  Never will i understand those extravagant three home cooked fattening meals a day ppl. But i do eat about one extravagant non fattening home cooked meal every two days lol.",False,False

It genuinely makes me really sad because the few times I cook something good and exciting and people love it, I get SO happy. But if I cook something I need to eat it (people would feel weird if I didn't) so often I literally can't cook because of that. Ughhh I hate this so much :)))))",False,True

Yeah it also makes me soooo anxious to cook at their place because my meals are sooooo simple (because I hate to add unnecessary calories) so my meals never get as tasty and fancy as those his mom makes!

I actually enjoy making food and stuff as well but i‚Äôve hardly learned to make any common ‚Äúproper‚Äù foods cause I couldn‚Äôt face eating them :( I just like to keep track of everything that goes into it and calories and stuff and anything fancy and complicated would just be too much stress although it would probably be delicious.

You just described my situation to the letter. I‚Äôm in a long distance relationship and whenever I come to his, I‚Äôm blown away (and internally freaking out) at how my bf‚Äôs mum cooks. And him, don‚Äôt even get me started. He is a true intuitive eater and on top of that he is very lean and cannot gain weight even when he‚Äôs actively trying. So his family and him always make a big dinner, trying out different recipes (!!) and I‚Äôm there like - how can you just... eat three meals a day??! and not snack?? and follow actual recipes with oil and cream. Of course I eat with them and ask about the recipe if something is particularly delicious but I‚Äôve never made anything from those recipes. And my bf knows that if it‚Äôs my turn to cook dinner, he can expect steamed or saut√©ed veg with a skinny, oil-free dip, and some pasta or rice made just for him separately, because I don‚Äôt eat them. Staying at his and planning what to make for food always makes me so anxious !! because I know they feel that there‚Äôs something disturbingly wrong with me.",False,False

They all (3 lovely folks) cook their meals daily and I don't understand or know how.

Even if I decide to cook something good and choose a recipe and calculate the calories in it down to every single calorie, I still will be afraid of it yanno? I'll wonder if I miscalculated something, if the labels weren't true, etc. But also I'd probably have some leftovers and it makes me so uncomfortable because usually there's left enough for several meals and I'm just so scared that i'll eat a lot because of that. One option would be to portion and then freeze everything that I won't be eating but we have limited space in the freezer (we share it with another couple) and also I share all my meals with my bf so I'd have to have at least 1-2 portions in the refrigerator at every point in time for him but it also means that ***I*** can eat it and I'M SO AFRAID ahaha. Another option would be to create JUST ENOUGH food for 1 meal (or 2 meals if it's for me and bf) but it's such a hassle yanno? It's so much easier to just cook in bulk because there's so much less washing up to do and it takes less time in general and I'm a very busy person and UGHYFUHGVJDFK It sounds so dumb but all these thoughts just completely take away any joy of cooking that I have and make it all so stressful I just... wish i could make food and not get sweaty/anxious/depressed at least once in my life oh my god",False,True
