Not a single person on this post is implying purging is good, in fact they’re all agreeing purging sucks and that hands free purging makes it hard to stop even when we want to.  Pretty sure most if not all of us rationally know the harms of purging. But it’s an addiction, just like alcohol addiction. You’re right though that none of us deserve such a terrible end.",False,False

I'm one of the *least* judgemental of guys, and maybe especially regarding EDs. But there's a YouTube video I've seen in which a young dad (aged 28yrs at the time) reviews his 15yr or so ED history and explains matter-of-factly that his crowning glory (his term) was he could finally purge hands-free.   Two years later he was dead of a heart-attack… His friend posted this news in the video comments. Beyond sad!  And I don't want this outcome, typical for b/p EDs, befalling anyone. *Not one soul, none of us, deserve this depressing end.*",False,False
