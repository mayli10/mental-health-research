I don't count cals but I'd imagine it's around 2200. Despite the amount I eat, I don't really gain or lose weight unless I try to. It's bc I weightlift, work a retail job where im constantly speed walking around, and I attend a college that is extremely large and hilly so i end up walking 15,000 steps on school days and walking upward 20~ feet.   I hate the way my family looked at me when I was eating a normal amount for my activity levels. My mom is stationary throughout her whole day. The only exercise she gets is from doing chores. She stays extremely slim by eating 1 snack and 1 meal a day. She doesn't look healthy in any way but then she had the audacity to look at me who is a BMI of 22 with a low body fat percentage and a healthy lifestyle and act like I eat too much and ""do excercises ment for men."" Now I'm approaching a relapse just bc I don't want to be the person at the diner table eating the most food. It's pathetic that I can tell you how many servings of food she has each night in addition to what I've eaten.",False,False
