My dog is at the skinny end of healthy and I spend almost as much time obsessing over planning his meals/treats as I do my own bc I don't want him to gain or lose weight, and I'm sure a lot of it is due to my ED. On the flip side, it helps me see ""food = fuel"" so I feel like it's also helping me??",False,False

Glad to hear your dog is fine after eating trash. Sometimes I worry mine will do the same,False,True

And dont withhold a days worth of food. Maybe take him out for a nice walk. My dog has straight up eaten trash a few times I forgot to lock it up when I left. No harm done thankfully.,False,False
