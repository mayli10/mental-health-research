My boyfriend suffers from depression so there's no way in hell I'll burden him with that shit. I want to be nothing but a ray of light for other people but to myself I am dull and void of light.  Wow, that sounded so dark typed out lol.  If you wanna have a chat my messages are open :)",False,False
