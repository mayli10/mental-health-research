I wish I could provide better insight, but I honestly don't know. I have avoided getting assessed there because I don't share with anyone that I'm having issues, and I would have for my sister in law to find out from working there that I have an eating disorder.   I can completely understand where you are coming from with the whole location thing. Funny thing, I refuse to ever go back to Florida as I was visiting there, got really drunk (I truly never drink, and I sat at the pool and beach drinking all day, got super intoxicated and dehydrated all while on antidepressants) and apparently made comments that I wanted to die. So I got taked to a psych ward and held for a day from the Baker's act. I was physically assaulted on the unit and had a horrible, horrible experience. Individuals there were really, really mentally ill. I was never actually suicidal, not sure what my drunk self was talking about, but I sobered up real fast in the hospital. They said sometimes antidepressants and alcohol can cause weird thoughts when uses concurrently. And I haven't had a drop of alcohol since (this was years ago), and I refuse to ever drink again. So I understand where you are coming from with the whole Ohio thing.",False,False

But also, the Emily Project as a whole had pretty mixed but generally negative reviews...?  The place looks *amazing* on paper but I'm kinda worried about the negative reviews of the Minneapolis location and EP in general. If you went there, would you be okay with telling me a bit about your experience there? It's really hard to find stuff online that aren't like, approved-by-the-treatment-center testimonials or people leaving a review because they're mad lol.  And I know that this sounds like a really stupid thing to be concerned about, but I took a summer job at Cedar Point two years back and it no joke was the single worst summer of my life, and I was literally in the psych ward last summer lmao. So, I'm a bit worried that being around Lake Erie and being in Ohio in general might be kinda triggering for me? I don't know if this question makes even the slightest bit of sense, but how like, ""Ohio-y"" would a stay at that center be...?",False,True

Some of their stuff is updated with inclusive language and plenty isn’t.  My experience at two locations was that 98% of the staff were inclusive in their practice and things like pronouns in use were standard practice— not that that’s everything but it’s an indicator to me that they’re actively trying and thinking about inclusivity. Not sure what your experience would end up being like and I’m frustrated that it’s a barrier you’re working with and wish you much luck!,False,False

I’m sorry that they don’t take vegans. I don’t think they have plans to change but all my love dear- it’s hard enough to be in the minority of adults with EDs but you have such a unique need- it sucks that so few places are able to help!,False,False
