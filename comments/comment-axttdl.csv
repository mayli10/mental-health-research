Way to play on fears and insecurities to rake in money from customers. Holy hell that is an awful ad.   But I know what you mean. I realized today my new thing is guilt over food I didn’t even eat. But I thought about eating it. I came close to eating it. I even for a moment decided to eat it and sometimes go as far as buying it. And even though I don’t eat it I feel guilty. I wake up the next day in a panic before I remember I actually didn’t eat it.,False,False
