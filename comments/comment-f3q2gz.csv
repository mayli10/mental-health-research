It's the higher end of what's considered healthy, but at the same time it's feasible - especially with the initial water weight loss. Also, is she aiming for the first of May? Is she being that exact and specific about it? Or is it more flexible than that? If she's being super strict about it all then it's more likely to be disordered, but if she's like ""the goal is 20lbs by May but if I hit that by mid-May instead that'd still be cool"", then it can be perfectly healthy.   Keep an eye on her. Ask her questions about how she feels about her weight, her weight loss, herself as a person etc. (Make it subtle lol, don't just go in all guns blazing). It could be disordered, but it could also be nothing to worry about.  If it gets to a point where you're genuinely concerned for her safety, then at that point sit her down and have a proper talk about it and think about contacting someone to help her.",False,False

I don't talk about food issues anymore with friends who have their own, *because I hurt/destabilized someone by doing that, even tho I'd never wanted to*.  Probably three someones, realistically. 2+3'd just never admit it. God. Open trash can, insert me, close lid. New home who dis.  Makes sense to wonder about that factor in similar situations now.  Some people have a mutual understanding and aren't hurting anyone. Others are oblivious and self-centered, like I was. Occasionally, I've met someone who either didn't care about affecting other peoples' mental health, or actively tried to make it worse for twisted personal reasons. Can't approach those all the same ways.  &gt; Why on earth would my best friend want to trigger me into relapse?  Hell if I know. Why'd the boyfriend from a different topic think it was ok to call his girlfriend ""lardo""? Why did a ""friend"" once try to ""confide"" in me about about food issues that just turned out to be a bizarre sudden imitation of the bits + pieces I'd already vented to them about?  I don't know either of you, so there was no clear answer abt whether this was a toxic or one-sided friendship outside of this one isolated story. If it isn't, glory be and hallelujah.  It's improved my peace of mind to realize the sheer number of times I used to keep worrying fiercely for someone post-weight!talk...only to find out that they'd forgotten about their wait-that-could-be-unhealthy goals sooner than I did.  If we lead different lives there: again. Glory be, and hallelujah.  Would I tell your friend that I'd keep my sanity by waiting to see if she acted on questionable goals, in case the issue resolved itself? Hell no. But this topic didn't come off like something you were going to link her to.  I *hope* she just turns out to be one of the people who occasionally decide ""I'm gonna lose a dubiously ok amt of weight now"" then carry on with their usual life.  I always hope someone will. The alternative road we went down is a lot worse.",False,False

Why on earth would my best friend want to trigger me into relapse? Idk about you but I don’t think it’s me against the world and everyone is out to sabotage me, and I certainly would never invalidate her experience like you just did. I was that person too who set goals and failed brushed it off and set another arbitrary goal I couldn’t meet until I finally failed so many times that I stopped eating entirely because I saw my friend get skinny from throwing up and decided that was the only way. She’s coping with a fuckton right now and this is exactly how it started for me and I’m worried about my friend.",False,True
