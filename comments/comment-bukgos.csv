It sucks sometimes, but didn't having an active eating disorder really suck? Something I've found helpful is keeping my list of reasons to recover easily accessible (it's in my phone's Notes App and also written out in two notebooks - one next to my bed, and one with my things at my parents' house); when I feel very much that I want to relapse, I can access this list and be reminded why I am doing what I'm doing.",False,False
