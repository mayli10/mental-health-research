I tried to have an eat a normal meal day for thanksgiving which immediately led to “I guess I should just keep eating fuck it” after my meal. Fortunately the last couple week’s high restriction/fasting made me so sick after eating normally that I wasn’t able to binge. Now I’m just having “hmm maybe I will not eat for the next few days” thoughts😔 ,False,False
