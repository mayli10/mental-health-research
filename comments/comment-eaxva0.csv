But then you do, and you keep eating more because you can't stop yourself, so you might as well give in and say 'fuck it' anyway. the cycle continues. it fucking sucks and you feel like you can't tell anyone because it's so embarrassing even tho you know you're psychologically fucked up and need help, and you're also killing your metabolism :/ been dealing with this a lot lately for whatever reason. I'm convinced that I've permanently ruined my stomach's ability to look flat because of years of binging, like it will never look 'normal' let alone flat, just soft and pudgy even though I've been low-normal weight/underweight the last two years. what if I need lipo or something to finally fix it? idk",False,False
