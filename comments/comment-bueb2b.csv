Go to inpatient first, and they'll help you find a therapist for after care. You can even call your doctors office and just say ""I'm struggling with my mental health, is there an inpatient facility that you can direct me to""  You dont have to mention your eating disorder until you register for inpatient.   That therapist was shit and please know that they aren't all shit and a good psychotherapist will be able to help you with a majority of your issues",False,False

Maybe ask her for one? or look for specialized therapist in your area? Also Skype therapy can be a last measurement if you life in such small city/town. If you go impatient do some research in the place before hand, some do the same technique of feeding and not solving mental issues.",False,False

There’s a ton of parallels between Ed’s and accusation! The only thing that ever helped me was this book called brain over binge which focuses on a more addition-type model for how the brain works. I wouldn’t write that off.  Best of luck girl. Please contact any impatient that’s in your insurance plan. You don’t need to go to a local one,False,False

This was a 12 step based recovery subreddit once upon a time. And now it's no where near that and the people here have never even heard of EDA which the SUB IS NAMED FOR  I felt like I lost a source of recovery in this sub when proed moved over here.

At that BMI, it does sound like you need inpatient or at the very least, one of those day programs.  BUT if that's not an option, maybe try going to AA? I was reading a autobiographical-fiction work, and the author found that AA meetings were helpful her. Not because she ever drank, but because the forced starvation IS a type of addiction. The habits and negative thoughts and  the coping mechanisms can possibly respond to addiction therapy. Having the support of a community, having a sponsor you can call in the middle of the night when you want to binge and purge, etc. could be very helpful.   I hope someone else can chime in with more thoughts!",False,False
