I went from being in collage and being treated like an intellectual to being treated like a stereotypical mental patient. It was dehumanizing. Not to mention that everyone was initially treated with the same exact meds. I was a cog in a very large machine, like just a number.   I'd say things and they'd just be like ""thats your depression talking"" and I was like ""no, *I'm* talking."" My feelings were constantly dismissed. ",False,False

Not for being sad or hearing voices but self harm, drug/alcohol use, not showing up regularly enough, not taking meds, things like that. I'm not saying it's right or what op is experiencing isn't wildly unfair, but people on here sometimes seem to have this weird misconception about how eds are treated vs every other mental illness and I don't really get it.",False,False

Thankfully, my therapist and dietitian there were amazing. I wasn’t a super big fan of being in groups with teenagers, but it wasn’t the end of the world.

I love my psychologist. She has never dumbed down anything for me and she always tries to point out how insightful I can be into my disorder which is extremely helpful. It is definitely hard, but the helpful, smart and non judgemental doctors are out there.   She also never forces me into anything or gives me ultimatums like OPs out patient place.   I would recommend looking at psychologists. I have found better luck there than therapists/centers.   My doctor also does specialize in (long term) EDs so if you're in AZ by any chance I will pm you her info. She takes insurance. ",False,False

That's the unfortunate reality of such programs. If you want an individualized approach, you'll have to shill out for private, individual treatment with the specialists you want to consult.  That's also the reason I'd never consider treatment. My bulimia is one of the manifestations of my desire to exert control over my life. I won't allow this control to be taken away and stand there with no alternative to fall back on.",False,False

I am a grown woman.  I'm married, I have a job, I manage a household.  I do not intend to put myself in an environment where I'm spoken to like I am a child (or an idiot).  I also have very low confidence in therapy.  I have had ED therapy before, and found it useless.  I might change my mind if I could find someone who *specialized* in treating *adults* with *decades-long* ED histories, but how do I find someone like that?",False,False
eabfie7,t3_9zpwt6,t3_9zpwt6,Jeydon,1,2018-11-23 13:48:11,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/9zpwt6/treatment_makes_me_feel_like_im_a_little_kid/eabfie7/,It seems like they don’t understand what a mental disorder is. Imagine if they were to tell someone with depression that they needed to meet a certain level of happiness in three weeks or they’d get kicked out of the program. Or if they told someone with schizophrenia that if they heard one more voice then they’d be cut off for their childish behavior of deciding to hear voices when they know it’s not good for them.  It’s all part of the notion of individual responsibility where everything is your fault and they’re not there to hold your hand or help in any way. Honestly it sounds more like parole than treatment. That unwillingness to work with you to come up with a realistic plan that is achievable completely discredits them as a good faith actor and the fact they want to infantilize you reveals their true interest is to make themselves feel superior and more mature. This person is obviously very insecure.,False,False

My therapist was saying, ""All you have to do is eat an extra 500 calories a day to start gaining"".  ALL YOU HAVE TO DO.  500 CALORIES EXTRA.  A DAY.  What part of can't actually do it don't they get?  They really do behave like they're dealing with some little kid sitting at the dinner table crossing her arms and saying ""won't, won't, won't"" because they don't want to eat their peas.  I know it's a handy thing for some people in recovery to use terms like ""fear foods"" and draw pictures of your ED and it looks like a black spiky monster, but I really can't take it seriously.  Especially being older than the therapists I've had.",False,False
