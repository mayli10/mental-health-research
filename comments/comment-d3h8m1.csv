Saw my stomach all fat and stuff.  It kicked off hard core right then and there.  I had always been a small kid growing up so puberty and my childhood eating habits were not kind to me in the beginning. Then having no boobs became a trend when i was developing and well. Its a big ugly snowball.,False,False

I have memories of sucking in my stomach and seeing all my ribs, and loving the shocked reactions of my cousins when they’d see how skinny I was. I’d get a weird sense of satisfaction when they’d try to do the same, but their ribs wouldn’t protrude like mine. Ugh.",False,False

I could still make out some of what it said (and I do have *some* memory of actually writing this), and it mentioned how “fat” my stomach felt, how I needed to start watching and tracking what I eat, and I think I could make out that I wrote I was 70 lbs. I was actually always considered the “skinny” one but I think I felt pressure to maintain that at a very young age, even though my mom never ever negatively influenced or shamed me in that way. Don’t know where it came from; likely from both school and the media? But I think I was about 10 when I wrote that entry. :( It’s really sad that I had those thoughts at such a young age. And I struggled on/off throughout high school, was relatively okay in college/post graduation, but recently things have quickly gone downhill for me again. It’s really come full circle I guess.",False,False

As a skinny little twig of a kid I used to love to suck in my tummy and look at all my ribs and stick my hand under my ribcage just to show how skin-and-bones I was.  I only got actual eating issues later, but I remember being infatuated with my extreme thinness from an early age. I literally had metabolic issues that made me not gain weight/grow so it was a super unhealthy mindset, but I had no way of knowing that.",False,False

I went to get a second bowl, and my mom asked me if I really needed more.  I said yes.  Then she told me that I was going to get fatter and fatter until one day I’d be 400 lbs, and then I’d ask her why she let me eat those potatoes, and she’s have to tell me that she didn’t, and it was my own fault.  It’s the first time I ever remember not eating out of guilt and shame.",False,False
