In order to have actually put on that much weight you'd have had to eat 19,250 calories over your maintenance. That's 34 big macs! Plus maintenance -- which for most people is at least 12 more big macs in that same time. Somehow I just don't believe you were eating 46 big macs. And even if you did manage to eat that many big macs there are studies that show that after a certain calorie cap your body really can't even process all of it.   Binging causes us to hold onto some extra water -- especially since salty foods are so damn tasty. Plus the food weight if you haven't managed to poop it all out. So drink some water and let your body pee out the salt and poop out the food.",False,False
