He knows about your disorder and he still told you he liked thinner girls? That’s super fucked up. It’s not like a necessary piece of info he needed to tell you, like that sweater makes you look fat, it’s a piece of info that he knows will get in your head and feed into your problems, and he said it anyway",False,False
