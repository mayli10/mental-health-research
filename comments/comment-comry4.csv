I just looked up what you're talking about and it looks like it's directed toward older audiences/ not romanticized. Your post just reminded me of my experience and I ran with it lol,False,False

I'm fully convinced that jokes like this are why I developed an eating disorder so young. I think I would have gotten one eventually, but some of my earliest ed memories involve calculating calories for characters on tv shows and getting upset when characters eat a lot but are super skinny. Mel from Gordimer Gibbons is one that I remember specifically for some reason.",False,False
