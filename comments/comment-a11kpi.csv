See her lips move, tune it out. Focus on being healthy and comfortable with your own self and body. Sending positive energy (and noicecancelling earphones with jazz music)",False,False

My mother also did terrible damage (body image wise) to not only me, but also my three younger siblings and we're all still suffering well into our 30s. Please find a way to get help or find someone to talk to that can help you with other coping mechanisms. This is not a healthy relationship, and unfortunately you are the one that will have to learn how to deal with the other person since you can't change them - but you can change the way you react to it. I strongly recommend it, each of my siblings and I delt with it differently and I watched my siblings go through stuff that I would never wish upon my enimies (worse than an ED, as sad as it is on its own). Best of luck to you! ",False,False

But it’ll come off really quick, usually the next morning for me. I don’t know what kind of relationship you have with your mom, but my parents have done the same kind of thing and there’s honestly no pleasing some people ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",False,False
