This part just made me feel sad because I wondered what would happen if I just ""gave up"" on trying to fight BED. I don't want to live my life with food anxiety ruling my thoughts and actions. And I felt like the book kinda encouraged people to...give up. I don't think body positivity and recovery are mutually exclusive.   A weird part is that the book really exaggerates fat discrimination.    Like, Plum has exactly one female friend and never had a boyfriend and never went on a date or had sex. Most fat girls I know have plenty of friends and get action, just mostly not with super fit/hot  model guys? Plum has random people taking pics of her and laughing (it's like she's the only fat person in America? Come on, fat people are normal here! Obesity isn't unique!), and basically any man she walks past fatshames her.   ..which leads to the fact that the whole book is really sexist? In the book (not the show) there is not a single positive male character. They literally are all pigs and rapists and only want sex. There's also a men-killing terrorist group in the book...and they aren't really criticized that much??   I hate to use the phrase ""not all men"" but this book literally portrays every man as evil, which doesn't fly by me.   By the end of the book Plum turns into a angry SJW stereotype who is kinda mean and angry and starts fights, shoplifts, etc ðŸ˜Ÿ she kinda stopped being a sympathetic character. Her activism consisted of being angry at men, not being helpful to women.   I get the message of body acceptance, but wish it was more empowering when it came to weight.  Literally nowhere does it talk about being active or eating healthy, it's just talking about coming to terms with obesity like it's  a terminal disease you're supposed to feel happy about.   And let's not even start on the fact that some women really like high heels and makeup etc...those women are seen as vapid and ditzy and only existing for male consumption. Can't I wanna be skinny and glam for my own damn self?!  ",False,True

She had a whole closet full of clothes her ideal self will wear, but her actual clothing is baggy and mostly black.    She feels like she can't start her ""real life"" until she's 125lbs (she's 304), so she doesn't engage in her hobbies or date or do fun things. She just kinda mopes around between work and home and weight watchers meetings.  She meets a body positivity activist whose mother started a giant as-seen-on-tv fad diet. The activist asks Plum a question that I felt like she was asking me too:  ""What happens if you never get skinny?""  Plum, without hesitation, says she'd rather die.   The activist (who is also a therapist) starts encouraging Plum to do the things that her skinny self would do- like get a makeover, wear flattering clothing that fit, and go on dates.   Plum gets more and more confident with herself, which I appreciate, because I obviously don't support people hating themselves until they are skinny. She also starts developing a better relationship with food via intuitive eating, though it looks like it's still disordered.      ",False,True
