But if you maintain at a certain weight the fat that you do have will start to redistribute, yes??",False,False

They're different macronutrients. You can tone up certain areas, but you likely won't see that part slim down unless you're losing fat overall. The fat you use for energy doesn't necessarily come from the part you train. It'll come from wherever you genetically tend to lose fat from first.",False,False

BUT you can do weight toning of your muscles and the area will slim down fast. You'll be building muscle there and it will convert the fat there first. I'd recommend doing arm circles with a light weight, like 2 or 5 pounds. Sounds like not much but you will feel a burn. I would also recommend doing tricep extensions and dumbbell curls, but at a pretty light weight with a high set volume. So to explain better, I do training for BIG MUCLEESSSS because I want to look strong (ofc ED brain wants to look frail skdhsodj). I choose a weight that I can only do 8-12 dumbbell curls with and I rest between sets, doing 3-5 sets. That's hypertrophy training.  The training you sound like you'd want to do I dont remember the name of, but basically you choose a light weight and do dumbbell curls at like 20-25 reps in a set, and 3-5 sets. So instead of building larger, bulkier muscles, you'll be building longer leaner muscles. And always always stretch!!!! That'll help them be even longer and leaner!!",False,False
