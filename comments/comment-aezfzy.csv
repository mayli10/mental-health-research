It’s very likely water weight because every stored gram of carb (glycogen) requires 4g of water to be held.  If you want to increase calories without a large rise in scale numbers, try close to 0 carb foods (egg, avocado, even some oil in coffee to give you some energy). These will require less water once processed in your body.   I hope you’re doing okay ❤️",False,False

That puts my mind at ease because there has been lots of scientific research that backs up the claim that I won't gain on 1400 cals, vs my opinion that it will. It helps me realize thats just the eating disorder talking.",False,False

I'm terrified of the potential of one. I've eaten to 800 kcal a day for like 3-4 days and then the guilt overwhelms me and I end up back down to fasting etc. I've never managed to go above 1.2k in the past year, because of fear and anxiety. This means that my weight has plummeted though.. I was a BMI of 35 in Jan '18 and now it's 16.  I don't even know if I want to recover, but I'm killing myself. The scales say I gain once I eat around 800-1000 for a few days, but logically it cannot be fat - and my water % normally reflects that, but I become too afraid to continue, hence the sharp decline of intake.

Sounds like the later?  I wonder if really slowly upping it would work... 1200 to 1250 for a few days, then 1300, and so on. Like are you going from 1200 to 1800 or something?  when you say you see the water bloat, is there actual evidence - your scale says you gain (and that gain is water)?",False,False

Do you have any advice? :s   I always see the water bloat and then I come crashing back down to 150-200 kcals a day. I'm scared because at my bf %, that won't last long, it's around 7.5-8%, my BMI is slightly artificially inflated by loose skin.   Ugh, I'm sorry, I just don't know what to do. I have this constant internal battle every day.",False,True
