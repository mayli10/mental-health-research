If I get my teeth into any of these I find I am channeling a lot of the obsession and compulsion that would otherwise be driving my ED. The challenge of setting goals and the satisfaction from gradually reaching them and setting new ones feels very similar but in a more wholesome and productive way.  It’s not necessarily a cure, but it takes a lot of the edge off. Find something you would be interested in and go for it. If it’s not the one, try something else. You’ve nothing to lose! Even if you don’t keep it up, you’ll have learned something new and if you’re in classes you’ll meet new people. At the very least you’ll have spent time doing something non ED related. Good luck!",False,False

Micro-manage the shit out of your income and make a prescriptive budget to stick to and stick with it.   It’ll stop you from overspending on binge food (pro tip: have a really tight groceries allowance), it’ll give you something to control that doesn’t impact anyone and it’s a great excuse to get out of dinners and eating out if you’re not mentally ready for it.   And at the end of the day you get to accumulate lots of money!",False,False

I’ve just started working on this and I think it’s helping. When things are out of place I get very stressed and binge eat. Less stress = less unnecessary food,False,False
