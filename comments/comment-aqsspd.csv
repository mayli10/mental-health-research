A lot of them are overweight, some obese, those encourage each other and they can fast longer. When BMI is in lower normal or underweight, nutrient reserves are smaller and smaller and fasting becomes dangerous. Because you are now depleting bigger part of your stored nutrients - not only fat, but also vitamin reserves, protein, essential fatty acids, minerals. You can see the depletion on quality of your hair, skin, deteriating muscles, low immunity, tiredness, fainting, headaches...  And people are not perfectly honest about their BMI, weight, type of fasting, stimulants ... take everything with a grain of salt. They are very cautious, otherwise fasting subreddit could follow proed.",False,False

They reach their goal weight...and they stop. Or at least maintain and are happy about it.   It also has to do with a lot of people being overweight/average, and just wanting to get down to a healthy BMI. Tons of people here have very low GW, on the cusp of underweight or even openly wanting to be underweight.   Lastly, people are pretty suspicious of fasting IRL. It's a well known truth in that subreddit that ""the first rule of fasting club is you don't talk about fasting club"", because so many people associate fasting with anorexia or very disordered behavior. They don't really get a free pass, they just have enough numbers online to create a community where it's normal.",False,False

On that subreddit, it's acceptable because everyone is doing it. Fasting has a lot of wonderful properties to it. But, any ""normal"" person immediately sees that as disordered.   I will say, however, the people on r/fasting don't have the same mentality as we do. Therefore, it's not disordered. Same goes with OMAD and ADF. These are lifestyles, not an illness. But yes, it is difficult to see us have the same behaviors and we are the ones to be shamed. ",False,False
