What's worse is when I lose all this muscle, and then go through a binge cycle and put on a bunch of fat. So every binge/restrict cycle is making me fatter and fatter despite the number dropping, as I'm essentially just replacing my muscle with fat. And when I do get the opportunity to work out, I can't bring myself to eat enough Calories that would allow me to build some of that muscle back. Because I only want to work out if I have self-control. When I have self-control, I restrict. When I lack it, I binge. When I binge, I do not want to workout or do anything functional.  I can literally feel my calves deteriorating when I go to bed at night. They hurt. And I have felt the feeling of my muscle building up before. It's not the same at all. It's the same atrophy, sure, but instead of slowly coming back to normal, I just feel exhaustion and it never comes back up from there.",False,False
