For some people that means gain, others it should mean lose (e.g. someone with BED whose is overweight from that illness would obviously lose weight when recovering from it). That's an opinion; I don't know how medical professionals interpret it.",False,False

It's a useful vehicle for the fat acceptance types. Fighting for fat acceptance/HAES by using the body positivity movement is going to be more successful than just arguing that fat should he accepted just ""because"". If it's framed in a way of ""loving your body, despite its flaws"", that's going to be more successful. I say this because I've seen a lot more posts recently (think the Gillette ad) of obese people ""loving"" their body, despite what society says, and ""living out loud"" (whatever the fuck that means). This video sums it up pretty well, imo: https://youtu.be/V1TL-tbQESU",False,False

I would love to recover (at least mentally and be able to maintain) but when I try to surround myself with recovery oriented things on social media and such it all seems to be fat positivity.

My BMI is 14.5, which yeah, is low, I guess, but it's not like 10 or 12. My lowest was 13.9 and I actually felt fine then, too. If I get worried about my health, I'll just stop losing, gain a little bit (say up to a BMI of 15), and maintain there. I don't think everyone has to gain weight to recovery, and even if they do, personally I would gain enough so I wasn't about to drop dead, but not so much so I could still be underweight, because I have *zero* interest in being a ""healthy"" weight ever again tbh.",False,False

I don't *need* to do anything, though. And I'm still alive so I've clearly got enough body fat, lol.   &gt; If you saw a severely underweight animal, would your heart not break for it even if it acted happy to see you? Why would you have more compassion for an animal than yourself?   But I'm not an animal, and losing weight *was* an act of compassion, because it made me happier. I'm a hell of a lot happier than I was when I was ""weight restored"". I actually think my body looks pretty good now, at least in terms of weight.   &gt; I’m not exactly sure if this is a genuine question, it is hard for me to believe you don’t know the consequences of chronic malnourishment.   You can be underweight without being malnourished, likewise you can be malnourished at any weight. I take a lot of supplements, so I certainly don't have any micronutrient deficiencies, and I'm going to start taking whey protein shakes to get more protein in. I actually feel better, both physically and mentally, at this ""unhealthy"" weight. Not sure why you question whether I'm being genuine. Not everyone loves recovery.  &gt; It sounds to me you like you were depressed before you turned to an eating disorder to cope if you don’t have friends and never left your room.    Nah, I'm just autistic. I've never had friends lmao. And I'm a lot less depressed now than I was at a ""healthy"" weight.   &gt; I hope you find your reason, and until then, please practice harm reduction like taking vitamins and staying properly hydrated.

So even if someone was severely underweight but didn't have an disordered mentality, they would be given a diet to gain weight in inpatient to save their lives.   People might gain weight during recovery because of severe hunger from restriction and they might maintain weight after recovery because they no longer care as much about their weight.

Thing is, true recovery is being happy despite the weight you have. Right now you can’t imagine yourself happy being average/overweight because you are not recovered. I know someone who is weight restored, but I would not consider her recovered because she still obsesses about her weight and still equates “thin” with correct.   Since you are not there yet, I would make a list of all the things your eating disorder takes from you. Your energy, your health, honest connections with friends and family, etc. Think of all the things you can’t do now because of your eating disorder, things you could do if you were well mentally and physically. These are things worth fighting for.   Retraining your brain to not equate your self worth with your appearance takes lots of work and therapy. Do not be discouraged because you’re not there yet, it will come.   You honestly admit that you’re miserable at the weight you’re at. Think of how much energy and brain power wasted on getting to the point where you are now. And you’re still not happy! Clearly the eating disorder is NOT working to make you happy. And I know that in your heart you know that as long as you hold your eating disorder close, you will never be happy, guaranteed. Have you ever met a happy anorexic or bulimic?  Your ED will keep moving the goal post to x lbs/kg until you’re dead. Don’t you think it’s worth taking the chance that you might get well and find happiness if you let your ED go?  I know getting better sounds scary but I believe you can do it. If you truly thought you can never be happy at a higher weight, you’d just let yourself die instead of posting here to get people to prove you wrong. That part that made you reach out, that’s healthy you. That’s the you that wants to live a full and happy life. Listen to that part!! You are so strong and resilient.",False,False
