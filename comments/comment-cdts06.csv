I was molested at age 12 by a pimply 19 year old who groomed me... I hadn‚Äôt thought about this in years, but he pointed out a very thin, pretty girl to me and told me that he preferred girls like me who had ‚Äúmeat on their bones.‚Äù I remember being jealous of the girl, but flattered by his attention, because I‚Äôd felt so ugly and unloved my entire life. My AN developed shortly thereafter (age 12-15), and then after getting down to a 15 BMI, I finally snapped after years of starvation and binged my way up to a healthy weight. The summer before I turned 16, I was gang raped by two men. ‚ÄúIf you tell anyone, no one will believe you and no one will care,‚Äù one told me, and he was right. I‚Äôll never forget how the cops treated me, and I‚Äôll never forget how roughly the nurse performed my rape kit despite the fact that I was shaking and sobbing. I finally got my first period later that summer, which made me feel even more disgusting.   I never really dealt with the trauma, and after the rape, I slept with a lot of men for validation and affection, and escorted throughout the end of high school (I met middle aged men off of Craigslist), during college, and at various points in my 20s. I also danced on &amp; off for almost a decade and only quit because of health issues... I figured I may as well profit from my sexuality because I‚Äôd be sexualized whether I wanted it or not.   My AN was quiet for years; I guess I had EDNOS and definitely BDD. I wasn‚Äôt thrilled with my body, but I was more focused on plastic surgery than weight loss. A number of things reawakened my restrictive tendencies... my abusive first husband‚Äôs suicide, cocaine abuse, and a toxic competition with my late best friend over weight and looks (she sadly passed away from a heroin overdose a few months ago). I hope to be well enough to dance again soon because I need the money (and I wouldn‚Äôt put it all up my nose this time, ugh), even though my BDD has gotten so bad that I won‚Äôt let my own husband see me naked. At this point, unless I‚Äôm getting paid, male attention disgusts me. If my chest is covered but men still look at me, I automatically think that I need to lose weight.",False,False

I was a chubby kid, still healthy bmi, but not a stick, eventually, but I don't know when I stopped being regular kid lithe. I have a super warped body image/ memory in regards to that. I binged to deal with things at a young age, had a lot of trauma symptoms flare at 12 then spent months obsessing over being a skeleton or a whale, about which would make me safer. I ended up gaining tons of weight to feel safer, but it made me feel so disgusting because there was more of me. I'm always anxious in the normal weight ranges, above underweight, because I look ""more appealing."" But then I get scared with underweight, in case I'm not strong enough.
