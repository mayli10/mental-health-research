That doesn't suddenly cure everything, but it does let me enjoy being the person I am.  Figure out what you want to produce, then stop consuming and start producing.  People think the opposite of ennui is happiness, but it's not. It's creation.  Track what you do with your time. Try to drag it away from your disorder. The more time you put into anything else, the better you'll be at it. The better you are at it, the more meaningful it'll feel.  Avoid frequent social media or mindless consumption, *especially* endless scrolling or autoplaying videos. That shit is *vampiric.*  If you don't know what passions you want to pursue, glean ideas from other people and keep trying them until you find something you can get happily lost in for hours.  Sports. Music. Art. App dev. Web dev. Gaming. Baking. Hiking. Curating a collection. Blogging. Smoking weed in abandoned buildings as a weird sort of 21st-century meditation. Whatever. As long as it feels meaningful and fits the person you want to become.  Your mental illness isn't unique or interesting. Millions of people deal with the same struggles. Those struggles can be tools or comforts sometimes, but in the long run, they're roadblocks that drain your health, time, and energy.  You are so much more than this. Even if you haven't created or discovered the rest of yourself yet.",False,False

With the depression, self-harm, and suicidal thoughts improving, I have space to re-discover what I enjoy. I’m reading more. I’m learning to play the cello. That feels nice.  Basically, I underestimated how interesting things could be because Depression &amp; Co. had sucked the life out of things.",False,False
