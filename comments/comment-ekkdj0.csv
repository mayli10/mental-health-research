Sending you so much love. I’ve been trying to eat less&amp; failing, which I’m trying to see as more of positive than a negative, but I won’t lie- it’s ramping up my desire to indulge in behaviours I thought I had left behind",False,False

It seems great, but the way I felt after was just unbelievably terrible. I think my ED is probably the one problem of mine that didn't get triggered though.",False,False

That makes sense that we'd be able to consume potentially triggering media when feeling confident and recovering, but watching it when low or even slightly more vulnerable is all it takes for it to become problematic. :(",False,True

Like they all notice her, and that’s a huge thing I have with my ed. That I want people to notice me and see me as vulnerable and want to take care of me? It’s weird idk  I think what triggers can sometimes depend on mindset. When I was doing well I could look at fashion posts on Instagram and just look at how cool the clothes were. Now I see (1) e-girl and I’m triggered enough to not eat for the rest of the day  With the trigger warnings: I mostly saw them for drugs and sex, but being an ex skins aficionado, I had a feeling where it was going. I think zendaya gives me the same “fucked up, beautiful and unquestionably valid” envy that Effy did when I was like 14. So maybe that’s where it’s at?",False,False

I didn't even look for trigger warnings, my aunt just recommended it to me as a cool, sad new show about millenials and I just shrugged and put it on. Hindsight is 20/20 right?   I know what u mean, I have barely ate since I saw it. I've just had one hand on my vape and the other with a diet coke with maybe one ""meal"" of a bowl of veggies or soup a day. I didn't think I even had any triggers until this. I'd look up thinspo once when I was recovering and it didn't even bother me. But seeing zendaya, I wish I knew 100% why her and why now, has sent me on such a downward spiral. I thought i was over this, i had been doing so well. And like 5 seconds of her on screen flushed a years grind down the toilet.",False,True

I get really triggered by zendaya in general (people tell me I look like her a lot even though they’re obviously lying) so this show was just ED catnip for me.  I watched all the episodes in 1 day, and while I was super triggered by all the skinny actresses in it, but even more by the chunky girls (I don’t remember her characters name but she was played by Barbie Ferreira)  story line. The show is so fucking good but also toxic af. Probably should’ve listened to all the trigger warnings tbh   Honestly haven’t eaten very much at all since I saw it. I wasn’t recovered but I was eating decently and feeling pretty good about my body. Wild how media can fuck that up so easily. Just goes to show how important it is to know your triggers and limitations.   Recovery isn’t linear and you didn’t “lose” any progress. Just keep going after health and don’t be afraid to reach out for help:)",False,False
