It was too small for me, but there was only one dress of the three smallest sizes left at the store. My other sister (who had body image issues herself) refused to wear anything but the second smallest size (which is what I needed) even though it was too small for her as well. We couldn‚Äôt hook the bra thing inside it and barely got it zipped day of the wedding. I couldn‚Äôt breathe in fully because my lunges couldn‚Äôt expand all the way.   Two weeks ago I was at my parents‚Äô house looking for a dress for a friend‚Äôs wedding and decided to try it on. I can easily zip it up and hook it on the smallest option.

I wore it so much, because I loved how it fit me. Recently, I haven't. I been afraid to try it on, due to I been hearing others talk about gaining weight while on holiday break. I felt like I ate my usual amount, if not less. Yet, I somehow convinced myself I had gained, so I never bothered trying the shirt on. I felt bigger, I felt like I looked bigger.
