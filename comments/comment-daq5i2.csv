Definitely not meant to be an ED song, but it's about overindulgence. Very funky beat. Basically he just lists off a ton of dessert names, and then states ""you might not feel it now, but when the pain cuts through, you're gonna know and how. The sweat is gonna fill your head, and when it comes to much, just shout aloud.""  Another good line is ""you know that what you eat you are, but what is sweet now turns so sour.""  It's my binge/purge anthem.",False,False

I dress like a Tim burton wet dream too! But I have two moods: goth and wholesome grandma who might be a witch( think Sabrina spellman with lots of jewel tones).  Also maybe with a dash of Kurt cobain grunge.   I love the i dress dead lyric and my favorite part of boy division is that guitar solo followed by the LalLAlaLalallalalala. I always sing that part until my throat explodes.   Stay gets me in my feelings and every time I listen to it I am like, ooof. Also Emily makes me want to legally change my name to Emily.  There’s this unreleased Gerard song floating around. I think it’s called piano jam and it’s really heartbreaking.",False,True

I’ll fight anyone that disagrees. It’s one of my fave my chem songs, and I relate wayyy too much to the “i’m not dead I only dress that way” lyric. in general I love a lot of their b sides. danger days slaps too because I love how strong the concept is, and destroya is probably my fave from the album bc the lyrics go so hard. do you know their unreleased stay/someone out there loves you? that one also rlly gets to me",False,False

Three cheers is my favorite from my chem followed by danger days( I really love the happy vibe and the Japanese dance party tunes destroya is another fav). We have the same taste.

I agree for the most part. hesitant alien is probably tied with three cheers for me; I love them both very much but in different ways. I probably listen to HA more though since it’s such a good jam album lol  I have listened to stomachaches!!

I have listened to hesitant alien more times than it’s humanly possible. I think I would get lynched by the my chemical fandom but I love hesitant alien more than the other my chem albums. And that’s saying a lot because they’re my favorite band and tied with Lana del Rey as my top bops.  There’s just something about that album and the whole era aesthetic that vibes with me. It’s very David bowie.  Have you listened to Franks album stomachaches? That’s another of my favorite albums( I love frank but this album is definitely better than the others in my taste). If you haven’t please check out the song guiltripping. It’s very dreamy,False,True
