I plan on just ""checking in"" with the app once a week or even every other week.  Basically just want the benefits of daily weighing (i.e. smoothing out those daily fluctuations) without the mental neuroses that it brings me.    I just ordered [this scale](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N1UX8RW/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) which looks like it should work!   The app that it syncs with also plots weekly, monthly, and daily trends of all body measurements (weight, bf%, etc.) and the weekly and monthly graphs don't show the y axis!",False,True

You might have to turn off notifications, Iâ€™m not sure, I canâ€™t remember if I had to do that. Also idk any of the details but Iâ€™m sure thereâ€™s an Android version of all this as well if you donâ€™t have an iPhone! ",False,False

Then, when I feel like I've made some progress I can check on the app and (hopefully) see a line with a downward trend.    Unfortunately, I live alone, so that's not possible, though it would be great!",False,True

It connects to an app and sends weight, fat %, bone mass, lean muscle mass, etc. not entirely sure how accurate it is but it had good reviews and I had googled about its accuracy as well, what I found said that the scale gets pretty close....unfortunately I dropped my scale a few weeks ago and it has retaliated by telling me I weigh five pounds more than what every other scale says ðŸ™„",False,False

You can get smart scales that will automatically update all of your measurements in the Health app, but Iâ€™m not sure anything exists that would let you see graph trends without values on the x and y axes...   FWIW, when Iâ€™m in your shoes and am too anxious to know the number but know I need it measured for accountability, I get on the scales backwards and have my SO read and note the number for me. Do you have anybody you can trust who could do this with you? ",False,False
