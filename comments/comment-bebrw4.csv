I completely ignored my other problems, finding coping issues, gaining slowly and instead delved into binging heavily aka ""reactive eating"" which was totally okay when i was underweight but quickly made me balloon up with no self control and an addiction to food. I rationalized by obsessively reading recovery ""gurus"" talk about their binges, which is my fault.  But it's not as fucking simple as to start eating everything without limits and I hate that I let myself get duped into it by some stupid uninformed internet communities. Being healthy and disordered isn't black and white and just because I'm a healthy BMI doesn't mean I have healthy habits or a good relationship with food and life - in fact, I believe my body was much healthier when I was exercising and eating in a controlled deficit than now when I've binged intermittently for 2 years and not exercised at all, living in constant anxiety and discomfort with my body that I placate with the temporary pleasure of food.   Fuck, this isn't me. I hate being like this. I don't care if it's """"""healthier"""""""", which I doubt it actually is for my body and mind. I'm just as obsessed now except with filling my stomach until near bursting instead of actually finding distractions from my angst. Sorry if this is triggering, I just needed to get this off my chest.",False,False

Even if/when you’re weight recovered, ED remains a mental illness and it is something that plagues most sufferers even when they are physically healthy.

But is that really all that helpful to hear? Please don't get me wrong, I don't mean this to be combative or anything like that. All I'm saying is that positivity is a powerful thing. Funny enough, you  mentioned cancer. Their outlook is often bleak, but positivity is considered (though it's hard to quantify specifically) to be critical in their recovery process. I think positivity is just as important for people with EDs, or with (or even without) any condition. It doesn't mean that you have to ignore that recovery is a real bitch sometimes, because it definitely is. But it *is* worth it. Even if it *might not* work. I hope recovery works for you.",False,False

You might be in a good state for months or even years but a slip-up or relapse might happen. That's not a negative thing and it doesn't undo any work done. The important thing is that you have a support net to help you up if you slip or fall.  Some people never relapse but most of us do specially if we don't have a strong support net available. In my experience it never gets as bad as it first was since now you have some knowledge of what to look out for and some extra coping mechanisms.  I do not want to be harsh (this phrase helped me, ignore it if it doesn't help in your case) but with anorexia it's recover or die.  I wish you luck. Hope this helps.",False,False
