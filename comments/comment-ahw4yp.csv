I suppose I‚Äôd rather be this height than super tall (I like being able to fit in small places/easily hide behind other people/stuff like that) but I do wish I was maybe two or three inches taller.  But yeah, being short sucks weight/food wise because I definitely look heavier than I actually am. Plus, people don‚Äôt understand that weight/nutritional needs are not a one-size-fits-all kind of deal. I remember my dad lecturing me that no adult woman should weigh less than 110 pounds‚Äî when I pointed out to him that I‚Äôm short, he said it doesn‚Äôt matter. Uhhhh, yeah it really does. 110 pounds on someone short is a lot different than 110 pounds on someone of an average height is a lot different than 110 pounds on someone who is tall. You can‚Äôt just pull a random number out your ass and say that‚Äôs what‚Äôs right for everyone. Then you get the people who believe in the whole ‚Äúwomen need 2000 calories per day‚Äù standard who then judge you and accuse you of not eating enough. I mean obviously that‚Äôs true when I‚Äôm active in my disorder, but I had a few years of recovery/remission and ate intuitively, and people were always making comments on how little I eat and telling me to eat more (complete with loads of incorrect nutritional ‚Äúadvice‚Äù disguised as ‚Äúfacts‚Äù).  And there‚Äôs just the general shittiness of people not taking you seriously or treating you like a child. People think it‚Äôs absolutely hilarious to make jokes about me being 16/‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt you be in school right now?‚Äù/‚Äúdo your parents know where you are hahahahaha‚Äù when they know full well how old I am. Then when you get pissed off because you‚Äôre sick of their shit, they laugh some more and say how ‚Äúcute‚Äù it is that you‚Äôre mad.   On the flip side (at least when it comes to weight), yeah you can ‚Äúonly‚Äù lose a pound or two per week, but a pound or two on a short person is a lot more than a pound or two on a tall person. If I lose five pounds everyone notices. If I was 5‚Äô10‚Äù and lost five pounds, it wouldn‚Äôt be quite so obvious. Of course the same is true of gaining weight, but what can ya do ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  One final thing I want to mention is I wouldn‚Äôt put too much thought into supposedly being shorter than you thought.
