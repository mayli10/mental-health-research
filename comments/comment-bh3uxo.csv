Like it‚Äôs helped me so much to be able to joke about it here with people that just get it. It really is a part of our lives and the fact that it isn‚Äôt a staple in everyone else‚Äôs literally blows my mind. Can we please have a purge friendly town that I can move to where we all love and accept each other even if we are all soaked in vomit??,False,False

Like they‚Äôd see me getting covered in spit and vomit and mucus and whatever else is in my throat. Then they‚Äôd see me trying to identify all the things I ate from the partially digested mush like wtf???  Hahahhahaa, I think about this all the time when I'm purging! Like, we talk about this stuff so nonchalantly on ED boards, but I'm 100% certain almost any normal person would be just fucking freaked out and dumbfounded at why and how anyone would do this to themselves.  I'm finally at the point where my mom and sisters know about my ED enough to where I can joke about it, so I made a joke about me being way too scared and grossed out by laxatives, and my sister said something along the lines of, ""No way, I'd way rather take laxatives than throw up; throwing up is literally so digesting, I hate it so much.""  And I just thought to myself how disconnected I am from reality because I remembered when I thought throwing up was gross for a long time too, but now I literally consider it a normal fact of my life. I just forget that it's taboo sometimes.  Everything about purging seems normal. But I bet if someone random was sitting in the bathroom with us, watching us, wow...I couldn't even imagine a reaction like that one. Probably just horror.",False,False

Or pictures of how gross toilets look when you are purging in them 2-5 times a day.,False,True

Whenever you do see it it‚Äôs always some gentle/dainty puke. Where they just kinda cough once and apparently all the food is just gone after 2 seconds of vomiting. Like how about tooth decay, bile breath, acid reflux, busted blood vessels, frog face?",False,False
