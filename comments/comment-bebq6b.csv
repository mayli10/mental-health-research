It helped.  Now that I'm better (started recovery at 16 and I'm 22 now. I've had ups and downs but overall recovered), I have an agreement with one of my best friends who also struggles that we don't talk about EDs, and when we do we leave out triggering details (weight, calories, specific food, among some others). If one of us crosses the line the other informs that we need to stop the conversation there.  Any of these two things might help you and her out.",False,False
