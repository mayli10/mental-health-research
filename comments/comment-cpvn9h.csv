Kids stare, and even if they were staring at you because of your weight, I wouldn't interpret it as judgement/jealousy. I just don't get why you'd assume a child is staring at you because they're jealous of your body, depending on how young they are it's probably not forefront on their mind. I wouldn't see a kid staring at me funny like kids do and interpret it as ""obviously they're jealous of me because they're fat and I'm not üòî"".
