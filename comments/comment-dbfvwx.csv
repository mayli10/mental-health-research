Some people do experience changes in appetite, but technically speaking that is under your control. Many people do experience some amount of weight redistribution (often the breasts get slightly larger, and a slight abdomen pooch may form), which can be mistaken for weight gain, but it's not the same thing.   The skin thing can definitely be an issue, but if you stay away from progesterone-only pills, and the combo pills that use esp problematic progestins (you can google about this), your skin is actually likely to improve (Yaz often has good results).   You can also get a copper IUD, which has no hormones and no maintenance (beyond insertion/removal), and also happens to be as foolproof as contraception gets. If you used condoms in combination with an IUD, the chances of an accidental pregnancy would be astoundingly low.   However, I know none of this info helps if your anxiety is irrational and persistent. Have you ever been in therapy for anxiety?",False,False
