The problem here is not that people are fat or skinny or just about right, we have disordered eating patterns and habits and you're just adding one new thing to the mix. People here don't need a new way to remove fat people here need to find a healthy relationship with food.",False,False

I don't mean to offend you, I'm sure you mean nothing wrong but you're on a sub with very easily triggered people and telling people about ""at home cryo"" is not appropriate.",False,False

My diary, which I can not link, only reflects the actions of a single individual and his struggles with fat.  For the price of a monster energy drink, ice and salt, I'm removing my double chin and chubby cheeks and I have no affiliation with monster, Morten salt or the water works.   There is an alternative to selectively remove body fat, that does not involve eating.   Is it bad that I feel better about myself for removing fat without bringing eating into the equation???",False,True

Either way... I don't want to be petty and report you because I'm sure your intentions are good (I hope) but it might not be quite appropriate for this particularly sub.",False,False
