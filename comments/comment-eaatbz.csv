But I don't have any weight stats, or thinspo on my page, or even a personalized icon. That way, I never personally break any guidelines, but I follow lots of people who do. So I get what I want out of it without actually participating. It's not the best, because I want to be able to upkeep an active page, but I got shut down like every month 6 times in a row. Even though it isn't an optimal solution, I've been able to maintain an account for about 8 months now. Another new perk on the site, there are group chats now. So you can still use the community as a means of accountability!",False,False

It’s pretty secluded on tumblr now because it was the really big pages that got kicked off, the ones with tons of followers lol. But there’s a lot of active Ed accounts on tumblr still. Including mine. :)",False,False

I’ve been lost since the decline of LJ back in like 2013-2014. I should be grateful that hopefully less young people are getting sucked in but I’m sad because I miss my community :(,False,False
