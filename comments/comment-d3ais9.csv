I have my schedule worked around everyone's around me so nobody notices how little I eat. Monday I stop eating after dinner then I don't eat again until dinner Wednesday. Then I don't eat again until dinner Friday. I have to eat on the weekends because I do yard work and I don't think it'd be very ideal to pass out from the heat.,False,True

If you can go 3 days you can go 5. The first day is okay but 2 and 3 are fucking nigh on impossible. Pass that and itâ€™s plain sailing unless youâ€™re already lean - which I ainâ€™t. 48 hours just sounds really hard. If you go for longer though please put yourself on bingeacide watch after because you can and will get refeeding syndrome. r/fasting,False,False

I feel more huge than I am. I've lost 50lbs, but I don't see it. I do 2 48 hour fasts a week. I've been off track the last week though because we were preparing for a hurricane that didn't even hit us. ðŸ™„ Getting back into it is hard. My stomach is screaming at me. Before, I wouldn't even be hungry until 40 hours in. I still restrict coming off a fast. I try to keep my calories under 800. I've been stuck juggling the same 2lbs the last week and it's really getting to me. Like how am I maintaining on 800? Wtf body? Get your shit together.",False,True

Obese people commonly go for months. Fasting is great yes but fuck me itâ€™s hard to get going, the constant â€˜oh I can eat what I want now because Iâ€™ll stop eating for a week anywayâ€™ probably causes more weight then it loses",False,False

Fuck I couldn't imagine 5 days. I wish I could though. Fasting is the only time my mind is mostly quiet because I don't have to think about calories since I'm not taking in any.,False,True
