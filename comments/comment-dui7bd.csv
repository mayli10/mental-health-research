But I believe it can happen for you. At the very least, maintaining a more consistent weight would have added health benefits, even if it took a bit longer to show visually.  Also she just sounds like an asshole then! If she's constantly belittling you/undermining you passive-aggressively then it sounds like she was just trying to get a rise out of you. Like I was trying to imagine how anyone could think it was appropriate to say that but oh, she's just trying to push your buttons, she's doing it on purpose. That tracks.",False,False

Sounds like the person who said that to you belongs to this group of miserable trash.  I know it hurts nonetheless, but these people and their poison are not worth risking your health and life over, ever.  If anything you should do your best to stay on the course of recovery to spite that asshole, they hate nothing more than happy and content people because they never are.",False,False

She yelled at one of my coworkers over the phone a few days ago, and was borderline harassing me all afternoon because she didn’t like the research study. Which was 200% free to leave at any time and was getting paid hundreds of dollars to answer questionnaires. She also asked me how old I was as if I’m not old enough to do my job.  I feel like my stomach has been grossly bloated for seven years, since my first recovery attempt. I’ve relapsed and weight restored several times since then. I’ve seen those redistribution pictures before and it can be a huge difference, but I’m scared it’ll never happen to me.",False,True

I know you can do this. You are so strong. I know how it feels. I hate it when ppl comment on my weight in any way at all. But I know u can do it. Don't give up over one uneducated asshole!!

Once you maintain at a healthy range for longer you'll go through ""body recomp(osition)"" and things will settle down more. Your body is probably trying to protect your organs which have been vulnerable for a long time so that's where it's concentrating its efforts.  Also that participant may just be an asshole. Or if they've seen you over the time you've been in recovery then they may just correlate any weight change with pregnancy even if you don't look like you're ""showing"" at all. But I'm still leaning towards being an asshole bc who doesn't know not to ask people if they're pregnant?? Do you work at ""rude jerk research facility""??  If you look at some people's before-and-after photos (if that's not triggering for you, otherwise DON'T!! DON'T DO IT!!) where they've been maintaining for a few months at the exact same weight, you'll see a WILD change in how their body looks, even when many of them aren't doing any different exercises or eating any differently. Our bodies are just weird machines. I'm sorry this happened to you, you're doing the right thing.",False,False
