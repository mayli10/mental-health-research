I hit a new lw in October and was well on my way to getting to my ugw but guess who lost control and reached her hw 2 weeks ago? This chick. Just gotta pick a day to start and believe in yourself to be honest. I know how shitty it feels to start back from square one but I guarantee one you gain a little momentum you’ll be ok,False,False

Hit a low (130lb) in October several years back, gained all of it back plus more, and even went from being referred to as a “ten” to no one noticing I existed. I haven’t really fixed any of it so I don’t have advice, but I hope you feel better soon and take it easy on yourself.",False,False
