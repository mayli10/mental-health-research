I just dont want to tell myself im going to recover and have all these triggers. thank you and im glad you aren't with your sister and im glad she didn't develop an ed. I hate it.,False,True

Especially if its something ive ate near my sister because I too feel like woah she lost fking 20 pounds in less than a month. I dont know even though I dont think she's actually developing an ed I think its just her being a little narcissist as she does commonly. Ive started going to my car.. like my car! after dinner just so I can purge. then I get rid of it and come back but I have no idea what to do nor do I even know at this point if I want to stop til I lose more than she has.,False,True

I live with my mom and my brothers and sisters. my mom knows about my ed I've been trying to recover for two years now. my sisters just started the whole ed thing because my mom cared so much about my ed struggles. I literally dont feel well being around my sister because it angers me and it just provokes my ed triggers even more. Sadly there isn't another place I can go and if I did im sure my mom wouldn't let me because I am the caregiver at home. I'm the overseer for everything at home :/,False,True

While the origin and function of her purging might not be the same as yours, its still destructive and leads to negative outcomes for her.   Do you live with your parents? It's sad that you are not being protected from this. Living with someone else who is actively engaging in ED behaviors is of course going to trigger the hell out of you.  Is there anywhere else you can go? I feel being around her is not good for you",False,False
