Struggled a ton with disordered eating and made the decision to go vegan partially because of compassion for \~the animals\~ but mostly because of my inner urge to lose weight fast without anyone getting worried.   It's wild how similar we are. I was super strict vegan with no slip ups or ""cheating"" but I just passed my 1 year anniversary of re-introducing fish and eggs into my diet, but I still don't eat cheese, chicken, pork, beef etc. I stopped being vegan because I went through a recovery period and **gained literally** **40 fucking pounds** from pigging out on carbs and vegan junk food.   Going vegan can be a great way to force yourself to eat more fruit and veggies and less high-cal fatty foods but if you're not careful and smart about it, you can end up malnourished AND gain weight. I 100% support a vegan diet, especially when restricting calories, but you gotta do your nutrition research.   &amp;#x200B;",False,False

You can't get enough of it from plant-based sources, so if you go vegan, make sure to also  include fortified nut milks, vitamins and/or a sublingual vitamin B supplement so you don't accidentally kill yourself with malnutrition.

I’m still vegan all these years later because I care about the animals and environment, but a part of me is glad I have a valid excuse to avoid eating certain things since they aren’t vegan. I would say if you are seriously considering veganism, do your research to make sure you’re getting enough of certain vitamins, like B12 and calcium but those can easily come from supplements. Also know that just going vegan alone may not help you lose weight, you might have to restrict calories but it’s easier to avoid junk food when you’re vegan. ",False,False
