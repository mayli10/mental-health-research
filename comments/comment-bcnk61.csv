But it is starting to freak me out again because other than the first 2-3 seconds upon waking up, my chest is literally in constant pain. And quite honestly, I'm not really functional like this. I suppose that if it's something I can't fix on my own, I'll be forced to see a doctor anyway, so there is no point in fearing about taking away a prescription/plastic surgery if it's inevitable. And besides, I probably shouldn't be taking that prescription or getting surgery anyway if they really are bad for me. The doctors won't take those things away from me because they hate me; they'd take them away because that is genuinely what is best for my health. Even if it is ED related, there is no point in not getting help for an electrolyte imbalance only to die on the surgeon's operating table.  If I wake up tomorrow like this, I think I'm going to see someone about it. I can always try my best to hide the fact that I purge. They don't need to know everything to help me.

(**EDIT: This is a massive wall of text, you don't have to read it haha, I'm sorry guys**)  I spent two days bingeing without purging because of fear, and I finally woke up today feeling a little better. I'm 95% sure I have costochondritis, but that doesn't explain the numbness/pins and needles, so I think that was caused by an electrolyte imbalance (the main culprit probably being potassium). I still have pain around my ribcage/chest, but I think the bingeing kind of fixed my electrolyte imbalance because I have regained most of my lost feeling in my left side finally.  That being said, I don't advocate for doing what I did at all. I did tell my boyfriend, but I was fully accepting the possibility that I actually might have died yesterday. Ffs, an electrolyte imbalance alone could kill you. I'm fucking lucky I am a dietetics major and at least had some knowledge on what to do to get my levels back up fast, but something could have easily gone wrong and I could have died in my sleep.  The costochondritis does kind of suck now because it makes it virtually impossible for me to purge now and I have no experience with any kind of chronic pain like that, but most of all, it sucks knowing that I did this to myself. *I* caused this. I was born with a healthy body, but *I* did this. My diet has been fucked the past two months. I chose to abuse stimulants, throw up everything substantial, fast, and keep an intake of &lt;450 Calories every single day I didn't b/p. At best it will be almost fully healed in a couple months, but at worst, if I neglect it and continue to b/p, I'll basically be in chronic pain for life...and that's a scary thought at my age.  That being said, costochondritis is just pain, and technically nothing harmful. It's a much better prospect than cardiac failure or stroke. Because I'm a 19-20 BMI, my ED had me think I'm too fat for those kinds of consequences..but being that I've lost like 50 pounds, it's taken quite the beating already. I didn't think my 1400 Calorie deficit this past month could be harmful, but I guess I was wrong. I'm typing all of this with pain radiating through my sternum, and my ED is still hungry for the next behavior I can do for it. I'm not going to die rn, but if I keep going at my previous pace, I certainly won't live to see 22.  During my 7 years with BED, I would long for another type of ED.. I was such an idiot. Sure, I've lost the weight, but this weight loss is going to kill me. Or at the very least,before that happens, I *will* develop an irreversible heart condition (which is another huge fear of mine rn). All of this because I hate my fat. I don't wish this on anyone, and if anyone is going through something similar, please don't do what I did. If you wanna live, get it checked out. And don't be embarrassed of going because you're ""too fat to receive care for that sort of thing"".",False,False
