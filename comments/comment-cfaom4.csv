Now that I reflect back, having a breakdown over a motherfucking laxative isn't the be all and end all. My legs and stomach hurt from the work out I compensated with - but *why* did I have to compensate? Idk man, EDs are weird.

I literally wanted to blow my brains out over a Pb and J sandwich last night. Youâ€™ve got this, just pace yourself and try your damnedest to not beat yourself up. Remember that you arenâ€™t cursed for eternity, youâ€™ll feel better eventually. Ik you only want to be at peace, so think about it like this: you can still keep going, itâ€™s not to late to walk away from those sad thoughts. Youâ€™re not doomed. If you can push forward past this grief, I commend you, it takes real determination to hunker down and move forward, youâ€™re going to be alright. I hope all the best for you, donâ€™t let Fig syrup be the sole determinant of your life.   ðŸ¤˜ðŸ˜ŽðŸ’ªðŸ’¯strength be with you!",False,False
