And I thought that skinny was normal in all Asians and since I didnt look like them it triggered me to start restricting and being afraid of food.,False,False

Design outfits over thinspo that you draw. Just practice a lot and watch YouTube vids on croqui drawing,False,False

If I may suggest, one at-home hobby I really enjoy is sewing, which comes in handy a lot for me as my size changes a lot, and I’m able to alter my clothes to fit properly",False,True

Congratulations on your new relationship❣ My ED also began before I was a teenager. When I'm in serious restriction mode I have had to break away from my tendencies to solely focus all my attention absorbing thinspo and such. Since my ED began when I was 9 yo, I decided to work with preteens. I volunteered (I don't now bcuz I am sick &amp; unable to any longer) at a women's shelter working with the children of abusive families. I also worked with preteen girls who were with their families in church shelters, getting back on their feet.",False,False

A someone who has bpd and an ed, this sucks lol.   To find any hobbies I enjoy, I really just had to look at things and go, ‘that looks cool, I’ll do that.’ Maybe try something super simple at first. You could possibly learn to crochet or knit? You could start collecting certain items (antiques, furbies, plushies, anything really!). If you had any child hood activities you remember you liked, do those! Coloring is fun and relaxing, and usually pretty easy and low cost to do.   You’ll get there, though! Eventually, you’ll find something you like to do that will take up your time and maybe connect you to a community of people that isn’t Ed related at all!",False,False

Try to maybe morph your Ed interests into normal people interests. Like project runway? Try getting into fashion ! Or art maybe? I like photography a lot and I found that out through body checking so idk, there’s something for everyone lol  Also if you’re any type of minority, it helps connecting to other parts of your identity instead of “just” your ed. For me it helped to know who I was outside of my eating disorder, to try and piece together who I could’ve been without it (and hopefully some day want to become)",False,False

I used to have hobbies that I enjoyed but they’re mostly physical and I don’t have the energy or the strength to do them anymore. The ones that aren’t, I’m too tired or unmotivated to think about doing. I have gotten into reading as of late which is nice. I think I still have those hobbies. I still get excited/envious seeing my friends doing them. I just think it’s a matter of mental and physical energy now. I conserve it for things that require it because I know it’s limited.   I would say to try things out. Even stuff you normally wouldn’t. Try things people around you take interest in. Hopefully one or two might stick.",False,False
