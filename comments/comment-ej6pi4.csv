A big piece of what I am craving is the flavor and texture of the food in my mouth, I guess the sensation of swallowing or the sensation of it being in my stomach arenâ€™t usually that important for me? I typically will have some sort of food item such as string cheese or popcorn or something before &amp; after a c/s sesh also  Itâ€™s definitely not as satisfying as eating the thing but if Iâ€™m gonna like 100% freak the fuck out and binge if I eat it, Iâ€™d rather c/s if I can",False,False

I will eat the healthy foods first, then C&amp;S some of the rest and throw it straight down the toilet so I can avoid any further temptation.   It doesnâ€™t really make cravings disappear, but I mostly crave a certain crunch feeling so just having that food in my mouth for a second helps.",False,False

I just feel like my stomach would be very aware of its continued emptiness, which might even make things worse :/  Good luck to you!",False,False
