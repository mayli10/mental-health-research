I don’t know if it’s even helpful but I can say that for my co-occurring mental health issues I went to two short term residential programs, one long term, PHP maybe five times, and I don’t even know how many short term hospital stays. The doctors had given up. I had basically given up. My brother told me he loved me forever but he was just waiting for my death certificate. And then, somehow, something shifted inside me and things started to improve inside my head. I’m still struggling at times but there’s good days in the mix and I’m 15 months hospital-free.
