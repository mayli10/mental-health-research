Like for me my therapist bills insurance with ednos cause she knows that having an on my health record might make insurance rates higher later. I’m so sorry you have to deal with this, feeling invalidated is awful and you should never have to feel bad or invalidated for making the choice to eat!",False,False

Which may sounds silly but I’ve spent a lot of time in different psych hospitals and they don’t really do much for EDs. At least where I live. I was in one once after overdosing on my meds and I was eating 300 cals a day and all they did was offer me Ensure but not actually watch if I drank it. I wasn’t very underweight but still. I’ve seen loads of people starving and purging in psych units and no one does a thing or even acknowledges it. They seem to only give meds and make sure no one physically harms themselves or others. I’m sorry you are dealing with this,False,False
