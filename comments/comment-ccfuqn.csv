You’re already proving yourself wrong. Just try to remember that the things that feel “safe” to you right now, like starving, b/p, or however your ED manifests are actually not safe at all. These behaviors are destroying your body and mind. In the beginning of recovery, you can’t really trust your own mind what is safe because your mind is lying to you. You have to put your trust in the medical professionals that you are paying to help you. If you feel scared or worried about something, tell them. They should be able to assuage your fears. Even if you feel stupid saying something like “I’m afraid that if I eat this, I will get fat.” They’re supposed to be there and talk you down from those fears. Be strong, lovely one. I know you can do it",False,False

Not going to lie to you and say everything will be great now. It’s going to be stressful and you’re going to be asked to do things that you’re positive you absolutely cannot do. But I promise you that you can and you will do those things and you’ll be better for it. Healing and growth is uncomfortable, but you can do it!",False,False
