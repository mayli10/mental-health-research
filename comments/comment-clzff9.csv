Scary stuff. It happened so quickly I usually wouldn't even be able to catch my self. I hit my head on several desks at school (oddly arousing no suspicion/ concern) and once I fell while standing on my counter getting something from the top shelf. I was so lucky I didn't get a concussion!,False,False

I had knee pain when I was 15 (already had anorexia) and decided to get an x-ray and turned out I had osteosarcoma (a type of cancer) like the guy from The Fault In Our Stars.

It‚Äôs pretty common actually to experience joint pain. I also have it in my hips and elbows. It‚Äôs usually from malnutrition, or if you‚Äôre super sedentary it can be from muscle loss as you said.  Try your best to incorporate some healthy foods where you can in your diet, and maybe research some vitamins to take. Short walks and a set of resistance exercise a day can help too with muscle loss. Please do this, I can promise you won‚Äôt gain any muscle, you‚Äôll just be retaining the muscle you already have ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False
