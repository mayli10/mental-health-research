My bf of over three years is several states away and will be for the (probably short) rest of our relationship, my roommates/close friends just moved out and are an hour away, my best friend from home (10 hour drive) won’t text me back, my closest work friend is moving stores, my dad is ghosting me, and my mom is in Spain.  That was therapeutic and explains this b/p cycle I’m caught in... for real though, I’m a listening ear with plenty of free time if you wanna talk.",False,False
