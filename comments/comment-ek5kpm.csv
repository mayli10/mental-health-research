Don’t let that trick you, you still need water, and you need to drink more than the recommended amount because normal people get a lot of water from the food they are eating  (The two other reasons you can faint is low blood pressure/low heart rate-which drinking lots of water can help with and hypoglycemia which is very very very unlikely during fasting but can be deadly, so be careful)",False,False
