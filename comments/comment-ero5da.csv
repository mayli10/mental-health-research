My family has had some comments that hit me the wrong way, even though I am losing weight that I can afford to lose.  That said, it may be that some of the other clients are struggling with weight gain, and she was lowkey hoping you had a good tip or two to share. I know it's a cliche, but some people really do get the munchies hardcore. I know I did, though it's been decades since I've had any, and not legal where I live. So I'm not likely to find out otherwise any time soon...  Sometimes I wish everyone would keep their mouth shut about others' weight. It's fine to say ""Hey, looking good today!"" Or ""man, you seem to have a spring in your step lately."" It's a compliment that leaves the door open if you do want to chat, but also easy just to thank them and move on.",False,False

Having recovered from anorexia I'm painfully aware of the fact that people who are malnourished do not look good - there's a sunken look around the eyes, people's skin looks grey.  Your body isn't designed to be underweight, it can't out energy into making as much hair so people's hair gets thin.  My point is, if she's complimenting you on your weight loss she's probably got some unhealthy ideas herself about what weight looks good on people.  That doesn't excuse her comments but might go some way to explaining them.  All the best to you OP, it's a terrible, lonely thing to be dealing with.
