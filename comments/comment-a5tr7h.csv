They only highlight the healthy aspects of course (readily available fruits and vegetables) but never address the EDs. All of their beauty standards are just messed up in general. They advocate use of whitening creams without a care of what's in them.  And the craziest part are the families. Your Asian aunties make fun of you to your face when you gain weight but then nag you to eat more of their dishes. Wtf is that about?? ,False,False
