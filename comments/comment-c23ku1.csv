I'm doing better. For me, it was more of a habit than a disorder. I took my habit and viewed it as having next to no self control. But I'm learning that's not the case. I'm learning that by repeatedly thinking I have an ED, I develop even more ED habits. I constantly surrounded myself with my ""ED"", whether it was through this subreddit or through my diet tracking app. I had to remove myself from the rules I manifested over the years. ""I ate too much lunch so I need to skip dinner to make up for the extra calories."" I stopped doing this. I stopped trying to correct my ""mistakes"". Because all that would happen was I'd be thinking about my diet (aka: clocking in hours that would further convince me that I have an ED) and more times than not, I'd give in and binge eat later that night. Recently, I've been able to stop myself from eating late at night and it alone has transformed my diet. Usually, after a night's binge, I'd wake up with the idea/mindset that today was going to be the day I hunkered down and got serious about my diet. But again, all that would happen would be me clocking in even more hours towards developing the thought ""yes, you do have a problem."" And when you feel like you have a problem, you tend to make excuses for yourself. ""oh you gave in because you binge eat. It's just what you do. You can't stop once you start."" It's just negative thought after negative thought until it consumes all of your thoughts. But trust me, it's as complicated as you allow it to be. Don't let bad habits form then get obsessed over ridding yourself of your disorder. It was only fuel the disorder.",False,False
