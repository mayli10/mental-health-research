Idk why I keep them bc they’re not even good quality but I think it’s just the principle... like “fuck it I’m going to fit them eventually so I can’t get rid of them”,False,False

And the sizing of women’s clothing is so unpredictable that my brain waves away as useless data whatever number currently fits. But when a pair of pants I tried on today was too tight at the knees, you better believe my brain noted *that*. (My knees were the first thing I started worrying was ‘fat’...at age 8. Sadness.)",False,False

Helps hide the weight loss a bit so no one asks though so that's nice. But honestly I just don't want to spend money on clothes.,False,False
