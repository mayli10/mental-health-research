I have this friend that I always look at and think, ""God I wish I was skinny like her/had a flat stomach like hers/etc"" Well she was going to a fancy party and was sad that she didn't have any nice clothes and couldn't afford to buy new ones. So I brought a bunch of my fancy clothes over to her house so she could borrow something. She literally couldn't get most of them over her hips and definitely couldn't zip anything. It left her feeling bad about herself and then I felt horrible because I never would have done that if I had any CLUE how much bigger than me she is. I genuinely thought she was so much smaller than me!! I came home and cried to my husband about how fucked up my body dysmorphia is and how I made my sweet friend feel bad about herself because I have no grasp on reality. Fuck EDs",False,False
