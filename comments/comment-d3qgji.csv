I’m a product designer for  a protein shake company.  I mean everything has calories so it’s not like you can avoid them.  It’s dumb that they let us say 0 calories for 4 calorie items but it’s marketin that usually makes that call.,False,False

Because if you ate 100 4kcal things that would be 400kcal which isn’t insignificant. Essentially you could just say well... half a gram of lucky charms is less than 4kcal therefore 0kcal.. so I can eat endless lucky charms and it’s no calories? No   Protein contains calories (4 per gram). And BCAA are protein. The chances of you actually using protein for energy are minimal unless your deficit is quite large.,False,False

So because BCAA powder just has 3 specific amino acids (proteins) instead of some balanced distribution like real food, according to the FDA it has zero protein, therefore it is zero calorie. Way to put the F in FDA.  80 calories sounds way too high unless these scoops are huge. BCAA are 4.65 cal/g, and the powder is probably only half BCAA.",False,False
