Yes, walking your dog is a good thing you are getting steps and burning calories while you are bonding with your doggo.",False,False

I needed to get this off my chest so hard. Most of my friends are men (aka: TWO WOW), so the scant two women I regularly talk to who I thought could listen just made me so... depressed with their reaction. I would like to gym/go rockclimbing with a friend but unfortunately the one person I feel I can go with doesn't know how to drive and I don't know as well. Walking my dog longer just seems like a better option even if I hate the sun/going outside. At least he's happy when I'm not.",False,True

Like, shut the fuck up PLEASE. And it isn't ''uwu concerned about your health'' .. it is ''you are a fat ass and ugly lose weight' lmao.  Anyway as for the gym - I avoided the gym for months, but I know that I need some exercise, I was gonna go to a gym where a friend goes but then realised that it would make me even MORE uncomfortable. And I would rather go to a gym rather than run around in my home town where everyone knows you and will start talking.  &amp;#x200B;  I hope you kinda go with the healthiest option. Good luck",False,False
