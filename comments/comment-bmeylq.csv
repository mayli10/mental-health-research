I‚Äôve had a very similar experience lately (got very frustrated with the posts on the fasting sub about fasting for dayyys and feeling aaaamazing.) I *can* fast, but I‚Äôm a barely-functional, dizzy, cold, mentally obsessed train wreck (though supplementing electrolytes admittedly does help). Ngl, kinda pissed at my body over this, but a small corner of my brain recognizes this belief that I shouldn‚Äôt need food...is more my irrational ED talking than a genuine desire to fast for any purported health benefits.  Some of the current pop culture surrounding fasting strikes me as concerning (and likely toxic for those dealing with an ED). I get these vibes from fasting peeps about not listening to my body and glorifying zero intake that are just crazy dangerous and triggering to my brain.",False,False
