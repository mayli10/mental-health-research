I only use it if it's necessary (cooking in steel pan etc) and even then it's as little as possible. Just out of curiosity I put some olive oil on my salad and didn't make the taste any better. I'm not sure if it's just my ED but yeah - why have it when I can go without it. I'm not talking about deep frying of course, which I avoid as if I'm allergic LOL.     ",False,False

It's such a high calorie count for a taste so mediocre and fruitless. And the worst part is that you never fully know if it's in food that you haven't personally prepared yourself or how much of it is in there. Butter is not a food item that people often properly measure. Most people just ""eye ball"" it which usually leads the serving going from a tbsp to, like, three. And they don't even realize it. Same thing with oil- except oil just may be the worser evil out of the two because a lot of uninformed people think olive oil/coconut oil/etc is ""sooo healthy"" and usually end up downing it in fucking globs of saturation because they just genuinely don't know any better.   Damn, I was not expecting to this thread to make me so heated lmao. Butter has scorned me far too many times and the wound is raw, I guess ðŸ˜‚ ",False,False

Twinsies.  I think it's because it's so high calorie but it doesn't fill you, plus it's optional and doesn't actually add anything to food once you get used to having it without. For me at least.  Here's to one day being able to eat butter without longing for death ðŸ‘Œ",False,False
