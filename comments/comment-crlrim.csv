Dont try to restrict but dont use it as am excuse to binge either. Serve yourself a portion that is regular (2-3 slices of bacon) and regular amounts of other things too. If you're still hungry when you're done, wait 10-15 mins and if you're still hungry after that, get some more! If you're full before you finish, or once you finish, just try saying, ""wow that was great grandma, I'm full now though"" and if she pushes you to have more say you dont want to feel full still when the next meal comes around.  Basically- try to be a normal eater for this one day, it wont stall your progress like you think it will. If you naturally overeat one day, your body will feel less hungry the next (if you havent been super heavily restricting)  Anyways. Good luck",False,False
