First figure out what happened such that you got a surprise bill - half the time, istg, it's the company essentially making stuff up just to see if they can get you to pay more. Even if it turns out to have been your mistake, shift as much blame to the company as you can. (Which I realize sounds unethical, but in the world of shitty health insurance, there is no ""ethical."" The whole thing is a game of made-up numbers and bargaining, and if you aren't persistent, clever, and assertive, the insurance company won't hesitate to screw you. Never worry about their alleged bottom line, only worry about yours.)   Emphasize that you are not able to pay the bill in full. Offer to pay some amount of it, but insist to them that if they attempt to charge you $855, the debt is going to end up in collections bc you literally can't pay it. This is often a sticking point - providers would almost always rather get a guaranteed sum of money now, than end up chasing clients into collections.  These are the lessons I have learned from disputing charges on my aunt's behalf. Be prepared to spend an irritating amount of time on the phone, and for the company to stonewall you repeatedly at first. You just have to keep calling, and being a figurative asshole (if that makes sense), while also being really polite and friendly to the representative you're currently speaking with.   Ugh. It's all so stupid, and I'm sorry you're dealing with it.",False,False

Many many lumps end up being benign, so drink some tea, take a bath or whatever else makes you feel cozy, and try to take your mind off of things. (Not easy, I know. I say this hypocritically as someone with literal hypochondria).   I really advocate for doing anything right now that makes you feel better - this is the time for self care! Wishing you a clean bill of health (I mean, aside from eating disorder bullshit, I wish you well with that too tho), and some calmness ðŸ’•",False,False
