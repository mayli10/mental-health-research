I was truly probably EU size 50, but for some reason the work pants were numerically in these huge sizes even though the fabric was really rigid and they were almost tight on me. Yikes! Now I wear a S shirt and M pants in my scrubs. It’s nice.",False,False

That summer, I got a job at subway. I didn’t really realize how much weight I gained, my ED brain WASNT really turned on as often I guess back then. I still assumed I was kinda small. When I was hired, she asked me what size shirt I was, and I said prob a small (adult sizes). She looked at me and said “maybe I’ll just get you a large”. Jesus. 110 now. If she saw me now she prob wouldn’t have recognized me.",False,False

A few years ago I was stuck with an xs when I should have had an M. I didnt ask for a small size :( I was forced into it and I felt terrible until I started restricting heavily and lost the weight to fit it. It was a tough time.,False,False
