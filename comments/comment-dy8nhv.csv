Apparently I’m the go to person for diet/food talk now (they know I’ve lost a bunch of weight but not the ed part) so every time that stuff comes up I just want to cry. Sometimes even family members skipping meals because they’re tired or because they just had a snack (even if they’re not dieting) is a bit of a trigger too.,False,False
