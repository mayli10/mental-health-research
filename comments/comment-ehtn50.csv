I have a high dose of Zoloft and that's been working for me. I also take anti-psychotics. I hate the side effects so much but I haven't gained any weight,False,False

Wellbutrin was alright. It made me feel kind of shaky sometimes. I had to stop taking it because of how restless I was. I think there are better anti depressants out there, at least for me. I’m off of them now because the side effects made me depressed in a whole different way. Like I wasn’t wanting to die all the time but I felt flawed and messed up because of the physical side effects, the emotional numbing, and feeling dependent on them. That being said, medications work different of everyone. A doctor’s opinion is worth 100x more than mine though. And there’s so many options now.",False,False

I also take vyvanse but on the days I didn't take Vy I still had a decreased appetite. The side effects fucked me up in the first week (increased anger and anxiety) but I think I'm just having a ""me"" breakdown atm.  Apart from the appetite decrease it's meh but that could be because of my life rn. Too scared to weigh myself but I will in a few weeks and see where I'm at.   Both times I've taken Prozac it hasn't helped my binge urges and although I lost weight due to nausea in the first two weeks, I still b/p and fluctuated. I didn't take Prozac for long because I lost my libido",False,False

Can't remember the name, sorry.  The second time I went on antidepressants, they helped alleviate my depressed and suicidal thoughts quite a bit, I lost a bit of weight because I was basically knocked out for the first two weeks, and I've had no side affects whatsoever.  It really does differ from person to person and from medication to medication so the only way to really know is to just try them, unfortunately. Good luck.",False,False

Prozac didn't do anything for me mental health or appetite wise. I think Wellbutrin helps with mental stuff a bit, but I'm not sure about the appetite side of things. But, I should say I have bipolar and take a lot of other meds which come into play so I'm not the best case study really.",False,False

Which is what makes finding a good med or med combo and dose so challenging.   They usually take several weeks to achieve efficacy, and unpleasant side effects are a thing, but for some people antidepressants are a massive help, so it can definitely be worth checking out. I’m getting the best outcome pairing meds with therapy (and the therapy is the bigger piece). Depending on the person, some psych meds can worsen some symptoms but when I’m super depressed/destructive it’s been hard to know what’s me and what might be the meds. So, I’ve found it important to be really open with my prescriber and to track my mood/symptoms so I can try to see what’s happening overall.   I super hope you’ll find a treatment approach that’s helpful for you! Depression is a bitch and the suicidal thoughts can get so overwhelming/exhausting. I hope you get a break from the chaos soon &lt;3",False,False

Research short term side effects though as completely honestly, they were horrific for me",False,False
