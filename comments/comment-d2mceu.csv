In short, yes you can, your brain makes it up as a way to cope. But it's not the ED that's the issue, it's what it's hiding. However, you can't make up your ED in the sense that you've been faking it. What you've experienced is valid and real.  She does a far better job of explaining it than I could ever do. https://youtu.be/BDCs6q0wgz4  No two people have the same experience of an illness.
