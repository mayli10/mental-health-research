I don’t know how people can keep all this inside. I’m really lucky that I work in the sort of place where I can (somewhat) be open about mental health/ real weird diet things.   I work in a kitchen as the sous chef and now the servers always come to me first to ask what has more protein/iron/calories or tips on dieting. Which is both flattering and terrifying. Most of them don’t assume I have an eating disorder ^tm because I’m not rail thin and they do see me eat normalish food (because it’s free so I eat my one meal a day there) and drink.   But if I had to worry about telling people “oh I’m not eating today, can I order you something?”  Or can say hey I wore this slutty outfit today because I fasted for a few days and love how I look. I’d go crazy",False,False
