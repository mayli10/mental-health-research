So I'm new on posting here, the first comment you got up there was also mine, so that person deserves the world for not leaving me alone.  Not being underweight doesn't mean you don't have an ED or that you're not developing one, it's a huge variation, we are not the same.  I am not diagnosed with an ED, I just know that I am not loving myself the way I should and I am not taking care of myself, so seeing your post hit close.   If you believe you need help ask for it, there are lots of places willing to give you that help you need, and if you need someone to talk to here I am. Things get better, fight for it. Our minds can be tricky sometimes but it can get better.  — I believe the topics you shouldn't touch are numbers (weight), no tips on how to do something that could be bad for your health, no shaming other. Those are a some of the rules.",False,False

If anyone could perhaps let me know the topics which may potentially be triggering I'd very much appreciate it as the last thing I want to do is trigger people.   Please take care.",False,True

Just know that you are perfect the way you are, your sister might be jealous because you are healthy, if this is starting go seek professional help, it might stop!! If you need someone to talk to you can always talk to us, but some topics here are sensitive so be careful for triggera. Much love❤️",False,False
