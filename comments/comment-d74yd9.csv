If mfp is making you feel undue guilt which you feel will cause further b/p, don't log it. If you feel it could lead to helping you curb the b/p by seeing how many calories you've b/p'd, then keep logging.   That is how I logic it.   If I am feeling utterly horrible, I won't log it to save myself the head and heartache of tracking it all. If its because I've been low restricting and absolutely need to eat, then I track it; sometimes by tracking and taking things slow, I am able to curb it into a normal meal and congratulate myself on having ate normally rather than b/p.",False,False
