I’d always been naturally skinny &amp; I had unconscious portion control, when I was fourteen in late September 2019 my friends mom called me during lunch while I was developing my disordered eating to tell me that one of my best friends had attempted suicide and she was currently in the hospital. My parents were on a business trip and all I did was cry, I binged when I got home and the purged than passed out and woke up at 9 pm than didn’t sleep or eat for two days and when I did I purged it. My parents were gone and I felt alone not to mention completely trapped.",False,False

It was pretty far from home and I was extremely stressed &amp; depressed every day, honestly the worst depression I’ve ever had. My roommate was also a shitty person. Sometime towards the end of my first semester I started unintentionally eating less. I wasn’t obsessing about it, I just stopped eating as much as usual, but still things that are mow my fear foods (pizza, fries, etc.). Then at the beginning of my second semester it got worse. I was eating 1 or 2 small bowls of salad a day, sometimes I wouldn’t eat at all and just get wasted at night and cry over everything that was stressing me out. Then the counting started. One day, I spontaneously started looking at food in the cafeteria and thinking “That’s too many calories. I can’t eat that.” And it all went downhill from there.",False,False

Parents yelling at me and my sibilings for buying sweets (""You could get so much ham for the price!""). And them filling the fridge with meat, meat, more meat. Meat only.  So during my teenage years I starved despite the fridge being full. Now I live on my own so I binge, then I regret it and purge and starve myself.",False,False

fgezjlp,t3_exzsql,t3_exzsql,Uni-Applicant,1,2020-02-03 01:56:36,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/exzsql/what_brought_about_your_ed/fgezjlp/,"My parents, especially my father, always pushed food on me. I had to eat what he wanted, when he wanted, how much he wanted... He wanted me to eat as much as my cousin who was living with us at the time, who's 6'5"". I asked my mom to join ballet classes, but my mom said no because ""they're all anorexic"". Eating that much, with no exercise, I started packing on weight. My father mocked me for the weight gain and would call me ""deformed,"" and would walk around like a sumo wrestler and blowing his face up with air, pretending the floor was shaking because of my weight as I walked into the room. That's when I started a pattern of disordered eating that didn't do much if anything to change my weight, but already showed problems (I'd go without eating and then just have sugar free jello, but then binge and use laxatives).   He decided that I should start going to the gym that was far away and in a difficult place to get to with a lot of very steep hills (it was also extremely hot, so I'd become mentally confused from the heat, water bottles weren't a thing in that place at that time so I could only drink water at home or at the gym), and I was also not allowed to take the bus so he ensured I never had access to any money.   So I started exercising, losing weight, as it progressed I used more and more laxatives and diuretics, and just drinking diet coke and forgoing food. I recognised the weight loss, the body changes - yes, there were problems in how I did things but I viewed myself in a relatively normal fashion. I changed cities to attend high school, and went through a period of relative normalcy.  Until body dysmorphia hit. I created a dieting blog, my BMI was &gt;!20.4!&lt; so far from fat. But I felt huge. I still remember my first post, it's been 17 years and the blog is long gone but I still remember. I introduced myself, said I was 164cm and 55kgs, my parents wanted to vacation at the beach and I needed to lose weight. I intentionally sought other proana blogs (I'd become familiar with foreign - i.e., American - proana sites, but local proana blogs and sites were just starting 17 years ago where I'm originally from). I started meeting people, and they looked up to me. Having narcissistic parents and being abused by them, and out of sudden having the admiration and encouragement of people, and also control over something (food), gave me the strength to go on, to numb my pain (of the things my parents did to me). So I went further down into it \[than previously\].  For my recovery, the psychiatrist wanted to send me to a rehab facility based on my parents' testimonies, but they wanted to keep me at home to further abuse me. I was also misdiagnosed with bulimia because my mother lied that I was vomiting in the bathroom -  I do think that, at the time, anorexia would be fitting, however. I won't detail here what they did to me, but they ignored everything that the dietician wanted to do (she set a number of calories for me to have, and a set menu to eat every day, plus a weight that would be healthy for me, and not just borderline at the 18.5 - but my mom wanted something 10 kgs (=22 lbs) above that. So eventually my ED morphed into something else - I now binge eat, and have become an obese adult for most of my adult life - although I've relapsed the opposite ways a few times, and even lost entire sections of hair in my head to the point it looked shaven (due to severe malnutrition).  But when I go for help to lose weight in a healthy way, I'm just told ""welp, eat better, control your portions"". Ok, and how does that help someone with an ED? I'm either binging or starving myself.   Anyway, that's my story of how my EDs started/progressed.",False,False

In the last year I got a full-time job that has been a generally good experience for me, but it also demands a certain level of perfection and standards I have to consistently meet. So while I’ve been doing a good job, my self-worth began to rely on meeting these standards and being perfect. That eventually led to me needing to be perfect in every area of my life- including my body. This led quickly to restrictive eating, and then to fasting 24/7.  The OCD makes me believe if I’m not perfect, bad things will happen. So it kinda feeds into all these different areas of my life.   I’m sure there’s a lot more to it than just that, but historically OCD is a big contributor to eating disorders. So keep an eye out for obsessive compulsive tendencies.",False,False
