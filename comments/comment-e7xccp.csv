Mine would give the compliments about outfits, hair, etc., in the beginning of seeing her.  Yet the ED sort of spiraled as the therapy continued.  When it became out of control, and was very UW, her entire behavior def showed some counter-transference.  She'd yell at me, make snide comments, at one point, after her becoming frustrated that I wouldn't gain, she said, ""your hands look like a skeleton"", with disgust.  Thank you for your detailed comment, very appreciated!",False,False

My apologies,  I been having a rough time with the holidays &amp; am going back to my old ways. I hate the holidays because of the eating in front of my family &amp; friends. Its more stressful than the million of questions for wearing baggy clothes. i am so sorry. I just want to run away from these people that think eating to eat is ok. It makes me really upset &amp; I dont want to make my family &amp; friends sabotage my Gw. I'm so fustrated &amp; am dying inside from the food I literally force down to keep them off my back. It makes me feel more out of control than ever.",False,False

I'd say it completely depends on why your therapist compliments you. if they're pointing out an accomplishment of yours or something you do well, by all means take the compliment!",False,True
