Like, buddy...  I will say that I don't think I'll ever truly water fast, just ""no calorie"" fast. That's why I was there in the first place, I just wanted to know if things like gum and 0 cal drinks would do something like make me extra hungry, but I just came out frustrated.   Like, if they can drink their weird homemade Gatorade, I'm going to drink the 0 calorie ones from the store and be fine. If the only issue is sweeteners I think it'll be okay. That's me drawing my own lines with no research backup, but whatever lol. I don't know where my arbitrary line on creamer would be, but definitely not unless it's 0 calories.",False,True

Like I want to just not eat and be like ""this is fine.""   But they're so stupid. One time I got downvoted for saying ECA stacks are bad for you. Yesterday I saw them talking about being lightheaded and Spacey and someone seriously goes ""I believe it's the spirit becoming less reliant on the body""   I would be roflmao if it wasn't so depressing how dumb they are.",False,False

I follow some fasting subreddits because I do IF, and that question gets posted like 50 times a day.    Is it that difficult to drink black coffee? Is fasting not simple and self explanatory enough without someone thinking there are loophole exceptions? I'm sorry, I'm frustrating myself again here ðŸ˜… I think I'm just imposing my dumb black and white food rules on other people.",False,False

A 30 day fast is not something you do for health and you don't spur people on to do it.  &amp;#x200B;  Honestly they just seem to like their echo chamber there. It strongly reminds me of anti-vaxxers using their own person and questionable experience as evidence. So much bro science as well.",False,False

Diet culture on forums is always going to be a circle-jerk that supports the diet. Nobody wants to hear that there is limited research about their beloved diet or heaven forbid there is strong evidence that the diet doesn't work. It is very self-defeating as someone who is almost a dietitian who has a very moderate view of food to get hung up on the public's perception of dieting. All I can do is provide evidence-based information and enforce what I believe is healthy based on science.",False,False
