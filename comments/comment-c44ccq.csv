She suffered from one herself when she wasn’t much older than me, so she still views skinny as beautiful. Like anyone who suffers she wouldn’t wish it on anyone, so I feel she tried to promote body positivity for me from a very young age - she’d tell me I wasn’t skinny, but she’d also call me beautiful and pretty constantly. But then as I got older, she’d comment on people’s skinny legs and said, “god wouldn’t you kill for legs like that?” and continued with the ‘you’re not skinny’ and so that became an insult. I come from a pretty weight-based family, so me being not skinny was definitely an insult, especially as I developed dysmorphia at the age of four (I was a freakishly tall kid. A teacher said, ‘wow, what have they been feeding you?’ Commenting of course on my height, I thought she was calling me fat). Once I hit puberty the pretty comments stopped but the ‘You’re not skinny ‘ ones continued, and then I was looking through pictures of me at the age of 10-12 before I hit puberty and god I was a skinny kid, I can’t believe I thought I was fat because I couldn’t have been further from it. But I was like, “oh my god look at my hair I was so blonde” “aha I look so little there awww” and my mom was like “look at your skinny legs!!!” years of getting told I wasn’t skinny and then, wow, I was? That fucked with my head.  I’m sorry for the off topic rant and managing to make it about myself.   I wish you the best for your recovery, nobody deserves to go through this.",False,False

I am 26 now and when I was your age I spent 6 weeks in a hospital fighting this. I was doing really well for a while and then have relapsed a bit because life circumstances are triggering me.  I really hope you can get well. Please listen to your mom. I know it is really hard to deal with this, and I really dont wish it on anyone. It saddens me especially when I hear that kids are dealing with this.",False,True

Bad fucking move. I didn’t stop eating, now I actually think I’m chubby and it’s not just my dysmorphia. I wish I could have done this and just gained two pounds rather than twenty",False,False
