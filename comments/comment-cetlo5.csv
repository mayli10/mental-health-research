I was actually really shocked because I've always thought that if my parents had just let me figure out food without all the rules I wouldn't be in this mess. I'm really sorry about that!  My parents never did anything super militant with food, certainly nothing like some of the horror stories I've read here. We also were mostly okay financially, and when we did run into trouble more than once they did a good job of it never affecting what or how much we ate, so we were never in any kind of ""famine"" or ""food crisis.""  That said, it was still weird. I don't really know where to start, even. I was pudgy for most of my childhood, but super active. Like, *hyper*active. I was always running around and wearing out my shoes, socks, pants, and stockings, I could never get rid of my energy fast enough. Except when I sat down to read books about dragons, lol. Anyway, I played lots of sports but again, stayed puppy-chubby. Which seemed normal, my doctor frequently said that the way that I grew was ""out, then up,"" I needed to gain a few pounds before I could have a growth spurt. Which worked just fine for me, cause there were so many yummy foods to try.   I loved snacks, and still do, and idk what about it rubbed my mom the wrong way, but it did. Maybe she thought I didn't need that much food, maybe she didn't know just how hungry I was or how much activity I had done during the day, but she started making comments that stuck with me forever. Nothing really nasty, but you know. In *that* tone. She herself is super mired in diet talk and always has been, so I guess it was only a matter of time before it seeped into our relationship. But I started not trusting myself with food, and feeling guilt and shame around eating. At the same time though, food was a reward, and withdrawal of it was a punishment. Misbehave? No dessert tonight. Good report card? Pick a restaurant to celebrate!   It got more complicated the first time I wanted to be vegetarian, at 10. Food for her and my father was a show of love, and they both put a lot of time, effort, and energy into making good and healthy dinners to show my brother and me, and each other, how much we were loved. They also come from a meat-centric culture, so you can see how it got difficult. I was rejecting the food they prepared, and by extension the love they were offering. I didn't have the agency to become vegetarian until years later, but it remained a point of conflict at mealtimes.   Around the same time, I started restricting my own intake. I was being bullied at school for being chubby, and also for my ""ethnic"" lunches. My mom was constantly going on and off diets, and I remember reading all the diet books she had lying around. She frequently complained about her body, specifically her legs, and so I started looking at myself more critically, too. I remember the very first time I looked in horror at my reflection in the mirror, at school at ten years old. I started throwing away my lunch without eating it, which made me feel bad for wasting food but good for not eating it and not subjecting my ""friends"" to the smells and tastes of it. My mom caught on somehow and started grilling me about it, since she was the one who would make my lunch every morning. I'm sure it again felt like I was rejecting her love, and it upset and hurt her deeply.   Unfortunately, I was only getting more and more confused. I still loved snacks and desserts, but no longer felt like I deserved them. But I wanted them so badly, and I was hungry all the time. I started binging after school after not eating all day. Whole packages of food would literally disappear down my throat daily, and when questioned I always blamed my brother or my father, since we all liked the same things anyway. I kept getting away with it, and started gaining weight.   Alarmed, my mom took me to a nutritionist, and the food comments kept coming. ""Stop *eating*"" she would say if I made more than one trip through the kitchen to get a snack. More guilt and shame, and more secrecy. I snacked in secret now, an expert at lying and hiding by 11. Not just my binges, but even regular sized snacks too. I kept gaining weight, and so the comments turned into restrictions. ""No more than one X,"" ""We can't keep Y in the house anymore,"" ""Don't order Z at a restaurant.""   Some foods we never even got to try at all, like cereal. We were never allowed to have it. To this day, cereal is a fear food in any quantity and a major binge trigger. Crackers and bread come next, because they used to be among my favorite snacks and the ones most frequently taken away from me when I got caught eating more than one tiny serving. Desserts, because of their exalted status, are also weird now. I have to be worthy of a dessert, and I so seldom am. When I want to punish myself, I take away my dessert.  If I ever knew how to eat intuitively, I've long since lost that super power. I can't blame my parents or my classmates, even the bullies. It was just a bad environment all around, and I'm sure there has to be some genetic factor too. Everything just kind of compounded in exactly the wrong way and now here I am, almost a decade after my first diet at 10.   I didn't mean for this to turn into a novel. Thank you, if you read all of it. And again, sorry for hijacking your post. Thanks for sharing your experience here.",False,False
