My opinion on it.. well, it's sad how much we pay attention to our looks that we forget about how we should be beautiful inside, too. Especially in Asia (I'm from Asia), lookism is something that is prevalent. Everyone just wants to be beautiful. Everyone just wants to look like the next big thing. Everyone wants to be beautiful but forget they have to be beautiful on the inside, too.  &amp;#x200B;  Also, I can understand Mirae's character in a sense that she face or body scans people and rates them in her head, because she's aware of her own insecurities, and wishes she could look like somebody else. As for Sua, I think this drama just shows that even people considered to be beautiful by society have problems and insecurities they bottle inside themselves. Sua, having no outlet for her issues, project her insecurities out on other people, like Mirae. People automatically assume that if you're conventionally attractive, you're already living a life better than everyone else. However, the drama shows that that isn't exactly the case; looking a certain way does not guarantee you a life without problems.",False,False
