Obviously them saying “healthier” to me means I’m a fat fuck who shouldn’t eat, but people are so ignorant about weight gain. Gaining that fast is not healthy. Plus I was eating basically all carbs and sugar so I was all kinds of vitamin and mineral deficient, to the point where I was getting daily injections. I wasn’t underweight anymore so no one gave a fuck, but I was healthier when I was!",False,False

I've gone from a borderline underweight BMI to a BMI of 20. Big deal, right?  I cant complain about that in front of ANYONE. Its technically healthier and apparently I look """"""healthier"""""" but my BD disagrees and noone understands :(",False,False

If I mention it, I get “oh that’s okay,” or “you don’t look like it,” or my favorite “no you haven’t.” I feel out of control and when people diminish it and trivialize it I feel so much worse.

It was good for them - not good for me. Honestly, I just don't bother talking about weight gain. It's one of those rare things that I'm ashamed of, but everyone else encourages.  Of course, everyone is different - your mileage may vary - yada yada.",False,False
