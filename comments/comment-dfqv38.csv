A few years ago during a relapse, I actually recognized that I needed medical intervention and I wasnâ€™t even underweight. But that was a REALLY hard realization to get to. Itâ€™s like... we can convince ourselves that we arenâ€™t sick enough, that this is normal, etc.  Try maybe to pretend this is a friend doing these behaviors and having these thoughts. I tried that with my anxiety so that instead of beating myself up, I would just kind of feel bad for that person and think that they deserve help. If it would worry you in a friend, youâ€™re there ðŸ’•",False,False

As someone who has also been the person helping someone with mental illness, I can tell you that losing you would break their heart. Caretaker burnout IS real, I got exhausted taking care of my friend, but that was nothing to do with her and just how stress and worry effects you.   I can promise you, things can be fixed. Honestly if you fail school? You can absolutely fix that. Another year, makeup classes, tutoring, like, messing up one year of school will never ruin your life.   And I know it feels like there is no recovery but there really is!! I was doing great for over a decade, itâ€™s absolutely possible for you.   I totally get being exhausted from all of this. Which, to me, says you really need some help and professional care. One of my friends has spent so many times at the ER and been admitted for suicidal ideation and he has been so glad he has gone each time.   You sound so sensitive and good, and also really ill. You deserve health and happiness and you ABSOLUTELY deserve to ask for it. ðŸ’•",False,False
