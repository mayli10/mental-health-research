I was at rock bottom and the absolute worst I had ever been when I saw it, and it completely fucked me up due to how it was both immensely relatable and immensely triggering. My friends invited me to see it with them after I had already watched it, and although I really wanted to go, I turned down the invite and explained that the themes just hit too close to home. This is the most terrifying movie I've ever seen, yet it's one of my favorites. I love psychological horror.",False,False

I might watch it tonight because I have the DVD too. I always saw it as more of a s/h story than a ED one.   I also really vibe on the crazy mother aspect. IDK about y'all but the first person I was never enough for was my mother ðŸ˜‡,False,False
