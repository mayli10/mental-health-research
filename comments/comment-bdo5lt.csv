I was sick with mono which made me so fatigued that I'd get home at night and go straight to bed without eating. I was making $8.50/HR at the time, and paying all my own bills + helping out my mom who was between jobs. I had literally no money for food, was horribly ill, stressed out, and working an active job. I felt and looked awful, but I lost weight really consistently, and all I ever heard was compliments on my weight loss. I was like I'm literally starving!!! I'm about to be living on the street because neither my mom or I can pay rent and I sold my shitty car for cash so I can't even drive to the grocery store!! I lost so much weight during that 8 or so months I'd rather gain 80lbs a month than ever go back to living like that.",False,False
