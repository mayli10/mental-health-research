As long as you're not severely deficient it won't be considered a problem.,False,False

My blood work was great when I had a BMI of 30, but that did not make me healthy, and my doctor was still recommending I lose weight (not in a pushy way at all, just a matter-of-fact type conversation)   So your blood work is great, but your doctor still wants you to gain some weight because that would be the healthier thing to do for your overall wellbeing.",False,False

Just because you are ""okay"" now doesnt mean you aren't affecting your relationship with your body and with your intake habits. This not only could cause issues in the future but it can also make you miserable and exhausted and confused and all the other stuffs...that matters too.",False,False

IOW you don't have to have ALL the symptoms to have an ED... and it's great that you're not deficient in stuff!",False,False
