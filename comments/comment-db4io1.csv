I find that when I’m stuck alone at home on my rare days off during the week that my habits get a lot worse.   I find the best way to get my head out of a funk is to switch up my environment- I like going for walks and playing Pokémon go or walking to do a simple errand or to a coffee shop. Something like that.   Keeping busy is the most important. I try to make a list of things to do most mornings and work my way through them. When I find myself growing bored or just want to shove my face with spaghetti I move on through my list.   I should also say that while fasting can be a part of a normal(ish-debatable- who knows- whatever) you have to be careful about letting it get too far. Listen to your body, if you are fasting longer than usual pay attention to how you are feeling and know it’s always okay to break a fast if that is what your body needs. Keeping up with water, and electrolytes helps a ton. And be mindful of strenuous activities like exercising, long walks or heavy cleaning on your weekends.",False,False
