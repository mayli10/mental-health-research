I already have some additional risk factors for cancer, since I have both Hashimoto's and Mast Cell Activation Disorder, so I'm kind of scared even though I know thyroid cancer's really rare. Unfortunaltey I think some of my doctors are brushing me off as a hypochondriact (I stopped telling them that I'm a bio major when they ask, since I think they get the impression that I'm trying to play dougie howser--back when I was in high school I didn't get the same kind of pushback when I was getting treatment for my chronic illnesses. The worst was when I was on the premed track--almost all of my old doctors dismissed me at that point in time, which was sadly when I really needed them the most). All of these growths have grown insanely rapidly (under 2 weeks, with the past 4 days being super agressive), so I'm terrified that it'll be too late to treat something more serious like lymphoma or anaplastic thyroid cancer by the time I actually get to undergo a proper biopsy :(  Even yesterday, when I was supposed to get all of the growths on my neck checked, the tech couldn't scan the most affected areas (which are basically all of my anterior cervical lymphnodes) since my doctor's receptionist accidentally filed the referal improperly. I was ready to pay out of pocket since it was an insurance policy, and I'm desperate enough to shell out whatever I need to get my status expedited, but the radiology clinic's policy didn't allow that :(  Thanks for your kind words, sorry for the rant, I think I desperately needed to vent. I'm kind of in a bad place right now, but I don't really want to talk about it with my close friends and family, since I know it'll just worry them more. I think I broke my mom's heart already when I told her that my doctor and I are concerned that I may have lymphoma. Still havnt told my dad, since he's still getting over the grief of finding out his dad has pancreatic cancer. Boyfriend also doesn't 100% know since I didn't want to fully tell him til after his birthday :/",False,True

I forgot that glycogen has a bunch of water molecules bound it it.   It's kinda tricky because this is by far the most I have ever lost at once from just a few days of restriction (I basically restricted for the entirely of high school since I didn't know that it was unnatural to gain weight eating anything over 800 calories, which was a problem that got even worse when I was uw). The most I ever lost at once was 7 pounds in 2 days, but that was when I was having really bad gallbladder inflamation/gallstones, so I wasnt absorbing food properly :/ I'm now on 25mg of cytomel (T3) since I wasn't converting my levothyroxine (t4) into t3 properly, but that's still a pretty low dose for people with hypothyroidism. I still don't have a very good ballpark for what a ""normal"" restriction weight loss for me at this dosage, but I ate normally yesterday and I'm still losing weight (definitely not hyperthyrodic right now though, since that's happened to me once before and I don't have any tachycardia/palpitations/abundant energy rn). Hopefully I can get these tumors biopsied this week for some answers :/",False,True

Even if you are in a restrict at the moment, it‚Äôs still important if things are different and that‚Äôs how you phrase it to the doctors- have you lost this much weight in this time period in a previous restrict. Even though you are restricting are you even less hungry?   A loss of appetite is as big a red flag for lymphoma as actual weight loss. So pointing out how things are different from your normal or even your normal restriction experience will highlight that unique symptom.   The water weight at the beginning of restrictions isn‚Äôt about diuretics sooo much, it‚Äôs about the water molecules that are needed to store glycogen (needs water to sit in muscle and liver) - using up glycogen releases water and that‚Äôs what the typical ‚Äúwater weight‚Äù is.",False,False

Thankfully they've been monitoring my T4 and t3 really closely, so they'll probably know that it's not from over shooting the cytomel dosaging, but I'm always super upfront about my ed to my endocrinologist since she knows that it stems almost entirely from my hypothyroidism   (Also thank you very much for the info)",False,True
