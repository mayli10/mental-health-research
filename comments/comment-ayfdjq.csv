Unfortunately, it's really common for friends (especially female friends) to openly complain about their bodies and weight to each other. I'm sure that their feelings are very real and they do want to change certain things about their bodies. They might be struggling with their own disordered eating and/or mental health problems as well. Saying that, it's not unreasonable for you to gently remind them of your ED and ask them to refrain from talking about those things while you are still struggling. Make it clear that you want to be there for them, but you know they don't want to unintentionally be triggering you either. ",False,False
