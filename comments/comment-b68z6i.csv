I know I have to put in work it just feels like when these issues control my life I don’t know where to start :(,False,True

That's the point I was trying to make in the first place. Of course therapy is important, I just didn't want you to think that simply showing up would automatically cure you. I'm super happy you finally found a therapist you like and I wish you all the best in your work there!",False,False

Like yes it requires work and being willing to change but I don’t think it’s possible to get to that point without therapy? I don’t mean to be confrontational I’ve just finally found a therapist I like and can be open with and I really don’t know what the point of it all would be if the goal were not to find a solution,False,True

Mine are tangled into a rat king - my bipolar feeds into my anxiety feeds into my OCD feeds into my eating disorder.  Narrative therapy has helped me. It's about taking charge of my own story, retelling it in different ways whenever I start pigeonholing myself. I try to externalise things that I've long considered as innate parts of me (e.g. ""I am self-destructive"" becomes ""I can sometimes turn to self-destructive coping mechanisms but not inevitably"").  I think it's also about trying not to get frustrated with yourself - that always makes things worse for me. I get hectic social anxiety but it's not as bad as it once was, I can flow and connect more readily with people because of exposure therapy, but some days, particularly when I'm under pressure, I can't socialise worth a damn. And instead of getting upset with myself and spiralling, I try to just accept it for what it is, much like I do with panic attacks. When I panic I need to lean into it a little bit and try to remember the feeling of utter terror is the worst thing that will be happening - I'm not in real danger, I just feel like I am. With social anxiety, I try to remember the worst thing that will happen is I will come across as awkward and nervous, and fighting it desperately doesn't help so I should just let go of that for now.  I don't know if any of this helps you right now, just know that you're not alone, and it's so very possible for things to get better and to stop feeling so relentless and out of control.  These help me when I read through them regularly - my therapist put me onto them and described them as a therapist in your pocket: https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/resources/looking-after-yourself",False,False

I really feel for you. It's rough. The thing is, you can't rely on therapy to fix it. Therapy is a place to explore those issues in a safe space with the help of a caring professional, not a cure-all to resolve the issues with some magic advice or something. I hope that doesn't sound sarcastic or demeaning, I'm kinda just saying what I wish I could tell my past self. You do have to do some work. Some serious thinking. Don't make the mistake of relying completely on your therapist, because in the end, they're just people.",False,False

I have a lot of mental health issues that feed off of each other and ruin my life (it’s very hard to focus on school right now and my boyfriend literally just picked me up off of the bathroom floor because of a panic attack not 30 minutes ago). I came to say that I hope you find the solution and I’m offering hugs if you want them ❤️,False,False
