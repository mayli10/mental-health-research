She will feel respected by you telling her, and it's always a good idea to let her be aware that your ED isn't  'healthy', and it's not something she should emulate.    Also, on the chance she does eventually develop one, it will help her feel less alone and that she can talk to you.",False,False

Or have a trusted third party who understands disorders a bit but also what is healthy.  I think it's great you are trying to talk about your experiences to help her, however i think if possible it would be good to have someone else there to recognise what is going to potentially hurt/inspire her. I think our disorders mess with our perception of healthy and it can be really hard to navigate.  Best of luck!",False,False

It’d be good for her to hear these things. Be honest. Tell her about how ugly and hard it is living with an eating disorder. About what you’ve lost besides weight and what you’ve deprived yourself of besides food. Eating disorders are romanticized so much, but as someone who’s lived it, tell her what it’s really like. Stress the importance of self-love and self-compassion, and how crucial those skills are. It’ll be her best defense in life.",False,False
