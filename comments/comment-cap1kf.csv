And I’m sure he probably meant the comment to be motivational and not triggering, but it’s hard sometimes when people say hurtful things and don’t realize what they are saying",False,False

Their thinking is to consistently be better then yesterday by getting leaner, fitter, lifting more. So when you said you’d like to maintain his boy brain couldn’t comprehend it. But I don’t think he meant you need to lose weight.",False,False

I think he’s just super goal oriented. But I may ask him about the falling off the wagon bit to see if it’s any deeper than that.",False,True
etaqmh7,t3_cap1kf,t1_etagxmh,saffronkeys,1,2019-07-08 17:57:19,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/cap1kf/my_boyfriend_told_me_maintenance_is_not_a_goal/etaqmh7/,Idk that he’d ever fall off the wagon. He has worked out almost daily for like 11 years. But you’re right there may be some body dysmorphia. He has a bit of “forever small” at times. But yeah he’s extremely goal oriented. So I don’t think he had bad intentions. Just a different mindset and I don’t think he realizes the depth of my ED.,False,True
etaqc4d,t3_cap1kf,t1_eta4c6w,saffronkeys,1,2019-07-08 17:53:51,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/cap1kf/my_boyfriend_told_me_maintenance_is_not_a_goal/etaqc4d/,Thanks for that perspective. Yeah I don’t think he’ll ever comprehend the constant mental battle. I know he thinks I look great and just wants me to improve tangibly so I guess I’m not stagnant or so I don’t get bored? It just kinda rubbed me the wrong way at first because he should be okay with the way I am now if he thinks i look good. I’ve always struggled a bit with feeling not good enough. I don’t want him to look out of my league.,False,True

I think the issue is him projecting something on to you, like he feels he will be falling off the wagon if he doesn’t improve where he is. I would be frustrated too, but don’t let it influence you from being happy with where you are physically.",False,False

That dweeb.  It's a thought-terminating cliche, so I wouldn't be surprised if he's just parroting something he heard someone else say.  I'd ask him to explain what he means. If more elaboration actually makes sense, okay. But if the elaboration is just garbled like a game of telephone, or clearly improvised on the spot as if he has to analyze his own words to figure out what that means...yeah.",False,False

He works in phases and changes and you want stability. You cant compare apples to oranges. Keep your goals! Go for them! But try and remember you dont need validation from him. Its okay to want different things.,False,False

Like I feel like I'm constantly fighting the urge to eat because I know I'll overeat and it's a little mentally exhausting. Whereas I guess for normal people, maintenance is doing nothing and putting in effort equals improving? Regardless I guess it's nice that he's trying to push you to improve and hopefully one day you'll get there :)",False,False
