Just spend my days waiting until the clock says its time to eat while looking at pictures of food that tastes better than mine. What are you supposed to do? If you actually go out and eat the food, you get a brief a moment of happiness followed by a days worth of regret. It doesn't change anything. What does it even accomplish? You just delay reaching your potentially unreachable goal.",False,False

Today Iâ€™ve been considering seeking a therapist. I donâ€™t know that Iâ€™m ready to give up the ED but I definitely want to work on the depression. Iâ€™m so numb and tired of the daily monotony. Iâ€™m almost 27 and Iâ€™m still wasting my life away.   Iâ€™m sorry youâ€™re feeling this way. Know that you arenâ€™t alone and Iâ€™m hoping that one day we can start living again ðŸ’œ,False,False
