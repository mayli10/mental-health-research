Lie in bed checking shit on my phone until my bladder is about to explode. Finally push myself out of bed and check on my rats. Hang out with them for 10-15 minutes before I finally decide to go to the bathroom. Then I strip, pee, weigh myself. Redress, weigh myself. Log the weight that’s between the two. Put in contacts, brush teeth, dry shampoo/brush hair and fix my bangs. Shuffle to the kitchen to get a Red Bull. Shuffle back to bed. Take morning meds and vitamins with Red Bull. Lie in bed for another hour or so before I decide if I’m going to the gym or not and if I’m going to eat breakfast. If I push for the gym, I don’t eat. If I don’t, I either fast or have a small bowl of oatmeal or cereal with almond milk. Then either way, I end up back in bed and kill the day with whatever.   When I do work:   Wake up at 6:30 and either hit snooze until 7:00 or check my phone. Pull myself out of bed by 7:05 and start with setting up my gym bag if I didn’t the night before and lying out my work clothes. Then I head to the bathroom, pee, strip, weigh myself, do normal “get ready” stuff. Go back to room to get dressed for work. Take last few minutes to hang out with my rats. When it’s time to go, grab my bags and head to the kitchen to get a Red Bull if I have any, a protein bar, and my lunch. Usually either some frozen thing with a fiber one brownie or a PBJ with some fruit. Whatever I had on hand. Throw all of my shit in my car and head to work. If I didn’t have Red Bull at home, I’ll stop somewhere for one. If I didn’t have a protein bar, either, I’ll stop at my usual ampm and get both. Then I pace my Red Bull my entire drive to work so that I finish it right before I pull in to the parking lot. And then my workday starts and I try not to die.",False,False
