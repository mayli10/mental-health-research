Itâ€™s weird but I watched an older relative of mine struggle from her teens into her forties with it.   While sometimes it seems like she struggles, she only gets healthier and more settled in who she is and that seems to help. Getting older isnâ€™t a cure-all, but it does give you time to figure out what works for you and what makes you tick and what YOU need to feel okay eating.   So if that means you donâ€™t eat in front of people much (or ever) because it makes you upset? Thatâ€™s okay. If eating is a private act to you and is only shared with people you love? Thatâ€™s okay, too.   I really lucked out in a sense. Watching her made me realize that it wonâ€™t be perfect or fixed probably ever, but that it can be managed, sometimes badly but sometimes very very gracefully, just like any other illness. It doesnâ€™t define you. Itâ€™s not who you are. Itâ€™s just an aspect of yourself youâ€™ll need to get to know better in order to keep yourself safe.",False,False

The first time i went out to lunch with my work group i was upset for about a week ahead of it. It was hard to hide that my hands were shaking pretty bad and i kept almost choking lol. I dont eat meat, and for some reason that embarasses me terribly. So of course my team found out about my veg diet and cracked jokes ðŸ˜­. They meant it in a light hearted way but im soo sensitive. I know where your coming from. You arent alone !!",False,False
