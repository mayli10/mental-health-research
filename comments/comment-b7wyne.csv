March was probably the worst month of my life - attempted suicide, spend a week in a state-run shithole of a mental facility, lost like 7 pounds in as many days from stress and self-hate and a complete inability to fucking eat.

Right now it's slightly underweight, but I think it's the perfect number to keep me out of treatment without me hating my body so much I'm suicidal.
