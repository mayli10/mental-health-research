You can focus on him all you'd like, but it won't make you fit  I just found the post and..wtf, this isn't how it works at all. You can't justify shitty behavior like that, no matter the circumstance. I did the exact same thing, saying ""My ex would treat me more affectionately and love me more, as much as he did his ex, if I just lost the weight. He's only like this because I'm fat.""  And of course, my ex wasn't even as douche baggy as the guy in this post, but it's just very harmful thinking overall.  I would never recover from my ED if I was with a guy like that.  Also, I think it's very ironic I didn't ""lose the weight"" until I was with a man who accepted me at all my weights. He hasn't seen me at my HW, but just about 10 pounds under it, so very close. So like, a 27 to 19 BMI, and everywhere in between, he's never treated me differently between any of my states at all. Now I find myself actually wanting to become underweight for myself instead of my partner though lmao",False,False

Also, my BMI is 30 and my husband is the one constantly trying to feed me (pisses me tf off but its sweet as hell and I know he just worries) and constantly telling me how beautiful I am and how much he loves me. Her weight has nothing to do with it, it's the piece of shit she married. Just remember that. If your husband isnt a piece of shit, then you're golden.
