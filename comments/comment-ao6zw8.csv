I know what I'm doing is stupid and pointless. From the most positive perspective, I'm briefly fending off the inevitable. From a more reasonable one, I'm spitting on the last of the trust my family has in me in order to get out of a whopping 30kcal.  But hey. Hey. We don't want to *gain*, right? So it's worth it. I'm thinking about hiding weights in my bra for my weigh ins so they don't increase my food. I'm not even in weight gain calories yet but good lord if I'm not in a full mental breakdown over juice.  Same to you if you ever need a friend or someone to talk to. I saw your post about feeling lonely and you don't need to worry about triggering me, my ED doesn't really get set off by other people. So hit me up whenever and good luck :,) ",False,True

I've started dissociating lately just because I don't think I can cope with how profoundly I've been screwing myself over.  Like hey stop, why are you hiding food? That won't help us, they're gonna find out and we'll be in deep shit. But we need to lose weight we're so FAT and it's almost SUMMER so we gotta HIDE THIS SHIT  Mannnn I know for a fact I've lost wayyy to much weight and I'm gonna have to do something to hide it or else it's back to residential for me.  Off topic but dude I relate to so many of your posts and we're the same age so if you ever need a friend I'm here :)",False,False
