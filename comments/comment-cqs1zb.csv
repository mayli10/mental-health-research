On one hand, I'm just ugly. From an objective standpoint I have absolutely 0 traditionally attractive features, from the fivehead, boring face, and stringy hair, to the linebacker shoulders, to the flat chest and ass and the broad ribcage that resides between the two.   On the other hand, I'm a talentless unemployed high school dropout with 0 social skills and 0 potential and I kind of use being sickly as an excuse for everything. Being a grown ass adult who lives and home, who will always live at home, who can't do a damn thing for herself is a lot less embarrassing when you're critically underweight. Then, people pity you. But if I was physical well, they'd be disgusted with me.",False,False

I'm ugly. And as a 26 year old, I've never been in a relationship. Never been like other girls my age who go out and have fun and get guys. So I figure if I can't change my face, I can at least fix my body.",False,False

I have to be better than everyone at everything (including losing weight) to distract myself from the crippling existential anxiety and depression I feel whenever I'm reminded of the reality that climate change will kill us all in a matter of decades and we're doing fuck-all to fix it.,False,False

Like sure, I might be totally mediocre at school and incapable of finding a job, but at least I have more control around food/am skinnier than almost everyone else.",False,False

If I had a pretty face, I would not give a shit about my weight. I'm so jealous of pretty thick girls, they get to eat whatever they want and still manage to be desirable and pretty. I'm just jealous of normal weight girls who have naturally skinny faces. My face and arms gain weight first, so I get super insecure. The worst part is that my face ends up puffing up for random ass reasons on random ass days, especially when I purge and ""mew"" unintentionally from compulsively chewing gum to suppress my actual hunger. The irony of it all, huh? I'm starting to realize that as long as your face is slim, you're good.  &amp;#x200B;  Don't be too hard on yourself, there will be good and bad days.",False,False
