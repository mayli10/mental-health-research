I've always been that person who asks ""what's for lunch"" like 20 minutes after breakfast or ""what's fo dinner"" at 2 pm. I just love food SO MUCH it's the only thing that consistently makes me happy (while I'm eating, that is. Afterwards I'm like Oh Shit)",False,False

I wake up at 8 am and I cant wait for 12 to arrive and I usually check my watch every time or so. I also cant help but look at the meals Im gonna eat later on and smell them and stuff. Kinda crazy lol,False,False

I was the most addicted to it when I was depressed and when I was neurotically counting calories. I ate for the sake of eating while depressed and when I stress ate it was like a coke head snorting a line (not that intense but still, very addicted to food), and when I was obsessively counting it was more like I was so hungry all the time but no amount of food was able to satisfy me because it was all numbers. So yea, be careful, if it's getting to you and your quality of life, then it could slowly become a problem.",False,False

If I meal prep and try to be organized, then I feel like I'm obsessing and doing it wrong (whether I enjoy it it not, and I have two small kids and a grown man to cook for besides me).  If I wing it, then I feel like in lackadaisical and doing it wrong.  Also I have a small child who is underweight and would rather do anything but eat, and another small child who likes to eat healthy but is rather pudgy despite that.

But I agree that liking, being enthusiastic or looking forward to food isn’t necessarily disordered. If you’re healthy, I don’t see how there could be anything wrong with taking joy in food. The only issue would be when it becomes a compulsion, or if it becomes difficult to control and it starts negatively affecting your weight and health, whichever direction the scale goes.",False,False
