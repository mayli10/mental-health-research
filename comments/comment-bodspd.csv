It's more like when I am less stressed or emotional I tend to restrict and I can make it through a period of fasting or restriction more easily and in turn, feel better about myself and be more productive. But when I'm stressed, sad, anxious, etc., I always end up binging. After I binge I just feel like shit so all I do is sit in bed, feeling sick, regretting everything, and not being able to get anything done.",False,False

I think I like myself more when I’m “doing things right” aka restricting, so I feel like I *deserve* more self care/effort in school/happiness in general. Restricted me is an entirely different person.  When I’m in a binge phase or gain weight for any reason I stop doing anything good for myself as punishment. Because that’s how my brain works, if I’m fat I guess I might as well be fat with terrible skin, failing grades and no relationships!",False,False
