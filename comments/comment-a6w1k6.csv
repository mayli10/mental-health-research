They are usually worse than actually dealing with stress...   I pull my hair out, in a very specific spot. I tend to do it for periods of 7-10 days until the area is damaged and it hurts...   I also bite my nails. A lot.   When I'm driving, I put an elastic band around the gear handle so I get to play with it. That's the only same mechanism I have.   Weed helps a lot but I tend to abuse it so sometimes I just stop buying it.   Sex, works better when you have a partner.   Exercising never works. It tenses me up. However showering after exercising seems to work.   Watching sad things and crying about my misery. ",False,False
