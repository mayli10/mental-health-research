Without private insurance you're still screwed unless you're middle to upper class, but taking one medication won't bankrupt you if have a decent job. That's why convoys of people from the US come here and buy all the insulin they can from our pharmacies and why the US is pushing to let Americans order drugs from Canadian providers. Instead of fixing their own problems they just threaten to cause shortages of medications over here. Basically they just want our people to suffer too üôÉ",False,False

Not to be confused with a flex spending account. Introduced to federal tax law under Bush, they are available to anyone who has a ""high deductible"" health insurance plan.

They are triple tax advantaged - you can put pre-tax income into it, and then invest it without paying capital gains tax, and spending it is not taxed either. However, you can only spend it on certain medical costs, such as prescription drugs, dental fillings, x-rays and whatnot.
