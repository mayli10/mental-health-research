It’s a little of both but mostly the fullness which the calories tip me over the edge to purge. Again thank you :) ,False,True

This could lead to a binge, then guilt then purging again etc. and trap you in a vicious cycle. ",False,False

One question, is it more the calories or the physical discomfort of being full that makes you want to purge? Either way, distraction (e.g. reading, watching TV, art or a craft, etc.) helps in most situations. If you can go somewhere where you couldn’t do it like a public place or outdoors. For the physical discomfort, hot drinks and fiber will help it digest more quickly. A calming tea can take care of both the digestion and the anxiety. On a darker note, there are a lot of reasons for not doing it. I quit it after 2 cavities, a Mallory-Weiss syndrome incident (stomach tear), a seizure, and so on. You could google the kind of damage that could happen but it becomes too real when the medical bills start adding up. I wish you the best of luck and feel free to hmu with any other questions.

When I was having problems swallowing in the beginning of my recovery, it made it difficult to eat bc I was scared to choke so I watched Netflix while I ate and it helped a lot. I’ve never purged tho sorry if this isn’t helpful. ",False,False
