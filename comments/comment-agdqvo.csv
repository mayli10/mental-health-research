Everyone in my life enables it, brings me diet Cokes, asks me to exercise with them. I'm still healthy (111 lbs 5' 1"") so no one believes me or takes it seriously. I don't feel like I'm worthy of trying to get better, I feel like everyone is going to hand me diet Cokes and laxatives until Im thin enough to die. I'm sure I'm being dramatic but on the other hand I just use this reaction to convince myself everyone thinks I'm fat and I'm doing a good thing. Everyone has more important problems right now and I don't feel like it's right of me to expect people to care and I honestly hate the part of me that wants someone to. My friend told me I seemed like a really happy person yesterday and there was a part of me that felt really proud people thought that and another part of me that just broke when she said it... Especially because she eats normal and is a little higher of a weight than I am and everyone even people who hardly know her are worried for her because she comes across as very unhappy a lot. I'm glad people are concerned for her and I shouldn't feel entitled to pity and I do hope she gets happier but I'm jealous at the same time... ",False,False

It's weird because the way my Ed brain fights back can get so nasty. It makes me feel like if I am able to do this on my own I must have never had a problem to begin with... ,False,True

It's also an extremely hard but extremely rewarding life lesson imo. My therapist told me something like (paraphrasing) if you're a reptile, you have to learn to become a mammal. That is, if you're reliant on whatever warmth you're seeking (i.e. validation that you need and deserve help) to come from others, you won't be mentally healthy until you can generate your own warmth (validation and eventually self-love in the long term) from the inside. Keep up with recovery!! You're so strong for doing it, I know I don't know you but I'm proud of you, what you're doing takes a massive amount of maturity and strength xx",False,False
