Hope you're doing a little better now   About January this year I started realizing that I can't really fast for more than 20 hours anymore without triggering a binge that makes it 110% not worth it. But even still, some days all my ED wants to do is faaaaast and it's so hard to think rationally when those thoughts are washing over me constantly. Total disclosure, I'm a massive hypocrite, even right now I'm pushing 21 hours on my current fast, but maybe consider not fasting as long in the future? It sounds like it's really hurt you this time, and I'd hate to think of you going through something like this again. Honestly, the binges (and accompanying methods of purging later) I've had immediately following long fasts are some of my worst ED memories...  Here's to hoping we'll find the strength to make more good memories and less bad ones in the future ❤️",False,False
