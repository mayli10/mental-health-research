My own, I thought- at first. It progressed and progressed and now she has her own personality, we fight, sometimes out loud (when it’s really bad), and her own writing style when I’m journaling. All of this in addition to psychosis-type symptoms and hallucinations. I tried to recover this summer and got over most of my “fear foods” but this only makes it easier to hide my illness. Honestly, I have no idea if other people get so screwed up with this shit but if you have the opportunity to kick this shit before you end up like me- please do.",False,False

It doesn't need to sound like someone else talking. Of course, it's different for everyone, but it's not like an auditory hallucination unless someone has those issues in general (like schizophrenia).  For me, most of the time it's the normal ED thoughts that I'm sure you have--the ones about being fat, needing to lose weight, don't eat x y z, always thinking about food, etc. But I also have (rare) moments where my ED voice is much louder and I get physical symptoms. Dozens of thoughts about my body/weight/food are racing *constantly* in my head within seconds, I get a headache, my heart hurts, I want to die, want to cry/do cry. But from what I understand, this could also be anxiety/ADD/OCD/etc (I am undiagnosed). The last time it happened like that was about 2 months ago, and it's not common like the normal ED thoughts I have on a constant basis. But like I said, I'm not sure if that's some other disorder working together with my ED. ((If anyone who sees this has any info on this kind of physical reaction, please let me know!!))  Maybe another reason why people use the term ""ED voice"" is because they can feel like different people/personalities when they have intrusive thoughts (but not like DID..) I feel like I have \~4 different voices (normal, restrictive/ED, binge voice, another voice more closely related to depression/BPD). They are all me, but in my ""normal"" (ish) state right now, it's like they are different me's, if that makes sense. I am fully aware that I act irrationally or that I could lose weight eating 1200 cals a day, but my thoughts ""won't let me."" This is why some people say ""ana/mia made me do it.""  Hope this helped :D",False,False
