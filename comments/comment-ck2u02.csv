And then plan your weekly meals around the days you must eat lunch for your job - which is frustrating but that way you can enjoy the food guilt free. And say you find meetings not at restaurants/over food more productive? Which in my experience is true but might not go over well given the culture of your work place. You could also suggest going for a walk, rather than a sit down meal (“yes let’s catch up, but I’ve been at my desk all day and need to stretch my legs, want to take a walk?”). I decline lunch meetings by saying I need some alone time to clear my head, take a mental break. I’m available for meetings throughout the day but my lunch time is me time, not work time. Another thing I do when people spring a spontaneous “let’s go get lunch!” is claim to have brought my own lunch, “I don’t want to waste the food I cooked, so let’s grab coffee later instead.” Good luck!",False,False
