My most recent binge was almost triggered purely because I knew the food I found tasted good, I didn't get to eat it often, and I wanted to eat it because I knew I would enjoy it (to start with).  When a binge is triggered by something like that, I try separating myself from it, putting it in the freezer, asking my partner to get me portions of it instead of myself, etc. I also try enforced portion control, e.g. going to a cafe and ordering a single serve of the food item rather than buying a whole pack of it and taking it home. And of course, prevention is the best cure - there are some foods I know I can't keep in my house because they are just... so, so unbelievably good that I know they will eventually trigger a binge LOL. Like this ONE brand of hummus is my Achilles heel. So, what I do instead is buy a different brand I still enjoy but not as much, or I only buy the smaller container so I am less likely to binge bc I don't want to deprive my partner (and if I do binge it's a much smaller amount), or I only buy it when I'm planning on eating the whole thing and I have meal-planned accordingly. Like I said, sometimes the best thing to do is just to let a binge run its course.",False,True

It's hard for me to pinpoint for me lately, because my most recent binge cycle was triggered by anxiety, and the anxiety was ongoing, it took me a lot longer to pull myself out of it than it would in a ""normal"" binge cycle. It also takes me longer to get back to normal if I try and compensate harshly immediately after a binge.  If I talk myself through it, and remain mindful by tracking what I eat during the binge, and focus on getting back to ""normal"" after a binge rather than compensating by fasting/low restricting/etc, then i can get back on track in a couple of days to about a week. My process looks like gradually eating less and less over my maintenance, until I'm at or around maintenance for a little, then back to my normal restricting habits. I am usually thrown out for at least a couple of days by a cycle as I do the ol' tug-o-war between wanting to restrict and wanting to binge, lol. Often times I find that consciously allowing myself to eat more than normal (so, eating over maintenance, but NOT binging) for a little while after a binge makes it easier to go back to maintenance/restricting than if I try and force myself to restrict again faster. It helps my food insecurity calm itself down.",False,True

I find the ""20 minute trick"" helps with delayed gratification. If I still want it in 20 minutes, then I can have it. Usually I can just keep telling myself that until the urge passes, and if it doesn't, then I know I'm not dealing with binge eating, I'm dealing with a craving, which is different.  And again yes, for both points in number 2! I will sometimes get someone else to get the food I'm craving for me if I can't trust myself to buy/make/order a reasonable amount. E.g. if I'm craving a cookie I might ask my partner to get me one from the packet so that I'm not tempted to binge. And if I remember, I try and snack on something else first. Often times my desire to binge will be gone afterwards, and if it's still there then again, I'm probably dealing with a specific craving.",False,True

I wanted to binge. My go-to for those times is a bowl is chopped slaw and some dressing. It‚Äôs crunchy, filling, and takes a lot of chewing so it satisfies most cravings. But i did t want that- i wanted a whole cake. So i went to Whole Foods and got a 210 calorie small cupcake and ate it slowly and savored it. And it was awesome. :D  I usually delay gratification though and just wait. For instance, i have been daydreaming about an everything bagel all week and tomorrow i will definitely eat that bagel- but only half :)",False,False

Delay gratification. Say you're at the store and you really want candy. Tell yourself you can't get it right now, but if you still want it later you can come back and get it. Most of the time you will decide it's best not to have it, or you're too lazy to go back to the store lol. Sometimes I do go back for it, but probably 1/10 times or less.  2. Or, if you're really craving something, just eat a normal amount of it. So instead of getting a whole roll of cookie dough to bake two dozen cookies, just go to starbucks/panera/mcdonalds/a local bakery/etc. and just get one cookie. This idea honestly sounds CRAZY in the moment, but most of the time I do it I actually feel much better after and don't want to binge eat anymore.",False,False
