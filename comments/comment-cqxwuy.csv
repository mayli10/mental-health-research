And those who don‚Äôt usually suffer from a deeper issue where they‚Äôll never be thin enough. If you do it the healthy way, you‚Äôll have long term success, feel good and look great. Often, the differences in restricting aren‚Äôt even that much. The reason you lost a pound fasting was because you lost water weight.  There are a number of reasons you could not be losing weight. But my advice is to try this next month:   You‚Äôre at a healthy weight. If you‚Äôre looking to lose and want to weigh like 115 pounds which is still a healthy weight and fine goal, this is what you need to do to reach that weight by March 5 of next year:  - Eat 1,200-1,472 calories a day. Make sure you‚Äôre measuring food and not binging, restricting, or purging. Restricting usually just results in more binging and purging can majorly mess up your body, especially when you‚Äôre that young and you get stuck in a binge/purge cycle because you‚Äôre hungry - Find am exercise you enjoy. I really like the daily yoga app and sworkit! Don‚Äôt think of it as burning calories because you‚Äôre still going to meet your calorie goal. You just want to have more energy and be stronger and healthier.  - Get a full night‚Äôs sleep (you actually burn calories when you sleep!) - Eat lots of protein to keep yourself full, eat balanced meals because often ana folks don‚Äôt and suffer a lot of consciences for it like hair loss. - Drink lots of water which will make your skin look amazing and prevents your mind from thinking you‚Äôre hungry when you‚Äôre not  Good luck, stay safe üëå",False,False

I saw you mentioned in another comment that you don't think you have an eating disorder but you are willing to do anything to lose weight?  Please reconsider, you sound very young and you are also a healthy weight for your height at your age. Undereating when you are young can lead to a lot of problems as you grow up.  Eating disorders really aren't fun, they take over your entire life and can make you very isolated and depressed.",False,False

You lose  weight by finding out your resting calorie burning rate and than burn more than that- remember to eat enough to give you energy and make you feel full through out the day, but don't go over your calorie limit for more than once or twice a week.  &amp;#x200B;  That's my healthy advice.
