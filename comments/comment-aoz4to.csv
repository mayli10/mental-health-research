I wasn’t hungry, but I wasn’t stuffed either, and I knew the next day I’d just be having broth, so I was like “well I also want a couple little baby Reese’s and a piece of bread and maybe a mini butterfinger as well, better to have it today when I’ve burned all these calories rather than tomorrow when I burn like 12” so that’s exactly what I did lol. Unnecessary little snacks just because I wanted them and just because I knew I’d be deprived the next day. Like I justified it so hard but still feel guilty, because truthfully I shouldn’t have done that lol. There was no reason for me to do that!  BUT there is a possibility of a whoosh from eating above your limit and going back down to it, and you’re also right about just getting back on track the next day. Bad days happen sometimes and guilty days happen sometimes, sometimes for days in a row, but when you get back on track those days don’t matter after a while 😭 I have to remember that lol. It literally won’t matter in a few days or a week or whatever that I ate over my limit today, and it won’t for you either!",False,True

And good luck next week 🙃",False,True

You shouldn’t feel guilty for eating- no one really should but I rly understand those feels man. ",False,False

I’ve full blown sobbed from eating what I thought was “too much” for one day lol. Periods don’t help either, not looking foreword to getting mine next week. Happy early birthday :) ",False,False

The whoosh is a good point as well, I’m not sure if I can counteract the current period bloat but that’d be fantastic lmao. Maybe I’ll do broth until my birthday on Wednesday and see if I have a whoosh. Then today will really be a tiny blip in the grand scheme of things 😂 Thank you again for the kind words! ♡",False,True

And depending on your weight it’s most likely less than you’re TDEE. Sometimes eating a bit over your calorie limit will help you woosh! Don’t try about it and trust me, you do not want to start purging. Just drink some water and try not to freak out. I know it’s scary eating more than you want when you’re restricting but you did not do any damage. If you even gained anything it’s all like water retention. Calm down love, you’ll be okay &lt;3",False,False
