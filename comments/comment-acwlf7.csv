Yeah no you're not right, it's literally the difference of 20 pounds for me. I know it's not ""healthier"" but it's more effective, and I know eventually I'll have to cut it out completely when I get closer to my goal weight because of the sodium and other stuff in it.

I work in a cafe/bar of some sorts, and I have regular customers who order fries with double mayonnaise (which is A LOT of mayonnaise, the standard portion is already three tablespoons or something). They're super obese and who the hell needs SIX tablespoons of mayo on a order of fries????? Baffling.  Plus all the people ordering fries or fried snacks and saying ""ahahahah, almost January again, so this is the last time!"" and then doing the exact same thing the next time. Just admit that you like your Sunday fries, lady, why are you trying to fool me and yourself??   And yeah, I view thin people eating fries differently than obese people eating fries. I was always super self conscious when I ate fries when I was fat (still am of course, just for different disordered brain reasons). So yeah, definitely projecting my own insecurities on other people. At least I'm able to keep my retail smile and my mouth shut when serving customers. ",False,False

I honestly don‚Äôt even care that these people are fine with being fat. You do you. But I just think about how I would feel like that  I was at a football watching party the other day &amp; we were drinking beer and I noticed a lot of people were drinking cokes. I thought a Coke Zero sounded good and wondered if there would be anything diet available, looked around, realized everyone was super fat and my SO and I were the only small people there and concluded that I wouldn‚Äôt be finding anything diet or low cal in that environment and continued on w my Michelob   I definitely felt bad for my thoughts.

Nearly underweight now and I asked for a Diet Coke and the waitress gave me a look and said ‚Äúoh diet trying to watch your weight‚Äù she then brings me a regular coke on accident and then makes a big deal about getting me a Diet Coke. Like first off yeah I fucking watch my weight duh. I‚Äôm thinner than you and I‚Äôm going to go puke the 2 price of fried pickle I ate from our appetizer so my friends don‚Äôt realize how bad I‚Äôve gotten.
