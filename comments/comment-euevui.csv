Offer emotional support, tell her she can tell you about anything. Instead of directly confronting her, open up the conversation. ""You've been seeming more stressed lately, are you alright?"" etc.  If she gets significantly more ill or you genuinely believe she is at risk of death (by bulimia or suicide), THEN you should break confidentiality and tell people - including, of course, medical professionals. Perhaps not her family as it's always weirder with family, but her close friends and doctors.  And this part is important: Her mental health is *not your responsibility*. This is hard to hear, I know. And it's fantastic that you care so much about her. But if you try to take it upon yourself to always make sure she's alright, it's only going to make YOUR mental health worse; it won't help either of you. Offer support, but don't feel guilty if her condition continues.",False,False

Ive been trying to figure out a way to approach this conversation and this has helped a lot. Were pretty close for roommates but shes obv very secretive about this issue and can be cagey about things in general and i feel approaching her about her nausea and vomiting will make her not get as defensive and i bet she will get,False,True

Also, getting help for her behind her back won’t work, since you can’t force anyone to recover. They have to want it themselves.   When talking to her, don’t ”accuse” her of anything, or say something like ”i found this in your trash can!” since that would make her embarrased and close herself even more. Instead, try saying things like ”are you okay? I’ve noticed you seem stressed out lately and it worries me, is there anything in particular that’s bothering you?” or ”how are things going with you nausea/vomiting? Is there anything i can do to help you, such as scheduling a doctors appointment?”. Try to tell her that you are there for her, even if she just wants a chat, a hug or anything, and show her that she can he trust you. Lastly i just want to add that it’s very nice and caring of you to want to help her, good luck to both of you.",False,False

I would recommend not telling her friends about it. It's her secret, and not yours to tell. I would also recommend not confronting her directly, as it could cause her to feel ambushed. I don't know how close you two are, but just offer her emotional support and let her know you're there if she needs help.",False,False
