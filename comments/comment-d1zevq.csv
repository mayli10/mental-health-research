All the cloths that I dreamed about wearing? I still hate myself in them. Dreaming about regaining weight because I have to? Not happening, also I hate eating more than ever. So fun   Oh and the man I have a crush on doesn‚Äôt give a shit about how much I weight, but that won‚Äôt stop me from avoiding him unless I didn‚Äôt eat that day. So I miss out on allot.",False,True

Even if they don't it hasn't happened since then, even when I lost more weight.  Recently got called too skinny while posting in a fashion channel in a Discord server I'm a part of. I just sort of mentioned that I did try to gain weight but ended up getting so sick because of it that I spent a night in the hospital. The person started by just tagging me and saying ""eat food"". It is pretty fucked up that when I was ready to get better it somehow ended up making me more sick. Now my ED brain is telling me that weighing less is healthier even though I know that's not true.  I wish people would just not comment on others' weight. It can feel nice when you get comments you want, but more often than not it just feels bad.",False,False

Even when I'm flattered, bc some people feel more genuine than others, I still feel overall embarrassed.

When the scale showed me a lower weight than I've been since I was a teenager, I just felt worse because I don't see it myself and it just felt like a cruel lie. When I see people do a double take at work, staring at my legs or arms, I just feel uncomfortable. When my mom gasped and said it's time to stop losing weight, I just blamed it on her being more used to me at a higher weight, so it meant nothing.  The only times I feel *some* satisfaction is if I'm completely alone and the lighting is perfect and I catch a glimpse of a bone I haven't seen before.",False,False
