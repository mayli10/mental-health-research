I do think it is impossible for her to lie that well to absolutely everybody with a perfect track of every single detail when she's not able to track her own calories. I literally track her food inventory, so she would have to throw away food to make it work, and I know she has money issues too so really, occam's razor would tell me to believe anything else rather than she's a psychopathic genius manufacturing every single detail of her life at every single moment.   I accept that no other reason has been found, but I'll leave it this way. I'm already tracking her food and inventory, if I start suspecting a giant lie I would definitely have to call myself crazy.",False,True

Yes she has more muscle than you which makes her have a higher TDEE but she‚Äôs also about 8 inches shorter than you and hasn‚Äôt been an athlete in years so I really doubt her TDEE is somehow crazy higher than yours. The only thing is you could have a thyroid issues causing metabolism issues but I doubt it since you seem to be losing at around the correct pace. Occam‚Äôs razor says that the simplest answers are usually the right ones. What is more likely, that someone you don‚Äôt know that well is lying to you or both of you are medical anomalies/ have rare health problems? Losing weight is basic math, we as ED people know this. It all comes down to caloric deficits. Again if you don‚Äôt want to believe that she could be lying, that‚Äôs fine you live with her/are her friend but there‚Äôs no secret reason any of us here can help you find to describe the difference in your weight loss results here can help you find other than the ones already mentioned ",False,False

She's open about worse things, I'm her calories accountant, she tells me every single details and she does not have any room to hide things, I know her schedule and it is too tight, and she can't fast or purge at work (she works with health people and she gets seriously dizzy when she fasts, like dangerously dizzy, they would notice...) . She also does not have the time to exercise during the day and I see her on the evening, so no lying here.  Maybe it's because she's a higher BMI ?",False,True

I eat twice a day, midday and evening. I eat an apple on the morning if I feel I'm dizzy because I know I can faint. I also eat greek yoghurt with each meal (60kcal). I only drink water, black coffee and tea with no sugar or milk.  She eats the same thing than me on the evening, says she eats the same on lunch, or tells me when she changes her meal (generally she would switch to ham and hardboiled eggs with diet biscuits and a protein shake).  I trust her because I am her accountant. She does not trust herself to count right so she tells me anything she changes in her diet, any single detail, so I can write it down too. She's very TMI too, no shame or anything, and tells me everytime she almost ate something and did not, and is proud when she eats less than she needs to. Also I have access to her food cabinet and I track it. She has no food in her room because she's an ex-military woman, her room must be absolutely clean and organised, she even took off her dressing's door so she would not let the inside get unorganized. She refuse to eat in her room and once I ate in her room and she immediately vacuumed the floor and her desk. So she does not hide her food in her room.   Also I'm here when she cooks for the next day so I can count the calories for her, and she has an inventory of the food she has in her office, which she has put on the fridge. Calories written too. And she crosses things she eats.   Also she refuse to eat in her internship's place, because she needs to pay to access the tables and she apparently got into an argument with the staff about it and now she avoids them because she wants them dead haha, she's quite the kind to hold grudges like this.  Lastly, I know she does not do sport, cause I asked her to run with me or something and she said she never wants to do sport again because it reminds her of her army days and she is too happy to be over with that to exercise again. I hope she'll change her view on that. But she has been open about using meds to throw up, fat absorbing pills, coke to not be hungry, etc, so she would not hide a few exercices, especially since she loves compagny in her ed behaviour. Also she does not have the time to exercise, she works from 7 to 18 and is home at 19, and she's not exercising here at all.    Maybe it's because she's a higher BMI ?",False,True
