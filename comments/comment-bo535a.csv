I hope it does help. Writing a letter is a trick I use for a lot of hard things. Sometimes, just writing it let's me say it out loud and I just read it, and ask them to wait till the end to respond. Anyways, good luck, you deserve only good things!!",False,False

There are a few people that I've told what's going on, and almost all of them said something like ""oh wow that really sucks!"" and then literally never spoke of it again and they still make comments like ""oh you look so healthy and thin! I wish I could lose weight like you"". It's like they all get very localised amnesia, it's insane and it hurts a lot.  I get that it's scary, but I hope you realise how great it is that people are noticing and worrying. Because they care about you and your well-being. I hope they are supportive and stay supportive ❤️ Good luck!",False,False

Detail how you've been feeling about your body, food, etc. And express that you appreciate their concern, but it may be better to avoid comments about your body unless they think your health is still deteriorating. If you gain, make sure they know not to even say ""you look healthy""  Also, you should add a bit where you say ""before you call, text, or write me, please check out these resources,"" and give a short list of a few articles, videos, etc, explaining a little of the psychology behind eating disorders.   You should set up an appointment to see if you would be diagnosed with an actual disorder or if you have this far managed to stay disordered rather than a full blown ED. (this is not to say disordered eating is less of a problem or illness, just that it would make recovery SO much easier) this way, if you have an official diagnosis, you can give your family some resources on your specific illness, especially if you don't have traditional AN, b/c most people assume that that's what all eating disorders are.  You have a family and a boyfriend's family who clearly care about you very much. Eating disorders thrive on secrecy, so even if you don't do everything I said above, even doing some of it could be so helpful, to make living a healthy life more easy.  Good luck!",False,False

Idk, it's really hard for me to lie constantly so being honest was a weight off of my shoulders.",False,False
