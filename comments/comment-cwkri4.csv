Those electrolyte drinks are not very potent on their own, since they're not really designed to support fasting.  You can get potassium in a shaker at the grocery store, it's sold as ""No-Salt"" or ""Salt-Free"" and is right next to the regular salt.  A tsp of each in your water per day will help prevent electrolyte depletion.",False,False
