A lot of people find it easy to avoid a binge by:   1. Stick to easier foods like a bit of broth / boullion cubes   2. Then a few hours later, pace yourself with eggs, healthy fats (almonds are low cal and my fave) and lighter veg (I find cruciferous and starchy veg don’t trigger a binge but can make me bloated.  3. If you’re feeling good and bowel seems alright you can ease into your normal foods  :))",False,False

End your fast with fruit or veggies (or a fruit smoothie thats what i end mine with) you’ll feel refreshed and it’ll be much better than filling up on high calorie unhealthy foods from a binge.,False,False
