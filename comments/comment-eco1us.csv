Nobody eats the entire pack, though, mostly because nobody likes everything in their pack. My battle buddy used to try to get the creamy spinach MRE (the most universally hated pack) just to get a cranraspberry First Strike bar and trade the entire rest of the meal.  I’m the only person I know who’s had her weight monitored by the army so far so I can only give n=1 firsthand anecdotes, but they didn’t change my MRE rations because the calories were so high. However when I ate at the dfac (dining facility), I was required to eat double rations and during BCT, when I didn’t finish my food, the drill sergeants would make me stay back after chow, sit next to me, and watch me until I finished every bite. Even though I don’t get double rations for MREs, my NCOs seek me out to give me the parts of their MRE they don’t want, citing, “You need this more than I do.”  I’ve considered making an entire post about EDs and the military on here because holy shit you know how in civilian life you suspect some people have EDs? In the army, there are only 2 types of people: normal people and people with EDs. It is extremely obvious, black and white. Normal people pick food they like, eat until they’re satisfied, and then toss the rest. People with EDs steal food and then beg other people to eat it, binge eat and skip meals, ask for half rations, suck on cough drops all day, stare at the dfac menu every chow to calculate calories and macros, mention “making up for meals,” do sit-ups right after chow... like it’s insanely obvious. There was a male in my platoon whose ED was on par with my own, and humorously, we could openly commiserate about ED behaviors even in front of cadre, but as long as we didn’t label it as disordered, nobody batted an eye. You never have anorexia until you say “I have anorexia.”  My disordered battle buddy stole protein bars, loaded his tray with thousands of calories and then tried to give them all away as soon as he sat down, collected everyone’s MRE coffees from every platoon to drink himself, obsessed over almond milk, joyfully ate 10k+ (his own count btw) calories and then felt guilty so he ran 6 miles on the track, compulsively exercised after every chow even when it was snowing, and he and I used to meet up when we got MREs to check nutrition facts and build our meal based on who needed which calories.",False,False

Do women also eat the same thing men do or is it usually lower calories?",False,True

I always picked the tuna MRE because it was the only low calorie MRE and nobody wanted it, but then they started getting Cheez-It’s, so people started stealing my MRE of choice. My last week of training, I had to switch to Elbow Mac and just eat the Irish Creme Cappuccino powder lmao I was SO PATHETIC. Sometimes I binged the pastries when I was starving. Not proud of that.",False,False
