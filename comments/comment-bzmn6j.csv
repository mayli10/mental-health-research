I've definitely always had OCD, and that often manifested itself in unusual behaviors around food. I used to have s'mores pop tarts for breakfast (lol those were the days), and I would meticulously cut it up and dissect it in a specific way in order to make it last longer.",False,False

My “real Ed” with counting calories and obsessing about how much I eat started when I was fourteen. As a child I was a very picky eater and hated eating anything unfamiliar. As a result of this I was at the lower end of a normal BMI until I was about ten years old. And there was a time when I regularly threw up my breakfast because I was afraid of going back to school. And then I just stopped eating before lunch.,False,False

The comparisons, the shame, the competitiveness, the repetitive attempts at diets has all been with me, but until I was 15, it was never enough to hurt my health. So, *maybe.* I'll go with maybe. I can't imagine what it would be like to feel this way since 5. Human existence can be such a nightmare sometimes.",False,False

I can remember being 5 or 6 and I loved being hungry. My mom always said I “ate like a bird” and I can remember thinking that meant I needed to eat very little. I also can remember loving how being hungry felt. I would drink water when I knew my stomach was empty and I’d lay on the floor and wiggle around so I could hear it slosh around.",False,False
