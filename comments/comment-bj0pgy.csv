I'm saying that the therapist herself might only have one extreme concept of what ""underweight"" looks like in her mind (e.g. skeletally thin) and so she mistakenly thinks that because OP doesn't look bone-thin, she ""doesn't look"" underweight, even though as you said underweight is a technical classification and it doesn't matter how you ""look"".  The fact that OP's therapist said she ""doesn't look underweight"" at all implies that she has a poor understanding of the classification because you can't always tell if someone's underweight just by looking at them, especially clothed.",False,False

You deserve better than that for sure. Therapy should be holistic. Even if you have other issues to work on, one shouldn't necessarily be pushed to the back burner - *especially* something as detrimental to one's physical health as an ED is.

This is not her first *questionable* remark.  She told me that there are thin girls, normal girls and fat girls, and that I'm normal. I was very close to underweight by then.  We were talking about my exercise, and she told me I should get addicted to exercise, that it'd be good for me.  She keeps telling me my ED is not her first priority because I am physically healthy.
