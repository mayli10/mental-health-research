Does it help at all to know that you are pretty enough to model - like, and forgive me if this is minimizing your feelings because I do not at all mean to do so - it's kind of a ""first world problem"" that you wouldn't be in that position if you weren't super gorgeous already? I don't know if I'm articulating what I mean well...",False,False

Everyone seems to be kind of skating around the topic of EDs all the time, like it’s a bit of an elephant in the room. We sometimes will make jokes about eating on set, about our agencies weighing us, and things like that. I would never tell anyone I work with that I struggle with my ED because I’d probably stop getting booked. In some places, like France, there are laws against letting women who are ‘too skinny’ model, so there is always a thin line that I have to walk. I developed my ED when I was 13 and getting into modeling, and it’s been so hard to try to get healthy when it would basically mean my career was over. Basically, it’s an incredibly harsh industry, where people tell you to your face, multiple times per day, what they don’t like about your body, while you nod and accept it. I also really enjoy certain aspects of it, but it is so difficult and I’ve cried hundreds of times about the rejection and humiliation I feel pretty frequently.",False,False

I either feel too bloated or too dead and it shows in the photos. I always 12 hour fast before a shoot. I HIGHLY dis recommend modeling in recovery,False,False
