Your ED is 100% telling you you’re not fasting enough 3. I don’t think you should increase fasting times. Anything I say here that could help you lose weight will inevitably be the same as giving you tips, I feel like. :( I think you’re doing okay. A lot of people without eds fast for 18:6 and are fine and don’t think it’s very hard. As long as you’re eating healthy food and staying active that’s all that matters. (Even tho, from an ED perspective, I know that just losing weight is what matters. I just don’t feel comfortable talking about ways to lose weight “better,” you know?)",False,False
