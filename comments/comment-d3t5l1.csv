That is INSANE to me when I think about how I’ve suffered at my lowest points. I’ve lost a job due to calling off too often due to extreme fatigue. I’ve suffered extreme physical weakness impairing me from even climbing stairs. I’ve purged in MANY public restaurants after panicking when out with friends. I’ve been suicidal after spending literal hours pinching my fat in a mirror. I’ve never been textbook underweight.... yet I’ve struggled with this obsession for TEN YEARS.   These struggles are VALID regardless of BMI, regardless of if you’re on an upswing or downswing with your weight, regardless if you haven’t restricted heavily or even binged in a while. The THOUGHTS, the panic, the dread, the self loathing, the body dysmorphia, the discomfort in clothes, the guilt, the shame, the obsession... it’s all extremely debilitating and the struggle is sooooo INCREDIBLY real.   Much love OP, you deserve support just as much as anyone else ❤️",False,False

I eat approximately 1600 calories a day and have never gone under 1000 except for days when I don’t have appetite. I’m at a healthy bmi and that makes me feel like I don’t even deserve to be diagnosed. But really it’s the thoughts associated with food that matters. I’ll crave in to my cravings and eat something whilst hating myself for being weak. I’ll have sushi for dinner with my friends and make new workout plans in my mind for the next day just so I can compensate for that. And it really sucks to be constantly wanting food but yet have such an unhealthy relationship with eating.,False,False
