Even if you maintained at 1000 calories (which is HIGHLY unlikely) you would still not have eaten enough to gain one pound of fat, you will have eaten only 2500 cals over maintenance, which again, I GREATLY underestimated your maintenance calories, so in reality it‚Äôs probably only like 1500 calories or less over maintenance depending on what your maintenance is. If you just go back to eating normally it‚Äôll all balance out don‚Äôt worry! You‚Äôre going to be okay, enjoy the time w ur loved ones! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüíïüíï i hope this helped at all",False,False

Shows up with chinese food!! for the first time in my life!! and my favorite ice cream!! I'm scared for my life now. don't even wanna think about stepping on the scale.",False,False
