I went from a 28E -&gt; 28F (or the more recognizable sister size 34C -&gt; 34D) when I went 10lbs over my previous highest weight.   Then I lost 25lbs... but my boobs still fit the new bra I bought to accommodate them.  I want to die from the shoulder and straight up boob pain. Like my chest skin just HURTS and I have boob stretch marks.   AND I STILL LOOK FAT despite me being 2lbs away from underweight bc fabric draping over my boobs just makes me look hella big.  Also now I only have one bra that fits me because I'm a broke bitch fasfdfasdzvcv,False,False

Mine look so funny on my body, they made sense when I was bigger, but now it’s just annoying. Whenever I’m in a tight tee I feel huge bc my boobs are so big.  Idk what I measure, but I’ve heard from multiple ppl that for my size my boobs are big! So it’s not just in my head. I want them gone",False,False
