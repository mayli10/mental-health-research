Eating disorder recovery advice isn't meant for the general population. People choosing to twist that is its own issue but the recovery advice in and of itself isn't fatlogic.,False,False

So many people are bashing Ed recovery stuff and I feel like really minimizing the experiences of people who recovered and got fat.  They act like an ED is a fringe condition and it’s all fat logic. I also see too many posts mocking people who want more diverse body representation.  We can have models who aren’t underweight without promoting obesity. I used to like that sub when people told me I was a bad person for dieting, but now it’s just become.....a circle jerk",False,False

Many of those things that you're recognizing as recovery language are actually posted by Fat Acceptance advocates and targeted at the HAES / FA community.,False,False

""Only exercise if you feel like it"" means ""exercise if it makes you feel better not to obsessively lose weight, it might be better to stop working out until you know the difference"" but fat logic twists that into ""only exercise if you REALLY want to, exercising to lose weight is ed behavior.""",False,False

I mean I'm on that sub all the time (don't really comment there just like I don't really comment here) but I used it all through my weight loss and now that I'm teetering on the verge of underweight (still healthy TM) I'm constantly lurking there. It makes me feel better about being so extreme with my habits. ,False,False

Basically it made me get a grip on two things; CICO is sound science and I won’t get fat on 1200 calories a day, and bingeing isn’t the answer to my emotional problems, either.  However, I can see how the sub can be extremely triggering for some.   If someone is posting ED recovery material specifically, please message one of the mods. Encouraging disordered behavior is against the sub rules (and I’ve had posts removed for talking about my own ED and self-flagellating on there) ",False,False
