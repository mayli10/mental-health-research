So  it's not like saying, ""WARNING! THIS IS DISTURBING TO WATCH BC I HAVE AN ED!"" but more like, ""WARNING! I DON'T HAVE AN ED BUT IF YOU DO, THE STUFF I DISCUSS MAY TRIGGER A RELAPSE!""  Whether it's actually effectively utilised is another story lol but... they may just be doing normal calorie deficit dieting and have been made aware that diet talk can be triggering for those with EDs, so they are either trying to warn people with EDs away out of the goodness of their own heart or they are simply covering their asses.",False,False

I've nicknamed these cases ""faux recovery"". Often times I see people who run recovery fitness accounts on social media who are totally unaware that their ED has just changed shape.  It's the obsession that gives them away. Things as subtle as how meticulously they put their meals together, the calculation of their calories and macros tweaked to their liking, are easily picked up on if you're familiar with disordered behaviours.",False,False
