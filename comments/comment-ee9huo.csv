My mum never makes me food but when she does I really have to eat it cause its rare that we get on well. Try to go easy on yourself it's Christmas, it's so hard to eat in a way an ED is okay with. After Christmas everything will be back to normal and then we won't have to eat all this festive food. I wish Christmas was less food-centric so it would be more enjoyable for all of us.",False,False
