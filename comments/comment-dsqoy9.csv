They‚Äôre not the nicest to their plus sized models though either, from what I‚Äôve been told by some other women. Thank you. Modeling commercially is a cutthroat industry and I have had much more success with alternative boudoir modeling. At this point in time I have decided to press pause all together because it fuels my ED. Of course I can only speak for my own personal experience.",False,False

I had already lost a shot ton of weight and transitioned from being considered a ‚Äúplus sized‚Äù model to a ‚Äústandard sized‚Äù model and they still wanted my measurements to be small enough to fit in an XS or S when earlier that year I was wearing a 1X or 2X and was having serious medical complications. (For reference, i was  9 pounds away from being underweight) Essentially because I didn‚Äôt lose that additional 15 pounds that they wanted they didn‚Äôt want me and because they were rude, I didn‚Äôt want to work for them. It was really devastating to my self esteem especially because I was at my LW and was made to feel like I was still too fat. It sucks too because I really used to love their clothing, but feel like as a brand they have shown me time and again they are seriously lacking in the ethics department.",False,False
