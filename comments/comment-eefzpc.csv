I can also tell by how my pants fit, if all 7 lbs of this were fat then my 0s wouldn’t be fitting me rn and they are still a bit baggy.   When a friend took my scale for a bit, I got really good at judging/predicting my weight based on my own calorie counting and how my pants fit because I know which pairs fit at each weight. I can predict my weight to a half lb very accurately.   I honestly need to give up the scale for a month again because it helped me mentally so much and really reduced my B/P sessions.",False,False

I'm hoping today's low restricting helps a bit ugh.,False,False

I’ve slowly put back on 3-4 lbs (based on extremely accurate calorie counting) since thanksgiving but the scale is showing 6-7 due to all the salt and bloat,False,False

Usually that means going over 2500/3000 in a day or even in one sitting. Just because I have such a big appetite. But some days I can eat over 3000 just by going out for meals with friends and enjoying it.   So, it’s more the feeling. Shovelling food that I don’t even want anymore into my mouth until I feel sick because I’m so hungry/anxious/angry",False,False

Over 700 is bad. Over 1000 is worse. I consider any eating that feels out of control - like I can't stop, and NEED to keep eating as a binge - so any amount could be a binge in my mind. And usually when I binge I end the day in the 3000-5000 cals range. But I still feel out of control if I'm over 1200. Or if I eat too much sugar, or too many carbs in general.   Also I don't purge in the traditional sense and sometimes I don't even compensate at all - meaning I continue to binge for days until I can get it together and fast or have a restricting day. I am currently on a binge streak that has lasted away too many days (even though I said I'd do the no binging until Christmas thing - fuck.). It's awful. Most days have been under 2000 with one day nearly 5000. I'm gaining slowly. I'm retaining water. It sucks. Anyway I'm rambling... what I'm getting at is I think a ""binge"" is different for all of us and it's difficult and painful regardless. You aren't alone but I do hope you can find a way to be good to yourself and not feel guilty for nourishing yourself.",False,False
