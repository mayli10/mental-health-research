But whenever I see myself I just feel too big, or that my abs are covered by too much fat  Sometimes (mostly when I’m high) I get a quick glance in the mirror and realize I really do look underweight. Then I binge and feel bad and big and restrict again.  But I do lift and really just wanna look fit and toned I’m just .. so scared of gaining fat I suppose /: ",False,False

I assumed fit people where healthy mentally and physically. I’m clearly ignorant but it’s actually really reassuring to know I’m not the only one and I’m not just faking. I haven’t told anyone because I would feel like an attention seeking liar but I have injured myself before during a workout. I kept pushing and pushing. I think I wanted to get hurt on some level. It was so painful and took almost a year to heal. I really hope I never get to that point again. EDs are so hard to live with :/ ,False,True

Idk why. I know about all these different kinds of EDs but I’m somehow always convinced I don’t have any of them and am just a gross fatty ,False,True

It's definitely very normal, and there's no reason to obsess over feeling like a fake. Hope you're feeling ok - if you start exercising more just be careful not to overdo it to the point of injury/sickness (happens a lot with excessive exercising with people who have EDs).  A lot of people with EDs don't want to reach the extreme of skeletal thinness, some of the people that reached that extreme perhaps did not want to initially either but due to body dysmorphia or other factors kept losing weight beyond their original goal. Their ED still would have been valid and real before they reached the path of losing weight to that extreme.",False,False
