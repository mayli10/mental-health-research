That's probably just me seeing myself in everything though.   Hunger by Florence and the Machine directly references disordered eating- ""At seventeen I started to starve myself / I thought that love was a kind of emptiness / at least I understood the hunger that I felt and I didn't have to call it loneliness""  Save You by Simple Plan says ""You're just skin and bones / you're drowning in the whispers"" (or something like that)   Melanie Martinez's Sippy Cup- ""You've got weights in your pockets when you go to the doctors / your favorite candy's cotton that's why all your teeth are rotten""  Teen Idle by Mariana and the Diamonds- ""I want blood, guts, and chocolate cake / I'm gonna puke it anyway""   In Gasoline by Halsey she says ""Low on self-esteem so you run on gasoline"" and while I don't think it actually has to do with disordered eating it can definitely be interpreted that way.   Crooked Young by Bring me the Horizon- ""We don't sleep, we don't eat""   Sincerity is Scary by the 1975 is about drug use but I consider my eating disorder an addiction and thus relate hardcore to it, and many of the words could bear a meaning equally resonate with us- ""Culture is to blame / You try and mask your pain in the most postmodern way / You lack substance when you say / Something like oh, what a shame / It's just a self-referential way that stops you having to be human""  Am I Pretty by the Maine has strong themes regarding insecurity about one's body.  Habits by Tove Lo might hint at bulimia- ""I get home Ive got the munches / binge on all my twinkies / throw up in the tub then I go to sleep""  Camisado by Panic! At the Disco is about (I think) mental illness/self harm in general but it always makes me think of my hospital stays- ""You're a regular decorated emergency / the bruises and contusions will remind you what you did when you wake / you've earned your place atop the ICU hall of fame / cameras caught you causing a commotion on the gurney again""   in Therapy by All Time Low I hear my own frustrations with never having seen much improvement from talking to professionals and pretending to be fine- ""Therapy, you were never a friend to me"" as well as ""I'm a walking travesty but I'm smiling at everything""",False,False
