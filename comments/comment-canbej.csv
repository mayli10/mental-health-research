I'd call it relapse. That's a real shame &amp; I'm sorry.  There is a reason you ""can't restrict like you used to"". Your body remembers the hell it was living through &amp; will do anything to prevent that from happening again.  If you continue trying to restrict you will continue bingeing...&amp; that will gain you more. If you continue to eat to how your body requires &amp; guides you to...you may overshoot, it's surely possible, but eventually (&amp;it may take a while) you will settle into a natural range. I'm not saying a ""set point"", I'm saying a *range* of a few pounds where your intake naturally is/leads you. Wherever that may be, that is what will be comfortable &amp; *maintainable* for you rather than a miserable yo-yo.  Wishing you all the best :)",False,False
