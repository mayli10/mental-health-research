I’m a pro track athlete and while my diet really isn’t what it should be, I do know what it ought to look like!    Your dinner definitely needs a protein source, as sweet potato and veg isn’t enough to recover your muscles after training.    For breakfast I’d consider having more oatmeal/and or adding more protein as, again, just the yoghurt won’t really cut it.   As you’re in recovery, like another commenter said, you want to be eating a more than this, if you can manage! Look at every meal and see if you have a source of each of the three macros in it - do you have fat? Do you have protein? Do you have carbs?     With such a high level of activity you want all three at every meal so that your body can recover and regulate your hormones properly. For fat for example it can be something like cooking in a little more oil or adding nuts, olives, avocado or coconut to a meal. Like you could add shredded coconut to your oatmeal for example if you like it!    And don’t be afraid to snack more - you’re pushing your body when you get hungry in the day, have something, I’m not suggesting you gain weight only that you recover from all your activity!   If you have any other questions feel free to PM me :)",False,False

Plus you're recovering from an eating disorder, so you're probably going to need even more food than a ""normal"" person. Maybe try having those same meals but, after you're done, ask yourself if you're still hungry and answer honestly, then have something else if your answer is yes",False,False
