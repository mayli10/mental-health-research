People are so quick to talk to someone about their appearance. And one little comment can stick FOREVER.,False,False

I am not trying to judge or pretend like I know what it is like to be other people, but I just can’t figure out *why*.   I think a lot of the time, such comments come from an innocently flippant place — like other general topics people talk about. On the other hand though, people who say such things can be implicating their own insecurities through such comments. Again, I’m not judging.   But honestly, I don’t know what drives such comments. I don’t ever recall commenting on another’s appearance or body, etc. even before I developed my own ED-related issues. So, I can’t really answer your question, friend.  Sorry that you’re having a rough time.",False,False
