Itâ€™s purposely impossible so please donâ€™t feel bad because of some made up diet. You still ate far below your maintenance. Youâ€™re not a failure just bc you couldnâ€™t stick to a diet made up by someone who likely couldnâ€™t even do it their self   I really hope that you feel better and donâ€™t let this get you down too much :( &lt;3,False,False
