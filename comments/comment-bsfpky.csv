I agree with the above poster, that regular oats don’t have enough protein to be filling for me either. I like to add an egg and collagen protein and cook the oatmeal over the stove instead of in the microwave. I think the yolk helps keep me a lot more satiated, too.",False,False

In the morning I like carbs BUT carbs alone make me overeat so I eat the protein-filled one.",False,False

I haven't tried oats with whey protein, will probably give it try considering I still have a full bag of oats on my pantry… I haven't dared to touch it after purging it. Thanks for the idea!",False,True
