I gotta say, for me there was a huge difference in quality of life.   When I was properly underweight I couldn't do anything without feeling like my heart was going to explode or feeling faint. Also, my vertabrae made a grand appearance when trying on wedding dresses (got some comments about that from family) and everyone, literally everyone I saw, told me point blank that I needed to gain. I also started losing my hair at a disturbing rate.   I don't know you and I don't know your goals but the negatives are definitely something to keep in mind at this stage. I want the best for you and in this case that might mean choosing the higher BMI. Please stay safe!! ",False,False

I initially wanted to get to 90lbs, but then when I saw how underweight I’d be, by just barely, I now want to get to roughly 70-80lbs.. ",False,False

For some reason the fact that I’m only just underweight translates to failure in my head ugh. I lost a lot of weight in a short time and now I’m annoyed that I can’t lose a few more kilos just as quickly. ,False,False
