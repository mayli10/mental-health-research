In college, when I relapsed and hit my non-high school low weight, I was the most miserable I‚Äôve ever been in my life. (Part of this was bc I was also binging at this point, and also because I was really conflicted about my food-related choices. In high school it was easy for me to restrict because it was positive and exciting; in college I knew it would mess with my energy and mood and maybe lead to a binge, so I struggled SO MUCH every time I had to choose what to eat, bc I both wanted and did not want to restrict.) I‚Äôm much, much happier now, even though I weigh more than I ever thought I would*. I‚Äôve been flirting with restricting again recently and it‚Äôs helpful for my to remember that restricting has never made me happier...  *admittedly, though, I‚Äôm still on the lower side of a normal weight, so gaining weight hasn‚Äôt impacted the way I‚Äôm perceived by society etc",False,False

If you lose quickly while already being sub-20 BMI, your body is obviously going to panic and scream at you to gain weight when you start maintaining. But if you take it very slowly and drop like 2-3 pounds a month, you can trick your body's homeostatic system to maintain a low weight easier. With unrestricted eating weight tends to rebound at the same rate it was lost, so fighting your body's urge to gain 0.5 pounds a week is much easier than an urge to gain 3 pounds a week.",False,False

But I have a feeling there comes a point of diminishing turns because to keep losing weight I've had to eat less and less. I'm constantly constipated, and trying to get enough protein and fats to make sure my hair doesn't fall out and my nails don't get brittle is a pitiful volume of food. I'm obsessed with food and look at recipes all the time in my free time and fantasize what they would taste like. I binge more NOW than I did 90lbs ago. I ignore the attention I get now and have been less romantically active than when I was fatter because I feel like I don't deserve it.

However, the amount of bad things I shed and good feelings I gain from being underweight feels very good.   I would say that I do feel a general sadness in life in both states, but when I‚Äôm underweight I also feel like I am living in a magical euphoric high that comes from being hungry and the social results of being underweight. Being able to wear anything I want and feeling in control both contribute to this euphoric high, among other things. And even though food becomes forbidden when I am underweight I can even enjoy this aspect, because it makes mealtimes something exciting. When I lay in bed at night I feel like I always have something exciting to look forward to the next  day, and when I‚Äôm actually eating things taste somewhat better because of how hungry I am.
