Don't let your doctors scare you, they're smart but human and make mistakes like everyone else. Get a second (or third or fourth) opinion if you need to. Even if it is MS, don't let it take away your life right now, and maybe see a counselor in the meantime? I'm sorry, this is scary and it sucks :( try to be safe",False,False

I hope you get some news that it's something else that has a brighter outlook. But if not, one of the toughest ladies I've ever known was diagnosed with MS in her early 20s.
