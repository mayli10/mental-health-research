I also had a nose bleed once - and heart palpitations. I really made me stop purging because is very scary. I know most of us does not plan to purge ...but if you do try to be as safer as possible,False,False

This time it was cheese enchiladas and not enough water. I tend to stick to easy purging food, but my grandma insisted on trying the new Mexican restaurant in town.   I also get them around my eyes occasionally.   Thank you for your help and advice!! :)",False,True

Everyone is different though. Take a break from purging for as long as possible and let them heal up, and if you must purge please drink a lot of water and only purge “easy” foods to reduce your strain.  It doesn’t look like a stomach acid burn to me, but you could always 1. Take a few anti-acids 10-15 minutes before purging 2. Apply Vaseline to your skin as a barrier against stomach acid before purging and 3. Wash your face/chin with a baking soda solution after purging to see if that can help. It won’t solve the problem but it can help minimize the damage if acid burn is your problem.   Also, have you been eating anything unusual for you? I only ask because a while ago I started getting bumps and zits after purging around my mouth. Turns out I was semi-allergic to an ingredient in my binge food for that week (coconut) and it was giving me a pimply rash; when I stopped purging anything with coconut my skin got better.",False,False
