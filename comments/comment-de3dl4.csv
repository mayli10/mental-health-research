You wanna recover cuz you feel like shit, right? It's fucking your life up? Well if you recover, you'll have energy again. The brain fog will lift. The voice in your head will quiet. And sure, you'll gain a bit of weight. But I can promise you that you'll be SO MUCH happier fully recovered at a higher weight than not recovered at a lower weight.",False,False

All its promises are lies. It will only ever bring you pain and take away any life you may have had. You can't see what damage it is doing to you on the inside, and if that damage is sustained for too long, full recovery gets further and further away. There will be a point where your body cannot fight for survival, even if you want to mentally.  You are in control of your body and how you live, not the ED. It is a parasite that will do anything to take control of its host. You have the capacity to take away its power. It might never leave, like an unwanted house guest, but you don't have to do what it wants; your body is your home.  Relapses are all part of recovery, but noticing when those bad habits are creeping back in is a good sign, it allows you to regain control and get back on the road to a fulfilling and healthy life. You can do this!",False,False
