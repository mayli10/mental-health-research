Also, ""a full half point"" means it's not a full point. It's just a half point. I know how EDs distort things, but the reality is that absolutely nothing has changed and you're fine and this is totally okay. It may not feel okay now, but it is. You're still exactly who you were before, everything you've been doing has been working just as expected, and nothing about this invalidates what you've been through or your diagnosis.",False,False

Gravity makes you shrink throughout the day, so just like you weigh yourself in the morning before eating (and after pooping lol), you should also only measure yourself in the morning before gravity has managed to get its sneaky claws into you and drag you down.   I had a full on meltdown a few years ago cos my SO measured me at night and I was 5‚Äô4‚Äù. Measured again the next morning (after he frantically explained the gravity thing to my wailing ass) and I was 5‚Äô6‚Äù.",False,False
