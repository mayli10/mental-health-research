I guess it woul be a kind of meditative, mindfulness exercise? Reminding yourself that nothing your brain tells you to do can control you when you control your brain.",False,False

I don’t know if it’s because i have no self control or if it’s because my body is craving nutrition.",False,True

I was obsessing over food and I was thinking about how much I wanted to eat, and it felt like those thoughts were inescapable and I was powerless to not binge, and I suddenly stopped mid-step and thought, wait, but that's just my brain telling me that, and I *am* my brain.  So like, I imagined like I was a brain floating looking down at this other brain that was saying I wanted to eat, and then I, as the higher brain, said no, I don't. I can't feel any cravings because that's my brain telling me things and I am my brain so I can tell my brain things too. And it really worked.",False,False

You really, really are. **It's okay that you've binged. It's okay that you've binged. It's okay that you've binged.**  But I just want to point out some facts (that are hard to swallow, I know): if you've been restricting, your body will try to make up for it in the long run. You will probably binge again. In fact, you will probably keep bingeing until you've stopped restricting, and even beyond then until your body is certain it's not going to go through another famine. It sucks, but our bodies don't give a fuck if we have an eating disorder and want to lose weight. Their job is to keep us alive.   If you can't accept that now, that's okay. Just try not to be so hard on yourself. You're fighting thousands of years of evolution.   And you are going to be okay.",False,False
