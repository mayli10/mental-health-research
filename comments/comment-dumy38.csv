I prefer when there's more people because then quality content still rises to the top bc of all the interactions, but I don't have to worry about missing any posts. Does that make sense? Like, I can't be bothered to check 3 places (4 counting this subreddit) with similar content.",False,False

I don't want to check it. I hate checking it. It is genuinely a hellsite that is actively contributing to its users' EDs.  But when you're in that voracious mode where you just need to read those sweet sweet ED buzzwords, and let the unscientific theories wash over you, and admire the svelte aesthetic of t h i s kind of typing, then.....yeah. It's that time again.   The time to expand arm.   (But like, all guiltily and shit. The guilt makes it okay, right /s)",False,False

It just meant that the people who used to go there turned to other sites for support, like MPA and ED Twitter, and those sites were all so much worse. It was willful negligence on the mods part under a sickly veneer of ""we're doing this for your own good""",False,False

General awareness of eating disorders and the dangers of being underweight helped push extremely thin bodies as ""goals"" etc.  I would probably say that pro-ana sentiment was still the norm in media up until the Kardashians started gaining popularity, piggybacking off other already existing movements/celebrities especially in the rap/RnB scene. That's when it started to be about being ""thicc"". I'm not saying the Kardashians started it, more like they were able to catapult to fame because of the timing of the general public shift, but yeah... I would say looking back that being extremely thin was more popular in the early 2010s/late 2000s (low, low rise jeans...)",False,False

Also the site really glorified bulimia like ~binge haul threads~ teehee. And asking for purging tips like nah you don’t have bulimia don’t be trying to get it that’s not how it works. Also stupid posts from newbies were getting annoying and yes like people have said before the site was no longer what it used to be. It ran its course at least for me. Kinda bummed but o wells. I just hope the users that left are in good places.,False,False

There was a lot of fun banter, but idk it just feels like a horrible cycle of new younger people coming in and 'learning the ropes to an ed' then getting worse.
