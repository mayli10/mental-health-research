I cut for the first time in like 10 years last week. Thanks for sharing, I have BPD too so this makes sense!",False,True

I didn't want to get better so I didn't make any progress with eating and weight gain until my mother threatened to stick me in the hospital to get the tube. I was horrified by that prospect and started eating more, which ultimately led to bulimia because the binges were so huge and it frightened me. I had also stopped seeing my therapist so I had no support.   My self-harm got very severe during that time as well, and I get more urges to cut during recovery attempts.   I think this has something to do with having BPD in addition to my ED, the restricting and overexercising blunt the intense emotional reactions associated with this condition. ",False,False
