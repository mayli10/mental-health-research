In my mind, real sugar and surculose are pretty much the same (not exactly identical twins but same in (both are extremely horrible for you, way)  I call surculose sugar in my head and in my moment of tiredness I forgot to distinguish the two here.   That being said my original post is still somewhat correct? Surculose can still trigger the food reward pathway in some people which can lead to increased appetite, especially if you follow a low carb diet.   And the thing is, Surculose is 600x sweeter than sugar so as you continue to consume it your body will get used to it making normally sweet things taste bitter to you.   I won’t even get into all of the side effects and dangers of consuming surculose. You can research them yourself if you’d like to know.   Also, isoomaltooligosaccharide, quests main source of fiber, alternatively known as isomalto-oligosaccharide, has been found in multiple studies to have a digestion-resistant property and may raise blood sugar just as much as dextrose. Though I will say that I haven’t gone too much into this so I’m afraid I can’t confidently verify the accuracy of this.   I know personally, one I stopped consuming surculose based products, I lost ridiculous weight and my rate of loss is SO much faster now in comparison. I don’t crave sugar or extremely sweet foods as much anymore, barely at all. I haven’t binged once since I ditched it tbh.   I’m definitely more on the orthorexic side of my ED spectrum. I should have specified that to me, personally, eating a quest bar isn’t much better than eating a candy bar.   I know some might not care what the hell they put in their bodies as long as it’s low calorie and fits within their limit. In that case, feel free to eat as many quests bars as you like lmao.   __________________ \\ ___________________  Funfact: did you know Splenda has 3 calories and 2 carbs per packet?",False,False

Hardly a glorified candy bar.  Some do have a lot of sugar (cough, Luna) but Quest isn't one of them.  Using the link, change the flavor and then look on the bottom of the wrapper for the sugar and net carbs:  https://www.bodybuilding.com/store/quest/quest-bars.html",False,False
