And yeah Juliet seems like an awful person in general. Ever since I saw that TMZ clip of her literally abusing Andy on the plane I disliked her. She's really fake too, you can tell she just tries to be like Andy when she probably doesn't even care about rock/metal.",False,True

Rise up and celebrate your life, you're not alone in your ritual. Sing for what you feel inside, becoming one with your ritual...Stronger in new ways, don't care what they say..."" Etc",False,False

Man this post made me nostalgic. Andy used to trigger me quite a lot too tbh. Most ppl on the rock/metal scene have super slim figures because of all the meth coke they take, those drugs suppress your appetite while at the same time fastening your metabolism.   Btw those lyrics are from ‚ÄúThrow the first stone‚Äù right? It‚Äôs funny that they‚Äôd be relevant to your current situation if they were taken literally but I think what they‚Äôre tryna say is that the person‚Äôs never broke a bone cos they never put themselves in risky circumstances, which is kinda a metaphor, they‚Äôre like tryna encourage ppl to put themselves out there and fight for what they want even tho they might end up getting their feelings hurt.",False,False

The main chick is pretty thin too though tbh. So I'd keep that in mind if it's something that really bothers you! Yeah, Pretty Reckless is one of our favorite bands.

Have a pretty love/hate relationship with Andy. Every time hubs and I watch American Satan (so once a month, haha), I will loudly and drunkenly complain about his perfection.
