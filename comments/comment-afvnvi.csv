My co-worker is so petty and immature (she's 50+ and I'm 28) and she always comments on how I look and what I eat. It pisses the shit out of me.   Finally after a month of hearing weekly that I'm so lucky and I can eat anything I told her ""not really, I'm perpetually on diet"". I didn't say what kind of diet because fasting 3 days a week and eating the rest of my calories in chocolate is not an actual diet...   Since I told her that, she keeps saying stuff that I definitely know aren't true. She is on the heavier normal/slightly overweight side and she keeps saying stuff like ""I don't need to eat, I just eat with my eyes"" or ""I just take this rice box (a Persian meal) and that's enough for the day"" or even ""I usually have breakfast at home and a second breakfast here but I'm trying to change this into juice and tea"" *proceeds to drink a full double cup of sugary coffee-based drink with biscuits*. She is ridiculous and I don't want to be mean or shame her, she's free to do whatever she wants, but she has turned this into a ridiculous competition of who is able to eat less. Bring it on, bitch, I can eat zero calories for several days ðŸ™„",False,False

Recently a few guys I know have said this to me and I looked at them and just laughed in their face. There is nothing natural about this whatsoever. You eat under 700 calories a day and workout at minimum 2 hrs a day and purge everything you do consume and talk to me about being naturally thin. ,False,False
