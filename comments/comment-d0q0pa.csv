The thing that saved meâ€” and now I do honestly feel mostly glad Iâ€™m still hereâ€” was the thought of my little brothers having to miss school for my funeral and go back and answer their friendsâ€™ questions. The next time, it was the fact that my fiancÃ© wouldnâ€™t know which dog food to buy or when to give our puppy his meds, and I didnâ€™t want him to get sick. After that, it was because I didnâ€™t want my fiancÃ© to lose the house without my income, because heâ€™s worked so hard and doesnâ€™t deserve to deal with that. I know how easy it is to feel like everyone else would be better off without you when youâ€™re in the middle of it. Even if you canâ€™t imagine people being devastated right now, the loss of you would hurt the world. I want you to be able to want to live for yourself, but itâ€™s okay if you can just manage to live for your neighborâ€™s dog who you pet sometimes for now. Hang in there",False,False
