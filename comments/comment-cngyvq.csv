Especially based on your inability to hear what Evey poster here is saying, I strongly suspect this is an issue with your mind.   Either way, seek medical help. You will not receive what you are looking for here, which we can only assume is some specific source of validation that you continue to push for by ignoring all posts that don't provide it.    And if you felt like this is rude, it's not intended to be. But it's also not intended to be polite as you have already clearly deviated from your pretense of asking a question and are firmly in ""tell me what I want to hear"" land. We are not here to play your game with you.",False,False

I don’t get why everyone always assumes I’m trolling. I don’t know what’s wrong with my body. I eat only up to 200 calories each day. Which is only two granola bars or a few pieces of fruit each day. I don’t eat anything else and other than that I just drink water.  I don’t eat out on weekends and I’m not lying to myself. I don’t know what’s wrong with my body so that’s why I asked here. I feel weak and dizzy but I never lose weight no matter what method I try.,False,True

So no body is free from the constraints of thermodynamics so either you weigh 1.50lbs or you're eating more than you think. Or you have some giant, body shaped, body sized tumor inside of you that has mutated to feed on sunlight. But probably your calorie assessment is off. You couldn't be eating 200 for a week and not have some fluctuating, let alone months.    Are you including liquid calories? Vegetable, fruit, and ""heathy"" calories? Mostly, are you lying to yourself? All of these are valid and frequent issues, and what you have written here is disconnected from reality.   And honestly is this even a real post because it feels super low effort.",False,False
