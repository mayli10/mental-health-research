It’s so hard to explain to anyone why the holidays are so hard or so draining especially when they come from a place of love and safety and have good mental health. This was my first holiday being estranged from my immediate family and it’s been really hard to be okay and be present even though I am so much happier. It’s a weird dichotomy I’m trying to sort out with myself and I feel better about having to figure it out knowing that I’m not alone.  I’m trying to I’m glad you’ll be getting some respite from your family while you’re at school and I hope you can take some time to try to love yourself even if its hard. Pm me if you wanna bitch about anything even if it’s school being overwhelming- and remember that there are people out here who care 💜,False,False

And it’s confusing to have such mixed feelings about such a happy time of year. Or what’s supposed to be a happy time of year.  Idk what to do now that they are over tbh this has been my most “successful” holiday season and I still feel like trash.  -I don’t live with people who abuse me anymore, instead I spent my holidays with my SO’s fam who loves me and accepts me and never ever makes me eat anything that I don’t want to. -I don’t live with people who binge eat EVERY DAY, instead my SO and I plan out a grocery list and it is almost always healthyAF  -I don’t live with people who stock the house with 2 months worth of junk food around the holidays which then is consumed within two WEEKS, instead I did my best to eat dinner when I was hungry and stop when I was full (which is hard in it self bc I get full after like 3 bites but always want to keep eating, but I did try!)  -I only overate a handful of times (like two or three times) and when I did it was never a bad binge which I am proud of. -I have not purged in a year and a half (even though I wanted to)  And yet I feel sadder than ever now that the holidays are over, I’m thinking about food WAY MORE now and even though I’m glad I won’t have to go to any more get togethers, I’m sad that I won’t have an excuse to “eat a real dinner” (it’s more acceptable in my brain for me to eat if I’m with SO’s family.)   I mean truth is it’s bc I’m triggered as fuck for a million reasons but it’s honestly frustrating. These were the happiest holidays I’ve had in ten years and I still feel FAT AND SAD AND MAD it is honestly unfair. I want to feel the joys and success of the year and I’m just ... blah.  End rant thank you for listening.",False,False
