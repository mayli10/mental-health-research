So far I feel like it’s great - it’s keeps my appetite low and it’s compresses my waist by about half an inch. Not bad for two days, though I wore the garment for 6 hours the first day and 10 hours the next day. The quality seems good; it’s very durable. I just got mine of amazon for around 23 bucks.  Here it is: SHAPERX Women's Waist Trainer... https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07M5THM98?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share",False,True
