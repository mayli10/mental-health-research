Went to the park where it was filmed. Even had the hots for shit boy Hemmings. And yes, wanted my ribs to show just like Verushka‚Äôs, or Jane Birkin‚Äôs. It‚Äôs really affected me, philosophically, which is a snooty thing to say, but like the message that we create meaning - for better or worse - still shapes my outlook.",False,False

Celebrities do of course make up excuses like that, but I'm inclined to believe it in this case.

I have no trouble believing that's the face of someone who just spent a week shitting their guts out!",False,False
