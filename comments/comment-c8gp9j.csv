Just today I was having a conversation with this same ex in which I basically agreed to get back together under the stipulation that he‚Äôs not going to really make time for me and doesnt want to feel bad about not being able to be a good partner. I think it was fate that you commented on this so I could look back at this and how awful he treated me and change my mind. So that you for digging 85 days worth in r/edanonymous üòÇüôà,False,True

This guy sounds so gross and absolutely out of line. EDs are hard enough without people saying things like that and making things worse. You deserve so much better! I hope things turn out better for you. There are so many potential partners out there that would love you. I also look like a child, I have a super young face and no curves (&amp; somehow still not skinny enough). I always have wanted to feel ‚Äúsexy‚Äù and felt like looking so young/flat made it impossible. I don‚Äôt feel happy about the way I look all the time, but it‚Äôs so much better than it use to be. I try to reply to every negative though I have about myself with two positive ones, and same with my negative thoughts about food/after I eat. I think of this quote from Audrey Hepburn too: ‚ÄúThere is more to sex appeal than just measurements. I don't need a bedroom to prove my womanliness. I can convey just as much sex appeal, picking apples off a tree or standing in the rain.‚Äù You are sexy when you feel sexy. So many beautiful and sexy women don‚Äôt have curves or are smaller. It‚Äôs also so much easier to feel sexy when you have a partner who loves you/supports you and finds you attractive(as you are).",False,False

He could be a bit more considerate. I understand him not finding a skinny person attractive, but saying it in such a harsh away(esp if he knows you have an ED) is so wrong and disgusting. It's good that you broke up with him even if it hurts now you will see in the long run that you did the right thing.",False,False
