Every rational part of me wants to order a pizza and be done with it because oh man I want pizza... I'm just not... Physically hungry? Or at least I've screwed up my perception enough that I've convinced myself I'm not physically hungry and that it's just ""I want a pizza because it's pizza"", I actually just raided the veg drawer of my fridge because all I can think about is just... Eating something  And honestly, regardless thank you for taking the time to write out a response ❤️",False,True

So I don't even know if this will help, but uh, here's this:  You definitely do have a disorder. To be here, to eat only two apples since last thursday, to be feeling jealous to this degree about people who are smaller than you - yes. You are disordered. You are not any less disordered because people aren't concerned for you (yet?).   With how fasting works, after the three day mark, it's very common to not feel hungry at all and to even feel euphoric.  It doesn't mean you're fat for eating those apples. In fact, I'm v jealous that you aren't foaming at the mouth for some food rn because I'm so shit at fasting.   You're not faking it, you're just? Doing well at it? I feel really bad for complimenting you in this way because ew 'promoting eating disorders' but, it's true. For our fucked up brains at least.",False,False
