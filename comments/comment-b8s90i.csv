The SECOND I gain actual weight it becomes apparent in my face and collarbones, and when I lose it both are the first to change. My face changes a lot with weight and it's kind of spooky to me.     I see a difference in the pics, your collarbones and jawline are def different (same happens to me). You could edit two pics together side by side for an easier comparison next time, or you could experiment and take a few selfies at the same angle at different weights to see for yourself and make it easier to tell?",False,False

But the thing is I only lost, at most, 2 lbs of water weight (cause the other 2 lbs was fat). So I guess that means that water weight has, per pound, far more noticeable impact on your appearance than fat does?",False,True
