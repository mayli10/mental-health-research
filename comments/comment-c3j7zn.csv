To me, it sounds like at least SOME of your binging could be because you are trying to place restrictions on yourself. Even if you fail at following those restrictions every single day and night, if you are mentally forbidding a food from yourself your brain kinda panics and wants it as often as possible. That's how it is with dairy for me, being lactose intolerant but also a binge eater, when I'm restricting well I wouldnt touch dairy with a 10 foot pole but when I'm binging it's usually the first thing I go after. I didnt stop binging on it till I started by allowing myself a small amount of halo top every night and working up to random dairy treats when I felt like it (usually restricting other stuff to fit it in).  Anyways, binging isnt necessarily caused by only one thing. The way you've described it, it doesnt sound like a reward. It sounds panicked. I think, if you agree with that, that you should talk to your therapist about it and say ""hey, this doesn't feel like a reward, it feels like panic or punishment and it's really distressing for me and I'd like to start working on figuring out why I'm doing this""  Good luck pal, I hope your therapist can help you find more insight",False,False

The part about watching the car drive away and immediately racing to the kitchen? I could have written that word for word. You’re not alone, man.   And not to disparage your therapist in any way (therapy is fantastic and I respect you so much for doing it), but for me at least, binging was anything *but* a self-reward. People binge for all kinds of reasons. Obsessive compulsion, as a form of self-harm or self-punishment, coping emotionally, etc. Personally, it wasn’t until I had the eureka moment that for me, bingeing was just my method of self-harm and self-sabotage (I was also really obsessed with fitness, but binged to self-sabotage because I thought I was a garbage person who didn’t “deserve” health), that I was able to figure out how to start avoiding it. Maybe it would do you good to really sit and think, maybe journal, about why you might be compelled to binge? Your therapist could help you interpret your feelings.   Also, your problems are *not* less valid just because they don’t stem from a desire to be skinny. Disordered eating/EDs aren’t always just about being skinny. Orthorexia is one that may manifest as a desire to be skinny, but mainly as a compulsive need for health. Muscle dysmorphia is actually seeing yourself as *too* skinny! A guy could look like Dwayne Johnson and think he looks like Christian Bale in The Machinist. Some people with eating disorders don’t experience any type of body dysmorphia at all; they may even really like their bodies. Just because you might not fall perfectly into a DSM-5 category does *not* mean that your problems aren’t real, or worthy of seeking help for.",False,False
