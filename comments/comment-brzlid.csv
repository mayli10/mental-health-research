The first 3 days I was sort of mesmerized and obsessed about restriction. But I got bored of it maybe. Maybe it was from watching too many calorie challenge and recipe videos and shit idk. I have snacks and desserts left untouched that I would normally reach for first thing, and our fridge and freezer are fully stocked but I'm not tempted by any of it. And all i can think anyway is that it'd be a shame if I did eat anything because I know it won't be satisfying. I'm so self-aware that I can't even fathom supposing I would eat anything. Like yeah I'd feel guilty probably but I have no desire in the first place.  Today has been the most eventful and unavoidable food-wise. Went to a party thing and had 2 slices of pizza (they were cut thin) and went to another event and had 2 cookies. Didn't feel guilty because I planned on allowing myself exactly this. My dad was with me and it was expected I had pizza, so I got 2 slices to look normal, and later was offered a couple of cookies so I took 2 as well. Eating felt mechanical though and I was a bit bummed out. I wanted to enjoy it. I didn't get anything out of it. I feel let down and underwhelmed. I'm not mad about it though. It's just like, I really could've gone without and it would've been no different to me.  This is just a prompt for me to vent my thoughts. But is hunger a thing? I feel like eating has always been a matter of addiction to sugar/carbs, numbing or distracting myself/procrastinating/ (using the excuse that i feel too lousy to do anything now that I've ate) /routine and habit/to ""refresh"" boredom. I don't really feel like I've ever been proper hungry.   I've been more social and eager to just do things. And super fucking bored. Like my normal distractions don't interest me whatsoever. Not in like a depressed way, by distractions i mean dumb shit like browsing reddit and watching youtube or playing video games. And I don't have much else to do.  I've also had less tolerance for people. As in I get bored easily. Especially my boyfriend. And i find myself stopping paying attention to what people are saying to me while they're talking because I lose interest. In a way, I'm less inhibited. I'm still polite but not like I'm constantly walking on my tip toes anymore  I guess I've been a bit restless. I've been getting less sleep but still functioning well. But i absolutely hate this boredom. Nothing is stimulating me",False,False

Like 5'0 and having-trouble-hitting-triple-digit-weights tiny. Occasionally, when no one is home, I'll sneak into their room and try on all their cute clothes to trigger myself.  It's been a few months since last time I tried it, and I had to go into their room for something today and suddenly got the urge to do it. So I picked out one of my sisters' Columbia sherpa jacket; I've been obsessed with sherpa recently. I held it up, thinking, ""Oh man, this is so small; this is gonna trigger the fuck out of me."" I looked at the XXL shirt I had on, and started slipping on the XS jacket.  ..and the arm fit. I was like ""Oh, wow that's weird.."" and then it fit around my back and onto the second arm; I thought, ""Oh, progress, that's awesome! Cool, but I'll get my triggered on by trying to zip it up; there's no way this will zip before my breast reduction next month."" And I was wrong. It zipped. Not only did it zip, but it fit like a glove. I looked in the mirror and I looked amazing. I have never worn anything XS in my life.  A little dazed, I threw the jacket off and picked out something else. Obviously, the jacket only fit because it was oversized, right?  I'm honestly not sure if I just happened to pick out a bunch of oversized things on accident, but I tried on a bunch of different pieces..all of them fit. Some of them were a little tighter than others in the arm area (one of my biggest trouble areas, still have way more fat to lose there), but nonetheless, they all fucking fit. Bottoms too, although that's not as surprising for me because I have a spongebob body.  Of course, as I mentioned before, I'm getting a breast reduction, and their bralettes look ridiculous over my boobs (I'll break them if I try them on honestly), but maybe after the breast reduction, I'll actually be a true XS/S in tops.. I'm just so accustomed to buying XL/L, and sometimes even those being too small..I'm honestly in for a trip right now. I've lost 50 pounds, but a HUGE portion of that has come from muscle due to binge/weight loss cycles, so I'm not proud of my weight loss at all and still think I look obese.   But it's gotten to the point where I thought I would never be small enough to fit cute clothes because my rib cage and shoulders are just too wide..but obviously...I was wrong  Why is it that I think I still look so fat/obese then?   BDD is weird yo :(",False,False

I don't know how to cope with this guilt. And on top of it I've picked up a nasty habit of poking at my belly fat when I'm slumped in chair (which is quite visible since I'm obese).
