Your life won't be perfect. You won't fall in love. Your personality will not change.  You can do the things you want and get the things you want at any weight, actually. Consider that you're actually too scared to go after them -- dating is scary, being vulnerable is scary, etc etc. I used ED to prevent myself from getting the things an ""ideal"" (actually sick/deathly) body would give me, even though on one level I thought I was getting closer to them by striving for that body and hating the body I had then. That's one of the things I learned in therapy. ED promised me all the things I ever wanted (a huge lie) on one hand, but also kept me safe from them and prevented me from ever getting them.",False,False

I used to hate my body too, from pretty much age 11 onward. My hatred of my body caused me so much shame. I used my shame as an excuse to isolate myself and avoid seeing people.   Would you consider therapy? Anorexia and body dysmorphia will kill you. It's one of the most deadly mental illnesses.   I only healed my relationship with food with the help of a therapist specializing in eating disorders. They've seen it all and are eager to help.",False,False
