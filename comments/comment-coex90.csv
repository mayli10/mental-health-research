I've never seen anyone fast for 2 months. It is impossible for anyone to not eat ANYTHING for two months. Even if they do go on a fast, they need vitamin supplements, and electrolytes, their blood pressure is going to be messed up and it is gonna affect their health.",False,False

There is no way your body can keep up with that mentally/physically, and for two months? it's impossible to go through with such restricted 'diet' and not binge/face real health problems. If you're looking for losing weight please do it in a healthy way and forget this sub. Intermittent fasting, and a diet of 1000 calories a day, with exercise or active life should provide a very stable weight loss. So please do not follow that plan",False,False
