Your body increases efficiency by lowering your BMR (even your heartrate decreases), lowering thermogenesis (hence why you feel cold, adipose browning is actually reduced during energy deficits), lowering NEAT, increasing digestive efficiency by lowering the thermic effect of food, and also lowering exercise thermogenesis by limiting exertion (endurance athletes for example will be unable to maintain high heartrates) and, speaking anecdotally, increasing perceived exertion.",False,False

Their attempts to reduce their food intake are only successful to the degree that they are able to depress their metabolic rate by undereating most of the time.

Like by not eating enough calories that meet your nutritional needs in the long run could cause weight gain via binging or just fuck with your metabolism.

But obesity is a leading cause of death and yet people are so confused about gaining/losing weight. I'm not saying it's easy to intact it, but it's an incredibly simple formula (CICO). I think deep down everyone knows the key is to just eat less/better.
