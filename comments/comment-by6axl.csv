It felt real (without being exploitative or cynical), yet it was also a delightful escape.   I also loved that Bryce Dallas Howard was properly zaftig in her role. Usually you see some extremely fit actress pretending to be a working class mom, and it never looks real.  I did sigh during the dessert ordering scene, because I knew what was coming next, but others clearly didn't because they were kinda laughing at first. (Oh you sweet summer children.) But overall it was about the best handled/least triggering ED content I've seen onscreen, so props for that.",False,False
