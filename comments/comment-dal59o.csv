Atypical anorexia to binge eating for the past like 4 months. I'm still trying to restrict to compensate but i can try to help you out.  Like another comment said, maybe try hitting macro goals instead of calorie goals. If you want to nourish yourself you need to make sure you're getting enough of each macro. There's calculators online if you need to figure out what your goals are.  There was a post on here a bit back that was a pretty good guide on how to fight binges and i'll link it if i can find it.

If so, you may want to get help/support from a dietitian or similar provider. It's really tough trying to self-recover (although I realize some people have no other choice).",False,False
