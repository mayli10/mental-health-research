It's ranged from severe restriction and weight loss, to binge eating and major weight gain, and now back to heavy restriction and other compensatory methods with pretty significant weight loss. I have never been officially diagnosed with anything and at this point it feels too awkward and uncomfortable to even discuss with my family or a medical professional.  One of my very good friends has been in and out of recovery for anorexia for about 8 years (she is 28). Recently she has had a lot of significant stress in her life and relapsed hard. She was trying to open up to me and another mutual friend about what was going on and I kept saying that I knew exactly what she was talking about but was afraid to tell her why. This eventually prompted me to send her an email confessing what I have been going through for years. She called me and it started a dialogue where now we are able to talk to each other, especially on our really difficult days.  Sometimes I worry that dumping my struggles on her is a really bad idea, but at the same time I have never been able to be so honest with someone who truly understands. It's actually making me stop and think about the choices I make because I truly want her to do well and move forward with her recovery and it's making me think about how I should want that for myself too. She's good at making me feel like I'm worthy of recovery too without pushing too hard.  But yeah, at this point I agree that I just feel like I am too old to still be dealing with this shit. It's exhausting...",False,False

It's definitely not as bad as it used to be and I had 4 year period of normal eating. I think the biggest factor for me was getting therapy for my trauma that was where the biggest amount of my EDs destructive power came from. Processing that trauma toned down the destructive nature of my EDMONSTER by a good bit.  But I'm having a feeling that little relapses are going to be a life time thing for me. :( ,False,False

I definitely am not as old as you, and I haven't had my ED for as long...but I've had it since I was 12. And at 12, I never imagined I'd still be doing the same shit but worse. I've been trying to recover since 15. 5 fucking years of attempted recovery, and during that time, escort for a small potion just recently, all that has happened is that my ED has gotten worse.

Fucked up shoulders (surgery is next month) and infertility at 34...my ED has given me the physical age of about 60 years old.   I'm eating better but the thoughts, behaviors, shame, guilt, self-hate etc are all there - probably forever because now I see the effects of this fucking disorder on top of the irrational thoughts.

I got good treatment and very much thought that I was fully recovered early in my early twenties (looking back, the warning signs for relapse were there). It has been crushing to realize no, it’s not over,  and I might fight this the rest of my life. For me I think it’s mostly due to tendencies toward depression and anxiety and this being the easiest and habitual outlet/form of coping.   Full remission/recovery is one outcome of these disorders with or without treatment. I’ve seen it happen, and I would never tell someone it’s not possible. But for a substantial proportion of us, we will battle this for a long time, maybe our entire lives. I sincerely hope it’s not a chronic illness for me, but I think my expectations for what this will look like across my life have become more realistic. I wish these narratives were also told when we talk about eating disorders (including partial recovery, which helps many of us function and lead meaningful lives). I still have hope for all of us that things can at least improve. ",False,False

I have had periods of ""recovery"" but relapses eventually come in and my life goes on hold yet again.  I have been in this relapse for almost 3 years now.  My ED has caused me to lose relationships with family, it has caused me to lie and do terrible things.  I can't concentrate on anything BC 80 percent of my thoughts are food, weight, and what I'm going to eat next. I feel like my life is always on hold until I can get to my goal weight, which is never good enough. I have thought of killing myself, but could never do that to my kids, even though my ED has made mothering challenging.  I want to get help, but it means my husband of 17 years would finally have to admit to himself that I have a problem, and his denial means I can keep using my anorexia as a way to cope with normal daily life.

It makes me want to laugh/cry when I think about it because I still think of others at this age being all sensible and ... old.  You can get out of it though.  This is my second relapse.  During my 30s I had a 7 year gap of being a ""normal"" eater.  This time getting into a recovery mindset is a lot more difficult because I'm thinking what's the point but then the point is I want to be a normal eater again and not letting calories and weight rule my entire life.  I think to myself every day why's this still a thing.  I know life's greener on the other side, I know it can be done but wtf's holding me back from taking the plunge again?  Kinda feel on the brink of doing something about it instead of telling myself maintaining's enough.  It's not because it's miserable.  Tired of the ED, tired of fighting it.    I think a lot of treatment methods for older people with EDs is really crap, being the same as those for people in their teens/twenties.  When you're older you have actual responsibilities and don't live with parents to wrap you in cotton wool, buy your groceries, make sure you're eating, drive you everywhere to make sure you attend appointments.  There's also none of the - oh well, you're young you've got the rest of your life ahead of you as motivation.  Motivation's holding me back but I don't want to do any more damage to my body and spend the rest of my life in physical pain with endless doctor/hospital appointments.  I also want to go out for nice things to eat.  I want a slice of cake with my coffee.  I know these things raise my mood and being stronger physically because of better nutrition helps with depression.
