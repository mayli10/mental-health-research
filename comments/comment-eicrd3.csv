I am 37 and this shit really messed up my teeth. A few years ago I mustered the courage to go to the dentist. He totally knew, but wasn’t a jerk about it. Fixed my teeth (so many cavities) and gave me harm prevention techniques. Like I get the fluoride treatment they give little kids. It’s like $40 but I haven’t had a cavity since I started getting it.",False,True

The purging is rotting my teeth. I’m so afraid to go to the dentist. Purging hasn’t helped me lose any weight any way. I gained 6 pounds this month. But that was ~15 binge days. One won’t do much harm to you. &amp; plus maybe you’ll poop! 👍,False,False
