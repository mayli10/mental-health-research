If you feel like working on this some more, it might be fun to train an NLP model on your data; most trivially bag-of-words, but you could also try word2vec or similar. Using your model you can then cluster related terms, manually go in and annotate related terms for themes, and then cluster peach accounts based off these annotations.  I think that way you'll probably get a more representative view of ""ED-related"" words that may not be intuitively obvious choices for manual segmentation, as well as getting an idea of how the community is otherwise comprised. Heck, this sounds fun, if you're willing to share code/data, I'd like to give it a try.",False,False
