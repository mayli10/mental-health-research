Which makes no sense but it was bliss",False,True

Just get tired of it one day, and then stop.  I chewed and spit food for years, decided one day to quit, and then that day realized it was exhausting to do all day every day and I didn't even want to start up again.",False,False

Because recently I’ve been so tried of bingeing and purging that I got lazy and stopped doing it... Like years and years of trying to stop and lazyness was the answer xD  Still have the restriction part but eh maybe it’ll go too,False,False

That’s probably rookie numbers but whatever. Along with losing a ton of weight I’ve gained an obsession over food and calories and macros and shit. I wish, I wish, I wish food wasn’t the main fucking thing. Day in and day out. My only personality trait.  I’m thinking about reaching out to a licensed dietitian. I need to start reverse dieting and upping my calories so that I have more energy for exercise (like going to the gym and lifting heavy, I can’t do it currently, I get so light headed). Sadly reverse dieting also requires careful calorie tracking so that I don’t start regaining fat. Maybe after that I won’t have to worry about every bite I eat. Fuck me. I can’t remember what it’s like, just... eating something. Without worry or guilt or anxiety.",False,False

After counting and stressing for so long it just becomes so mentally exhausting. And I don't even enjoy the foods I'm eating anymore because I'm so hung up on my safe foods. I've maintained my weight now for 6+ months regardless of how much i've been restricting and its just becoming so unmotivating. The thought of restricting even lower makes me think why the fuck bother anymore??? Trying my best to love my body too. It differs day to day. But good for you for loving your body and changing your habits! It's motivating to see people move forward and especially loving their body.,False,False
