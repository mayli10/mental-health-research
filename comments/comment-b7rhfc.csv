A Karen, if you will.  I‚Äôm not always thrilled that she‚Äôs around, but sometimes being with her beats being by myself.",False,False

Whenever something goes wrong on my life, I always have my ED to fall back on- ""I can just fast today""  ""I'll eat under 400 cal today""  ""I'm gonna binge- forget it""  ""At least I'll be skinnier than \*insert name(s)""  - You get the point. I feel like my ED is the most supportive thing in my life. It sounds stupid saying it, but it's true.",False,False

Giving up your ED will definitely be painful (emotionally and physically, depending on your condition). But, the above comment says it all. The feeling of comfort we get from our ED is largely an illusion. Giving up your ED may be the hardest thing you will ever have to do, but doesn't that just show you how important it is? Sorry if this made no sense, and good luck. ",False,False
