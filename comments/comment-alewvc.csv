I know the fear or eating out is real but maybe try going somewhere with a grilled fish option? Those dishes usually come with a veggie and a starch. Have a fancy night out somewhere nice where the portions are smaller.   My ed is particularly fueled by wanting to be databable and I feel to fat to even try. The fact that you dont is a major step! ,False,False
