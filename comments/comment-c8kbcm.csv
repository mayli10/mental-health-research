Like, one problem I have is that growing up I was always really small so I kinda got used to being the small one, but then as a teen I had a massive growth spurt and now I'm taller than average, so whenever I'm around average height girls it makes me dysphoric. I'm not that much taller than an average girl realistically, but I have this idea in my head that maybe if I didn't go through puberty as a boy that I might be still be shorter so it really bothers me.",False,False

I don't even want to see any of the pics my family took of me when we were at a funeral last week because they all take pics from a really low angle. Like, the people who took the pics were shorter than me and would hold their phones at their chest for some reason. And the spot they wanted to take photos had such poor lighting. I could hear my relatives making fun of themselves in the photos, but they don't struggle with body dysmorphia or gender dysphoria like I do so they don't feel bad when seeing poor quality photos like I do.",False,False
