All that ended up happening is - I got clinically morbidly obese and hitting my highest weight ever triggered my ED back into high gear. I have gotten back to ""only"" overweight through bouts of low restriction punctuated with ""normal"" eating and they cycle is now endless.  Everyone thinks this is just about fatphobia or if they tell me I am beautiful the way I am I will have a glorious revelation that I am actually beautiful and stop. Either that or they say ""Oh wow you must be living a much healthier lifestyle now and girl you look so great now that you lost that weight but you don't need to lose anymore okay?"" or ""Just lose it healthily and workout if you want to be thinner"" or ""you don't want to look like an anorexic! haha!"".",False,False

I feel as if the second I hit normal weight is the second I will allow myself to get help. It feels as if my issues donâ€™t matter unless Iâ€™m at least at a normal BMI. :(,False,True

You donâ€™t need to change because of your disorder, or to meet an arbitrary standard of beauty.   Please, if you really want to lose weight, talk to a therapist and a dietitian first about how youâ€™re feeling. Take your time. Find what feels good to all parts of your body and your mind. You are not a masterpiece hiding in a block of marble that you have to chip away to find. You are already a complete work of art ðŸ’–",False,False
