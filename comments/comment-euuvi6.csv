She's always like when was the last time u ate a burger or chips and why don't you ever eat unhealthy u must be miserable. At the same moment going on about how healthy she is when I just watched her eat a whole massive bag of tortilla chips. It's actually so annoying,False,True

Someone sabotaging themselves is very hard to watch. So many live in denial and have constant fat logic and are truly confused how they gained so much. It doesn't help that she is putting you down for eating less and not mirroring her toxic habits.,False,False
