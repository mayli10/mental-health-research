So true... I got sucked into the terribly habit of purging and every time I ate even the smallest thing like a chocolate truffle, I had to purge even if it was at work.  Every time I looked down a drain, whether it be a toilet or a shower, even at my boyfriend's place, I wanted to purge. Can't count the number of times I purged after dinner with my boyfriend in HIS shower drain (terrible, I know). Eventually, I fell out of the habit because frankly, it was gross and I hated the idea of having my face anywhere near a toilet like that again. I lasted maybe a few months, and now I've fallen back into the habit of purging because my weight went up a bit and I have a trip coming up... Just awful...",False,False
