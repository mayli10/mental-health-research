He’s like offered to buy me new clothes, vacations, etc. for gaining certain amounts of weight. It’s sweet but fuck.

Nah. Shit went to hell. I was eating like 3500-4000 calories a day. Somewhat got it under control but I’m still eating way more than I’d like.   What I initially thought was water weight from a week or 2 of bad eating has become a permanent 3 lbs. going out of town tomorrow so hello more weight gain bc no one knows how to fucking eat healthy, my drinking will be up bc of a friends graduation, dealing with my SOs family, Mother’s Day (of course ya girl is gonna have some mimosas bc being a mom is hard &amp; if I can have some day time alcohol &amp; it not be frowned upon I’m doing it, lmao).   Sorry to rant on your post lol",False,False
