This isn't emo at all, this is some very real shit, and it's brave of you to post it. It sounds like you at least have a lot of insight into why your mom has such toxic attitudes - although I realize that knowing *why* someone is the way they are doesn't help much in dealing with them on a practical level.   Intergenerational trauma like this is very pernicious, and often difficult to deal with. If you're in a position to access therapy, I would consider it for yourself. Don't worry, your therapist won't (or shouldn't) pressure you into getting treatment for the ED if that's not something you want. It just sounds like you could use some space to deal with the emotional burden your mom has placed on you. If you do look for a therapist, frankly I would recommend finding an Asian American practitioner. I have friends who have had a really hard time trying to work with white therapists on family issues like this...this is definitely an area where the issue of individualist vs. collectivist cultural norms can be a barrier to understanding.",False,False

My mom (and brothers) also fat shamed me while growing up. If you can, let it all go. The hate isn't worth it and revenge isn't as sweet as we think it is. At some point I realised that my mom probably had my best interest in mind, but just didn't know how hurtful it really was to me. She was very much a product of her upbringing where skinny=good and fat=bad.",False,False
