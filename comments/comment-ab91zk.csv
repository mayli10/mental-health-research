It doesn't have to be tons of food for it to be a calorie bomb. Some meals are a calorie bomb even if the serving size is normal, especially traditional dishes on holidays.

I kind of thought of it the opposite way -- like, don't worry and fret *so much* about this one treat you might be having for Christmas... because that will easily even itself out, without any effort, if you're eating sensibly for the rest of the year.

Excessive worry over the availability and temptation of seasonal treats can actually lead to developing a black-and-white, binge/restrict mentality, where it's like, ""New Year's is just around the corner, better eat ALL THE COOKIES while they're available and I'm not officially on a diet yet.""   But then, fast-forward several months, maybe you have a bad day at work and eat a pint of cheap store-brand ice cream to self-soothe. Maybe this begins happening more frequently, and before you know it you're overeating on a regular basis. It's every-day crappy food, you don't enjoy it, there's no social component, and it happens way more often than Thanksgiving or Christmas... but *because* it's not a special occasion, just an every-day binge, it doesn't register the same amount of weird guilt as that one single dessert you invest with so much emotional power during the holidays.  It's kind of sad to agonize over food that surfaces just once a year. I'm not even someone who *does* partake of holiday food, myself, but even I can see the messed-up logic in vilifying it. Like, why stress over one slice of pie that's happily savored with friends and family... when you could easily end up unintentionally stress-eating thousands of calories later on in the year, which you won't enjoy or even remember? What's the point of exercising restraint at the holidays if you're going to wind up scarfing down a bag of chips alone in the dark some random Tuesday night in February?   We also just had a really different food culture a few decades ago in which set days or periods of indulgence made more sense (listen to my mom talk about how they used to drink a small 8-oz cup of cola every once in a while as a special treat!). Our holiday customs still reflect a time in which high-calorie foods were often either prohibitively expensive or time/labor-intensive to make, or just socially not part of people's daily habits... if you had to make your own doughnuts or French fries every time you wanted some, you probably wouldn't have the opportunity or inclination to eat them all that often. Now you can just drive through Starbucks or McDonalds every morning...",False,False
