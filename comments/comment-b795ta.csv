It was after Christmas and I was going to put the Christmas chocolate in the fridge. I ended up eating 3 mini Cadbury dairy milk bars, 2 packs of Cadbury buttons, 3 Wispas and 2 fudges. Then ended up eating a McDonald‚Äôs cheeseburger and grilled chicken salad and chocolate milkshake when my mum and dad brought in it later.   I‚Äôve also eaten half of a strawberry gateau and 2 cans of squirty cream on top. And half of box of honey Cheerios.   There was also a binge where I ate a full pack of So Natural almond cereal bars. I‚Äôve also eaten more or less 3 jars of honey and 3 jars of white chocolate spread over 3 days.   Thank god I‚Äôve stopped binging.",False,False
