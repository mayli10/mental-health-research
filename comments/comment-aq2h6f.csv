And not like they have said anything wrong. ""Your tummy is big"" ""I know right"" then change the subject. Kids are easily distracted. It might hurt on the inside but when you think about it there is nothing wrong with what they are saying if they are little enough. After about second grade I would say that is rude unless they are autistic or have some social issues. Kids are naturally curious about bodies. I have even had kindergarten kids literally grab my boobs. To them it's not weird, to just kind of a funny part of your body. A simple please don't touch me should be enough there. ",False,False

She didn't even know that might be hurtful, it just popped into her head and she asked the question.   Completely honest and completely devastating.  Do you have any tips to respond as a teacher? I tried to just say that I didn't like her taking about/touching my body and distracted her with climbing again. Obviously it's not my place to try and parent somebody else's kid, but I do want to be constructive about this kind of situation",False,True

That little girl wasn't being mean, she was just observing something.

The only way they will learn and know how to not be rude is to be genuine. If they say something rude, or that offends you, show them with your facial expression and words that you didnâ€™t like what they said, and how it makes you feel. BUT theyâ€™re not adults, so they usually donâ€™t know better, or need more reinforcement of how to behave, so you shouldnâ€™t be too angry at them. Everyone puts their foot in their mouth sometimes.
