Are you sure about your measurements? That's my height and my weight was a bit higher when I lived there but I still fit into most clothes in a M at least.   Japan does suck for restricting ironically. Everyone goes on and on about the healthy diet but clearly doesn't know what they're talking about... I would usually eat onigiri (plum and seaweed ones) and bagged salad with miso dressing from convenience stores.,False,False

I mean you know more than me because you live in Japan, but I saw this video the other day https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xkz0l1pqfEg and I thought these girls looked really healthy and not that stereotype of impossibly waif-like.",False,False

I was there for a year and lived off of tofu, shredded cabbage, kimchi and whatever seasonal fruit/veg was cheap. I also managed to find a greek yoghurt equivalent in the super market. If you have an Aoki brand supermarket near you try that as they have own brand foods which tend to be a little cheaper. That and those 0 kcal konjakku drinks. Peach is the best flavour.  Whatever you do don't eat the bread. It's so high kcal but so unsatisfying???!! I couldn't understand. Also fish is cheap and healthy too.",False,False

I feel like traditional foods, esp fermented food, would be good. I’ve never lived in Japan but I went for 2 weeks on a government funded student exchange in HS and ate lots of fish, chicken, and soup. There’s definitely a lot of fried food so I know what you mean with eating healthy lol everyone acts like Japan is super healthy but the diet is typically really high in sodium, people forget. In HS I would eat red miso soup with silken tofu and enoki mushrooms and lots of rayu chili oil. Pickled food, Kabocha squash, cabbage. Just watch the sodium content, maybe use low sodium shoyu when you can",False,False
