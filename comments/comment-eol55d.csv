Because I want to give you a big cuddle, take you to a nice secluded place with lots of old cups and plates and let you yell your lungs out, then break every single one of those things and just cry for a moment.  But reality - darling, stop. Please. EDs are a mechanism of self-perpetuating self-punishment . They thrive on precisely this type of interpersonal problem. This is another method of torture and it's just perpetuating the same self hating cycle, now with added personal sexual identity. If I may extrapolate, EDs dehumanize you to nought but flesh and numbers, and now it's using your very own sexuality and being against you to feed off of. I'm very, very sorry that you are in this situation. Please know I understand. I'm a gay person unable to stand touch, but longing for companionship and love is never not gut punching me. I've been in this situation. And it was at best an excuse to hurt myself further, at worst, well, it ended very badly for me. Please just let her go.
