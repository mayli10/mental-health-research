A fast plus morning workout was killer for my confidence.   Now that I've relapsed faaaaaaaaaar far to the binging end of the spectrum, fasting just gives me anxiety.

Yes I have, BUT I hardly think it's something everyone experiences... there's a bunch of studies of the impact of longish fasting on things like seratonin, endorphins etc. And it boils down to, some people have measurable positive chemical effects, and some don't, and we don't know why. Honestly I think the brain chemistry of it is real interesting- I know for me personally, part of the thing that keeps my ED kicking around is the objective depression relief I get from restricting. I wish we understood more about the brain, because I'd love to be able to take a pill and get the same relief instead of this bullshit :/",False,False
