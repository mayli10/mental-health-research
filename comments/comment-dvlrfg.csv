My dry herb vape decarbs it so I just use the bud from that but if you know how much you need and decarb it and just eat the straight flower with a bit of peanut butter or hazelnut spread (esp natural peanut butter, it has more fat so the THC binds to it better) it works! You don't even need much peanut butter, I seriously use like 50 cal worth. Definitely not as delicious as brownies but it gets the job done",False,False
