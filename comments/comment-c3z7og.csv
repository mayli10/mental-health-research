I think I want to wear the tighter one mostly because it's around knee length, though the other one is comfier because the fabric is so much softer.",False,True

Maybe try wearing something tight like bike shorts underneath to suck your tummy in? And something high waisted? Thats what I usually do, hope that helps xx",False,False

There's no way you could have predicted his death and from how your talking, it's clear you really cared for him and would have spent those last days differently if you knew. But sadly we're not clearvoyant. Death just sucks, so I doubt that gut-punch feeling will pass anytime soon, but you will eventually get better.   Sorry again for what's happening. :(",False,False

The worst part is that I was already planning to come into town before he and my grandma were supposed to head home, then I found out he died the day before I was supposed to see him :( I could have come into town sooner, but it would have been more expensive for me and I was kind of hoping to see somebody I've been chatting with before leaving, so I waited until the end of the week. Overall it's just been an absolutely terrible week and that was just the worst way it could have possibly ended. It's like I was already beaten up on the ground and then somebody came and stomped on my gut to make it worse. (*Not an ED reference, I just think that would hurt a lot.*)",False,True

I'm sorry to hear about your grandfather. I'm guessing it's a tough time, so most of your family will probably be grieving and not paying attention to whether your stomach is flat or not.",False,False
