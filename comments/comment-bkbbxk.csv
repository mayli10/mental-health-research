A few times these periods dragged on for so long that I didn't think anything could change. Everything seemed difficult and painful, while others didn't seem to struggle as much. And it felt like it would take me years of hard work to get just to what's ""normal"" for others.  But it hasn't been like that. I quit my addiction (gaming) by selling my gaming PC, so there was no way of relapse. I went out of my comfort zone, tried a hobby that intimidated me (dance) and met people that way. Still horrible at making friends, and expressing how I feel, but others are more generous than I expected, and don't seem to mind. It wasn't an overnight change. The reason I was ""stuck"" before, was that even though a small part of me wanted to live, express myself, and try fun things, the rest of me still felt too scared, insecure and paralysed to do anything but go through the motions and keep numbing myself. It was only when I started paying attention to that little voice, and doing what ""felt right"", that I started making progress. Journaling, and watching movies that tugged at my heartstrings and made me feel something, helped bring that voice out.  I realised that that part of me was felt neglected, unsafe and ignored, so I try to listen to what it says, and nurture it. Still bad at it, but seeing it as an ""inner child"" that needed help helped reign in my worst behaviours, at least sometimes. Maybe this can resonate with you or help  &amp;#x200B;  Sorry, that was too long. I hope it makes sense",False,False

It might be helpful to have a therapist to talk to (you may already have one) or perhaps you need a HLOC to best help you.   Itâ€™s exhausting. I feel you so much on this,False,False

I wish we could help in some way, but just know you are not alone.  I don't know the point when I crossed the line between having a normal relationship between food and now I can't get back again. I'm stuck in this situation of restricting and wanting to be thin and having no period, but at the same time I want to recover and wish I could go back to eating whatever I wanted without even thinking about calories. How did I used to do that???  No matter what, just hang in there. I've realised now that I can't just snap my fingers and go back to being normal. It will take tiny steps day by day to get there. And each day life will be less black and white, and I'll have one less thought revolving around food.   Maybe there are some support groups or therapists available in your area, if you want to get more help or find some direction? Honestly there is so much more in life worth living for, it is possible to get through this. Please don't give up. Even if you really don't want to be here anymore, there are people who need you and love you. ðŸ’•",False,False

If you arent in a situation where you can talk to someone I suggest maybe keeping a journal and writing all your thoughts down and re reading it. It's what I've been doing to stay sane.,False,False

The last couple of months have been hell for me.  My depression is taking a toll on my everyday life.  So my ED tries to cope with it by eating, and more specifically, by binging.  My binges are getting more and more frequent, and then I fast. Trapped in my binge/fast cycle.  I suck at restricting, it usually ends up with me binging anyway.  I'm at my LW now, but I know it's just not enough.  I feel like I want to disappear.  To fade away.  I want everyone to know that I'm sick.  Sometimes I want to hurt myself.   My life sucks, but I hope that it will get better, that I will get better, one day.  Sending lots of love. â™¥",False,False
