I’m seriously doubting that I’ll ever be all the way OK. i would like to avoid looking sick again at the very least so that I don’t worry the people who love me.

I got in to a normal weight range and started counting again. Fuck if I don’t have days that vary from 600-1800 with my common being 1200-1300. Slow weight loss this time but still loosing after all that hard work to gain.,False,False

I’ve been in and out of recovery for years, but my habits like calorie-counting and constant guilt-tripping are learned habits from my mother. If it’s not calories, I’m counting something else. Macros. Nutrients. Minutes spent in the gym. The obsession changes, but in order to see a full recovery, I think the source of the obsessive behavior has to be addressed. When I was diagnosed with BPD last year, everything made sense and helped me understand why I ever counted calories in the first place. I’m still in recovery, currently obsessing over trying to maintain a healthy diet and exercise regimen but...easier said than done. ;)   Sorry for the novel (mania lol).",False,False
