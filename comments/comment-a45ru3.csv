I feel like there is more sugar calories in the latter? Or an apple that taste watery compared to a sweet, juicy apple...one has more sugar than the other. IDK maybe I'm crazy lol ",False,False

Calories on menus or packages of processed foods might be off/wrong, idk, but calories in fruit and veggies and eggs and meat, etc, by the gram, is correct. ",False,False
