Looking back, that shit fucking sucked.  My exercise was 100% out of self hatred and punishment.  So exhausting.  EXHAUSTING.  Now...My experience is to focus more on exercising for health, because it feels hella good to warm muscles up, stretch out, feel that heart rate go up and get a lil sweaty.   Any movement is an achievement, and your body thanks you for it.  Physical soreness or mental exhaustion doesn’t always equal a good workout.  The American Heart Association only recommends 30 MINUTES a day!!  Of like, brisk walking.  So seriously, EDs can suck a big one.  Every workout is good enough!!!!",False,False

There’s definitely a catharsis to it. Plus I have feelings about what “counts” as a ‘good workout’ that aren’t necessarily in line with what exercise science shows. Then toss in some urges to punish/atone just to maximize confusion.   What I try to remember is that effective exercise plans set frequency, intensity, and duration to challenge the body in balance with recovery/rebuilding for the stressed systems. If I let myself push into the red zone too much, I’m damaging my body faster than it can heal, and I end up injured. Which means I temporarily lose my biggest tool to manage Depression &amp; Co. (Very not good.)   It also helps me to remember that mixing in lower intensity workouts (sometimes of longer duration) is *not* being lazy or ineffective. Rather, it’s producing different adaptations/optimizations within my body vs the high octane days. That’s part of why distance running training plans mix long slow runs with faster runs and interval runs. They’re all valuable! (And honestly, all fun in different ways)",False,False

I push myself more when I do workout videos but when I try to create my own workout it's either too hard (like I physically can't finish it, excuses excuses I know) or wayyy too easy",False,True

Once I got a personal trainer and she really kicked my ass and I’d crawl out of the gym but when I’d try to replicate it on my own I never felt the same. I wish I could push myself the way I let a complete stranger push me lol,False,False
