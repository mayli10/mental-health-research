I have a strong aversion to therapy because I had a shitty therapist as a child. She kept relating everything to God and making it weirdly religious when I didn't and don't care and I was just a fucked up kid looking for sense in the world.     Anyway, I'm available if you need someone to talk to. Lord knows I've made so many posts like this. Not wanting help and not wanting to be in pain anymore. Deleting them later on and then posting similar things again. I just want you to know you matter and the pain you are currently going through matters.",False,False

You're sick enough if you even thought about posting it! I know it's really hard to accept it (I don't even accept it, so I'm a hypocrite) but I really want you to know that how you feel is real. I feel like us ED sufferers have a tendency to downplay the legitimacy of our suffering b/c of the stigma and it's BS.     If you feel comfortable, please reach out! If your therapist is good, they know the comorbidities associated with depression and PSTD and will understand. There are so many times I wish I had reached out! Please feel free to PM me. I always feel like a fraud. I've struggled with this since I was 11, more severely since I was 16, and I definitely can't pretend to know exactly how you feel, but I can at least be a friendly face.     I know when I was going through the thick of it, I felt like I was making it all up for attention. You **aren't.** You're in pain and deserve to feel better.",False,False

I'm frustrated with myself... and I know and I have access to reach out for this shit (already in a therapy program for PTSD and MDD) but 1 I don't think I'm sock enough and 2 I'm not ready... it's just a cycle of hating and destroying myself..,False,True

And it's just so frustrating because there is so much shit going on inside my head and yet I'm the same weight still and have nothing to show for it. You aren't alone. We are all going through this with you. I'm so sorry you're struggling right now.,False,False
