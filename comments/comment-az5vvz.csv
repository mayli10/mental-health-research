Did an ECG and both cases it appeared to just be anxiety, but this is definitely something worth getting checked out. I thought I was having a heart attack. Not sure how accessible healthcare is where you are though, I am in Australia so all that is free.  I get it's a bit late now compared to when this was posted but I hope you're doing ok - if this happens again the most important thing is to try and stay calm (deep breath in for 3 seconds, deep breath out for 3 seconds and repeat) in case it is just an anxiety thing because stressing out will make it a lot worse  (and if it isn't anxiety, and something more serious, this is still a good practice to remain calm so you are able to go get help).",False,False

I went A&amp;E (am in the UK, yay NHS) and was diagnosed with costochondritis. They looked at my mental health history (what a mess lol) and said it could be anxiety related.  Get it checked out if you can. It might be something serious, it might not. I honestly thought I was having a heart attack, as did a few medical professionals. Tests showed it was just an inflamed ribcage.",False,False

I agree with the previous commenter's suggestion to call a nurse line. But generally speaking chest pain is something we ALWAYS check out because it's probably reflux but it COULD be a very urgent heart issue. 90% of the time, it's something minor, but we don't f*ck around with that 10%.  The best way to make sure your okay is to see a Dr who can make sure you're okay. Hang in there~",False,False

There’s a number for the free nurse’s hotline on it for your provider. They’ll talk through your symptoms with you and advise you on whether or not you need to be checked out.   ,False,False
