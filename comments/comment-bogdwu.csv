She's so small and there is no way I'm not 30 lbs heavier than her. I saved it and I look at it occasionally to ground myself when it gets bad.,False,False

I occasionally send my boyfriend nudes from those subs and ask his opinions on them and apparently i look pretty close to a lot of these girls but I don't see it.,False,False

Sometimes it makes me feel better about myself because I see that other people aren't perfect either, but then again there are sooo many really tiny and beautiful girls... and I know I'll never look like them. My boyfriend saw the sub once and said ""oh there are so many of you"" because he thought that I looked like them - but it made me feel bad, because I look at my pictures and I definitely don't look like them.",False,False
