I‚Äôve been on track all day and didn‚Äôt binge. I have been waiting all day to come home and eat the chocolate chip speculaas cookie that I bought on Saturday while grocery shopping. Came home, ate my planned healthy snack. Worked out. Hopped into the shower and I had planned on eating a healthy sandwich along with my choco cookie and was trying not to calculate the calories of my meal, because counting and tracking fucks me up. Finally decided I‚Äôll just check how many calories the cookie has and I‚Äôll allow myself 200 calories of cookie along with my healthy sandwich. Was very proud of my decision. When I got into the kitchen to pull out the cookie, and to start making my sandwich... it turns out that my fianc√© had made carbonara pasta. It smelled so good. He said: I want you to try some of this. Can I put some of it on a small plate so you can eat it with me? Without a second thought I said: sure. I thought he‚Äôd grab the very small 1 cup sized dessert bowls. But he grabbed the small plate on which we eat breakfast.  He then poured himself what I would call a normal-to-small serving of pasta and poured all the rest of what was left in the pot onto the small (but still too big for what I wanted) plate for me. It was at least double, if not triple, of what I thought he‚Äôd serve me. I started to freak out and said babe that‚Äôs too much. So he said: just give me the rest of it if you don‚Äôt want it. But it smelled so good :( I told him I wanted to make myself some salad because I wanted to have that with the pasta because that amount of pasta was not going to be enough to make me feel full, but he insisted on me sitting down with him to eat. You can make some salad later, he said. And it smelled so good that I sat down and I ate. I ate the everything that was on my plate, and I didn‚Äôt put anything back onto his plate as I was supposed to.   Now, I‚Äôm freaking out trying to calculate just how many calories I ate.   The pasta was good but not that good. It was just pasta drenched in cheese and bacon. I couldnt stop eating it. I‚Äôm trying to figure out if my portion was as big as my finances was, but o can‚Äôt tell because mine was on a dessert/breakfast plate and his was on a regular plate. And I am a stupid ass bitch who is incapable of gauging portion sizes. Did I eat as much as he did? Please please please god tell me I ate less than him :(  I also tried to eat as slowly as I could, I swear, and by the time I was done my fianc√© hadn‚Äôt even finished half of his plate. I hate it when that happens. He eats so much slower than me, and then I‚Äôm left staring at him eating, mouth watering, wanting to have seconds, and I feel like a pig. I always eat more than he does. I hate it.  So I just sat there, and regret started creeping in, and I felt horrible for eating that pasta. I was not full, I was still hungry. And yet I had eaten so many calories. And on top of that now I cant have the cookie I had been waiting all day to eat. I have been wanting to eat that cookie since lunch. First I decided to have it as an afternoon snack, but then I decided not to have the cookie as a snack, and to have it as a reward after my workout instead. I decided to fight against the urge of eating it Right then and I felt proud that I did, and I planned on having it as dessert and I looked forward to it and I could almost taste the cookie because I wanted it so so bad, and while I was showering I was thinking of the cookie. And now I cant have it anymore because I ate that fucking unplanned pasta.   I‚Äôm so angry. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm hungry or not. I think I am, but then again I can never really tell if I‚Äôm hungry or not. I‚Äôm so frustrated. Now I‚Äôm hungry AND I ate too many calories AND I can‚Äôt have my fucking cookie.  So because I felt that I was tearing up on the table, I grabbed a small fatfree yogurt to have as ‚Äúdessert‚Äù because otherwise I would have lost it and I told my finance I wanted to go to bed. He must have guessed I was starting to get stressed because of the food because he lovingly told me to go.   Fianc√© is in the kitchen now, and I hope he stays there. I don‚Äôt want him to see me crying. He tries to help me, but really he has no clue.",False,False
