And I can almost guarantee you that other people also think they don't need to be there for whatever reason. Comparing yourself to other patients is easy but will make things more difficult in the long run. Hang in there.,False,False

I was also the largest person on the ed unit when I was in the hospital so I know how you‚Äôre feeling and it definitely sucks and feels like you‚Äôre not Valid‚Ñ¢Ô∏è enough. but you DESERVE to be there and get help and get healthy. one of the most helpful things a therapist from residential told me when I was feeling valid was ‚Äúdo you think we just keep people here for the fun of it?‚Äù It‚Äôs rough feeling body-conscious in the hospital when you‚Äôre in such a vulnerable state but you wouldn‚Äôt be there if you didn‚Äôt really need to be. Eating disorders can kill people of any and all sizes, and you are as deserving of recovery as the smallest person there. Hope this helps üíì",False,False
