My ex-best friend (who also has BDD) agreed that my bathroom mirror is “bad” and makes her look wider. The full-length mirror in my basement is more flattering, but not as flattering as the mirror at the library I frequent. I still don’t know what I look like - more like my basement mirror or more like the library mirror? Photography is also crazy - I can look thick or like bonespo depending on the angle and lighting. BDD drives me fucking batty and I have no objective way to analyze my body apart from measurements and weight, which fluctuate daily depending on water/food weight... ugh.",False,False

I always hate what I look like in the bathroom mirror, but I saw myself in another mirror downstairs recently and there's a big difference. I also don't wear my glasses around the house a lot, and then when I do I realise that I look smaller (short sightedness makes things wider).",False,False
