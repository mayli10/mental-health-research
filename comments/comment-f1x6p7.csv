Everyone is impossibly thin and lightweight yet still will have huge body full of muscles and abs and huge boobs LOL. But something I actually found out later in life was that despite not all characters being something completely ‚Äúunachievable‚Äù in the real world (looks wise) their weights would always be something mind-numbingly improbable. And then later found out, even in some Japanese girl focused fashion magazines I‚Äôd want where models are featured with their body stats, the weights were also unreasonable and probably untrue.. Like ‚Äú39‚Äùkg at 5‚Äô4‚Äù and still having boobs and everything else. I don‚Äôt know how much this has to do with it per se since its the manga we‚Äôre talking about, but I watched a video where guys just sort of... expected girls to look relatively normal and still have unnaturally low weights. Like there isn‚Äôt a common connection being made for people between a healthy body weight number and the image of a healthy body. After viewing it I noticed this with guys in my real life too, but that video interviewing Japanese guys and girls felt like it helped me understand this more. So I think it will almost never make sense.",False,False
