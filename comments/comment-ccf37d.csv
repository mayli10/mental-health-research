I am usually somewhat regular, have had a few late ones. Last month was early and this one is being weird- spotty, cramps but no actual period. I'm at day 35 now and feeling awful because I'm still having PMS symptoms. I have EDNOS from depression - binge and starve type. Right now I have slight acne, random cramping, bloating, waves of anxiety and depression and fatigue but can't sleep. This. Sucks. :(",False,False

Losing your period means your body isn't producing enough hormones, so basically no cramps, no bleeding, no acne, no nothing. Bad thing is, your body takes this as you literally going into menopause way too early- so your mood gets even worse, you get hot flashes and sweating at night, hair gets way duller than it should be, all that fun stuff. 2/10 would not recommend, though I do *not* miss periods one bit.",False,False
