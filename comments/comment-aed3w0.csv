We really appreciate your help.   My GF hasn't visited in a couple years so it's hard to tell if pickiness is new behaviour.

There are some people who naturally eat very intuitively i.e. They eat when they're hungry, they stop eating when they are full - rather than eating for the sake of eating or continuing to eat until their plate is completely empty and then feeling too full.  Also when I was a teenager, I was really picky about food, until I was about 19 or 20. So if being picky is normal for her, rather than a recent change then that's OK.  The fact that she managed ice cream and bubble tea without any changes in behaviour is good. A lot of people with eating disorders plan their meals, often right down to the last calorie. So if their eating deviates from the set plan in their mind (e.g. someone offering them food or going somewhere for dessert), that is when you may typically see more disordered behaviour, because the situation has gone their control. Then again, it's hard to say because it also depend of the level of disordered thoughts - some people with an eating disorder might have a meltdown after eating unplanned ice cream; some might eat seemingly normally, but freak out internally afterwards; some might eat the ice cream, but then later purge or severely restrict the next meal/the next day to make up for it.   As for her being thin, it's hard to say as she's a teenager and still growing. My best friend in high school was very tall and naturally thin but ate completely normally. Are the parents/family quite tall/naturally skinny?  I'd say continue to observe. If it was me, warning bells would ring if:  - her appearance/weight concerns her, and she spends a lot of time thinking about it. (E.g. She says she's too fat when she's not/she's worried or scared of gaining weight.)  - if she makes noticeable weight/food related comments. (E.g. If her mum is overfeeding the pets and she brings this up regularly or implies that her mum is overfeeding her and making her fat/or she comments about heavier people in negative way. It's not uncommon for people with EDs to project their thoughts onto others.)  - if she makes regular concerning excuses for not eating (e.g. She's not hungry/she ate earlier/she doesn't feel well)   - if she eats, but then disappears afterwards for a while (could be purging).   - if her pickiness is a new behaviour and she's restricting herself to the same foods or low calorie foods (many people with EDs have ""safe foods"" which are usually low calorie foods they feel comfortable eating, and that they feel won't trigger a binge).  - if she is using/abusing/restricting food as a way to cope with or gain control over other mental stresses in her life.   People with EDs or disordered thoughts around food are often good at hiding it. Try to stay open and approachable, and let her know that she can talk to you guys about anything. It's good you have reached out to educate yourselves more on eating disorders.   All the above is obviously only from my perspective, and eating disorders vary from person to person. Some people can easily be classified as having one, while with others it might not be so clear cut.

edorjl5,t3_aed3w0,t3_aed3w0,RussetWolf,1,2019-01-09 22:02:41,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/aed3w0/daily_discussion_thursday_january_10_2019/edorjl5/,"Hi folks, new here and looking for some info. My apologies if my language comes off as insensitive at all, I'm not familiar with EDs or the community/support around them, which is why I'm here to learn. Let me know if there's a better place for this or a better way to say things.  I'm traveling with my GF to meet her family and we are both concerned that her sister may be exhibiting ED behaviours. Before we go any further I wanted to consult someone to verify if our concerns are valid or if we're just not interpreting things right. And then if we are right, what can we do (her parents are not the most helpful). We live on a different continent so there probably isn't a whole lot besides talking to her/her parents before we leave.  So, I guess I'll get to describing some of what we've observed. For reference she's 17, and has been bullied at school before (moved schools as a result of it 8 years ago [the schools here are kindergarten through grade 12]). The school she currently attends is an hour drive away, so most of her friends live that far. The family lives on a farm 20 minute drive out of the nearest town, and while she's learning to drive, it has been very isolating.  Firstly, she doesn't eat a whole lot. Breakfast is half a small croissant with some jam. We've only seen her eat breakfast once - when I was preparing something for my GF and I, and asked her what she'd like. We've only seen her eat lunch when we go out to eat (her mother assured us she'd seen her eat earlier when we asked one time). Sometimes she doesn't eat any dinner when the whole family sits down to eat. To be fair, I often skip breakfast so this isn't alarming alone. The family waking/eating schedule is all over the place since it's summer vacation and my GF and I are jetlagged, so it's entirely possible we just aren't around at the same time, she could have eaten recently and not been hungry, etc.   She wanted to experience conveyor belt sushi in a nearby town, so we took her out for lunch. She's quite picky, so chicken sushi was all she wanted, which is fine. Each plate had 3 slices of the roll, and she managed almost two plates before saying she was full and wanted no more. We then went for ice cream and she happily had a cone with one scoop, and later we had bubble tea - she had a regular size to herself. Another time we went for lunch she managed about half of her chicken burger and a few fries. Dinner is similarly small portions, often only potatoes with cheese, or plain rice with tomato sauce since she's picky.  We've seen some evening snacking on suggary snacks (and some daytime snacking on crackers when offered), and she's taken initiative to buy fudge and delighted when we brought overseas candy for her Christmas presents.   So, is this anything to be concerned about or just regular teenage behaviour? She does drink juices and things. She's also very thin (and tall), which again could just be normal teenage body stuff, but her hip bones are visible in shorts and thighs are about the same width as her calves. She makes comments about her mom (who is heavier) making the pets (a dog, cat, and very large goldfish) fat by overfeeding them.  ",False,False
