I honestly think it’s a combo of both. After making this post, I talked to him about why his comments were hurtful and he seemed genuinely surprised that it’d had that impact on me, and sorry that he’d said those things. So I hope it gets better from here. But it helps to have you all to vent and talk to. ❤️",False,True

It’s almost like having a person that you love becoming a real-life manifestation of a nagging ED-fueled voice in your head. Like that taunting voice you have to fight off, but it’s harder to ignore when it’s coming from a real person who you love. If that makes sense?   But I’m glad you guys talked about it and I hope he now sees your perspective. I talked to my husband about this last night so hopefully we can learn from this and get better at communicating with each other.",False,True

It was a long, hard convo for me to get through and it was clear even then that he didn’t quite “get it” but I was hopeful with some more time that maybe he’d understand.  Last night after I made this post, he asked if I would cuddle him and I calmly said no, I didn’t want to because he made me upset today. I asked if he understood why the things he said were hurtful to someone with an ED, and he said something along the lines of, “I swear I didn’t mean anything by any of that. I wasn’t thinking. I’m sorry.” And I told him that he needs to be more mindful in what he says, and he replied that he just won’t comment on my eating habits again. Idk, I guess we will see how it goes from here.",False,True

I hope it's not malicious.  Have you ever told him that it's harmful to your psyche to comment on your eating habits?,False,False

He would always say ""It's just some food."" ""Only for one day."" Like he was testing and taunting me even though he was completely innocent. I had to sit with him and have a long hard conversation about why those comments messed with me and let him understand my perception of view. Now he doesn't offer since I told him, but it really made me think hard of how it's hard for people to see people who have ED's that food could associate a lot with guilt while as they have no clue and are on autopilot. I hope your SO can learn your perspective and be more mindful of what he's talking about. Hope you feel better now.",False,False

His comments are definitely thoughtless, hard to say what the motivation is - projection or a very clumsy attempt at support or both? But either way, not cool. Hugs.",False,False
