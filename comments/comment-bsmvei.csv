And I even have abs so it is not weak muscles. Are all the skinny people I see I the world just perpetually hungry? Like my stomach curves out on TOP when I eat, were my literal stomach is. Not where fat is held. Ruins my wasp waist.",False,False

I'm like seriously UW and only ever am flat on day 2-3 of very low restricting. Otherwise it feels like I'm a quarter pregnant, which is a major rip off",False,False

Like my perfectly flat beautiful stomach curves OUT because it has to hold the food. It looks horrifying and completely negates my slim figure. Every cute outfit is 500 calories away from being ruined.,False,False

I notice every time.   As for the bloat, it’s both. I can’t even drink water in the mornings without my stomach expanding noticeably, AND we’re more likely than most to have digestive issues. TMI, but it’s a gasfest for me if I eat too many carbs (like during a binge). Taking digestive enzymes is supposed to help a lot with bloat, I just started taking them daily at my SO’s insistence (he’s out of patience with the gas problem lol) but I haven’t been on them long enough to say whether it makes a difference. Might be worth trying though!",False,False
