I remember reading about the hierarchy and thinking it made so much sense that when I'm particularly anxious I start restricting - everything else seems to take a backseat, like my anxiety is muted. And you articulated it so perfectly!",False,False

I started thinking about this because of that pesky little thing where when you don’t eat enough your brain wakes you up at night to send you to go “hunt” for food sense you’ve obviously not had luck in the day time. And then I started to think how there’s this rift between the conscious mind ie I want to be thin I don’t want to eat food is available it’s not a real pressing issue I control my behavior and our subconscious mind wanting to survive needing food assuming it’s not available if we aren’t eating it and how we use our conscious mind to play tricks on our subconscious to avoid the “real” blockage. ,False,True
