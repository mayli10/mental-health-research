And it's not just fellow Asians. At my heaviest (BMI of 22), multiple (white) men gently suggested that I could lose some weight. People assume I'm now ""naturally"" thin when really it's because I weigh every gram of food I put in my mouth.   Anyway, I don't live in Asia but I feel ya.",False,False
