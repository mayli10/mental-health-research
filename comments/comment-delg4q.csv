Sorry to anyone who I may have triggered w/ that.  And I know I should speak to a professional, but I have no health insurance right now and am very broke so unfortunately I’m gonna be chugging along like this until I get paid finally!  But you’re right, only a doctor can diagnose me.  Thank you for the kind words.",False,True

It sounds like you have some symptoms, but until you speak with a professional to really get to the bottom of this, no one can know.      None of us here are qualified to diagnose or even suggest you have an eating disorder. Try looking online for therapists in your area.       Stay safe and sending love your way.       Edit: also please be careful posting your height and weight here, as it can be really triggering, and honestly has hardly anything to do with whether or not you have an ED. I’d remove those parts.",False,False
