Obviously the best solution is to eat properly, but I totally understand how thatâ€™s easier said than done and if you have trouble eating enough then you could take supplements? Iron and magnesium deficiencies are big culprits for insomnia and fatigue (Iâ€™ve had iron deficiency and that insomnia/fatigue combo is the worst!) also the B vitamins. Avoid caffeine completely if you can; if not then curfew it from midday. Good luck",False,False

Makes me sleepy and help keep stay asleep. I also put on a podcast because listening to other peopleâ€™s voices calms my mind down and stops it doing the manic subject-hopping thing, or from thinking about food. Also I donâ€™t drink any liquids after 7:30pm because Iâ€™ve found that if I wake up itâ€™s nearly impossible to get back to sleep, and I was waking up a lot because I needed to pee.   If Iâ€™m especially stressed lâ€™ll ask my SO to rub my back for a few minutes which helps my body relax enough to at least get some rest, if not fully asleep. ",False,False
