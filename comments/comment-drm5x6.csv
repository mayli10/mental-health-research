Chicken has 231 calories in a cup and beef has 339. Like yeah they're different meats, but for the chilli example, who just subs turkey for beef unless they're trying to cut cals? It's not a typical popular recipe.   But also... There are different grades of ground beef. Some have a higher percentage of fat than others, it's on the label.",False,False

The low fat American cheese slices are hands down better than the full fat and I will fight anyone over this. They melt faster, and they have a more velveeta-like taste to me, which I prefer.  That is the one exception, and yeah the low fat or sugar free versions of stuff are pretty much universally worse, though I have zero issues with low fat cottage cheese and mayo (not better than original but not worse at all, about equal to me) and would still eat them even if not restricting just to save some calories for other stuff.",False,False
