Growing up my dad would let me eat whatever, &amp; mom would try to combat him by having me diet early on in life. My weight constantly yoyo‚Äôd growing up. I‚Äôve never truly had a healthy relationship with food. Then when they divorced it got even worse. Total bingefest junk foods every other weekend, while eating like a rabbit with my mom.

Instead of getting healthy home cooked meals from him, my mom served me nothing box pizza, McDonald‚Äôs and boxed meals. But for some reason she always was on a diet and refused to give us her healthier meals.   It fucked me up real bad never learning portion control because she didn‚Äôt have any!

My mom is obese, and my dad is average / skinny. Once puberty hit, I started gaining a lot of weight and went up to 170-180 lbs at 5'1-5'2. My dad always thought it pertinent to call me chubby and to tell me that I had my mom's body type. One time, I remember him taking me shopping for new pants because I had gotten wider hips from said-puberty, and he asked a random lady who didn't work there if she knew where the women's pants were. He then went on a rant saying that nothing fit me because of how fat I had gotten. She looked so uncomfortable and gave me a look of ""I'm sorry."", and she said she didn't know where the section was. To this day, he also ""jokingly"" shakes his head and scolds me for eating too much or ""stealing food from the fridge like a rat"" (common saying of his), even if it's my first time eating in two days.  A few years of this passed, something snapped, and I stopped eating and lost 70+ lbs. I then overheard him excitedly saying to my mom ""I guess I was wrong. She got my body type, not yours!""... Now my goal is to lose even more in order to shove it into his face that he was wrong and that I was never fat and never a burden on the family who ate too much.",False,False
