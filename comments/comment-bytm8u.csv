I mean for me, binging is any eating that I feel I've lost control over, so my ""binges"" can end up being under my calorie limit too. But I haven't binged this bad in a WHILE, it's like I was afraid I would never be able to eat again LMAO. I was genuinely afraid for myself. But! Today I clocked in under 2000, actually pretty well under maintenance, so I fiiiinally have it under control (knock on wood). But that was freakin' hard. I mean, I ate like I just came out of the Jumanji board game and I hadn't seen mayonnaise in 12 years. But that's how it is sometimes! I think spending a while on this sub has taught me that binges are different for everyone and none are more/less valid. It's about how they make you feel and they all deserve support.  That said I don't purge so I had to keep aaalllll of these freakin calories ðŸ˜­ phew!",False,True

Cus I always feel ashamed when someone says 'omg I had 1000 cals a day today I fucking binged' I get itttt I used to be like that. But once the binges hit me, oh I could go up to 4000 easily(also doesn't help that I have acid reflux that makes me throw up so much. Then I pretty much have even more space to binge).",False,False

I've definitely been in a downward spiral of denial about my eating the past couple of days, which is a low I haven't really been at in a while. But I've climbed my way out of worse and I can climb my way out of this one, too. Having to acknowledge it and ""face the facts"" so to speak by posting it online has definitely helped, and logging stuff in MFP is like magic for how much easier it makes accountability. (Still not perfect, but it helps.)  Good luck to you too on your own journey! Also the event is a high school reunion, LMAO. Very Romi and Michelle of me. But at the same time I'm nowhere near as huge as I was throughout all of highschool so any weight loss at all will look impressive. Thank you for your support!",False,True

Youâ€™re also setting reasonable goals and not being too hard on yourself! Thatâ€™s fantastic. Good luck for the important event whatever it is, Iâ€™m sure you will look terrific regardless :-)",False,False

I hope you can get some pizza soon too! Thank you for the encouragement, I've been a lot better today.",False,True
