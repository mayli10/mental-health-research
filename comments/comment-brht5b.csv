Sometimes parents just respond really dumb to situations. I mean, parents are just ... People. Lol. As simple as that sounds. So they see someone they love deeply and go into protective mode of "" AAH REMOVE THE POINTY THINGS??? THAT... WILL HELP?? ""  My mom got good advice on how to respond and cope with my self harm from *her* therapist (to try and offer harm reduction, wound care shit, etc) so if your mom has the means to do so, this might be a really good time for *her* to talk to a therapist.",False,False

I'd write (if you're not comfortable talking face to face ) a letter about how you appreciate her concern but that snooping makes you feel like there's a violation of trust , and that it's hard to progress if you can't feel like trust is growing.    If she's trying to look out for self harm tools, I know how awful that is. And I'm so sorry your personal space and privacy was breached. But her snooping (while awful feeling, you are 100% entitled to being upset over it) is a poorly thought out way for her to try and keep you safe. She might not know of any other way to protect you so she's going for the only path she sees: removing/looking out for the dangerous objects.   Again I'm really sorry this happened. Trust violations hurt.",False,False
