I'm trying to just breathe through it and make peace with the damage that is done. I cant change it, I can just make the best of it.

The person I considered my best friend for the last 6 years has put me through hell this past year. Her inability to clean has brought on so much extra stress because I either have to clean up after her constantly, or live in filth and the fear of getting an infestation. (Yes it is that bad, and has been for an entire year, despite my begging her to please work on it.)   So I finally decided I couldn't let my mental health suffer because of her inability to be an adult, and gave her notice to move out.    Now I am losing who I thought was my best friend, and she is stealing from me as she moves out. Taking absolutely everything she can. I have hundreds of dollars worth to replace. It is the money as much as the principle. It is a nightmare and I have been a disaster.   My mom and my boyfriend have been angels. They both have always suspected my ED but they are just handling me gently. They are offering me my safe foods, sometimes making me my favorite fear foods but saying ""if you just want a bite that's okay, you eat what you feel okay eating, if you don't want it, don't feel pressured, I will eat it. It won'tgo to waste."" and they have been an amazing escape for me when I need to get away from home while soon to be ex roommate stomps around with her friends talking shit about me and packing up. They have provided safe havens for me until my home becomes my safe haven again. They also have both made plans to help me replace and repair things if I need/want them to.  I could go on but my comment is already way too long. Sorry üòÖ  Anyway. Not Vday related but definitely something I have been thinking about constantly through this mess!  ",False,False
