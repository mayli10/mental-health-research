Usually happen during an extreme mood, and they sound like music, knocking, my name being called, or a distant conversation I can't make out.  And holy shit that's exactly what I was talking about! Like, it's distinct from myself, but it feels different from my other hallucinations, but also I can interact with it? It's whack and it's kinda fucked up. Especially the screaming shit, holy fuck. It's like when you can hear the blood rushing through your ears but instead of blood it's my brain yelling about how I'm fat",False,True

I do get them if I'm severely manic and sleep deprived, but it's not like the ED voice. It's stuff like music and knocking and hearing my name being called in an empty room.  But the ED voice is definitely distinct from me. I can't ""conjure"" it by consciously thinking disordered thoughts, nor can I really make it go away if it's there. It talks to me using second-person pronouns. ""*You're* fat. *You* don't need to eat that."" It refers to itself with first-person pronouns. ""You need *me*."" I can respond to it and even have a conversation with it. When I was younger, I called her Ana. Now I call it The Monster. It doesn't like that name. (Also note - I used to call it ""her."" Now I call it ""it."")  If the monster is present and I'm ignoring it, it.... screams? I don't know how else to phrase it. If it's telling me to not eat, and I eat, it's like the volume in my head goes up to eleven. It isn't even words. Just angry noise.",False,False

To me, it almost sounds like how telepathy is portrayed in movies - a completely different voice talking in your head, with no conscious control over it.",False,False

I don’t personally really refer to it as an ED voice but I think people do that to separate themselves from their disordered thoughts. Like once I was being irrational and my friend was like “it’s just the voice” and tbh it made it easier to discount the thoughts I was having and think of them as something separate from myself and something I didn’t have to listen to bc it wasn’t the real me that was thinking that, it was just the illness.",False,False

But I do believe the reason people like myself say they hear a voice, is because that although it sounds exactly like our everyday conscience, we recognise it isn't actually us, but the sick part of our brains.  That's why it's so difficult to ignore and overcome. It so easily blends in with our everyday thoughts, it's familiar. But it takes very real effort to spot the lies in the moment, not when recalling what was said.  Maybe those without psychosis who hear a second voice have learnt to quickly identify the wolf in sheeps clothing that sounds like them, or maybe they do genuinely hear a different voice, I can't really speak for them.",False,False
