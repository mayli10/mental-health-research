Calorie counting is *simple* and it's logical. What's special about organic food that makes it easier to lose weight and be healthy? It's more expensive, too.  What's 'clean' eating? I do sometimes wonder if people think that eating healthy is expensive because their concept of healthy eating includes money-draining categories of food like mock meat, organically grown vegetables, or the specially made health meals. I try to think of thought traps I've fallen into in the past as a means of understanding, and I do to some degree understand it when I reframe it within my own mistakes, but it still leaves me confused knowing that CICO doesn't contradict any of their ideas about healthy eating. Frequently I would deny something because it was in direct opposition with what I thought, but CICO is a simple box that anything can fit in.",False,False

At that point I‚Äôd say SLOWLY reduce and listen to your body. So say you‚Äôre eating 1500 a day just normally maybe for a week try 1300 and make sure to get some high volume low cal food in see how you feel. If you can do that without a binge stay there for a week then try lowering further by small increments. If you find yourself binging one day, up it by 100 and stay in your safe no binge zone. Slow and steady sticks and if you can don‚Äôt go below your TDEE for your goal weight. For us, 1200 is safe. That‚Äôs healthy.

Oatmeal always gets me full and I don‚Äôt feel too bad about an extra 100cals because over all I‚Äôm still at a deficit. I am obsessed. I have no clue how not to be. But CICO is not to blame for that. For me CICO calms my panic because the numbers are right there the data is accurate and I actually find myself to be more accountable for what I‚Äôm actually in taking instead of assuming everything is 1000 cals and calling it a day after an Apple. I‚Äôm trying my very best to not hurt myself this time and I‚Äôd never give advice for anyone to hurt themselves either. Although I know how this ED thing be. ",False,False

I understand because I've been there and following CICO was what turned my binge eating disorder into EDNOS. So I wanted to offer what my dietician has taught me and what helped me stop the purging and calorie counting. If I get downvoted for that then so be it.  Maybe I should have been a little less harsh. I just see a lot of promoting of CICO without acknowledging how it can be harmful for people who are prone to eating disorders.  I know what it is like to count calories obsessively and end up eating far below a healthy amount and then ending up with huge binges that I then purged. It was really rough. The worst thing is that I ended up gaining weight in the long run because of my behavior and that only made me feel worse.   So I want to do what the old sub did and help encourage mitigating of harm. If you want to eat low calorie amounts at least try to do things like eating nutrient dense food. I guarantee you will feel a lot better if you at least eat a good portion of fruits and vegetables as well as protein while eating in a very strong deficit.  I know not everyone is ready for recovery but the goal should be to do as little harm as possible to your body while you engage in your disordered eating.   I've been there and I want others to at least be harmed as little as possible.,False,False

Why? Because this encourages unhealthy habits that in the long term do not lead to maintained weight loss.    First off, counting calories can encourage ED behavior. It encourages the person to eat lower and lower amounts. This obsession encourages the person to purge when they eat over what they think is too many calories as well as avoid foods that are VERY healthy for you but higher in calories (especially foods that are higher in protein.). The number game catches a lot of people and it caught me badly when I tried calorie counting. It encourages thought about food as not what is nutritious for you but rather what fits into your calorie count.     This is why many people with eating disorders have nutrient deficits that can even be life threatening. The sheer fact that it makes unhealthy foods seem okay because they fill your calorie budget is why CICO is not good diet advice. I'm sure many people have lost weight on CICO but how many long term (5-10 years long) have maintained that weight without engaging in unhealthy behaviors? This is why many doctors view calorie counting as disordered behavior.    I'm sure this is going to be posted to fatlogic but this is all stuff my dietician has taught me.    The fact is, when you eat a healthy diet your hunger hormones will naturally make you feel more full and have less of an appetite. Hormones like insulin and ghrelin control your hunger and this is part of why so many people who restrict highly end up binging. This is why CICO is a failure and ends up in a restrict-binge cycle or an extreme restriction.     Long term the diet may help you initially lose a lot of weight but it often has the consequences of worsening or developing an eating disorder. The diet may help people who are willing to eat a reasonable amount of calories and try not to lose weight so quickly.It shouldn't become a lifestyle because a lifestyle of counting calories is just torture.",False,False

Now there is still legitimate science in the fact that eating a conventionally healthier diet (with protein and vegetables, etc etc) will give you better energy or preserve muscle, or that insulin and blood sugar regulation can affect your fat storage or hunger cues.
