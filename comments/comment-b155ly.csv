So after reading this, I spent the next hour browsing food on Pinterest and any time I got the urge to go into the kitchen I tried to really, really picture exactly what I desperately wanted and then found it again on Pinterest and started planning getting groceries for it and then making it and eating it. I would still get urges to actually get up and eat something but I told myself that my dopamine would drop if I actually did that so I searched for more things and kept that going. Definitely felt that brain rush a bunch of times and I finally went to bed and didn‚Äôt mess myself up :).",False,False

I noticed that I was only super excited about food because I would fast all day, not knowing when my next meal would be. If I stressed out, I would immediately think about food.   So instead of that, my therapist asked me to come up with three things to do during the day that would bring me joy. If I was stressed, I could use these as an emergency, however it was advised that I schedule these 3 things through the day.  For me it's:  1) 6am: get a good workout in - this sets me up feeling good and already accomplished for the day  2) 12pm: go outside and listen to some music  3) 6pm or when I get home from work: play an hour of video games and drink tea   Honestly, I probably only spend $10 a day on food now because of this.

It may have not been adequately proven.    Now that I think about it-  It sounds like the stage in addiction where addicts bodies are triggered by their environment/people/places/etc., and their bodies appropriately prepare for the substance they‚Äôre about to use. The thing is, even if they don‚Äôt use their bodies can still have that reaction- and it‚Äôs not the mechanism behind addiction that makes it compulsive.  I‚Äôll have to check that book out!

How is the neurobiology basically the same as addiction yet addictions don‚Äôt cause a dependency from the act of planning?? Why doesn‚Äôt stopping the planning stop the binging then??) but most things we think we understand end up being completely different than we conceptualize them! ‚ÄòTis the beauty of science, always learning!
