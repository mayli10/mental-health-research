It's harder to be subjective when you are looking at a photo than when you are looking in the mirror. (But all hail the skinny mirror in my bedroom, which I will take to my grave.)",False,False

Google searches usually pull up pictures of women with the same BMI that look entirely different just to prove some kind of point lol,False,True

Also between 20-21 and I feel like a cow. I try and tell myself that my pants size is a 2 which is on the lower end of things instead of the higher end and I still.... Can't get over it. Also I know you said you were Google searching bodies but I would also suggest mybodygallery.com... you can search heights/weights/sizes and get a bunch of photos from people who uploaded and put in their stats.,False,False

And people will roll their eyes if you ask and call you “skinny” but you really don’t know. I just feel big. Bigger than I want to be. And I am bigger than I was last year - I was at about 19 and I just feel big. I feel like I’m not allowed to be insecure sometimes.,False,False
