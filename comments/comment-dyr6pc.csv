I told all my coworkers I’m a vegan with celeac disease. They have no idea what I can eat so don’t try. Except this really extra employee who one time brought in a Vegan Gluten Free cake (made with fucking almond flour of all things) for my birthday. I’m still horrified and this was years ago lol.",False,False

Makes it enough that it’s not super questionable to coworkers and comments I tend to shrug off. I work out a lot so I just blow it off like yeah, I go to the gym. Weight moved around differently as you build muscle.   I personally do fine with eating in front of people since I plan my eating around making people think I’m Normal and Okay. Reduces comments and concern so it’s most convenient.",False,False
