Body positivity isn't exactly the same as eating disorder recovery—it's a movement, not a health thing the same way recovery is. In this particular movement, there are a *LOT* of misunderstandings and oversimplifications, which leads to psuedoscience.  You don't need to believe *everything* that *every single* body positivity supporter says. You just need to feel that you deserve to love yourself and take care of yourself.  I relate to you. It's why I was never really able to recover. Whenever I have any concern with stuff I get called out for stressing about it and I'm told to STFU :(",False,False

I usually hate this language, but ""feels over reals"" comes to mind. Like I'm sorry, just because it would be nice for something to be true, or would encourage people to recover if it were true, that doesn't make your bullshit, a priori theories *actually* true.    One site that especially irked me was mirror-mirror. I found it in middle school, and while it's now improved some (it used to have a bunch of random pages that were basically just opinionated rambling), it immediately turned recovery into a joke to me. To be fair, I had no interest in recovery either then or now, but still, sites like that could have done better than making 13 yr old me actually laugh. When you tell me set point theory is the realest thing to ever real, and I'm just too stupid from not eating to know that, you've instantly lost my respect (and attention). People with EDs do not take kindly to condescension, and that site was/is the epitome of both condescension and pseudoscience - no better combo to repel the people it's supposed to help!

I took this from a comment by u//edgeofdreams on a r/nostupidquestions thread where someone asked if set point theory is “bullshit” or not, since there are a few conflicting definitions online about it depending on the source. I think this quote helps explain and debunk the scary myth side (that it’s beyond our control) while validating the slightly annoying yet relieving, scientific and true angle (that it’s mainly our body being used to certain habits and not liking changed but none of this being fixed whatsoever) behind set point theory:  &gt; ""if your parents are fat you'll be fat because of your set point""  That's mostly bullshit. There are some genetic factors that affect weight gain/loss, but it isn't a guarantee you'll be fat or skinny. You might as well say, ""Your parents had long hair, so you'll have long hair.""  ""someone can go on a diet but it wont work because of their set point""  This is also bullshit.  The whole idea of a ""set point"" is that it's a particular weight your body is accustomed to being at. You'll tend to want to eat more if you drop below it and want to eat less if you're above it. However, it's not permanently fixed by genetics. (...) You can change your set point. It just takes time.",False,False

And even though I can't follow my own advice/thoughts, I really do believe that being overweight and mentally healthy can be better than being normal and super stressed/tired/obsessed with food.  So in some cases, yes, there is 'too big', but if someone can live a happy life carrying around a few extra pounds it's better in the long run.",False,False

Focus on your health. It's hard for your body to maintain itself while underweight. Losing hair is just the first sign that something is wrong it tends to happen pretty early. At my lowest weight my BMI was still above 16 and I was losing a lot of hair. I'm back to a healthy weight now, only had to gain 15 lbs from my lowest weight, and I'm noticing hair regrowth now. My hair hardly ever sheds. There will also be broken strands of course, but I stop just losing hair constantly. In terms of things that are less noticable my chest stopped feeling tight, I don't experience frequent numbness in my extremities anymore, I'm not as lethargic all the time (*I do have other health issues which contribute to this one though so that hasn't entirely stopped, rather just improved*), and I don't feel quite as cold as I used to.",False,False
