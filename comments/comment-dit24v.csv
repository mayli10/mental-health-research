He had one more chance to step on the scale but he couldnâ€™t leave the weigh in area. I had medical scissors in my pocket for cutting athletic tape. This kid had gorgeous hair down to the middle of his back. He cried the whole time I was cutting his hair for him. But he made weight. And he took state. And he got a full ride for college. I still feel so bad about that.,False,True
