It does for me. I actually take it as a diarrhea remedy. If you're going to try it, definitely start small and drink plenty of water. Ground flax seed works better for me. Insoluble fiber (e.g. cellulose) works even better.",False,False

No uncertainty involved as they don't have to work their way through your GI system.

You'll get it in Tesco or Boots or wherever. You can also get it in Saversz so cheaper. It's nasty though.  You can get bottles of psyllium husk capsules in Holland and Barrett - they're about Â£15 for the big bottles but they are usually in the buy one get one for 1p deal so you get 2 bottles for Â£15 so they last a long time. You take 2 capsules 3x a day. Much more convenient than the Fybogel drinks and much less nasty. Keeps you nice and regular.   To get yourself moving to start with, get some Senokat Max Strength tablets and take one at night - give it 12 hours. If nothing, do it again the next night. If nothing, do it again tbe next night. If nothing, go to A &amp; E because you may have a bowel impaction (i had bowel adhesions where my bowel was attached to other organs so I'm not scaremongering - if you cannot shit after that many days and you are taking some solid food in, you need to see someone. They will give you a super strong lax to try and clear it)  ",False,False
