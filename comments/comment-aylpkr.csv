You can do it!!!   I’m not gonna tell you to stop fasting, but I do wanna tell you that I used to feel the same way about it (like it would “reset” me in many ways) and still do honestly, but my therapist considers it purging—and apparently it is pretty widely accepted as a form of purging, through an ED Recovery Lens or w/e (just some food for thought, no pun intended 😬).  I’ve  been *trying* to hold off but am losing the will because I just keep binging and needlessly gaining.... .... So let me know if you want a fasting bud, I guess, heh. I feel like my conflict about “recovery” has been letting me put it off, lol, but I really feel like I should. Idk idk :/ Anywayy.   You got this!!!!! 💪🏼 Bumps are inevitable and are to be expected on any road surely, but you WILL get past them. 💛💛",False,False

In a few days you'll stop pmsing and you won't be bloated, just keep on eating healthily and you'll get through this hurdle. :) ",False,False
