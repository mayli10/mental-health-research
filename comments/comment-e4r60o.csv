Try it in cold brew or americano form. Those taste a lot different.  Seconding syrups and milks. Unsweetened almond milk is 30 calories for an entire cup, and you’ll use maybe a quarter or a third of that in coffee. Syrups can mask flavor decently. Not many actually taste good imo though.   I still haven’t been able to tolerate it. I just moved on to energy drinks and gave up. Lol. Which sucks in the winter time because there’s no warm energy drink.",False,False

Yea, there are calories.  But I find, in my opinion, that oat milk is thick and filling.  Not something I’d binge on. I put just a splash.
