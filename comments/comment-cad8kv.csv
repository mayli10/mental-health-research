AMA. I felt so supported and everyone was really nice. My home meeting had a lot of bulimics. Some people who have been in the program for years dont necessarily call themselves bulimic but rather just a compulsive eater.   I made a close friend through OA. I called my sponsor pretty much daily for a year. Her support was so generous. However, I will say that the Christian themes were just too overreaching for me to feel comfortable. Technically your higher power doesnt have to be God and lots of people had other higher powers (like love or justice or the group) that totally work for them. I just felt like as an ex Christian I just could not make the program work. I dont enjoying the idea of submitting myself to something spiritual bc I'm not at all spiritual. I'm a pretty staunch atheist.   (Please Google the steps so you know what I'm talking about). I got through step 5 which sent me spiraling into depression. I cannot recall instances of abuse or when I fucked up without also reliving all the feelings. I felt like I was never going to fully complete step 4. It was difficult to say the least. I did a simultaneous step 4 and 5. It made me realize I had only ever completed step 1. I realized I'm not capable of completing step 2 or step 3, nor do I want to. Steps 6 and 7 are impossible in my opinion if you dont believe in at least some type of God.   I want to get better and dont mind hard work but I just could move past the judeo Christian themes about sin and submission. I also couldnt get over how much people talk about god's will. When I was a child my religious upbringing at church taught me about original sin so I often felt like a bad person who deserved abuse. People just talk very freely about how prayer works and how God has transformed their lives. Working the steps as an atheist just felt like mental gymnastics. I got tired of going to several meetings  a week and feeling like although I had so much in common with everyone eating disorder wise, I did not share the same beliefs and values about life.   If you are Christian or Jewish or believe theres a God or even if you are unsure but open minded it could definitely help you. Try it out even if you are an atheist. You will make great connections and meet very supportive people. If you are like me, I just dont think the program is a cure all or good for long term.   They say to attend at least 6 different meetings before you go once and quit. This is a good recommendation bc each meeting is composed of different people, different formats, and different vibes. Try it out.",False,False

I got to talk it all out. I spilled my guts (no pun intended) to people who actually understood and I didn’t feel judged. It was liberating.  Then I met this girl who was a lot like me and our friendship became more triggering than helpful. We would go out to eat after meeting and eventually we would both just order black coffee. It’s like it became a competition.   If you can keep it as a therapeutic experience only, I highly recommend it. Just be careful.",False,False
