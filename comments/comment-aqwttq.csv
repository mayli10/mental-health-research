Although maybe I've been working harder/actually building muscle? I managed to a chin stand for the first time this week.  The constipation is SO bad. I promised myself I'd never use laxatives again though, after I got way too into them last year and made myself horribly ill. I have no idea how to help things ""move along,"" since I already buy high-fiber breads and Quest bars etc.",False,True

It freaks me out that it wasn't even a big increase though, and I've restricted more the past two days yet my weight has kept going up :(",False,True

I do need to gain weight and rationally I know that, but actually letting it happen is a whole different ball game.   I do yoga 2-3 times a week and I like how it makes me feel, but it also hurts sometimes because of my bones hitting against the floor :( maybe light walking for now.",False,True

Exercise can cause water weight that lasts up to six weeks. And I’m betting the fact that you’re constipated is probably adding a lot of weight to the scale. ,False,False

It's food weight, poop, and water retained for digestion. You're not gaining actual fat at 1200 calories.",False,False

Especially if you're underweight. You'll probably still lose on 1200 but at a much slower rate than you would while restricting any lower. If you're looking to try to maintain, I'd probably keep my calories around 1300-1400. But keep in mind that the scale will go up and down. A week is not enough time to determine if you've gained or lost. I've recently been eating more but also going to the gym. It makes me feel better to just get on the treadmill and burn off the extra that I've consumed in a healthy way. If you can, try incorporating some light walking or any form of exercise into your regimen.  Not only does it help kill off some extra calories, it makes you feel better all around &amp; the scale might be a little nicer. ",False,False

I just don’t know what to do because I’m supposed to be eating 1700 on my meal plan that the dietitian gave me. Should I go up to that much or stay at 1200 longer?,False,True

My weight goes up and down between 1-3 pounds no matter what I eat. I can drink only water for the whole day and it will still shift a pound. If you're eating more than your body is used to, the scale is bound to shift. But that doesn't mean it's real weight at all. A lot of things play a role in what the scale shows. For example: Sodium, water intake, is your period  imminent? Etc. Also, if it's only been a week, give it some time. ",False,False
