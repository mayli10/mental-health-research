Those crisps sounds sooo good! I‚Äôm thinking Trader Joe‚Äôs would be a good option because I‚Äôve seen a lot of pre-made meal options there before and they tend to have more dairy and gluten intolerant friendly stuff.   Have you tried any dairy-free yogurts? When I‚Äôve looked I haven‚Äôt found anything that doesn‚Äôt have a lot of added sugar :(,False,True

I just got Corn Pea Bean &amp; Quinoa Crisps that are vegan and GF.  I know Clif Bars are vegan and GF but I'm not sure on simple carbs.  If you can find whole unprocessed foods that you feel safe with, that's probably your easiest bet.  This is totally anecdotal but cutting out dairy has really helped my skin and my bloating.",False,False

Trader Joe‚Äôs has a really good stir fry blend. You could even skip the noodles and just do the tofu and veg.   I just add soy sauce, garlic, salt/pepper, ginger paste (Trader Joe‚Äôs), cayenne, and sriracha.   Miso soup with tofu and veggies.   Cauliflower rice with veggies. I like making it into fried rice.   You can also get gluten free bread that is about 80 cals depending on the brand , Tofurky slices (vegan substitute for turkey slices), vegan cheese slices, light mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomato. It comes out to about 350 cals depending on how many slices of cheese and tofurkey you use. I do 2 slices of tofurkey and 1 slice of cheese and bulk up on the lettuce for crunch. This is one of my favorite lunches. I know that‚Äôs on the higher end but it‚Äôs a filling meal!   Progresso light soups are my go to and you could take those to work. Super filling!   Thinslim is a brand that is zero carbs and I just ordered their bagels from amazon. It‚Äôs pricy but it pretty good and I‚Äôve been craving bread-y things. I use vegan cream cheese and some jam on top. Each bagel is 90 cals. I bet if you can find them I‚Äôm a health food store they would be a lot cheaper.",False,False
