Every so often I'll take a tiny bit of melatonin or some other drowsy drug but I find that usually just makes me groggy and sometimes makes me feel more bloated in the morning.,False,False

I can't even get a buzz without at least 500 calories worth of wine, which would (and sometimes do) steal a big chunk of my daily calories. I always end up going above 2k if I go out with friends and stuff like that. I guess I'd just have to... not eat, or barely eat? But I've tried that before and the next day I felt so sick I could barely walk. Alcohol + existing dehydration and lack of nutrition just completely fucks my body up.",False,False

But for a few days, it was just so tempting to have some shitty lowcal dinner that will keep me full for about 37 minutes, take a pill and fall asleep before my body can realize it's been bamboozled.",False,False

I remember one particularly bad time where I was choosing to sleep instead of doing important things like going to classes.  I was diagnosed during my first year at uni and had to take a medical leave of absence to get help. Luckily, they provided great health insurance for students but I had to sign an agreement that basically said if things got bad again when I came back from that medical leave, I would have to take another medical leave. So due to that agreement, when I came back from that medical leave, I had consistent doctors appointments at my university health center.  I remember I went in for an appointment on a Monday and they always checked my weight as the first thing. I had to be backwards on the scale so I didn't know what the number was and they told me I had to come in again in 2 days for them to run some more tests. For those 2 days, I was pretty much just fasting and sleeping. When I went to the health center for that follow-up appointment after those 2 days, they checked my weight and once the doctor came in, she was really concerned and literally told me, ""okay, things are obviously not going well because you've lost 9lbs in 2 days."" I didn't respond to her when she said that because even though it was fucked up, all I could think was, ""HOLY SHIT, OMG, THAT IS FUCKING AWESOME.""  Aaaaaaaaand then I got sent to inpatient again.",False,False
