I will never be that girl again but I can became a new person that is stronger and happier than what I was in my disorder. I am working toward making myself into what I wanted to be and disregarding the voice that tells me that I am not human until I see my ribs sticking out and my thigh bones to be visible and a thigh gap to be human and worthy of love. Things that are getting better. I am surrounding myself with things that are positive: this sub so I can talk to people who understand, reading to escape the day, art to express myself, singing to feel like a little song bird, a therapist that makes me feel safe, pets that love me unconditionally, healthy exercise that makes me feel free( I was a figure skater competitively and it made me more concerned of my body. Now I skate for my own enjoyment away from the pressure of competition with other girls. I changed coaches to one that emphasizes strength not thinness.) when I catch myself slipping back into old thoughts, I simply look myself in the mirror and tell myself,‚Äùno. The voice is a liar. You are worthy and beautiful and capable.). One aspect that I need to improve is loneliness. I need to find friends that understand so maybe I need to ask my therapist for a support group or something. I feel like filling my days with hobbies that I find fulfilling is important for overcoming the thoughts of food.",False,False
