I think it helped me alot with prevebting muscle loss etc. I also do know that when I have crazy high protein days AND I manage to properly hydrate, I don't generally get as bingey at night. But tons of protein can also be hard on your digestive system (protein is hard to break down), so it can make you feel sick too sometimes.",False,False

I can't restrict eating stuff like cereal or bread or crackers; it feels like I ate nothing 5 mins later (not to mention carbs are my #1 binge trigger). Eggs, meat, protein bars are my loves",False,False
