I white knuckled my way through recovery exactly like that for 8 years and it's so hard but you're doing the right thing for your body.

I'm ""recovering"" in the sense that in the last few weeks my eating has been better and I made an effort not to overtrain, and I do feel healthier.

In order for me to get the body I want I have to be restrictive, period.

Cessation of behaviors but the mental aspect is still there. Full recovery means the thoughts are no longer there. You can get there. It just takes time and practice. I understand it’s exhausting but it’s not hopeless. A healthy relationship with your body and self is fully possible. Try working toward body neutrality, instead of full on body positivity. Seeing myself in a positive light when I hated myself sounded impossible, but getting to the point where I didn’t really care about how I looked sounded maybe achievable, so I started there. Now in body neutral territory and moving into body positivity sounds much easier to try and achieve.",False,False

It's your brain your body if you dont like how it works reprogram that bish!!  The human brain is just a biological computer powered by the electric pulses our blood triggers when it flows through us and ran by (insert your name here) operating system    So reprogram it honey   Watch lenore Alexandra on you tube as well as Aaron doughty and victor oddo   These people helped me reprogram my brain (with help from spirit guides and spirits but I'm very spiritually inclined and am a medium as well but that doesnt change the fact that it will help you too)   As long as your ready for your brain to work different than it does now then it should help you    Your brain works how it does because of everything in your life up until now so I'm not saying this is gonna be a quick fix or that it will be easy (cause it's not there were times I wanted to just give up but I made a promise and ima keep it)   But if you can be tenacious about it and accept that its a process that will show results in due time then I highly reccomend it   Because you can see that this isnt how you should live means you are ready to let go of it   Their videos helped me let go of alot of negative feelings I had for myself image and it made my brain a much nicer place to live,False,False
