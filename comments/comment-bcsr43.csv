And coffee? Forget it. I'm 30 years old with a kid, a degree, a house, a career, I survived cancer. The LEAST a man can do is put some thought into a date.   Luckily my boyfriend agrees and our first date was to the neighborhood carnival for rides and games and then for date 2 we went to a pistol range.",False,False
