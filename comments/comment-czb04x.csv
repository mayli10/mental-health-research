Physical hunger is not even being a thing anymore and it's made me not want to eat once I start actually eating but up until that point my body is just anticipating the food. When I'm not eating, my mind wanders directly to food (some days more than others, other days it somehow just doesn't happen???). I fantasize about hearty, warm, cozy home cooked meals alllll day but when I do manage to put something in my mouth I'll get 25% through and then start feeling sick about it. If I put it down I'm like ""fuck I'm hungery uwu"" and the cycle never ends.",False,False

I'm really shocked someone hasmt said anything, though its probably becauss im nowhere near underweight",False,False
