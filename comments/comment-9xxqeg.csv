One of the consistent themes I always saw was all us trying to make sure we didn’t tell other people about our disordered eating or give it as diet advice.  IDK about anyone else, but whenever someone asks me for diet advice, I just say I am no expert and change the topic. I never want anyone to think what I do is normal.",False,False
