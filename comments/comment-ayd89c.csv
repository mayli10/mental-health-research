I'm so impatient with myself when it comes to my mental health. Anyone else? I'm very supportive and kind. I'm the one exception for some reason. ðŸ˜‚",False,False

I actually don't cope with that aspect well, but tell myself everyday that there isn't much else to do than to wait. I put on a good 45lbs in a year due to binging, and being very short, this is super obvious to everyone and no clothes fit me anymore and I can't even recognize myself - yet it's only a few handful of days when I'm binge free. The fastest way to lose this weight again is obviously fasting, but even the thought of this makes me anxious and I know I can't handle it like I used to, also I started a quite physical job (with lots of mirrors, and people who I think are meaner to me because I'm fat now and they wouldn't have they gotten to know me a year ago), so I can't faint there. It's a constant battle to just stay on track and not do anything drastic and distract yourself :D",False,False
