At the very least, even if someone learns disordered eating from a support sub, they do so intentionally and knowing that they are engaging in self-harm. People who are taught that what they are doing is right and healthy will have a much harder time being able to let it go.  You're not alone! For what it's worth, the current moderators of this sub are in communication with Reddit admins to ensure that this sub also does not get banned. It's why we don't have the same flair system or stickied threads, and why there are much stricter and clearer rules about what is/isn't encouraged here. The new mods have been doing a really good job. I know that isn't a guarantee, but I do think we would at least get a heads up this time if something were to happen to the sub. But you never have to suffer through this on your own.",False,False

EVERYONE. Whether it was relapsing into restricting, purging, or (like me) binging, everyone's eating got WAY more disordered, VERY quickly.  *we did it reddit*  /s  For real, if I were going to ban a sub? I know which one it would've been, and it's not ProED. At least ProED openly acknowledged that it dealt with disordered behavior. What I find truly disturbing about....*a particular sub*.....is that I think it's entirely possible that people without EDs are showing up there, learning negative behaviors, and slipping towards actual EDs. To my mind, that is FAR more dangerous than ProED, which was explicitly aimed at people who were already sick. Disease breeds in the darkness, not in the light.  Anyway, I'm sorry you suffered as I did. I figured lots of people relapsed, but wasn't sure because I was staying away from reddit and any attempts to regroup. I was convinced that any ED-related sub or ProED replacement was destined for the banhammer, and was terrified of reaching out only to get cut off without warning AGAIN. Which only led to me relapsing alone haha hOooRrrRAaayyyy  I'm still halfway convinced this sub will disappear at any second. But I can't go it alone anymore. I don't use Peach, but I really appreciate you reaching out. Just being on this sub with people who understand makes me feel less alone, and that much more stable.",False,False

Especially this:  &gt; guess what happened when proED got banned? To deal with my panic, I started counting calories again after years of relatively happy intuitive undereating.  EVERYONE from proED I spoke to relapsed after the ban. EVERYONE. Whether it was relapsing into restricting, purging, or (like me) binging, everyone's eating got WAY more disordered, VERY quickly.   I also agree that Reddit is not to blame for the fact we have EDs, but they absolutely would've known that this kind of response would've been likely if they actually gave a shit about the users at all. But they didn't. The hand-wringing ""this is for your own good"" bullshit they tried to sell us was just so deeply patronising when it was obvious that their actions would cause more harm than good. They first completely misunderstood the point of the sub (it was a support network for people who already had EDs, not promoting them) and then worked on that misunderstanding (ew, gross, we don't want to think about people with eating disorders and think we're responsible for them at all). It was never to help people with EDs or they would've, y'know, consulted with some professionals instead of just insta-deleting it. It just smacked of some totally removed Reddit admin who has never had any interaction with EDs or probably even broader mental illness who just decided they knew what was best. Problem solved. ðŸ™„  I agree that there were lots of problems with the old sub. The flairs, even though I used them at the time, were definitely triggering. I also didn't want to acknowledge it. And a lot of the weekly/stickied threads were super bad, especially the thinspo, and the daily calorie counting threads were super super competitive. I got a thrill from using all of those features but I do know they were bad for me, and I'm glad they're now gone, even though I missed them at first. I can even understand the whole sub needing to be soft reset. But, as you said, it should've been handled better, and it would've been if their intent has been to help people with EDs even remotely. Because then they would've understood how much people there relied on it, as a community, and that its sudden and unpredictable removal would've been really, really bad for their mental health.   Instead it was just gone. Overnight. No explanation and no help that we didn't carve for ourselves with a new sub. And it hurt people, and what's worse is that ANYONE with ANY experience would've been able to tell them that it would. It couldn't have been more clearly ""we don't care where you go so long as it's not here"".  And the worse part is that this stigmatisation of disordered eating just allows pockets of unrecognised EDs to fester and flourish in other subs, too. The entire fasting sub is a clusterfuck, but they all argue until they're blue in the face that they don't have disordered eating, so the sub gets to stay up. Meanwhile, proED talked about the EXACT same behaviour, the EXACT same effects and preparation, but they ACKNOWLEDGED it was disordered to fast for days at a time - and bam, suddenly it's wrong and doesn't belong on Reddit. That doesn't teach people not to fast, it just teaches people to be tricky about it, to obscure the truth of their reasoning, to build up an echo chamber of bullshit where everyone is agreeing that they're totally healthy and totally not motivated by anything disordered as they argue about whether toothpaste breaks your fast.   What breaks my heart the most is to see people in other weight loss subs suddenly being able to dismiss any and all valid criticism of disordered eating that featured in those subs under the insistence that people from proED were ""infesting"" other subs. Like oh, this isn't something that's actually worth listening to, it's just tragic little anas who didn't have their own sub any more and were flooding other perfectly healthy diet subs with their own issues! Except we made a new sub almost immediately to go to instead, people who used the original sub had always been using the other subs as well already, the disordered behaviour had also already been present in the other subs and had been called out previously, too, and the people calling it out were only trying to help, not, idk, recruit other people to EDs. But none of that mattered. People had a tidy little excuse not to have to analyse their behaviour any more, they could just say ""pfft, a proED-er is projecting again,"" and ignore them. The way I hear people talk about any ED-related subs on the main subs is awful. Most of them will straight up acknowledge they don't understand EDs and that they don't WANT to. They just malign them out of the gate.  Everybody lost from this scenario. And it still hurts. This sub is great, Peach is great, but neither of them are the same as proED, and I cannot help but wonder how many people left the old sub and never found the new one and are now stuck on ED Tumblr or Twitter or MPA, all of which are unthinkably toxic compared to the old proED.   Sigh. I wonder how many calories you burn angry-typing.",False,False

I'm still so bitter about what happened with the previous sub. And like, I'm glad we have the new sub! The numbers and stuff on ProED were more triggering than I could admit at the time.   But randomly and suddenly taking away ProED, leaving us to either twist in the wind or go to a much worse environment like MPA? What the actual FUCK. If they had given even ONE DAY of warning, ONE DAY to process and make plans, it would have made an enormous difference. Instead the sub just vanished.  Like, guess what happened when proED got banned? To deal with my panic, I started counting calories again after years of relatively happy intuitive undereating. And while I tried to fight it for months, I'm officially obsessed with losing again, even though the sane part of me knows that's a really bad idea at my underweight BMI. (Goodbye to over two years of decent body image and weight stability, I guess.)  Don't get me wrong, I'm not blaming reddit admins for my ED existing. However, if I were testifying in a court of internet law, I'd say they should've reasonably known that their actions might cause undue distress to the sub's mentally ill subscribers. They certainly destabilized my life by removing one of my support networks with no warning. That desperate feeling of having no notice and no control over the situation, that's what really fucked me up. Because, of course, many EDs are manifestations of a *need for control*.   Not that the admins care. It was never about health/safety. They just wanted us gone, or at least less visible. I do think that ED sufferers make most people deeply uncomfortable, and that many would prefer it if we just vanished. But whatever. Let them find us disgusting and vanish-worthy as they want, as long as they outwardly treat us with human respect, right?  ...Except they don't. Instead they both infantilize us, and treat us like infectious monsters who will seduce others into our disease if we're exposed to the public. They project all their own feelings about food and eating and bodies onto us. They deride us, implicitly or not, as being stupid for having this particular mental illness.  And it all enters a special level of hell on the shadier ""healthy"" dieting subs, because as you say, many of the posters seem to have unacknowledged ED behaviors, and react defensively. It does make me sad for them...but it's also just irritating as hell.",False,False

THIS! THIS! THIS!!! Thank you for putting it so concisely! This is ALWAYS how I feel whenever people talk about subs like, say, edfood or the newer one I can't remember. People see a post talking about a 120cal dinner or something, and they clutch their pearls, like, oh my goodness, that's not enough! We shouldn't be encouraging this!  But for someone with disordered eating, the alternative to eating a 120cal dinner isn't to eat a 500cal dinner, or whatever they ""should"" be eating - it's to eat NOTHING. And encouraging someone to eat 120cal of nutritious food for dinner because that's what they can handle is ALWAYS, ALWAYS going to be better than eating nothing at all.",False,False

Like, yes, there's a point that encouraging disordered eating probably shouldn't be allowed on mainstream dieting subs, BUT that line of thinking has mutated from ""protect people from developing disordered eating habits"" into ""people with eating disorders are EVIL and DISGUSTING and they should be BANNED ON SIGHT""  Like, how is banning them going to help at all...? It's the same reason it was so awful and disingenuine for reddit's mods to completely destroy the original proED. Banning that sub does NOTHING to help people with disordered eating, it just strips them of any support system they had - a support system which was encouraging them to MINIMISE their destructive behaviours, not continue them, which any mod would've seen if they paid more than 2 seconds of attention to it.  The idea that people with disordered eating should be banned immediately from talking about anything in weight loss subs, etc. is so harmful. It just forces people with EDs to be more secretive about their behaviours, and thus less likely to receive help, or drives them further into actually genuinely pro-eating disorder communities like MPA. I briefly looked at MPA once the original proED shut down and the night-and-day difference between the two subs and how much MPA glorified and encouraged disordered eating made me so sad for the young impressionable people left behind by proED.  Sorry for ranting on your comment. I know it doesn't achieve anything lol. But I'm just so pissed off at such a bone-headed decision from reddit's moderating team that obviously had ZERO interest in helping anyone and was just caving to pressure from people who also didn't have any understanding of disordered eating who were screaming for it to get shut down.  Anyway, I think more to the point, people in weight loss subs perceive people with EDs as like... bad people? Like they're trying to manipulate other people into getting disordered eating or something? I see soooo many threads or comments that boil down to, ""Those stupid disordered eating people project their EDs onto everyone else! They WANT us all to have EDs like THEM! But there's nothing wrong with what we're doing! We're being HEALTHY about weight loss, unlike THEM!""   But then... of course... the reality is that most people with EDs are just genuinely concerned when they see the EXACT SAME DISORDERED EATING rhetoric that they themselves are familiar with, being shared as good dieting advice to impressionable people. So they point it out because they want to help other people from going down the same path as them.   In the end... I think it's because the people in the regular weight loss subs are defensive. A lot of people with EDs don't know they have disordered eating and/or are in denial about it. I think, especially if you've been struggling with losing weight for a long time, finally finding something that helps you lose weight can feel like a miracle. I mean, we here often talk about how euphoric it can be to start restricting/fasting, etc. If someone is doing something that makes them feel amazing, light, focused, motivated, etc. and is also actually helping them to lose weight, then of course they'd be defensive if someone tried to point out to them that their behaviour is unhealthy. It's denial, a coping mechanism. ""Nuh-uh, of course there's nothing wrong with cutting all my food up into tiny sub-bite size pieces so I can eat them with my baby spoon! Of course I would rather eat this 150cal massacred meal than a 400cal alternative, haven't you heard how bad oil is?? I eat exactly 1200cals (even tho I need more) so OBVIOUSLY i'm NOT disordered! You're just PROJECTING! Stop trying to take this away from me!""  I mean, even people with full-blown EDs who know they have EDs and have been professionally diagnosed and treated for disordered eating will sometimes minimise their own actions, believe that they aren't really sick and have been faking the whole time, etc. So it makes sense that someone who's flirting with disordered eating and has never been given a diagnosis and doesn't have a support network like this sub could stay deeeeep in denial about their disordered patterns.  Guh. Sorry for rambling even more. I just want to understand the psychology behind it I guess.",False,False
