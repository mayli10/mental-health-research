The only way to get ahold of it is to stop purging entirely - which means you will probably lose the ability to purge hands-free.  I'm speaking from experience here. I haven't purged regularly in a few years now, but I went through this. Any time I ate, especially if it was a ""purge food"" (aka, something I regularly purged or something that ""sat heavy"" in my stomach, if that makes sense?), it came back up whether I wanted it to or not. It took... maybe 6-9 months for this to stop completely? (And then I switched to lax, 0/10, do not recommend.) ",False,False

I notice the more I purge the more that problem happens. It will go away when you slow down on doing it this way. I’ve never used my hands I’ve only done it this way so I can’t speak about that. I know it doesn’t always feel like our choice but that’s my honest experience ",False,False
