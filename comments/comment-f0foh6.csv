I don’t have heaters BUT I WISH I DID OMG  I’d do anything for some direct heat source to cuddle up against but I don’t have one and even using every bit of fabric in my bedroom as an extra layer of insulation I can’t get warm at all.  I also really need to start wearing gloves all the time as my hands go numb and I stop being able to feel my fingers even in 21 degree (C) heat but I can’t as I don’t want people seeing how cold I am since they’ll figure out I’m ill.",False,False
