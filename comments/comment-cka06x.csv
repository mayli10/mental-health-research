I'm steadily getting worse.. I'm on hour 41 of a 48 hour fast. My second 48 hour fast of the week.. I only eat 3 days out of the week. :/ I don't want to eat, but I do because I'm trying to keep my mom from noticing how little I actually eat. I planned my fasts around her work schedule. I rarely eat 1000 calories on the days I do eat.",False,False

I've been struggling with daily symptoms for years now. Been studying the mechanisms behind keto, but more importantly why carbohydrates and sugar in my diet may have contributed to my binging (luckily I'm mostly BED).   Starting now. Day 1. I'm optimistic in the first time in a long time because I've flunked out of treatment twice, tried all the medication suggested, and gotten much worse from relapse after relapse.",False,False
