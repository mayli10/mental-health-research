I give myself one hour. Usually if I stick to that one hour I don't have to count calories. However I've been counting calories forever so im pretty good at staying under my limit. I just hate counting because I get obsessive over it and this is one of the few ways I've found to get around that and be successful. ,False,False

I hate how i cant moderate anything. The closest ive come to preventing binges is stopping swallowing halfway through and chew and spit the rest. I cant make myself stop but at least it stops my stomach from hurting for a full day. And then i still punish myself for it. ,False,False
