My family life was absolutely terrible growing up so I put a lot of thought into how I can be the best parent possible and do the least amount of long term psychological damage to my kids   I feel ya on the food issues not being about food and body. I feel like different aspects of my eat disorder are caused by different things. Some having to do with food and body &amp; some having to do with my mental health. I’ve already hit you with waaaaay too many walls of text but I have a lot of thoughts on insuring my kids get the help they need if they suffer from any type of mental health issues.

I'm glad you've found such a healthy way to approach all this. I'm definitely starting to feel like it is a more achievable goal. I 100% plan to make being physically active a big role in my family activities (because I love being active and it's such a healthy lifestyle). I grew up in a ""we just aren't runners"" kind of home, where my mom used to play sports but we didn't, and there was not always a great deal of body positivity (my sister was overweight from childhood on and is very obese to this day). But I also do have to acknowledge that my food issues aren't generally about food and body, so therest a good chance if I can help my kids manage their mental health in general, this won't be an issue either way.",False,False

I wouldn’t restrict food if my kid was gaining weight, rather just provide them with healthier options. Maybe buy less snacks, have less (or no) candy in the house so it isn’t telling them they can’t have it, it just isn’t available. Or start cooking healthier meals &amp; pack their school lunch if they’d been previously buying it at school so you know what they are eating.  Adding in more physical activity like walks as a family or pick up hiking or riding bikes as a family.. or try to get them more active. You can make these lifestyle changes for/ with your child as a way to be healthier without specifically commenting on their weight or body. If you teach them to live a healthy, active lifestyle they shouldn’t have to worry about weight  I do think you should teach children that some foods are more nutritious than others, such as an apple being better for you than candy, but still not put it on a pedestal like “if you eat your carrots, then you can have icecream” bc you’re putting emphasis that the icecream is better and you only should eat the carrots to get the dessert.",False,True

At 13 I was getting more autonomy and doing things without my parents and basically should be reasonably expected to manage many of my own health concerns on my own.

So at what age is it necessary to tell the child that they have to make better choices to control their own weight.

I was never overweight (or even a healthy weight) so I just completely ate to my bodies hunger cues and I was super active  My mom would tell me I needed to diet or give me weight loss pills bc SHE was obsessed with her weight so she thought I should be too, I guess?! She missed pretty much all of my school/ sport events and basically sat in her room 24/7 and wouldn’t even eat dinner with us bc she hated herself for getting fat.
