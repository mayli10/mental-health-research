Trader joes gets busy everywhere too, esp if you live in a big city. My other advice is to go in the early morning or right before close if youre like me and need to stop and check all my options, serving sizes per calories and prices to make sure im getting the lowest number in every way. Also the employees at trader joes are plentiful and v knowledgeable they always have good recs on cheap healthy options.   I also forgot to mention they have jars of kimchi! My fav snack! Its $7 for a big jar and so filling and 15 calories a serving. I know a lot of americans dont vibe super well with the idea of spicy cold pickled cabbage but damn if its not my favorite food.

Cauliflower pizza crust! its 80 cals and $3.99 and v v v good!   Mashed cauliflower is like a mashed potato that tastes great with some seasoning and is 50 cals each and $2.99.   The organic aminos coconut seasoning sauce is great if youre like me and fear most liquid dressing and seasoning,   Dipping their sweet potato chips (2.50) in their spicy salsa (1.99),   regular non organic sweet potatoes are so good and cheap eaten with some garlic salt and hot sauce.   you can get huge bags of brussel sprouts there for $3.99 and get some delish roasted sprouts with garlic that will last a million years.   Their seaweed snacks are 30 calories a serving and 99 cents only! And seaweed snacks are really hard to find outside of chinese market places.   They have tons of really cheap cereals that are all ranging from 70-130 calories a cup and sell the cheap and sugar free almond milk.    And earth balance vegan butter is a must have, i dont let myself have butter almost ever but earth balance is great.   Their low fat yogurt tubs.   Their gelato or coconut based ice creams are all low cal and delicious, but pricey for ice cream!   They have chocolate covered banana slices that are so flavorful and intense all you need is one to get satisfied lol.   They have lots of frozen fruits good for smoothies and protein shakes, but their frozen veggies are super lacking. I prefer other grocers frozen veggies theres more options there.   Unsweetened matcha green tea (in the can) its 0 calories and 99 cents and its a great green tea!  Organic frozen squash is amazing too, its 30 calories and less that $3 i think  Carrot Noodles! Theyre frozen and $.2.99  Sesame bread is 80 calories a slice, i dont like the taste but i keep it around.  They have goi cuon there i believe, which are usually 3.99 i believe for 2 big ones! I d ont remember the english name for them, i think theyre called spring rolls in america, but americans call many dishes the wrong names.  Their rice stir frys, theres a cauliflower one is my favorite (lol can u tell i love cauliflower)  Theres frozen edamame too that i would die for  i dont think its at trader joes, or at least i never seen them in a trader joes, or in ed communities in the us. But ube is really popular as a diet food. Ube biko is one of my favorite good good foods.  and oh lord how do i even begin to express my love for their organic herbal waters, 0 calories each and so tasty ",False,False

They are one of my favorite ‘safe’ indulgence foods at 200 cals for 7.    I stockpile their frozen cauliflower rice, frozen grilled chicken, and frozen green beans too.   Since I don’t drink soda I spend far too much money on the Gerolsteiner sparkling mineral water. ",False,False
