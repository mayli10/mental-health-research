I find I feel I'm making no progress then I look back over 6mo or so and I see a difference.   Like, it feels fake and patronising or weak to celebrate 48, 72 hrs of coping but it helps me to stop and acknowledge each milestone. Eventually I realise I'm not counting them anymore, or im thinking in terms of good days or weeks, not living hour to hour. (Recovery never clicked for me but I have had long periods of """"""recovery"""""").",False,False

It took me 4 years to get stable in recovery - the first time I got out of treatment I was relapsing immediate. The second time, relapsed within months. Third time was the charm luckily, because I was about to give up hope and just start looking into applying for disability. Now Iâ€™ve been mostly stable for like 2 years! It is amazing.",False,False
