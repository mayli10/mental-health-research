Homemade applesauce (apples and cinnamon and salt in a slow cooker) is really good though.  Oh my god I would have oatmeal for every meal if I could. Pro-tip: grate spices like cinnamon and nutmeg by hand (using a microplane) into your oatmeal and add a generous amount of salt it is amazing.  My favorite food ever (combines my 3 favorite safe foods) is a banana and spices mashed into a big bowl of oatmeal, eaten with dollops of nonfat plain icelandic yogurt (skyr). It is sweet and sour and hot and cold and creamy and sooooo good. (And it has like 21g protein and 7g fiber for 350 cals) You should try this with soy yogurt or whatever vegan alternative you like best.",False,True

I hate ""healthy"" diet sodas like Zevia.   I am honestly doing a lot better calories-wise. Like give me a pile of plain yogurt or fruit or oatmeal or whatever and I'll be fine, but I'm pretty sure I would have a breakdown over one (1) Hershey's kiss.

Bananas and oatmeal as well as bananas and nonfat Greek/Icelandic yogurt are my favorites. I know bananas are a common fear food but absolutely cannot relate.
