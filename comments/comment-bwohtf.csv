As disheartening as this may be, I doubt that she'd be convinced to do so. Theres no words that can magically cure someone and make them want to gain weight- that person has to willingly chose that or it wont have a lasting impact. I wish that she could get some medical help in forms of therapy or what not but I understand how that's not always obtainable.  I would suggest trying to be supportive and even if you want her to gain weight please don't force her. Encourage her to eat healthy foods perhaps? Nothing too much in volume or in calories as that might actually upset her- but something that will encourage her to eat... Im sorry Im not entirely sure. I really wish she could get some professional help...",False,False
