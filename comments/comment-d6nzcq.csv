The first time you get to under 500 cals, you feel on top of the world, nothing can stop you, the hunger pangs are a sign of victory, and the adrenaline/high you get from restricting can be addicting. I'm not going to chastise you, you know what you're doing and what harm it can cause, but please stay safe. 500 cals is very very little. When you start to feel ill, please eat a little something, even just one cracker or an orange. Anything under your tdee will cause you to lose weight ♡",False,False

I did 500 restriction for two months and honestly it was the worst decision of my life. I looked sick for the last few weeks, I lost my period and I could not concentrate on anything (for someone who's normally good academically it was a blow) and it absolutely kickstarted an insane obsession over food. The way it ended? 5-10k calorie binges every day for weeks. The first few days I felt like I was dying because my body hurt so bad but I could not stop eating. Please consider having higher intake in the long run.",False,False
