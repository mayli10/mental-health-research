My curves are at 24 and 32 so not nearly as bad as yours, although I've shrunk at least half an inch in the eight or so years since I last got x rays at my orthopedic doctor so they might have gotten worse. I'm perpetually salty about the fact that, if my back was straight, I'd probably be around 6' tall instead of the 5'10-5'11 I've always been. My hips are also super uneven and it's annoying because one of them sticks out way further than the other and makes me feel so fat.",False,False

I’m at 37 degrees (s-shaped) and wore a brace for 4 years. I’ve actually done some research into it—we’re more likely to have low BMIs (that can’t be attributed entirely to higher rates of EDs) and fucked up leptin/ghrelin levels. One of the papers I read thought it was because of body image issues and wanting to minimize a fucked-up silhouette and while that might be kinda true, my pain levels go off the charts when I binge/am bloated/weigh over a certain amount so being underweight or low-normal is physically less painful for me. Idk about anyone else though.   And the height thing KILLS me. I should be an inch taller by the formulas for corrected scoliosis height, and since I’m transgender, there’s a dysphoria factor to that too. ",False,False
