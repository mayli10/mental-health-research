Things to be aware of: 1) There will be bloating. It’s not fat. Do yourself a kindness and wait a few days to weigh yourself.  2) You might get a “hangover”. I usually do: dehydration from carb intake, headache, water retention, “sugar sickness” which is nausea and heartburn. This only lasts a few hours but it sucks.    Other than that I really recommend it. I haven’t had an out of control binge in over a year since I started scheduling “refeeding” days like this. Hope you enjoyed your cheat food! ",False,False

So I end up averaging around ~700 cals a day for weekdays. During weekends I binge and eat whatever junk that I want and give up on counting calories. Somehow, I end up overeating just enough to cancel the deficit that I made during the weekdays and I've not gained weight since 3 weeks ago, when I decided to do this crazy thing.   Obviously I wouldn't recommend this because on binge days, I get super bloated and retain water like crazy. My weight fluctuates by 1-3 kgs and I get even more determined to restrict further the next week to ""undo"" the binge, but when i restrict too low, I start getting heart palpitations and feel like my legs are going to give in any moment. It causes me so much of emotional and physical pain because we all know this is going to end up in a slow and steady weight gain in the long run and also because I really want to lose more weight but that ain't happening with this around.
