I feel like a lot of people on this sub hate BED sufferers and sometimes I wonder if I am allowed here. There was another post a few months ago of a recovering anorexic terrified of becoming fat due to health issues and when I said honey it has nothing to do with health issues or you would have been too scared to stop eating she down voted and fought with me. Ed's don't give a fuck about health,False,False

Halo/horns effect in action. Disgust comes first, and everything else is seen through its lens. Then rationalised as ""it's not healthy, it has nothing to do with weight, she has a shitty personality"". Which is true - she seems to have mental issues and a personality disorder as well. Which is very common in people with EDs. But when a starving person acts annoying and irrational, it becomes ""poor thing, it must be so hard to deal with not just an ED but other mental issues as well, can't somebody help them!?""",False,False

Supersize vs superskinny no one is disgusted by how little the skinnies eat. Mukbangs encourage binge eating so I can't watch them.
