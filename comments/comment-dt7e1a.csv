The first time I did that, I went for a walk to get lunch and got a Diet Coke but I found a wrapper on the way back, so now the wrapper act is part of my life.",False,False

Don’t worry! I’m at a healthy weight, I just carry it more in my lower body so I end up looking thinner! I do eat, I just usually end up timing it when you’re not home/I stop somewhere on the way over. Oh, I started a new medication and it messed with my stomach for a little while so it was hard to keep food down. It’s all better, now! I just eat a lot of small meals, that’s why my lunch is so small. I’m sure you’ve seen me snack!   I’ve:  * kept a collection of wrappers/fast food bags to “prove” I’ve eaten something by either showing it off or putting it in the trash on top of everything so it’s obvious   * also dirtied a dish just to put it in the sink to make it look like I’ve eaten  * buried binge food at the bottom of the trash can and told everyone I ate it all   * taken food into my room and thrown it out the window lol",False,False

But when I first started developing an ED, I would hide all my garbage/leftovers from my binges under my bed until I could throw them out without people noticing. I got away with it for months. Until one day my mom decided to clean my room (wtf) and found everything... luckily she just thought I was weird, and didn’t suspect I had an ED. I still hide pretty much all evidence in my room until I know I wouldn’t be seen disposing of it, including bags of vomit and c/s nowadays :) I just really can’t handle people figuring it out.",False,False

I still do it. I know they all eat that way all the time but they dont know thats the meal I look forward to all month.,False,False
