The models I know personally (like, signed with real agencies, not ""models"")are 5ft7 to 5ft 11... 5ft 7 is the low end but from my experience 5ft 8-5ft9 is average",False,False

You might get there on 5'11 but any career models shorter than that were either lucky or well connected (or both) ðŸ˜­,False,False

I have grown a little since I was 18 and started maintaining instead of losing. Right now I am 19. Since my 12-year molars came in at 17 to be honest I wish I could still grow a little.,False,False

Plus when I go get double digits I'll be almost dead or very very sick. I'm happy about one thing that I'll at least look more masc and pull off certain styles once I'm skinny enough cus that's part of my tomboyish style. Other than that it's really not that big of a deal. If you're short and esp have a small frame you can full off the petite dainty look which also looks awesome.,False,False

I'm 5ft 4 inches and apparently I was supposed to be 5ft 7 inches. I would give ANYTHING to be that tall. I want to model so bad. My ED happened first during my growing period, 9th grade. Sigh",False,False
