You get to a low weight, and the constant anxiety drives you mad, you're fucking hungry and tired and you don't want to exercise but you've got to work off the 900 calories you just ate, so you try to reason with yourself, ""Look, you may be having a bad day, maybe you're up a pound or two, but just think about where you were three months ago and how you would have killed to be this weight.""  So you can remember a time six months ago when you felt absolutely thrilled to be 105 lbs and thought that was skinny. But now you're 91 lbs, up from 89, and you feel almost suicidal about how fat you are. Nothing has really changed. You're still as fat as ever. You're still not good enough.  But then maybe you go for a long run, and have a good shit, and you wake up the next day feeling empty and clean even though your weight hasn't shifted an ounce. You go about your day on 300 calories and you smile and sparkle and feel fucking invincible. Same weight. Totally different feeling in your body.  Maybe that's just me, but I doubt it.",False,False
