People gave me crap for bringing a little soup bowl to potlucks but I was able to grab a lot less without people pointing it out because my plate was ""full"" after a scoop of salad",False,False

If someone offered me something else I said ""oh my plates pretty full,  I might get some later"". If they would have asked, I would have I had another part of my family's meal to go to. Which was true, but I didn't go. I didn't eat any dessert.   The problem with potluck is it's usually a lot of crockpot foods, Saucy meat dishes, casserole, pasta salad, and of course desserts. There is fruit, but not a whole lot of others foods that aren't super calorie dense.  In short, potlucks suck. ",False,False

I mean I am somewhat. But today I was super depressed and didnâ€™t care. Also many people there were eating a lot, so I didnâ€™t feel as obvious chowing down. Also we were sitting at a table covered in desserts and breads and snacks so it was easy to just keep grabbing stuff and I felt like probably no one was paying attention. And I didnâ€™t know many of the people and didnâ€™t care what they thought. Still, itâ€™s shameful. I never want to do that again. Iâ€™m so sad about the weight Iâ€™ve gained lately.   Next time I will bring a healthy thing and try to stick to that. ",False,True

So if you bring something you actually want to eat, there will probably be at least one more thing out there that's okay. I mean someone else is going to bring fruit/a salad/something healthy.   &amp;#x200B;  I have a bunch of food rules so I'm usually okay around potlucks. Usually people don't say anything about my food, and if they do I just say I'm trying to eat healthy, so I cut out dairy and bread. Sometimes this ends up being a conversation, but I expect vegans go through the same thing. Although I'm fat and in the midwest, so if I say I'm trying to eat healthy, I mostly just have to listen to other people's 2 cents on what 'healthy' means.   &amp;#x200B;  As for controlling myself... Usually if I make good choices when I grab my plate, I'm good to go. I feel like the social pressure of being in a group of people kind of helps me limit the binge. Like I can only get one plate because if I get more than one, people will really judge me. :c",False,False

You can load up on that and just use the excuse that the other options are not what you like to eat. Maybe help few people eat a tiny bit healthier too in the process!!,False,False
