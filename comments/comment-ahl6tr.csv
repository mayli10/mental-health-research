If you want to try lifting but have no idea what you're doing you could sign up to gym classes, or even get a friend/personal trainer to show you the ropes. There's also the grayskull program in the fitness reddit - it only involves a few types of lifts so you're not overwhelmed. ",False,False

Like I'm also 5""2 and pure flab, and to make things worse, when I was doing weights to get buff, my gain ratio of muscle: fat was 1:2.  Feel like I'm always gonna be a wobbly blob even if I starve myself to death.  I mean I *could* be alright with that, if it wasn't for the fact that I gain weight in my stomach. FFS, my hip bones start hurting when I lie on my stomach, my spine is starting to stick out, I have zero T&amp;A, so why the fuck can I still grab chunks of flab around my stomach???",False,False
