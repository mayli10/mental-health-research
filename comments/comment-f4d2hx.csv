I’m only 5’5” and being 5’10” or even taller would be a DREAM :’) but any chance of me even growing the tiniest bit more has probably been crushed by the malnourishment caused by my ED oof,False,False

I'm stuck at 160 and wish I was at your range. I have PCOS so all my weight goes to my tummy and I hate it more than anything. Also doesn't help that my bf likes it when I cook for him and he likes everything covered in cheese when I'm content with a salad for dinner when I'm alone.,False,False

Our brains aren’t rational.,False,False
