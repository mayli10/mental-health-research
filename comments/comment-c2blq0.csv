Trust me. My boyfriend is basically always touching me in some way or another. He‚Äôs a touchy guy and doesn‚Äôt get nearly enough hugs so often over-indulges around me. Your  guy is probably the same way. As long as it doesn‚Äôt make you uncomfortable I don‚Äôt see any problem. If it does bother you, casually let him know you aren‚Äôt used to being felt up so much and that he should tone it down a little.  Regardless, congratulations!",False,False

Girl, he's just attracted to you! I know it can be hard to fathom when your ED makes you hate your body, but there is literally no reason to think he's a chubby chaser. An ED will make you think fat is an inherent turn-off, but it doesn't work that way for most people. Especially when someone is in the process of getting it on...body features that aren't necessarily a personal or general ""preference"" can start seeming great just because they're attached to a particular person at a particular moment.",False,False

Meanwhile, he may see you as normal weight because society's perception of normal weight is skewed anyways. Or maybe he does see you as less skinny, but doesn't care.  And if he is a chubby chaser, so what? Confrontation may ruin your relationship at a higher chance than if you lost weight.  It may just be your eating disorder talking. Classic ED sabotage lol. Or maybe instead of sabotage it's that you're just out of your comfort zone and want to revert (another classic ED behaviour).   BTW-- congrats on your relationship!!! You've accomplished what I can't. Lol. I've not allowed myself to do literally anything with guys because I ""only deserve to be in a relationship if I'm skinny""... you've done the impossible. Be happy!",False,False
