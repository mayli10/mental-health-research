I have a health issue, I started to get into alternative health when conventional doctors couldn’t help me at all. I know a lot of people are skeptical of non-traditional medicine, but I started working with an osteopath and I’ve had so much improvement from the course of non-prescription supplements he recommended for me. I try my best to stay as healthy as I can while restricting, and my quality of life has improved so much over the past few years due to my regimen. Mood-enhancing nootropics (especially Kratom &amp; Phenibut) have also done wonders for my mental health; I used to have a substance abuse problem and I’m grateful that I’ve found far healthier alternatives.   My husband got us an infrared sauna for Christmas and I really enjoy using it! It’s supposed to help with detoxing, improve circulation/skin and boost metabolism - and regardless if it lives up to those claims, the heat is super helpful for relaxing my muscles (I frequently overexercise to the point of soreness) and it makes an immediate positive impact on my mood.   I’m obsessed with trying to look youthful for as long as possible (I’m 31), and since I can’t afford the plastic surgery/injectables I want, I’ve designed my nutrition and supplement regimen to hopefully slow the aging process, and wanting to look good keeps me from going off the deep end with my restriction. In the past, I’d occasionally get a facial or injectables, but didn’t have a solid skincare/beauty regimen; nowadays, I’m really into clean beauty and do several masks a week and apply Living Libations Rose Best Skin Ever (the best beauty oil I’ve ever used... it’s like liquid gold) religiously. Aging used to be a huge fear, but I feel more optimistic now that I take better care of myself.",False,False
