It gets good to great reviews for MDD but unfortunately my depression wasn’t responding to it. It definitely mildly helped my ADD, despite it not getting the most overwhelming positive reviews for that indication, though. What I really liked about it is that I could *tell* what it was and wasn’t helping me with. For a lot of other medicines it’s almost fully  guess work early on lol",False,True

So a drug for mood improvement + appetite &amp; weight control + addiction treatment + impulsiveness w/ inattentiveness + possible behavioral issues = all in one med which theoretically should be good for BED  ***Breakdown***  Inhibits Serotonin Reuptake — *Think among the lines of many typical antidepressants do. These drugs were actually made to be an extension of SSRIs. Ex. Prozac.*   Inhibits Norepinephrine Reuptake — *These drugs are also an extension of SNRI’s like  Atomoxetine/ Strattera, Effexor, &amp; sibutramine*  Inhibits Dopamine Reuptake — *adds dopamine reactions to SNRIs+SSRIs. A lot of ADHD medications and amphetamines in general do this so imagine all three working together*   ***  Antidepressant effect can help by mitigating depression which is a common catalyst for some of someone’s binge eating episodes. Vyvanse isn’t indicated for depression  SNRIs are utilized  as atypical antidepressants. Some have are prescribed for obesity, pain, adhd (*especially primarily inattentive*), OCD, and menopausal symptoms.  ADHD medications, including Vyvanse, decrease appetite and increase response inhibition (impulse control) in the short and long term.   ***  **other**  •Unlike Vyvanse this doesn’t seem to be a prodrug so it shouldn’t take 2hours to kick in  •Related: Drugs like bupropion which are prescribed for depression and smoking cessation (*habit breaking?*) do step 2 &amp; 3. It inhibiting norepinephrine reputable and **weakly** inhibits dopamine reuptake so I’f you want you can also Kinda think of SNDRIs as medicines formed by ‘combining’ SSRIs + SNRIs + enhanced NDRIs",False,True
