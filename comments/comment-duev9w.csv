I went into heart failure and got dizzy and ill and got the beginnings of osteoporosis from high-restricting.   You’ll get the same effects.  I also exercised obsessively, so I know that sped up the process.   If you aren’t exercising and eating 1500 a day, you may be in the clear.   But yes, I’m in recovery and it’s been a lot of peanut butter, whole wheat bread, mini wheats, clif bars, and dark chocolate to get in enough calories.",False,False

Like maybe have a chocolate bar or some chips? And then the meal replacement shakes can help get the vitamins you're missing from food as they already do.,False,False

I’m mostly drinking ensure, when it comes to food I’ll feel full after a couple bites and I can’t make myself eat past that.",False,True

EDIT: It is understandable to struggle to eat after restricting because it's a huge shock to your body. As long as you get enough nutrients and eat until you're full I think you will be fine until you can get professional help. You're not still losing weight, right?",False,False
