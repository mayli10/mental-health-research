What happens is it dehydrates that portion of your body so you kinda sweat out a little extra more than usual making it appear like you’ve lost weight. It works short term if you’re trying to de-bloat but it’s not a long term thing at all. Plus you can really throw off your electrolytes if you do it too long/often. It’s similar to what people accomplish by running with extra sweatshirts or trash bags on, or going to the sauna constantly! Short term yes, long term sadly not. ",False,False

You'd get 'results' by using just the plastic wrap, but a corset, waist trainer, or even a back brace would work better. The Vicks has nothing to do with it. ",False,False
