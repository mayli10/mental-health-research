I always wanted to go into communications/marketing but I thought I was too fat/ugly in college to even think about it. So I stuck with a computer science degree since I liked computers and techy stuff anyway. Don‚Äôt really regret it and I‚Äôm much more confident now (lol I also lost a bunch of weight) than I was back in high school when I was choosing a degree. I also realized that I‚Äôm not shitty at what I do so that also helps. ,False,False

I've had disordered eating since I was a child (hiding and eating cans of frosting by the spoon when everyone was asleep), but my BED flared up in 2nd year of uni, now bulimic since my 3rd year of uni.  I currently work 9-5 days doing research. For once in my life, restricting feels intuitive, it's scary. People eat whenever they want, there's no official lunch hours. When I'm with my friends at lunch, I just tell them I do intermittent fasting (which is true) and they're fine with it.  I have an endless supply of tea, coffee and gum. I'm cold 25/8 because of the damn aircon, being super sedentary and restricting ofc.  When I get home though, it's harder. Even if I tell myself I can have 1 small thing, or large volume of low cal things, it triggers a b/p for me. I hate how it's all or nothing mentality.  It's ironic that I'm doing medicine and I know all the dangers and consequences of ED. But I have to remind myself it's a disorder, it's an addiction.",False,False

I can easily over exercise and be seen as diligent and hardworking   And nobody really notices if I under eat either because I‚Äôm not in a sport that‚Äôs considered a high risk for eating disorders.  I do find I have to high restrict in order to keep up with training and competing but I‚Äôm well aware at some point the weight loss will equate to strength loss instead of performance gain and I‚Äôll have some issues but it hasn‚Äôt happened yet so let‚Äôs ignore it right ? ,False,False

Idk i always wanted to help people and its my kind of population. I can blame my relapse weight and this job and the stress of my divorce. Everyone knows i spend my lunch break smoking off the institution and they see me eat candy and when we have work lunches I eat so they think i can just eat anything and lose weight.   So my ED really had no place in my chosen occupation. My job just makes it easier to fast. Which is incredibly dangerous considering the fact i work with highly unstable violent offenders and the place I work at has a piss poor rehabilitative attitude. Idk I guess my death wish keeps me there?,False,False

However then the stress makes me want to b/p as soon as I get home.

So I work 32 hours a week, research (and most biology fields) are not sedentary jobs. Im on my feet a lot of the day moving around the lab to different testing machines, microscopes, the insectory, ect.. I work with chemicals so no food or drink is allowed in the lab and its a closed off part of the building so Im not constantly passing the kitchen. I also do a fair share of field work to set up testing sites throughout my parish (Lousiana equivelent to county).. which its very hot down here so I sweat and am boots deep in nasty ditches.

Also, the kids sometimes make comments about how I look, like one time this sweet 6 year old boy hugs me and goes ‚Äúwow you‚Äôre really skinny.

I have a lot of issues while restricting and/or purging because I feel physically too weak and dizzy for work.  HOWEVER, I used to work food service, and I can tell you, I am so happy to be surrounded with water all day rather than food. I used to binge every time when I worked at Subway. And while we do have treats at my pool for the kids sometimes, it's not everyday, and it's still wayyyyyyyyy easier to resist. Like, I think during all of summer last year, I only binged at work like once or maybe twice. At my old job, I'd binge like 75% of my shifts. On top of that, being in the pool all day honestly burns a lot of Calories, and it really helps with my under-developed glutes because my day-to-day job involves a lot of eggbeating rather than swimming laps with using my arms.  It's only a summer job though, but I definitely have motivation to keep in shape because of it. Because if I can't swim well/fast, I might get fired.",False,False
