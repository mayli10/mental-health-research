Seriously - healthy food can be nice. You may not find it so easy to eat 6000 calories of healthy food. Yes it’s bad to eat 6000cals of junk, it’s really really bad, but so is eating nothing. These are not the only two options.",False,False

It's our body's response to being so malnourished. And junk food is the easiest to go for. What my therapist has told me to do and what my friends have told me to do is the same, wait it out.   You will love yourself. You need so much energy to go to your brain now but before it can do that you need to weigh a good amount. I know how much it sucks to have that BMI near the upper end of underweight/ lower end of normal. I dread that BMI of 18. But it's inevitable. This is what our bodies are meant to be like and acceptance is what you have to try and obtain.   You won't be eating like this forever, your body will become normal again you just have to let this run its course. If it makes you feel any better, i've been literally binging (or maintaining, but literally never less) for the past month/month and a half and really only gained 7kg. so most of what you have now is water weight and your body trying to hold onto everything. In the long run you wont hold onto all that. Yes, you look more bloated, yes you feel fat, but that is those numbers speaking. Your friends and family dont see that I promise. I ask my boyfriend all the time ""am i getting chubby, i gained 1 pound, am i getting fat omg i gained 5 pounds"".   Now I know this is tough, but my biggest recommendation is to get rid of the scale. I still sometimes look for the scale my mom hides and secretly weigh myself. But i only end up depressed for the rest of the day. You need to take an active role in your recovery honey, you will be okay. Focus on school, relationships, tv series, etc. and forget your weight because it is literally just us who are so obsessed with it. ""normal"" people dont make this the center of their lives. Once you find a way to do that, you will be ok. I promise.   You've been restricting so so much and your body is finally getting what it wanted all this time. It wont stop no matter how much you try to stop it. Your body sees it has a constant supply so it'll force you. And thats a good thing. Let it pass. You will be able to do the 3 meal plan and you will be happy. Please feel free to message me if you need anymore support because I am going through this exact same thing.  And genuinely, even after typing all of this, im still terrified because i feel obese. But it's okay. we will be okay and recovery isnt going to be like this forever. Much love &lt;3 please just try to go about your days with your head somewhere other than deep inside your intrusive thoughts, you got this. Rant all you need, it helps. If you need someone to reassure you its okay and gaining permanent weight is harder than people make it out to be, let me know! So many recovering anorexics actually find it HARD to gain weight, even with binging. So stop worrying please!!",False,False
