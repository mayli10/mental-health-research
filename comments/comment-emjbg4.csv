But she talks about weight 24/7. And then, when I visited her, she point blank says to me 'how's your weight loss going' like who even says that to someone??? That was just such an awful thing to say. And we're in our late 20s like you should know better by now imo   But. I will think about it. Thanks for the reply, I didn't really think about it in the way. I just don't want her to talk about it every single day. Or, if I bring something up, she dismisses it. But maybe yeah cuz she doesn't know how to approach it... Hmmm   I'm sorry though that you recently lost a friend! :(",False,True

Tell her what's wrong and let her know what she could do better but don't cut her off just yet.,False,False

Like thanks I want to think about how much I hate myself thanks   I'm thinking about ending one friendship because she's supposed to be my best friend and I've bulimia before and then she just triggers me almost daily.
