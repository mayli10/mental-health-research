When I met my boyfriend around October, I told myself that with how happy he made me, I didn't deserve to have mental health issues anymore and from 100 to 0 recovered physically. Which is stupid, I know, but he never really realized that I didn't do the mental part of recovery until I acknowledged it and told him. He's incredibly supportive though, just scared of anything happening to me.  I do better around him, I ate fries every other day, fatty foods, salads drenched in a dressing with olive oil and honey.. I felt guilty still, looked at my body begrudgingly, felt more comfortable when I skipped a meal, but it became easier. Went from pretty underweight to barely healthy. He genuinely rid me of almost all my body dysmorphia and made me believe I was beautiful.  Lately though, the body dysmorphia has been creeping up again, and I realize that I exchanged anorexia for it's complete opposite. I gave too little fucks about food, I ate like shit so I could distract myself from the fact that I felt fat. So I've made the decision to let myself go back to anorexia for the time being. Life is just too hard to fight that fight too right now.  But with the knowledge and support I have this time, I'll figure out how to actually recover. Because I genuinely believe that there is an out, and that with the right support system and the right ways, you will be able to be happy with your body. Even if you see thin people, even if you see models on Instagram, there's a point where you will be happy with yourself. Because I am already, in some way. And I'm still anorexic! :D",False,False

I know it’s addictive but try stay away from things like Instagram and thinspo - you identify them as triggers into relapsing and they’re making ill.  You’ve come a long way and are doing amazing so far! ⭐️  I’m not sure if the guilt from eating goes away completely but I know for the majority it gets better with time. I’m finding it hard not to relapse at the moment but I’m thinking of things like my heart and blood pressure which are weak as hell - think about your health in general and how your body is healing and getting stronger.,False,False
