I eat cabbage soup for lunch then broccoli, red pepper, shredded carrots and some type of protein for dinner. I lose about .5 lb to 1 a day. I feel full. My MIL definitely has an eating disorder and she eats 80 cal yogurt, oatmeal with Splenda, then regular dinner (well-portioned of course).",False,False

Tempeh is my new favorite snack to keep on hand, because unlike tofu, it has good texture &amp; taste for eating raw &amp; room temp. (I like tofu too but I don't like it slimy and cold, it's not something I can just throw in my lunchbox)",False,False

I know nut butters are a fear food for some though. just making sure you eat enough fat should help a ton. but also your period coming soon very likely has something to do with it too! I have the same problem.",False,False
