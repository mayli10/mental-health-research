Itâ€™s so funny, Iâ€™m really active on this sub from another account and this is my first post from this one and itâ€™s about getting better. I feel like a switch flipped. Iâ€™m not all better but Iâ€™m better enough to realize I can get past this! I hope this sticks.    Again thank you so so so much &lt;3",False,True

Youâ€™re so much more than your ED, itâ€™s just a small part of you. Sometimes it will seem larger than it really is. I think a lot of people will feel like theyâ€™re ED is all of their time and hobbies but I think it is jus recovering up peopleâ€™s true selves not replacing it.   Best luck I hope you can stay healthy and kick your eating disorderâ€™s ass!",False,False
