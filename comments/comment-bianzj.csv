I've seen exactly ONE other post or comment that briefly mentioned having accidents. I'm 29 with no kids and have been purging for about 10 years. This developed within the past year. It makes sense with such extreme physical strain being put on your body for so long. It's embarassing but if I can stop just one person from starting down this road it's worth it!
