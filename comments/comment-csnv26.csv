For my program I go 8am-3pm (but they have 12pm-8pm as well). They control breakfast, a snack, and lunch plus all my therapies and activities (both individual and group).  I start Tuesday so I'll have more info after that but basically my intake assessment therapist said IP but I said it would be too much to take me away from my support network. This is ""one step down"" from IP for my program.",False,False
