Especially with medical conditions causing, love and compassion. You deserve to be on this planet just as much as anything else does. Your boyfriend loves YOU because you are you. If you can, have him write down why he loves you. I know it can be hard because sometimes people who don’t love themselves ask “why” all of the time. If it’s an option, explain to him that yes, you want validation but you’re trying something. Keep that list in your pocket, or on your mirror for anytime you need to know why you’re loveable. It’s ok to look at it a hundred times a day, it’s ok to keep it in a drawer to look at next year. I’m sorry for what you’re going through, I’m sorry if this is unwelcome advice.",False,False
