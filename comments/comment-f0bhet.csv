Thank God I‚Äôm on my mom‚Äôs insurance until I turn 26 this year and she works at a really big hospital so at least I have a lot of resources and can just switch doctors by just making an appointment online. I didn‚Äôt even think about the fact that not everyone has that.,False,True

They never show any reaction. My primary care literally wrote in his notes that there was ‚Äúno significant weight damage‚Äù  Because 35 pounds in less than a month is insignificant? This is why people die from this. Because no one believes us.,False,True

And with that could come a different cardiologist. I‚Äôm so sorry they treat you this way, they‚Äôre both wrong and unprofessional. I‚Äôm glad that your therapist and psychiatrist are good people though. Those can be hard to find! Sending you hugs üíú",False,False

The need to prove ourselves to people, health professionals no less, feels terrible... I don‚Äôt know why people don‚Äôt believe.   &gt;!About a week ago, I went to the ER (not ED related) and they took my weight. The nurse seemed almost.. unimpressed? I don‚Äôt know what word to describe her expression and behavior. It felt like I was disgusting. The doctor who saw me was nice but I have an appointment at the same hospital next week and I‚Äôm determined to restrict and then fast until that day. I don‚Äôt want to be met with the same look again, I want them to see the differences in my chart and be shocked...!&lt;",False,False
