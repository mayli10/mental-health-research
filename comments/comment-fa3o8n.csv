Why does any of it really matter? But it does in today’s world. You can get really far in life just by being pretty (hence social media). That’s all that matters. It’s so disheartening.,False,False

When we get to a place where we dont care about our appearance as our top priority, we stop caring about society’s often negative, never-enough opinion and start seeing others differently as well. Or at least I assume so.",False,False

Don't want a repeat of that, and ESPECIALLY can't handle people telling me to eat. But if I wanna date someone healthy/positive who will encourage me, so I have to be the same. (Just ignore the fact that dropping weight at the rate I want is not healthy but...).",False,False

In the end girls and guys all go for attractive partners. Even people who are overweight demand “fit” partners.   Personally I always saw myself with a beautiful partner as well so it’s fair that the woman want the same.,False,False
