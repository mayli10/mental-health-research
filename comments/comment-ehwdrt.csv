I like not having it as I find periods to be an annoyance, but am glad to have it back and hope that it means my hormones are fixing themselves, as my bones are fucked due to this.",False,False

I love when I lose it.  I know it’s fucked, but it’s a sick validation for me that when I lose my period *that means I must be doing something right*.",False,False

It’s back again now that I’ve started eating (regularly) again but now they’re always super short like 1-3 days and super light flow when they used to be 7 days with heavy bleeding so honestly I’m worried I’ve damaged something down there or my body didn’t heal completely idk.,False,False
