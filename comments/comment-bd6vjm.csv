And I completely understand not publicly giving out account information, especially with such personal subjects. I definitely wouldn’t want anyone to give mine out without asking. I’m not super familiar with the Instagram ED community but I’m going to check it out. Thank you for pointing me in the right direction",False,True

They are smaller accounts and mostly locked/private so I’m not comfortable posting @s, but I would definitely recommend getting involved with the people in that community who also deal with chronic illness (nb not the ones who get posted in subs like r/illnessfakers tho since they are not likely to have many friends among the genuinely sick people), and it shouldn’t be too hard to ask around quietly and find the accounts I have in mind. I’m sure you can understand why I am a bit hesitant to list off the names of private accounts on a more private and “medical” topic, but I also really do want you to find the support you need! Sorry I can’t be more direct - I hope this helps a bit and that others comment too.",False,False
