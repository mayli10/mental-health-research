I've found the maple waffle one is super easy to overcook because the syrup part straight up melts, but also one of the most delicious and unique flavors. ",False,False

They are expensive but I'll sometimes have one for lunch at work. $2 apiece and 200 cal isn't bad compared to a lot of stuff I can find since I work at a grocery store. I usually try to bring lunch, but sometimes I run out of time or i'm lazy. I gotta eat at work, unfortunately, what I do there is usually pretty tiring. ",False,True

If you've taken it off since you bought it, you could try google searching walmart, Amazon, wherever,  for your microwave brand and type and seeing if you can find one that looks just like yours and what watt it is.

I want to try baking into cookies like I have seen people do - they'll stick less to parchment right? If I wasn't on a budget rn I'd buy some. They are sooo good but expensive (money and calorie-wise).,False,False

There's like a 1-2 second microwave time difference between slightly melty deliciousness and goopy overcooked blob that expands like a microwaved Marshmallow Peep.  Play around with it and your microwave time. Usually for me on a 1000 watt microwave I do 1/3 of a bar at a time for about 7 seconds, or 10 seconds on an 800 watt microwave. ",False,False
