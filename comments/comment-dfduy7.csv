It’s a good idea to think about what is needed from telling. I hadn’t really thought about ‘what’s next’ other than all the bad things I might be thought of.",False,True

You can get your support elsewhere; an ED is not something to bring into the professional sphere.   And I would also be highly concerned about the outcome of that potential promotion. I think you've got the idea about them seeing it as a potential hindrance to your job performance, and passing the promotion to someone else.   Get support for it, just not at work.",False,False

I thought about all the ways I react to different things, and how the stress can be reduced. Then I specifically said what would help. It prevented the conversation opening up to behaviours and details I didn't want to discuss, and it made sure others knew how to recognise when I needed support even if I couldn't quite recognise it myself.   I know it's a really difficult thing to do, especially when promotion is involved, but if you're in a supportive environment then I think it's great to be acknowledging that you need a bit of help with certain things, or to do things a bit differently. It shouldn't hold you back, and people should respect you for it.   Give me a shout if I can help with planning what to say.",False,False
