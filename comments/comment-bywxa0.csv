I gave in to the urge a couple weeks ago after almost a month clean and havemt gone more than a few days without purging. If you want to pm me and see if I have anything to say that cant help resolve your strength, feel free. I definitely would love to complain, lol",False,False

Try to resist it. It eventually gets better. For me it’s a stress thing so I have had random occurrences during bad times but I’m kinda 6 months clean (as in there have been one offs but no proper relapse) Just hold on okay.  But remember if it does happen - one fuck up can be just one. It doesn’t have to mean you’ve ruined all your progress. Sometimes things get a bit worse before they get better but if you’re doing your best you’re doing your best. I know in the ED community we tend to have an all or nothing mindset but if you’ve been clean a long time having an urge doesn’t make you relapsed. You’re still recovering. It takes time. I probably made this all about me but I hope this helped in someway.  During stressful times the urge definitely does get very intrusive in my brain but I’ve built a tolerance and ive never looked back days later and gone “god I wish I b/p on Friday”,False,False

I was actually doing alright for a good bit of time, for the first time in a long time actually, but lately a number of things are stirring up my binge-purge tendencies. God I wish it would just piss off and leave me alone",False,False
