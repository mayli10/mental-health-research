I have been b/ping like at least 3 times a day for a while. But everything was so empty to me because I kinda muted my emotions out.    I've just confessed about it with my bf and everything I numbed out came at once. I had the biggest panic attack ever for years. My bf watched me through the video call and it was painful for both of us. I know if he hadn't been watching, I would follow the urges to cut my wrist because I couldn't stand the pain my ED brings everyday like this anymore.   Thankfully I'm calmed down now. ",False,False

Just try to keep in your mind your goal weight and that bingeing will only put you further away from it every time you want to binge.,False,False
