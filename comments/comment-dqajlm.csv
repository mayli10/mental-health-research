I think all of us here are at least a little bit obsessed with food, lol, and technically love it, which is why it's the ultimate control.  I put on like 45 fucking lbs in 4 months after a really bad depressive bout ended and I was able to actually eat (and enjoy) food again. The next time I had a two week trip with the massive depressoboys, I just ate and ate and ate carbs and beer to try to dull the existential pain and boy that was a lot less sexy of a result but I think it probably helped me feel better faster because I was staying nourished.",False,False

I remember years ago a friend and I went out and ate the same thing for two days. I had gained 5-6 lbs. She gained nothing. I was so upset. Now I could eat those same things and maybe gain a pound or nothing at all. And even after a day or two of normal eating, the weight goes back to normal.",False,False

When I go through those periods I try not to keep much food in the house and make sure it’s boring food.   Trying to keep my hands busy with something or going out anywhere helps too. Sometimes our body is overeating to compensate for all the time we restricted. Sometimes is bc something is bugging us deep down. Sometimes it could be excitement about food (like your fave dinner or holidays or gatherings). Sometimes it’s just boredom too (my friends who don’t have EDs do that a lot).   I know it sounds stupid but work really hard on faking confidence and a positive attitude. Try to talk to yourself as a friend does. For me, going through this subreddit and giving advice to things people post has helped me.   Good luck with it all. Its the part of recovery and EDs and life that I hate so much. I’m so sorry.",False,False

I can't cope with seeing myself lose control and not even WANTING to do something abt it because hey at least i get a fuller face and a normal metabolism! I am going to be starting the gym too soon so hopefully that'll motivate me to be more moderate. Literally I use recovery as an excuse to binge. It's confusing me and my body so much. I am now permanently bloated and look 9 and a half months pregnant. And i still don't want to stop eating. It's like my body is saying ""yaay we get to eat now? Give me everything"". Almost like i'm compensating it for all those days I starved. I regret restricting so much because it's got me to this.",False,False
