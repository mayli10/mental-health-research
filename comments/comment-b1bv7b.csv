He only eats when he is hungry and doesn't even really care about the taste as long as it gets him full. I wish I had the magic gift he was blessed with lmao,False,False

I have zero appetite and food is a complete turn off and a chore.   It's especially troublesome when I'm stressed or busy. I'll go multiple days without thinking about it and skip into in alternate reality from ""fasting.""After a few days I get loopy and other logics pop up. ""I dont need food"" ""I'm so poor...if I dont NEED food..."" but mostly ""I just dont feel like it""  As a result, while most doctors will admit I have SOME kind of food issue they also think I'm lying or in denial about something. The idea that I'm NOT motivated by a fear of fatness does not compute.   As a result, therapists usually insist that I'm just stressed. Because stress typically causes people to neglect eating for weeks and the answer is totally to just take a bath and chill out.  20 years like this and so one can help me.",False,False

I would realize I needed to eat I was just too lazy to ever cook anything so I’d rather just not eat. Probably stemmed from never having food at home as a kid and having to wait til my mom got home at 10 to make us food,False,False

I have an ED but on days where I sleep 8 hours and then work an insane 12 hour shift where i barely even have a chance to pee, it is very easy for me to absolutely forget about food. I'm not just talking days where I'm at work standing around but the work day is long, though. Then I'm standing at work and totally agonizing over it. I'm just talking about those days where I'm running all over and barely have a chance to think about anything other than work related shit.   And I def have a food complex. So it makes sense that people who don't have issues with it could so easily forget. ",False,False

Is it sports, music, girls... like what is filling the space in his mind if he's not thinking about calories or where his next meal is coming from? He just said 'idk' like don't tell me that, please give me a window into your mind.",False,True

I think it has to do with how they grew up, like how much importance his family placed into food. Things like always stocking the pantry, cooking, eating together. Maybe there wasn’t much focus around food growing up also due to his cultural background and what they value/ spend more time on. I just find it so fascinating how people can live such stress free life around food. ",False,False
