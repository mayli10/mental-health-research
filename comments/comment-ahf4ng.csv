Eating at maintenance doesn’t feel good mentally, but rationally I know it won’t make me gain. It’s helped me come down from the panic of binging when I didn’t actually eat beyond a normal, sane amount.   On days where I feel more urgency to restrict, I use my BMR as my limit.  On bad days where I feel like I need to punish myself, the limit doesn’t really have a number, but it’s low and miserable. ",False,False
