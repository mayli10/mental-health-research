Here's what I've noticed:  Older people have a poor understanding of mental illness because it's a relatively new concept that didn't ""exist"" during their generation.  Things like depression, anxiety, addiction, eating disorders didn't even have a name during their generation, so they couldn't possibly begin to understand them if there wasn't even a diagnosis for it.  This causes them to see disordered behaviors as surface level physical ailments. It does not even occur to them to think ""oh this behavior is part of a bigger picture of disordered habits stemming from a mental disorder.""   Instead they think to themselves ""That is Bob, he throws up a lot, that's his weird quirk. He should stop throwing up, but he doesn't for some reason."" ""That's Anna.  She sleeps 20 hrs a day and doesn't shower for weeks at a time.  How odd, maybe something is wrong with her nose, someone should teach her to tidy up."" So because they see things only for their symptoms they provide surface level solutions.  Throw up a lot? Don't eat in the first place. Just stop throwing up.  Take a pill for antacid. They struggle with the idea that it's not the /throwing up/ that's the problem.  They don't understand it's a symptom for something greater, like maybe it's the person's coping mechanism to externalize an internal pain (depression, trauma, identity suppression, etc.).  What's interesting is that the older person who's lacking empathy often suffers from some mental issues themselves... and they just don't see it.  ""Oh, yes I get angry a lot and have a strong urges to punch walls and hit other people.  That's just being tough, not my unacknowledged trauma from how my own parents beat me.""  So because they just rough out their unhealthy behaviors, they expect others to do it too, not realizing how hurtful and toxic their own actions are to themselves and the people around them.  ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø",False,False

Sorry you had to read the comment too though x  Giving her an article seems like a good idea, although I feel like she'd read it but it wouldn't ""click"" with her. I want to paint a picture of the bulimic mentalities but I agree, I'd prefer not to make myself too vulnerable.  I find that giving an example of ""normalised"" addictive habits/behaviours has helped with other people- like using ""binge watching youtube"" as an example (eg. knowing it's wrong, feeling captivated yet dissociated, regretting it afterwards) to a teen who asked me and that seemed to really click for them.

Just reading it myself, made me feel sick and down on myself - so again I'm awfully sorry.  I know you want to educate her, and I admire that. Personally, I'm not sure I would respond, but that wouldn't help others better understand what we go through. Maybe a good option would just be something simple like, eating disorders are a mental illness, they are hard to understand unless you have experienced it, and everyone's experience is different. Here is an article that explains more about bulimia (insert an article you find informative) - not sure how helpful this is but maybe keeping things less personal and more generally informative is less vulnerable for you and somewhat helpful to her, although not sure how much will get through.",False,False
