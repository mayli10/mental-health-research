And I feel, just like I always used to, like a failure for not being able to restrict ‚Äúproperly.‚Äù (And I also feel like I need to justify myself &amp; say: it hasn‚Äôt *always* been this way; there also have been times when I‚Äôve just restricted.)  Anyway. I keep telling myself I‚Äôm gonna try intuitive eating and see if it helps. But there‚Äôs also a bit of me that‚Äôs clinging on to the idea that I might be able to make restricting work this time, if I just don‚Äôt restrict too severely. (But in reality the binging, I think, has much more to do with the mental set of restricting, and less at this point with the actual amount of food I‚Äôm eating.)  Anyway the whole thing is dumb and bad",False,False
