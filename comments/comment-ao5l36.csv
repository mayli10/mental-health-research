Therapists know they can't force any type of behavior. It would be pointless to try. They're there to work with you in a way that works for you.  While you don't feel ready to stop restricting, I'd encourage you to have conversations about it anyway. Why you do it, how it makes you feel, etc.",False,False

For example, I have extreme anxiety around travelling because it takes me away from my routine and my safe foods, but I used to love travelling and I want to get back to being able to enjoy it, so that’s what we’re working on right now. Her only requirement is that I’m physically “healthy”, ie, that my organs are all working okay. She can’t ethicallynwork with me if my body is failing. At a bmi in the 20s you should be fine in that regard. ",False,False

It's better that I have a place to be honest about my behaviours than try to keep them all secret, you know? I think most good therapists have this outlook, as long as you're not in imminent danger.",False,False
