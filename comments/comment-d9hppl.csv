I have every single thing I’m going to eat, every day, restriction and binge, mapped out in detail up until the end of the year. It’s very reassuring to know everything is so solid so far in advance. The worst thing about binging for me was the feeling of losing of control, and I never feel like that anymore.",False,False

I used to be able to restrict for a really long time without binging but I guess it's okay that it's different now.,False,True

Most of the time it come with a little bit of guilt and regret but mostly the feeling you describe of relief at being able to get comfortably back into restriction. It’s like finally being able to sneeze after feeling the sensation build up for ages.,False,False
