We are all fat :P all jokes aside I totally get the skinny lazy thing. Being lazy makes me thin. I’m vegan so if I want anything close to what I ate before then it takes a lot of time. So it’s either eating the random crackers in my bed, making a salad, or cooking a full meal. Crackers or a salad with a fresh packed bowl of Mary Jane usually wins haha! Skinny people either work really hard I’ve noticed... or are too lazy to cook/eat/clean! ",False,False

I'm naturally thin and lived with a BF for two years who was naturally husky from birth. When we'd eat ice cream or have a cheat weekend, my body hardly changed (although I was freaking out about it) but you could tell that he gained weight almost immediately. But I didn't love him any less for it, he was a beautiful person and very attractive. All of our bodies are different.",False,False
