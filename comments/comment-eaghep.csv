With me working and excessively exercising. Idk, I had normal blood sugar this whole last year but now that I know the symptoms of what happened I can think of a handful of times this has happened since I developed my ED. Including a car accident and a time I thought I fell down the stairs but couldn’t remember it.   Turns out I need to listen to my body more :(",False,True

I have been seeing a doctor to keep an eye on my labs over the last year in recovery but hadn’t looked at mine from the last time I was in pre-relapse. Turns out, even when I wasn’t fasting, my glucose was &lt;60 when 70-100 is the normal range.   I ended up, on my way to see my dietitian Tuesday morning, having a hypoglycemic episode and seizure while driving and wrecked my car. We rescheduled for today, meaning it’s been 3 weeks since she last saw me so it was a lot for her to take in. She didn’t actually kick my ass lol   It was an oddly heart warming response because it was her way of saying she was really upset by all of this.",False,True
