I think shed be worried if I binged, not due to what or how much I was eating but my mental state or physical state getting me to that point. That all logically makes sense to me and I believe that for the most part its just that tiny voice that says ""nah that aint it"" which is probably just me projecting cause i feel like a fraud myself.",False,True
