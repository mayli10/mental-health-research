I arrived to work on Monday. It hadn’t been a very good weekend.   When I came into work on Monday the person who does the cleaning for the office (Who also buys the coffee, tea, milk etc.) greeted me with a cup of coffee. I thanked her and as usual on a Monday we compared our weekends.  Chatting for a while, I placed my cup in the washing machine.  TO MY HORROR, A NEW BRAND OF COFFEE SAT ON THE COUNTER. The new coffee she had bought had no nutritional value no KCAL’s or calorific value.   I blurted out “theirs no nutritional value, theirs no fucking nutritional value.”  My mind splintered and I felt trapped. My thoughts spiraled. Trisha looked at me and asked “Yo’ alright.” “Yeah fine, Monday. Just in a bad mood sorry” I said composing myself on the outside.   I know Trisha for years and she always thought, I was a bit mad, eccentric, a fussy eater. She just smiled and left me to my thoughts. I spiraled into my internal mad vengeful, raged filled thoughts.   Sitting at my desk I just kept thinking. I need to walk this off, I need to take control of this situation. I need to get back in control.  As soon as the clock struck 12. I took an early lunch and walked and walked and walked. Contented in the knowledge I would burn more KCALs then I consumed in the coffee.   Drinking a coffee by the canal (KCALs known). I tore pieces of bread and fed some swans as they drifted towards me. Thinking how I got like this.   Just thought I would share.",False,False
