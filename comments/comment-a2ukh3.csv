I think people stare at me because i look like a freak and they want to work out ""what"" i am.   I try not to think about it but is pretty annoying sometimes and happened since i was a kid. It made me really shy and self  concious ",False,False

You're so cool! I wanna hang out with you! You're so pretty! It took years for me to be able to accept a compliment. My worst fear is still bei g that socially awkward and ugly 12 year old.

Despite losing all the weight that kind of thing I find stays with you. I grew up thinking I was worthless and had no value because of my weight, which I didn’t know what to do about.   I generally feel overly sensitive about weight comments and it bothers me a lot when people make ‘fat’ jokes. I really don’t get how that’s socially acceptable. Jokes about eating disorders are the worst and the amount of ignorance regarding them are really sad. ",False,False

It was when I started noticing people literally stopping and staring that I realized I was pretty. Take pride in it for sure. Just be aware that confidence will attract people even more. I try to smile at people when they look at me. That part is harder lol. Im really happy you are noticing this though. You’re realizing you’re special!,False,False

My “dad” would tell me it was because I wore too much makeup but one day this man walked up to us and said you have very beautiful daughters. Years later, it still happens and I take pride in it.
