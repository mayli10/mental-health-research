With your expert, keep in mind they expect to be the expert and you the student. Your interest in their topic is probably invigorating to them as they are probably often surrounded by people who are tired of listening to them talk about the same topic.   You will be a delight to talk to because it’s something you’re passionate about, even if your brain farts and you forget everything you know.   Try to find a way to stay in this moment.  Look around. Describe to yourself what you see as you take deep breaths. Say to yourself four or five true things. “The walls are painted white. The carpet is soft on my feet. The window is closed. Etc.” this will help ground you in the now. But the key is deep slow breaths.   You’re going to get through this. ",False,False
