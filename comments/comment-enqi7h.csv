The waiting lists are long and there isn't much in terms of specialist support. Though that is not to say it's certainly possible to benefit from engagement with your local team.  Usually, in the first meeting, you'll chat with either a clinical psychologist or a psychiatric nurse where you'll go over stuff like your personal details, confidentiality, why you're seeking support from the team, and a physical assessment to include your vital signs, blood sample, height and weight, etc. then you can discuss what you'd like in terms of support like CBT, supported meal planning, group motivational therapy. Depends on your local provisions.  Honestly, the worst part of the initial assessment is sitting in the waiting room trying not to make awkward eye contact with everyone else...",False,False

It’s incredibly frustrating.  The only reason I got rushed for CBT therapy was because my psychiatric nurse felt I would actually die if I went to university without intense therapy.  I don’t want to discourage you from getting help, but with the strain the NHS is under right now you’d be lucky to get an appointment in 4 months. I waited for therapy from November to February and that was “rushed past the waiting list.”",False,False
