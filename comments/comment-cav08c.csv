Jokes aside, drink lots of water, get your electrolytes in (powerade zero or something), and please try to refrain from abusing [stimulant] laxatives as they damage your digestive system overtime and you will develop a dependence. If necessary, try milk of magnesia or a similar gentle laxative. Stay safe. 💕",False,False
