Plus has the best protein to calorie ratio that I've found.   I'm 90% vegan but need protein and non meat sources are crazy high calorie so started eating kangaroo.   They can't be farmed, but are harvested from wild populations with strict regulations and quotas. The code of practice that says death must be instant using a single bullet from a high-powered rifle to ensure it's humane.  As they are kind of a pest with a giant population they get culled anyway so eating them at least makes it slightly less of a waste.   Because they're not farmed it's also way better for reducing your carbon footprint too.    The upside of us eating a national symbol is we want to ensure it's as ethical and humane as it can be.",False,False

I've been vegan for 5 years, and idk about where you live but there are a ton of vegan restaurants/junk food options for planned binges (if you're into that). That would allow you to feel like you're binging with no restriction because you can eat vegan versions of your favorite foods. They can also be lower calorie than their non-vegan counterparts!  In terms of safe foods, tofu is a godsend! It's super cheap, can be seasoned any way you want, and is pretty low calorie! I'd make it your new chicken substitute. I'm a volume eater, and I love eating a shit load of vegetables when I want to mindlessly eat. You'll probably feel a lot better mentally/physically as well as psychologically.   You can totally do this. If you need any specific advice, feel free to PM me!",False,False

Its not as if you're ignoring your ethical/moral perspective and eating chicken anyway. You have an illness. Please try not to be too hard on, and blame yourself for your ED changing your dietary choices. Try to eat vegan meals when you can, and understand that your health comes first. Personally, I think its better that you eat chicken and don't restrict something you consider safe. Limiting your options, even to fit your viewpoint, is probably not a good idea when you're actively struggling with your ED.  Furthermore, I think from the things you think about yourself, the black and white, good and bad view of yourself is not going to be good for your health at all. Please try not to put yourself down because of your mental health. You're not bad, you're doing the best you can right now.",False,False

Veganism is HARD. people only say it's easy when they're trying to encourage other people to join them in their struggles lmao. And it's not for everyone, no matter what people say (for me- i have IBS and can't eat a lot of plant-based food so my options are limited) and maybe the worst thing about veganism is how black-and-white people make it out to be. Like you're either vegan or you're not. You're either pure or you're dirty. You can't be half vegan.  And that's fucked up! because when it comes to the ethical and environmental concerns of veganism, every bit helps.  So don't beat yourself up... just aim for... usually vegan! or as vegan as your illness will let you be. or call your diet ""plant-based!""  Personally I think the best choice people can make is to abstain from eating red meat. That's meat from mammals. Red meat production also has an unbelievable negative environmental impact because raising mammals uses soooooo muuuuch waaterrrrr. Chicken has not even a sixth of the impact as red meat, I believe! So don't think of yourself as wrong for eating chicken. Think of yourself as right for not eating red meat! you know? I think framing your choices positively helps.  And you can be proud of every vegan meal you eat instead of feeling bad for every nonvegan meal you eat.  Also, as a former chicken addict, I had a lot of success moving onto tuna instead! Something to consider! it's absolutely loaded with protein.",False,False
