I eat it hiyayakko-style, which is cold with soy sauce + wasabi and loads of spring onions (and usually bonito fish shavings but I don't like them). But you can add it to lots of different dishes, marinate it, press it, freeze + defrost it for a firmer texture, etc etc.  You could probably add some protein powder to that oatmeal without it affecting very much?",False,False

Make baked oatmeal by adding an equal amount of fruit puree(pumpkin &amp; banana are good) as oats and then add an egg white. Top it with yogurt like a cupcake and you got extra protein from that egg and the yogurt on top. (I prefer this bc plain oats have 0 texture and it feels like I'm eating thick water)  Kodiak pancake mix (I think 14g protein for 1/2 cup?) makes good microwave mug cakes. Top with....yogurt!  I have a huge sweet tooth lol",False,False

That way you wonâ€™t mind using powdered peanut butter on the other   Of course most of these wont work out if you dont want to spend time cooking food rather than just preparing it haha.
