Ten days is a huge achievement!!   Perhaps instead of having a binge reset the counter you could cumulatively count the days? So instead of going back to zero you just mark that day as not counting and continue the next day if that makes sense? So that you can see your progress still growing, because you’re never really starting from zero anyway- every bit of progress is progress that matters. It’s something my therapist told me to try for my self harm years ago, and I do it now for binge days.  I feel like I’ve absolutely failed at explaining that but I am really really sorry that you’re in this place and I hope you can find a way to pull yourself out.",False,False
