I'm in one of those phases right now and I do a bit of exercising and purge shit up sometimes but I'm still just maintaining weight it sucks,False,False

I totally get it's sick to actually think ""I wish I was still *really* anorexic"" but that doesn't stop me from feeling that way while shoving cookies and cereal into my mouth. I don't think I've related to post so much here in a long while. Definitely good to hear from someone like me.   The worst part is having fat person eating habits and anorexic thoughts and actions. Like I've just given up so much to the point where exercising is pointless because I'll gain it back within a week from binging. I used to love exercising and now just get more miserable from it. Definitely identify with you when you say it's just so much damn *effort.* Like damn man why restricting so hard. #Maladaptive daydreaming gang# Though maybe it might help you to know I'm in a much worse place than you lol (been going on ""ED switched off mode"" for 2 years and counting...still waiting for it to come back, not even sure if I still even have one. Honestly I've just accepted this is how it is now and I've given up).",False,False

I‚Äôve been in this odd between plce for a while now - and it could go either way, but the effort and energy to restrict or use behaviors is more than I can manage without neglecting my relationship or career.   -another 5‚Äô3‚Äù girl",False,False

But, I know my brain uses my ED to deflect tension around the uncontrollable problems in my life into something controllable, food intake. I‚Äôm currently dealing with a big problem my brain can‚Äôt handle, so I can recognize it‚Äôs turned off my restriction capacity so my stress and self-disgust can be focused around eating. I know it‚Äôs tricks, but god it‚Äôs killing me though. I just wanna go back to effortless days of gum and Diet Coke.",False,False

It tends to present pretty strongly when my general anxiety gets out of control (thankfully that is in control right now). This tends to happen in random bits throughout the year but, for the most part, I find the in-betweens oddly quiet.   Then, once my seasonal affective disorder is active, the ED becomes a lot more out of control because I no longer care about most things, become numb, and can no longer act on my values (because it feels like I don‚Äôt have any.)  But there have been a lot of random weeks or so in treatment where I‚Äôve gone to therapy and my therapist has asked about Ed and I‚Äôm like ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è who dat",False,False
