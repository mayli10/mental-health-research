I do find it interesting that she keeps up with some of her military habits but not the exercise?  I'm sorry but I'm not really sure why you are not having more success. ,False,False

In my case both gum and c/s is bad, because i chew gum to suppress an urge to binge - i'm pretty sure that isn't the healthy way to cope with a binge, just like binging on healthy foods promotes the disordered eating instead of trying to solve it. c/s is bad from pretty much the same perspective, it's disordered behavior that I do because of my fucking insane relationship with food.",False,False

Someone correct me if I'm wrong please!  I still chew gum sometimes to mask the keto/starvation breath or if I want some flavour but I don't do it often because of this. Also because I don't like people seeing me chewing... I think Oprah or someone mentioned it years ago that chewing gum just looks like you're chewing on a piece of steak or something and I can't NOT think about it now. Another thing to be self-conscious about haha UGH,False,False

Sugarless gum also protects your teeth by stimulating saliva production without giving mouth bacteria calories to multiply and cause cavities.",False,False
