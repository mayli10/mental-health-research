Bellies aren't typically flat because of your organs and gravity, but if it's that bad there may be something wrong. I don't recall where I've heard of belly pouches before however.",False,False

Nobody really has a flat belly unless they're flexing, but there's no way you should be a size 16. I would recommend getting tested by a doctor.",False,False
