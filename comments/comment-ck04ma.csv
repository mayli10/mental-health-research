Last year we went to a (drinking) festival where she kept buying tons of food and eating 2 bites of it and then giving it to our small group. Like bro, I don't want to eat all this crap. Then she didn't have money for alcohol - which is why we were there tbh. Ugh.   Honestly though lesson not learned because I'm going with her to the fair on Friday and she's already talking about all the food she wants to eat and I'm just like üôÉ",False,False

My first bf didn‚Äôt actually have an Ed but was so goddamn skinny it triggered me into diving deep into what was just slight restriction and dieting but then became the full blown bulimia I still have now (4 years later). My second boyfriend was the same, naturally unnaturally skinny.  The guy I was not-quite-dating-not-just-friends-with in college was anorexic. We got along great and never went out to eat (awesome!), but we did do a lot of drugs and I spiralled quickly downwards (not so awesome). We ended up both dropping out of school... sometimes I wonder if he‚Äôs okay. Sometimes I wonder if I‚Äôm okay.",False,False

She once told me that I can't restrict because it's my responsibility to make her feel like eating was okay. Needless to say that I understood what she meant, because I've always been a very helpful and caring person, but I just felt that she didn't care about my own eating disorder. Like hers was worse (it was) because she had it at a severity for longer than I did even if I had been dealing with my own for most of my life. Anyways, I still love her and wish her the best. EDs aren't easy and I don't blame her for anything she's done.",False,False

It‚Äôs also really exciting because I met her when she was heavily restricting and now I have seen her go through recovery. I have been mostly recovered for a couple years now but something about being around her when she was really underweight would bring up a little spark of this weird competitiveness. And we would always offer each other food and encourage each other to eat and most of the time, I was like this is great, she‚Äôs trying to support me. But other times that old ED voice would pop back in and say ‚ÄúNo, she‚Äôs trying to make you eat more than her and make sure you are fatter than her!‚Äù",False,False
