But I always like to dye my hair (mine is a little sad too right now) but getting better. I like to add in pastel pinks and purples. I use a touch of manic panic with a ton of conditioner or a mask to mix up a light color. It makes me feel fun and kinda cute. I also add in a few small extension pieces to add a little more volume. I dyed them like my hair so it looks natural with the colors and tone.   &amp;#x200B;  When I had a hair disaster ugghhh stylist. I got a really nice set of extensions and they made me feel so much better about myself. My hair was shoulder length but I got 18 inches and felt so good! I just got clip in ones so I could wash them desperately and give my head a break at night.   &amp;#x200B;  Also face masks are really nice!,False,False

One time I ballooned and all my clothes stopped fitting, which added to my nightmare. Nothing was fixed when I got clothes that fit, but I didn't want to kill myself as much every morning trying to get dressed.   &amp;#x200B;  If you bleached the fuck out of your hair (a) welcome to the club!!! We have cookies. (b) Invest in a hair mask. It's a 10 is my current favorite; there's a generic version from Sally's as well. (c) Get a good leave-in conditioner, same thing. I've been using a Sally's generic and it has done wonders. (d) If you can afford it, try Olaplex. It rebuilds the bonds in your hair, and I can honestly say Olaplex has improved my locks more than the rest combined. (e) If you use a blow dryer, use a heat protectant.      You aren't going to get good at makeup until you start using it. Invest in some dinky brushes and some W7 pallets from TJ Maxx and go to town on those pretty lil eyeballs of yours. Tbh makeup is 90% practice. I can't tell you how many times I ran around all day feeling pretty, only to get home and realize my face was a different color than my neck. But eventually I figured out less is more, etcetc. I've been using it for a few years and recently started getting high-end stuff. It's definitely worth it to experiment with drugstore and figure out what you want before you invest!   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;",False,False

If your hair is really dry, give it a deep conditioning mask.  I always feel better when my skin is soft, so lotion up!  If you find some article of clothing you think you look good in, buy it in lots of different colors!  I genuinely think beauty sleep is a thing, so if at all possible, try to make sure you're getting enough sleep. That shit is hard tho so just do what you can.  Trying to up your self confidence is really difficult! Maybe track things you've tried and what seems to work for you.

First off, wearing a pair of tight comfortable underwear that hug everything. Always makes me feel clean and  cute. (srsly the underpants are the most important first step) Pick out a lotion that you love the smell of and lather it up.  Then get dressed. even if its something basic like a sweater and jeans, it can feel nice to wear clean clothes. If you don't feel like make up, lotion up your face before you go out.

I don't know what color your hair is, but I have blonde highlights and like to use my purple shampoo on days like this too.  Some things that cost money, but not a whole lot: fake eyelashes.
