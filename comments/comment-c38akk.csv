Give it a few days, I bet most (if not all) of the weight will go down.",False,False

Bingeing makes her louder, restricting makes her louder. Restricting does make her louder - you reach a goal and she gives you another one. You 'fail' a tiny bit because the goal posts are so close together, and she's louder. You are strong, and don't let anything tell you otherwise. Doing the more compassionate thing for yourself is not going to be a sign of weakness either. But no doubt she'll tell you that.",False,False

She's messing with my head so much right now. Thank you for what you said. I just need that bitch to shut up. She's telling me I'm a failure and a fatass... I need to be strong sonehow,False,True

Your stomach is that basket. It's not fat. It's a basket of items. Be more angry that you binged, and be determined to work towards not doing it again (or at least for a very long time).   &amp;#x200B;  And listen, people survive blow out vacations, nights out, weddings etc where they really let go and eat/drink a shit ton, and they get away with it. So don't go crazy restricting - have sensible days, and I promise you will be OK.   &amp;#x200B;  If you're determined to diet, you need to do it in a way that is more positive. An angry resentful dieter, who is stressed AF and has zero self-worth, ALWAYS fails. Be the person you want to be - tell that voice, that this is just food and put that bitch in it's place.",False,False
