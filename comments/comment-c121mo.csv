If you ask me, it's pretty messed up that you can only get diagnosed with anorexia nervosa if you're underweight, and I think it sets a dangerous precedent of not taking ED behaviors seriously depending on how the person looks, but the WHO came up with it and the medical community has latched onto it pretty tightly.   That being said, there's other types of anorexia. Specifically, ""atypical anorexia"" is diagnosable when  “all of the criteria for AN are met, except that despite significant weight loss, the individual's weight is within or above the normal range.”   [Here's an article about atypical anorexia. ](https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/blog/top-5-myths-about-atypical-anorexia)",False,False

I'm a numbers gal. Calories, more recently macros. I'd consider my eating habits to be high restriction. When I *started*, I'd have just called it CICO dieting. I wanted to lose a few pounds, I *did* lose a few pounds, obsession took hold, I somewhere started viewing the daily calorie allotment on my tracking app to be a *limit* instead of a goal.  One side of my brain says it's time to stop, start figuring out maintenance, and maybe put a few pounds back on.  The other side keeps playing the same game with meal planning and counting and *how can I get the most efficient macros in the fewest calories* and freaks out about situations where tracking accurately is hard/impossible.  So I guess for me, I consider myself restricting in that I consciously, consistently, *compulsively* eat under maintenance.",False,False
