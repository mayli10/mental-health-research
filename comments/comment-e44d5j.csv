I was at a healthy weight a few months ago and now I'm a few pounds uw and it's to that point where I'm like ""okay ha ha this is not a joke anymore if I keep doing what I'm doing"" I tried bringing it up with my roommate (we literally share a room in a small apt in a big city) and the convo just died immediately. We have been friends for years and I know at this point that her idea of body acceptance is to just not bring it up at all, good or bad. She also cooks a lot of hearty meals and has never had weight fluctuations beyond a few pounds. Has no idea how many calories are in things and has no idea what activities burn x calories. She has never needed to. But I digress.  Anyway, when I tried to tell her about it I got stuck because I felt like she wouldn't really get it and I also didn't think i actually wanted her to do anything about it. I want to be able to say ""Hey, this is really tough today"" but I'm not ready to hear that I need to actually fix it, if that makes sense. This isn't an okay way to think, but it's where I'm at rn and it can be really frustrating that venting about an ED isn't viewed the same way as venting about a shitty day at work.   Sorry for what you are experiencing, sending love",False,False
