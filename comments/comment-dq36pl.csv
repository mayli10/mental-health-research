I asked him multiple times not to do that around meal times. I always think he’s checking for new fat or something. I’m very self-conscious. It increases my meal time anxiety. I think more about my body size and shape when he does that , particularly before or after a meal. I know he is glad about the weight I gained and said I don’t look “dead” anymore. I heard “I’m not thin or sick looking anymore.” On my short body gaining 4 pounds was all it took to not look sick based on his observations and my counselors.   It doesn’t seem worth it, I wasn’t really thin then. I never reached my goal weight. I’m hating myself so much over this.",False,False
