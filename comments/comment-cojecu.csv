She has mellowed a lot as she has gotten older.   Still dealing with the same old ED bs. It’s such second nature I doubt I’ll ever completely recover.,False,False

My dad is crazy Ortho and totally passed it into me.. my mom is obese after being a rail thin model in her youth, and is a feeder.. food is how she shows love.. and it kills me.. like her kitchen is off limits to anyone else.. it’s like a war zone if you step foot in there.. and my dad constantly makes comments on everyone and anyone’s body.. not a single body in the world is ever good enough.. either too fat, to thin, to muscular, bad proportions.. blah blah blah.. yeah I think it’s a pretty solid contributor. It doesn’t help that dad’s a total Narcissist.",False,False

Her weight doesn’t change much because of the volume of beer she drinks but that’s another story.  I turned it into a competition as ed sufferers do. If she came home from work and said she ate a big lunch and isn’t having dinner, I said the same or said I ate after school. It went on for a few years where I was basically fasting the entire time it was her week to have me.",False,False

My mom has disordered eating. She actually taught me to purge when I was about 7. I ate too much sweets and my stomach hurt so she taught me to stick my fingers down my throat to throw it up. I didn’t pick it up much heavily until early adolescence but I did make myself purge when I felt over full all through childhood.   She purged too, but more binged. She has always been overweight. And crazy unpredictable. She yelled at me a few times for purging too loudly as a teen. She didn’t care I was doing it. Just that someone might hear. And she almost let me starve myself to death after I got raped at 16. She wouldn’t have gotten me help at all if her hand wasn’t forced when I attempted suicide.",False,False
