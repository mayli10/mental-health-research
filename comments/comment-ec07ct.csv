She made a really incredible song about this experience. Shit cuts deeeeep. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkAjUBtn_TM  It is humiliating. And ending it can seem more humiliating, because it's like admitting that he really won't ever care about you, that you aren't just waiting for him to finally realize that you've just bEeN tHeRe AlL aLoNg. And when you keep it going, you can hold on to that fantasy that one day he'll realize he really cares about you.  I have pretty shit self esteem and have generally had awful relationships and I've always justified it as, like, obviously there has to be some kind of serious downside in the relationship because they're dating me, duh, and I fucking suck! Expecting someone kind and smart and stable to just love me and want to be with me is like paying fourteen dollars for red bottoms on a sketchy chinese website and expecting to receive actual louboutins. What I have to offer is terrible of course I'm not going to receive something amazing in return how dumb am I.  I have luckily found a really nice stable guy who wants to marry me, somehow. I mean I constantly worry I've just tricked him into loving me and one day he'll realize what a horrible monster I am and leave but so far he's stuck around even when I lose my shit so it's working out I guess? It's really bizarre I've never dated anyone who is always nice to me before I keep expecting the other shoe to drop and then it doesn't. I still think I'm a useless piece of crap but I have more periods of time where I don't think about what a piece of crap I am.  I hope you find a nice guy too.",False,False

It is soul destroying. I only broke it off when I went through his phone and found out he'd been seeing someone else without telling me.  &amp;#x200B;  When your heart is wrapped up in someone who doesn't give you everything, it stops you from finding someone who WILL give you everything. Who is capable of loving you back the way you need and deserve.  &amp;#x200B;  I don't think this guy hates you or thinks you're disgusting. I also don't think his feelings have anything to do with your weight. But he's made himself clear that this relationship isn't going anywhere. And speaking from experience - sleeping with someone who you have really strong feelings for who just doesn't feel the same way is fucking soul destroying. Please be kind to yourself and stop doing this. You deserve the space in your life to find someone who really, truly cares for you and wants to be with you.",False,False

Fact is, you're not alone, even and overall when ED brain tells you shit you can't argue with. You definitely deserve better than hanging out with a man who clearly doesn't care - or at least, not enough - and you deserve better than starve for self-validation, hope you find the strenght to get rid of this shit.
