But you‚Äôre right, doctors ignoring women or assuming they‚Äôre exaggerating is a suuuuper common problem. Lots of women suffer unnecessary conplications or even die in childbirth because of this phenomenon, especially young women and women of colour. Could you maybe see a different specialist? I always request a female doctor when I‚Äôm making appointments and I‚Äôve noticed in general they tend to take me more seriously.",False,False

I hadn't even mentioned my ED yet when he started being dismissive. When I mentioned that I was worried my GI problems might be related to my anorexia he said he has never heard of anything like that. He is a gastroenterologist. This is supposed to be his field of expertise and he apparently doesn't know about this super common cause of the problems he treats. And he seemed to just make the number up on the spot. I think since I was like 110 with my clothes on he just picked a lower number. I really think that he just saw a young girl walk into his office and assumed I was exaggerating my problems. I hear that lots of women who have problems like endometriosis struggle to get help because male doctors don't take them seriously when they complain about abdominal pain. I guess since they don't know how bad it can really be. I mean, I'm trans so that's definitely not a problem for me, but I think he didn't know that, so having a college-aged girl walk in complaining about abdominal pain wasn't interesting to him. He told me to just take a fiber supplement. As if fiber will solve everything. I think it has actually made me feel worse.",False,False

It sucks, but it‚Äôs reality. Good for you for being determined to stand up for yourself though, it can be anxiety inducing even thinking about it. I have to rehearse everything I‚Äôm gonna say to my doctor every time I see him because he asks so many questions I get sidetracked and forget half of the reasons I even went in lol.

Managed to gain like 15 lbs, but then lost 10 due to poor health. When I saw the doctor he said he wasn't concerned because I wasn't losing weight super fast. Even though I mentioned losing 10 lbs in a month without even trying to. He said if I was like 100 lbs he would be concerned. At my height my BMI is literally 0.1 point higher than a girl of average height at 100 lbs. So that was triggering. But I think I'm starting to get better again. Just in time for a follow-up appointment with him though, so I'm hoping he doesn't make things worse when I see him for the second time. 100 lbs for me is a BMI of 16 which is severely underweight, so I think if he doesn't offer to run the tests he was supposed to the first time I saw him after I tell that his advice was worthless that I will just have to, like, yell at him or something. I mean, I can't yell, I'm physically incapable of it, but if I talk very sternly he might actually listen to me.",False,False

Especially because I tend to need to replace a lot of it at around the same time.   Probiotics are just full of good gut bacteria and they help with digestion and stuff. When you‚Äôre not eating properly your gut biome can suffer and you need to supplement to make sure you stay as healthy as possible.   You can only take a diuretic for two weeks at a time, then you need to take a week or so off before starting it again. So I take it for two weeks after a binge to speed up the release of my water retention, then I stop for at least a week.
