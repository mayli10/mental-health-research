My best friend often forgets to eat, or she simply doesn’t have the time to eat since she’s so busy, and I always end up getting upset with her because she needs to eat more than a packet of ramen a day! But when I only “eat” coffee all day it’s fine and totally healthy lmao. I’ve actually thought to myself before that our situations are different because she’s an amazing person and she “deserves” to eat, unlike me. It’s so messed up how we think about ourselves because of these disorders.  I’m so glad that people can relate to me, because I feel like so often media portrays ed sufferers as people who just don’t know that their behavior is unhealthy and disordered. Surely people wouldn’t purposely harm themselves, right? (/s). It’s refreshing to hear that other people’s brains are just as illogical as mine when it comes to food, haha.",False,True

Someone in my life went through a period where they weren't eating very much and I got extremely protective and almost angry with them.  Stressing how important it is to eat and eat healthy and enough.  I drove myself into a frenzy when they wouldn't listen, yet I DON'T LISTEN TO ANYONE.  It's crazy how skewed the whole thought process is when you have this disease.  I too am aware of how unreasonable and unhealthy it is, yet it's ok for *me* to do.  You aren't alone!",False,False
