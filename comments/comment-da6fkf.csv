Just shame it when I gain. I told my friend I lost 14 lbs now in 2 months and she was so amazed and congratulated me and I’m like “but I don’t look it!!” I think I’m ok tho cause I end up binging and eating the rest of my cals at night 🙃🙃🙃",False,True

Please be careful. I'm now trying to find a way to maintain without fear of eating. I'm now at a place where not losing or gaining water weight are ruining my day seriously and I'm kinda addicted to losing :(",False,False
