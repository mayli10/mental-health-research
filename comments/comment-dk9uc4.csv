You’re right about the bland salad thing too, like the amount of times I’ve paid like £10 for a salad and been like ‘can you take off; the cheese, the dressing, coleslaw, the avocado, the side of bread...’. The judgement from waiters and friends is painful, but not as bad as the judgement from my bank account hahahaha.  I really hope so, I feel guilty for literally doing anything and this all just makes me feel so much worse.  Thank you for your advice, it means a lot, hope you’re good! X",False,True

I’ve backed out on plans so many times with friends I think they know to just not ask me anymore or wait till I ask them (it’s very obvious to them I have an ed now).   If it’s going to make you really uncomfortable to go I wouldn’t want to go either and you can just say that something came up or you’re not feeling well/up to it today. It’s not worth the stress and wasting your money to eat a crappy bland salad that you can make at home for 1/3 of the price (idk that’s how I always think about it lol). If they are true friends they won’t be upset if you can’t go. Or you can say you can meet up with them after if they plan on hanging out after lunch? Maybe for coffee?  I know this is prolly not the best advice but I wouldn’t wanna be in an uncomfortable environment but there will be a time when you can go out to eat with friends. I finally have two people who know about my ed and I can talk openly about it with them so I can ask them out to lunch on “my terms” if that makes sense. I don’t feel as embarrassed when I have to tell them I need more time looking through the menu to find something I’m going to want to eat, etc.  GL, and you got this 💕",False,False
