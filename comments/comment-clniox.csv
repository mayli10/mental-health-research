Counseling still helps me, at least I get to talk about it and the people there make sure that I'm not spiraling and getting worse with my overall mental health. I just wish I could get the help I need without involving my parents because they are just not...the best parents, let's put it that way.",False,True

It must be really rough having almost no one to talk to about it all. I don’t think I would’ve been able to deal with that.   Are there any eating disorder or mental health organisations in your area that you could benefit from? At least in my area they offer counselling and in my case they helped me a lot. Sorry if I’m asking a lot of questions, I just want you to get the support you deserve. ❤️",False,False

I don't want to feek like a burden and worry him.  At the moment I have attended therapy sessions but they are not ED targeted. To tackle my disorder I'd need to be 18, which is in 4 months. I can't rely on my parents support due to my messed up toxic family. So as if right now, I'm just waiting until I can really ask for help. But everyday hurts.",False,True

We're here for you, we understand the pain you're going through because many of us have been there before and still are going through it. Having an eating disorder is pure hell. I also feel constantly numb and depressed, but I'm in recovery and will get better. You can get better too, I promise you.   &amp;#x200B;  Do you have anyone in your life you feel comfortable opening up to? Do you get professional help?",False,False
