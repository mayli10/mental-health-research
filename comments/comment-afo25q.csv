Im 5 3” and its a big reason i think why people keep saying im “not fat” because i wear ~small~ clothes.

I'm super short and my clothes always looked too long when I was bigger, so I'm happy to be in XSs now.  I'm having the problem of stores actually not carrying sizes small enough for me now though :( I discovered today neither Victoria's Secret nor Macy's lingerie department carry below a 32 band size bra (I'm a 28), and especially with dresses a lot of stores don't carry a size small enough to look right on me.",False,False

I'm a short girl at 5'1 and my arms and legs are disproportionately short for even my height. Even kids clothes can have sleeves that are too long for me. I've got permanent sweater paws. When I gain weight and size up clothes look stupid on me.,False,False
