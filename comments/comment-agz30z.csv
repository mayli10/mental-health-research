It probably didn't help that I was the fastest in the packaging department since day one, so I was probably burning a lot of energy.",False,False

You can get a magnesium supplement (either drink or pills) and I mix about 1/8 tsp each of salt and potassium (I use Mortin No Salt) with about 24-32 oz water and I usually add a zero calorie flavour like mio for palatability. The mag drink mixes are flavoured I think so that would work too. Anyway what's l electrolytes and hydration are key when fasting too help with dizziness hunger and muscle cramps.,False,False

Your body needs energy and it needs nutrients. You feel faint because you're not supplying your body with what it needs. Our species has certainly changed since our hunter/gatherer days. Once we invented farming we really no reason to ever go days without eating anymore. You mostly only see people being fine after so long if they came from families which had been poor for many generations.",False,False

There’s a gatoraid zero or electrolyte pills if you’re trying to avoid eating.   Stay safe! ",False,False

I did a 30 day fast and developed orthostatic hypotension. That basically is just a loss of blood pressure when standing up etc. It got to a point where anytime I stood up I had to make sure I got to a wall or railing fast enough to grab onto so I wouldn't collapse. Plenty of times I didn't make it and I ended up with some gnarly bruises and cuts. Also shocked a lot of people by just fainting in public. Fun memories :(.  Even after returning to a 'normal amount of calories' (800-1200) and having a lot of binges this symptom has stayed with me. It gets better and it gets worse but it never goes away. Recently completed a 7 day fast and it got about as bad as it was before.  Fasting makes me feel in control and good about myself, but it also is probably doing quite a lot of damage to me as well.
