I was giving away food (_aha_) and they asked ""Why don't you wanna eat it?"" ""Because I have an eating disorder lol did you forget?"" ""oh right.""    I'm not sickly thin so nobody thinks it's an issue but man oh man it is.",False,False

I am going to see my best friend later and I am going to casually tell him that I am not eating at the moment because I have a vaginal prolapse due mostly to years of lax abuse and that I don't want to poop anymore and the best way to stop pooping is to stop eating.   I am sick of this internal battle. I don't care who knows now. I feel like it's just destroying things so I am going to join in with the carnage and be the fucking Godzilla of eating disorder honesty.,False,False

If you aim for fasting most of the time you'll ""fail,"" but you'll end up eating a lot below your maintenance, even if you eat food people offer you. I know it's fucked up for me to say this, but you can exist with an eating disorder without scaring everyone (or making them think you have something against them and won't touch their dirty offerings). All I'm saying is we have to remember that for most people, food is a reason to get together, and food is a way to break the ice.",False,False

But I‚Äôve had to discuss with my supporters the difference between support and that ‚Äúcalling out.‚Äù My mother saying that I‚Äôm going to die is not helpful,  but my boyfriend asking me to eat the bun with my burger because I act better with carbs is helpful.

I‚Äôve literally been able to engage in some of the ‚Äúworst‚Äù of them in full sight of people who don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre seeing.
