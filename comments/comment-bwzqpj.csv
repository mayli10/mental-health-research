eqb7ola,t3_bwzqpj,t3_bwzqpj,MissNietzsche,1,2019-06-07 17:20:11,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/bwzqpj/anyone_else_here_have_nothing_going_for_them_but/eqb7ola/,"Yep.  I have a boyfriend, but my relationship is honestly barely hanging on by a thread (literally over him telling another girl she was pretty through DM back in February and lied about it by saying his account was hacked and he didn't sent it [I'm still not over it]). It's causing me constant, extreme distress, and on one hand, I want to leave because of it, but on the other, he loves me and it's impossible for me to break it off yet because he still makes me happy sometimes and don't know if leaving is the right thing to do.  He is the only one I talk to. My sisters are kind of bitches to me, and I guess I can talk to my mom about certain things, but not everything, and my parents are finally in the process of divorce. Soon, it'll just be me and my dad, but he's kind of stupid and selfish, and I just can't really talk to him. Of course, I shut out all my friends. For a while, I had school giving me somewhat of a schedule, but that's over right now because of summer. I'm not working this summer because I'm getting plastic surgery in a week in a half. I've just been waifing for that, and for the first time in my life, I'm having issues sleeping and won't fall asleep till like 7 in the morning every day. I saw my doctor last week and I was like 106 pounds. I've been bingeing since and an am in the low 120's. My doctor will flip, and my breast reduction isn't going to turn out as good anymore because there's no point in getting it if I'm not at my lowest weight because my boobs will just getting saggy again with more weight that I want to lose, especially because I won't be okay until I'm 85 pounds. I'm going to be bedridden for weeks, and I'm going to be stuck in an anxious loop for weeks because I'll have nothing to do but to ruminate on how much I hate that my boyfriend lied to me, how stupid he is for doing it, how much he doesn't respect my own informed and autonomous consent by lying and wondering if he actually is a liar by lying about other things in the relationship..or not or if he actually could be a good father figure to my children or not. His proclivities are not as honest as mine are, and he's lied about things he's felt are ""right"", which include my weight, so of course I don't believe him when he says he thinks my body is perfect. I've already had one boyfriend in the past lie and say my weight was fine to him..I can't go through that again. And I'm so sick of my boyfriend lying ""to not trigger me"". Like, if the truth triggers me, how about I just decide not  to be with you? Goddamn   Sorry for my rant..it was a rough night.",False,False

He's the only one I've ever dated/had feelings for. But other than him, as thankful as I am to have him in my life, I have NEVER had any close friends. I've had a few acquaintances over the years that I might hang out with from time to time, but never consistently and without any emotional investment. No one has ever missed me. Hell, I would bet money that no one had ever noticed when I wasn't there. Part of this is my fault. Not only do I have severe anxiety in social situations and have the personality of a stale slice of bread, but I get jealous of other women (I'm almost 21 for context). I hate myself so much and I'm always comparing myself to others. Even if she isn't thinner than me, I can always find a reason why she's better than me: smarter, funnier, prettier, kinder, etc. I push them away because I feel threatened by them, and I have severe trust issues (took me a long ass time to trust my bf and I still struggle sometimes). It's easier for me to hang out with guys, but any ""friendship"" I've ever had with them has always been superficial. Im lucky to have a man in my life who loves me, even though I am undeserving of his love. I wish I could be better for him. I wish I could give him everything. But even though I am blessed with this amazing boy, I still feel lonely. Often. Idk what's wrong with me. Idk why I've always been the invisible girl. I'm sorry for the long rant. If you're still reading this, thanks for bearing with this long-winded post lol",False,False
