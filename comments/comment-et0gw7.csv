I agree with the post above that it could be a good idea to ask them about it. When I was in middle school I wasnt super aware of my disordered eating because I didnt know anyone else with an ED and hadn’t learned anything about it in order to notice the behavior. It wasn’t until someone brought it up to me and opened up about their disorder that I could see the parallels and the problems I was having.  Just be aware that it’s very possible they could be offended or dismissive but it’s not because you’re doing something wrong it’s just the way ED brains work at least that’s how it was in my case.  I just want to reiterate that by being there for your friend you are doing the right thing. I understand the fear of projecting your ED onto other people but even from the perspective of someone with a healthy relationship with food, these are concerning behaviors.   TLDR; you should talk to your friend about it but don’t be accusatory. You don’t have to open up about your own ED but it could be helpful for both of you.  Edit: when bringing it up I suggest not saying “do you have an eating disorder” but express your concern about their behavior",False,False

It would also be a way to bring up the fact you have one to see if that helps them talk about it. Thats how I was when my ED started in HS and since noone brought it up or seemed concerned it spiraled. But it’s definitely a hard topic.  It also depends on the other things youre seeing, its still probably a good idea to talk about it anyway though.",False,False
