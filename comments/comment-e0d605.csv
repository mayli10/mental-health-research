I don't really want to kick around for much longer but it's fine. I'm glad I stayed on diet pills because it finally got me to be treated as a human being. If I hadn't lost weight, I probably wouldn't even have a job.",False,False

I definitely struggle with that second one. I feel helpless just listening rather than “taking action” even though listening can be helpful as well,False,True

I think there are basically two things that had any chance of being helpful for me...  1. **Share your story**, to the extent that you’re comfortable. How you felt, what you did, what happened, how you feel now. Stuff like that. There was a peer support person at my local hospital who shared her story with me - about how bad things had gotten for her and how it wasn’t that way anymore. She never talked to me with an attitude of judgement or disappointment. Only with hope. It didn’t have a big impact in the moment. We didn’t have an emotional moment of connection or anything. I doubt she even knows that her story has been such a talisman to me. Your story might be that for your friend. You may never know the impact you have.  2. **Listen to her story** This can be hard - to listen without trying to fix. And if it’s too triggering for you, definitely protect yourself and your own health. But having someone say that they are listening, that they care, that they are sorry you’re struggling....that’s such a gift to give.   Other than that, you can’t really force someone to care about themselves. It’s a great act of empathy to reach your hand out like you are doing, but you can’t force her to reach back. Sometimes it happens in time though, if you let them know you’ll extend your hand again if they ever do feel ready. &lt;3",False,False
