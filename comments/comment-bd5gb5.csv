I tend to feel out of place because this is the weight I keep gaining back up to...and it's my normal weight. I've barely ever been above BMI 21-22. Despite being underweight twice in my life, I keep returning to normal and I feel like such a failure with nothing to show for this mental hell I've been in for years. Sometimes I'm ashamed to know that logically, I never had to struggle with my weight. I didn't work to be BMI 21, and I don't have any difficulty staying this way while eating what I want, but I use my ED to cope with my life, stress and illnesses, and fixate on being underweight.   Honestly, I think the majority of us feel out of place often. We're in denial, feel like imposters, ""not sick enough"", etc. I feel out of place just from knowing I've always been, (and seem to keep returning to) average/slim. It's not even because of the stereotype for me, because I have other illnesses that also don't always fit their stereotypes. Its just my view of myself. You can't win when if brain keeps saying you're not good enough either way.   That being said, for other reasons I actually do feel like I fit in on Peach, Pancake, and here. I've determined that based on us all having shared and similar struggles, not the stereotype of our disorder(s). As someone EDNOS, no matter what my body looks like, I can relate to a wide range disordered behavior, and that's how a sense of community/belonging has developed for me.",False,False

It’s hard to please everyone about this because some people strongly prefer the inclusion of BMI’s so they can better understand and relate to others.

A lot of people have EDNOS and cycle between various aspects of ED (restricting/binging/purging). Phase in the cycle can play a huge role in body type. Or people are in various stages of recovery/relapse. There are so many reasons why someone who is struggling with ED might not fit the stereotypical body type. Your body type doesn’t really correlate with how much you struggle with your ED.  What I love about this community is how accepting everyone is, regardless of body type.   I hope you find others with ED you can better relate to, but know that your struggles are valid regardless of your body type.",False,False
