I know my bluntness doesn’t translate well online. :x   Yeah! I think for one of my friends, she said that having the ability to easily walk most places meant she was able to exercise without focusing or obsessing about it. So she found it helped her to feel better and be active without hyper focusing - I think little things like that can make a big difference! :p  I wish traveling was more accessible.",False,False

My friends found success in experiencing a new culture, and found that the lifestyles they found were more conducive to recovery than the one they found in the USA! I was not trying to say anything more than that. :) I'm simply happy that I know a few people who were able to ""get out"" of their ED enough to find a sense of peace, and I hope that we are all able to do that one day, regardless of where, when, or how we find that peace.

Living in Europe and being constantly harangued about my weight when I was only 15lbs overweight was what started my ED behaviors that have lasted the rest of my life.

I know three people, whom went to France/Spain/some other country I can't remember, and they ended up moving there, since their ED vanished. One of my friends thinks it was the fact that they don't focus on bodies as much as we do, and are naturally more active, and have different relationships with food.   If my friend can do it? You definitely can for three days! Focus on doing what makes your body feel good, what tastes good, what you see, what you experience, the special experiences you have and the bonds you make!
