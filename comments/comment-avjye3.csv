They’d sometimes comment on how I got the brains while my sisters got the looks. I took it really hard and spent years restricting and dieting, and my sisters both gained weight, so I became the thin one. The way that changed the dynamic of the family was shocking. When I gained some of the weight back I think they were kind of relieved.  My younger sister is restricting severely now and I’m not quite sure what to do or say about it since I’m afraid my behavior rubbed off on her. Part of me is happy for her because she’s back to a more normal weight for her body. The other part is shocked how quickly that happened and worried that she’s going off the deep end a bit. She’s not as good at hiding her disordered habits as I was, and is getting backlash from our mom about it. I don’t know how to support her other than making wry jokes about diet foods and listening to her when she speaks about her relationship with food. I just kinda hope she snaps out of it one day.

She told me to 'fuck off'. I think she's jealous. She used to be smaller than me, and she made fun of my arms for years because they've always been chubby. Oh, how the tables have turned. Except I'm not going to be the asshole.",False,False
