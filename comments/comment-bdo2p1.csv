It might be utter bogus but i did it once before and lost on it and its an easy way to get myself over chocolate cravings.   I work best with strict rules and so mono diets give me that because following rules = reduced anxiety and a mono diet limits me well and i know right where the rules lie.   Knowing i might have fucked up the rules with a stupid coffee drink is making things a Bad Time.",False,True
