I had a skinny friend (total opposite of my body, she was 5'9 and thin and I was 5'0 and chubby) who also had an ED and was aware of mine and she would purposefully trigger me all the time. I think she wanted us to be sick together? She would do things like call me stocky, compare our thigh gaps, criticize people's bodies in my ear, and show me how her collarbones stuck out when she knew that was an insecurity of mine. This escalated to the point that I self harmed once and told her about it, and she told me if I really wanted to die to cut deeper next time.  Eventually she cut contact with me because I had distanced myself and wasn't giving her enough attention, and my life is better for it. Some people are just completely toxic. My ED is still an issue, but not living with constant negativity and triggering comments from someone that was supposed to be my friend has been a huge relief.",False,False

I had a hope that maybe she was but she isn't and I think that she knows exactly what's up, which is why she's doing this to you. I hope you're either distancing yourself from her or, if you intend on still being friends, talk about this with her and ask her why she's doing that and if she could stop.
