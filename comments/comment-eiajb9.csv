Not to sound condescending, but has it occurred to you that if you can sit through the feeling of food in your stomach, the food will digest and you'll be hungry again? Sorry I can't find a way to say that without it sounding like I'm treating you like a moron, and I know it's HARD to sit through it. But 100 calories of something should get absorbed pretty quickly. I think what I'm wondering is if you could  get yourself to keep food down by saying ""I will sit through this once"" then re-evaluate. Another strategy I've used is ""I will sit with this feeling for 20 minutes and re-evaluate."" If you could delay the time to purging that might help stop the behavior entirely. Or, is there anything you consider harmless? An apple, steamed or raw spinach, steamed broccoli? Wondering if you can practice keeping that down?",False,False

The anxiety comes from me being able to feel the food in my stomach. I really hate that feeling, and it makes me feel like I’ve eaten too much even if it was only 200 or 300 calories. So I purge to get rid of the feeling. I hope this all makes sense, it’s kind of hard to explain.",False,True

Can you try to keep down 100 calories instead of 200 or 300? When you say purging brings relief, what feelings are you trying to relieve? Sounds like anxiety - anxiety about what, if you can name it? Wondering if we can think of an alternate way to feel relief.",False,False
