Tell them you've been struggling with food and it would be helpful if they encouraged you to eat healthy items so that when you're sober you don't feel guilty. If that's out of the question, I'd suggest setting a reminder on your phone before you start drinking that will pop up and remind you to eat something healthy and small.  Hope that helps, good luck. Try not to let your ED take away these times with your friends, in the future you'll regret it and wish you hadn't",False,False

Yeah, i guess the bright side is I’m forcing myself to be socializing instead of curling up under a blanket all weekend. Somewhat healthy choices?   Also - i think I’m gonna bring quest bars and cucumber chips and carrots for car snacks so I’m not tempted to buy trail mix on the road 😊 (one of my weaknesses)  I’ll figure out the drunk eating another day 🤷🏼‍♀️",False,True

I spent the holidays on a road trip where I gained 10 lbs. Just as I’ve started to lose it, I’m going on another road trip (also 10 hours!) next week. 🙃 road trips are hard because spending that much time with other people automatically puts your eating habits under a microscope. I can’t even low-restrict this week to make up for the inevitable weight gain bc I need mental power for my exams this week lol.  I also really relate to drunk self eating like shit, haven’t found a cure to this yet besides not drinking. Maybe try to drink water in between drinks?   anyway, sending hugs ❤️ I’m proud of you for putting in the effort to spend time with friends. Let’s both try to enjoy ourselves and not stress too much!",False,False
