I induce knuckle cracking as much as possible and when I'm anxious I keep trying even if I can't. I also like to crack my jaw which is super wierd to everyone else.

I lie on the floor and pull my head up first to do my upper spine. Then I stick one leg up perpendicular and swing and drop to the opposite side while keeping it straight (I’m extremely flexible!) exhale with each movement and I get a deliciously satisfying cluster of pops omg I love it 😂   then I’ll push the knuckles of each finger and toe until it pops. With the fingers and thumbs I get two pops each. So 30 pops at a time for all the digits 😂 I have to wait several hours until I can do it again. I’m a freak lol my husband looks like he needs to throw up when he hears it 😬 I have to do it though I feel stiff and just not quite right if I don’t 😏,False,False
