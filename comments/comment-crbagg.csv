I wouldn't eat if he came over for the day. Got to a pretty bad point, felt like shit all the time. Attempted recovery. Now I'm back to a normal weight &amp; I feel like he's disappointed in me.

Plus, when I haven‚Äôt eaten in awhile I feel like my senses are heightened... which isn‚Äôt a bad thing when you‚Äôre hooking up haha. When I really start to think about that behavior I wonder if I also do it to show how much I care for them? Like I‚Äôm willing to suffer for my partner‚Äôs benefit.
