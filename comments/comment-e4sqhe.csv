And it won't show anything for increased eating causing your period to come. My period legit won't come until I binge. And if I don't it'll come really late. Like it isn't the other way round it is definitely the eating causing my period. I've forced myself to eat extra earlier than when my period was due to see if it'd work and bam there it was the next day. I can't find the answer as to why anywhere!!,False,False
