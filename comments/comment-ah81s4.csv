If heâ€™s still on the lease and power is in his name, the two of you will probably need to sit down and have an adult discussion about how this stuff will be handled. If by insurance if you mean health insurance and youâ€™re on his, you might be out of luck. You donâ€™t have a car so the only other insurance coming to mind is renters, which is actually really cheap, so just google it.  Do you have any friends or family that you can call about this? Honestly, if you are so isolated that you donâ€™t have a single adult in your life, your fiancÃ© hitting the bricks might not be all bad.  Donâ€™t panic. This stuff isnâ€™t terribly difficult. Iâ€™ve met 15-year-olds who had it figured out, and that was back when the answers werenâ€™t at your fingertips with the internet. You will be fine. Take care of yourself and just try to stay calm and focused on one thing at a time so you donâ€™t get overwhelmed. Good luck!",False,False
