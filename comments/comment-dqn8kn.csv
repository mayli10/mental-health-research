I got halfway through the second season in one night but Patty keeps saying all she can think about is food and it’s making me do the same thing. I’ve tried to keep watching it a couple times, gotten a minute or so in and started craving snacks... I want to finish the season because I think it’s a really funny show but I also watch tv to distract me from food which this show obviously doesn’t let me do so idk",False,False
