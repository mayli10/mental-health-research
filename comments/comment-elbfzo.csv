I know it doesnâ€™t feel good, and that your disordered mind is going to give you trouble about it anyway, but just know that the right guy doesnâ€™t care about your weight, just your happiness and health",False,False

My main advice is that it's all about the craic, both for men and women. (Confidence is sexy too, but given that we're all here probably not too relevant?) Sometimes they just don't like you though, which always hurts, but also means that then they missed out on what you have to offer and you get to flirt and have the craic with someone else!",False,False

Trust me. No one liked me any better when I was skinnier. In fact, most people liked me even less, which was a pretty impressive feat. If a guy isn't attracted to you at 200 lbs he probably won't like you at -12 lbs, same goes the other way around. Your first impression on a person matters more than anything else.",False,False

There was one I was interested in when I was overweight but she told me I will never have a chance. Really, that's what she said. So after I lost weight and became thin...bam, she wants to fuck me but I said fuck off instead. You know, people who only like you for your appearance aren't worth it.",False,False
