It's true, wine will always exist.  I went 53 days at the beginning of this year, and I felt pretty good but damn my brain doesn't like that delayed pleasure.",False,False

It makes me incredibly disappointed that I let myself get to this point.  But in that same vein, after your last 2 braincells click together and reach the ENOUGH point, it's like everything is under a different light now. I'm seeing friends tonight and they were discussing bringing Gin and wine to cheer for something and I was just... feeling sick to my stomach thinking of alcohol. I'm WAY more excited about the food though, I'm making wine guy bring desserts too and you bet your butt I'll be eating the heck out of that.",False,True

They won't be easy, please don't deprive yourself of whatever little comforts you can find. The probably won't taste good/feel good, or fill the void but your body will need it.  I honestly don't know how to break it. Years ago one of the advices my mother gave me was ""Too much or too little of everything is bad, it's important to find the balance"", and I'm like gee, thanks, but that's pretty vague.  In my personal case, when I wanted to abuse something, be it food, exercise, videogames, etc., it helps to ask myself ""Is this thing going to disappear completely from the face of the earth? Is all the alcohol in the world going to run out? Do I wanna eat this ice cream sandwich now or should I save it for tomorrow me's snack?"" Granted, sometimes I succeed and other times I will slip but whenever I hear that voice and answer that voice with ""No, all of these things will still be there tomorrow"", and MANAGE to keep it like that until the day is over feels like a HUGE victory. Now I'm just waiting for it to stop feeling less like a victory and more like routine 8)   Again, I wish you all the warm hugs in the world, you got this!",False,True

""Binges on everything"" is so accurate. I always thought I was just obsessive... I will pick something I like and do it until I can't stand it anymore. For instance in the spring I ate a buffalo chicken spinach salad and drank a bottle of wine every single day that I wasn't fasting. For like three months. Now I'm on ham sandwiches on pumpernickel...  How do I break this? Ugh. Going to a three day court-mandated alcohol intervention course tonight so I will be sober for at least 80 hours. It's a start.  Good luck with everything.  Get it under control now before it wrecks your life.",False,False

Stopping drinking cold turkey must be *so* difficult, I cant even imagine. I definitely agree that doing the moderation thing with something you're really borderline addicted to doesn't work. With everything I've ever had to quit  (cigarettes, going straight 1200 when I was borderline overweight, etc.) it's also been just one day of waking up and saying ""enough"" and getting on with what needs to be done.

I had them so well calculated too, I got them religiously at around 4pm the day after drinking and I had my plastic bag ready so I could breathe into it to alleviate the shakes.   Quitting is the worst. I guess it varies by person but those first 2 weeks are a nightmare. You'll have trouble sleeping, have constant migraines, absolute shit depression, paranoia and zero will to live. Last time I felt like this was when I also quit smoking weed/stimulants back in 2011. That psychosis lasted me about 6 months. Quitting stuff is terrible but a necessary suffering.",False,True

I made the decision on my own and I told her about it. She said she was sick of it too, but I don't think she's made the black and white choice I did (she's bringing wine and cheeses to the dinner I mentioned in my post, lol). What I'm doing is I'm taking time while cleaning my apartment/showering/meal prepping to try and identify all the areas of my life where I show signs of bingeing/compulsive and I realized it's more pervasive than I thought. I'm an illustrator and play videogames so I'm doing a bit of habit replacement (trying to focus more into drawing again, as well as playing videogames but not as a means of escapism but to actually enjoy the piece of art they are).

Yeah, when the weekend rolled around I was like ""What do I do with all these calories I used to consume drinking myself stupid???"", so I had all the Thali platters and falafel salads delivered to me.   Quitting a substance feels like you're floating in the sea and every other week you add to your sober count feels like taking a huge breath of fresh air. I never want to go back to my previous life again. I don't know who that person was and it's a complete shame. My bridges aren't quite burned but they were damaged quite a bit.

I'm almost 6 months sober from alcohol! I am on r/stopdrinking as well. I just want to say CONGRATULATIONS! I know how hard the ED gets when we quit.

Cutting back on drinking is hard. I was really depressed last year and drinking a real lot which is how my bulimia started. I'll take two shots before a binge so I can purge easier. I can get obsessed with calories but for some reason dont freak out about alcohol calories, which is probably why i only managed to lose about 40lbs instead of the 80 that i had gained. Now since I'm less depressed i can drink in moderation but i think i still drink more than my therapist would like.  Do you have any irl support on this? ",False,False
