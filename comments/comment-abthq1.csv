What if it was the other way around? What if a person who's never had an ED posted this here:  ""THIS IS THE YEAR I'M GOING TO DO IT YEAH I ATE A FULL MEAL WITHOUT PURGING AND IGNORED THE THOUGHTS ABOUT STARVING MYSELF  Wow!

Come back when you've been doing it for six months and have made some progress.""  Do you see now how mean it sounds when you turn it the other way around? If the text above wouldn't be allowed here (the person posting it would be considered a troll and an inconsiderate asshole), this post angry about people excited at attempting to change their lifestyle for the better shouldn't either.",False,False
