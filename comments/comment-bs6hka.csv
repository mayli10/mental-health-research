They diagnosed me with social anxiety as well, but nothing ever came of that for the rest of my life lol  They couldn't help my depression. I don't think they had the kind of specialists that would be able to handle me either. I was in pediatric psychiatry at the time, and most of the teens there were depressed because of usual teen shit, but how tf are you supposed to help an existentially depressed edgy 17 year old when you don't even know wtf Nietzsche is (peep @ handle).  I stopped going because it was utterly useless. Long story short, I got really bad and was literally on the verge of doing it, but I met this boy I fell in love with who also made me feel like an idiot because his IQ was so much higher than mine, making me realize I have a lot more work I need to do before I find truth, and to think at 18 I had it all figured out would be extremely haughty of me.  Then I started purging, and wanted to finally get help for my ED because I was out of control and just couldn't do it anymore, and I had to be VERY adamant that I wasn't depressed anymore and that my problem was my ED. The ED had been there farrrr longer than the depression ever had.  As an adult, I was finally funneled into the ED psychiatry rather than the depressive one (though there is a lot of overlap). The first time didn't work out. But the next time around, I got on Vyvanse (was denied it the previous time because I was on caffeine, even though I didn't ask for it because I thought I was gonna get Dx'ed with BN instead of BED again), and treatment finally started working, and never have I had so much control over my own life. It killed a lot of my social anxiety. And it just overall has made my life so much better. Unfortunately, the newfound control over my own life has caused my ED to flip to the more restrictive side of ED's (there's definitely still BED at the overruling base though, and lots of BN is present rn), but aside from that, this is the psychologically healthiest I have EVER been. I still have sooo much more work to do, but considering all I used to do was hide in my room, too scared to come out because of my fat, and binge eat, being situationally depressed as shit all the time, this is a way better spot in in now.",False,False

After that they referred me to an ED specialised place instead. I got to talk to a social worker, I got weighed, they did a routine medical check up and I got to do a depression diagnosis test and an ED diagnosis test that diagnosed me with Bulimia Nervosa without self emptying (??? Not sure how to properly translate it, basically bulimia but with non vomit purging).  It was based on the behaviour I had had in the last three months and my ED behaviours change all the time.  Generally it was a positive experience actually, people were really nice to me and not judgemental at all. I recommend it, recovery is very worth it",False,False
