I got to my HW during 'recovery' (minimal use of behaviors) but I hated how fat I've gotten and couldn't take it anymore. So I started losing weight again and relapsed into BN.  It feels like there's no escape from this ED. I'm either fully into a relapse or constantly switching between 'life's good, eating is okay' and then hating myself SO fucking much for keeping the food down.  I really think that recovery would be possible with a good support system. However I don't want to bother my friends with it, my family is super ignorant and finding a partner seems impossible because I'm lesbian.    Sigh. At least I have learned some things about myself from all those years with an ED.",False,True

I was anorexic/bulimic for 10 years and “recovered” in my early 20s. All I can say is... the damage you’re doing to your metabolism is real. It makes recovery so much harder. I gained so much weight and now I barely recognize myself in the mirror and it’s caused a few minor relapses. I’m trying to lose it again and the one thing I’ve realized is that if you can tweak your thinking just a little bit, your crazy eating disorder willpower can become a healthy diet/exercise superpower. When I was 15 I could forced myself to eat 500 calories a day. Some of us have done crazy shit to lose weight, shit normal people wouldn’t be capable of. Now that I’m almost 29, I know I can force myself to eat 1200-1600 and follow a strict exercise plan, because anorexia taught me what mind over matter is. If you can do the crazy shit, doing the normal is a breeze (it’s not true every day but the mantra helps.) I admit I still feel myself teetering at that edge sometimes, but the sooner you try to harness your brain’s desire to to ANYTHING to lose weight to force yourself to follow a strict, science based routine that’s HEALTHY... the better.   I also recommend taking a fuck load of nudes and studying yourself in the mirror and forcing yourself to say good things about your body. Find one thing you like, that’s sexy, and focus on that, and go from there. I’m overweight right now and it’s the only thing that keeps me from spiraling off that edge, and having done it in the past at “normal” weights kept me in a safer recovery zone mentally. It sounds weird but it really, really helped me with body dysmorphia.",False,False

It sucks to end up in your 30s with nothing but warped memories and lost time. To realise it's been decades since you last genuinely enjoyed something like your own birthday cake, or a picnic with friends.   Get help before you start a family and risk either passing on your disordered behaviour, or taking out your shitty moods on them because you're so busy torturing yourself that you can't even be nice to a little kid, who doesn't understand why mommy/daddy's so crazy.  And *when* (not ""if"", because you're making me a promise here!) you go get help, commit 100% to it. Be prepared to be raw, accountable, hurt. But also be prepared to get through that and find a version of you on the other side that you actually realise you can love.   The journey through isn't easy, and yeah it probably will get worse before it gets better. But please sort it out for yourself. You think and feel like you don't deserve it but you absolutely do.   You're a beautiful human being, an absolute genetic miracle (how many embryos don't make it?? Think about that). Please honour yourself.",False,False

The only detail I’d add to my story is that I restricted in high school (at this point I know I had atypical anorexia; I never told anyone so I never not a formal diagnosis). I recovered somewhat for about 5 years on my own, then relapsed, but now with bulimia. I think if I had gotten treatment in high school I might have been able to mend my disordered thought process around food; my behaviors stopped when I “recovered”, but I never had healthy thoughts or approaches to food.",False,False

Your goal weight won’t make you feel magically better, and life doesn’t miraculously get better as your size gets smaller. It’s gonna be hard to sit through the feelings and not give into that binge, or to just eat the damn food, but the more you do it, the easier it gets. Like others have said, it is a process, it is a journey, and it takes work to maintain. It’s very easy to fall back into old habits, but getting help sooner than later can make a huge difference.

I developed an ED in middle school but I wasn't really too ""into it"" until I was 20. Then I started restricting and purging regularly and the shit hit the fan. Its not even that I lost a lot of weight (statistics suggest that the average bulimic is actually overweight), but I was obsessed and did little other than binge and purge. I ended up reluctantly inpatient and it was the best thing that could have happened. At first I fought recovery, bit when I looked at my quality of life, I knew things had to change.   The thing I had a hard time wrapping my head around was this: though I didn't want to gain any weight... once I stopped binging and purging, I also stopped obsessing about every calorie and ounce I ate, and then I started feeling so much better than I *truly* didn't mind being a normal weight. Even though I fought it at first, my life was SO much better in recovery and with a recovered mind, I didn't care about my weight as much.  Now I know that's hard to imagine, but many, many people in recovery would swear it's true. And for me, that was it for 15 years. I was ""recovered.""   But recovery is active. It requires staying vigilant and getting help when you slip. I ignored my recovery and eventually, I slipped back into it when I was too busy with life to feed myself properly. I'll tell ya, it took almost zero time to go from healthy to underweight. I had to do an IOP program. Me, a mother of two and a nurse in her mid-30s. It was humbling. Since then, recovery has been a struggle. After IOP, I was still too busy to take care of myself, but this time I ate (in the name of recovery). I gained a decent amount of weight... And then I sort of gave up. And here I am.   But my advice is this: if you want your life to be better, you need to recognize that losing weight won't fix things. Recovery will fix things. There is no weight that can make you happy, but having a life that is focused on things other than weight and food will allow room for happiness.   And recovery requires you to take care of yourself; no one will do it for you. And I gotta tell you the truth: if you don't care about yourself, no one else will. Sure, maybe your parents when you're young, but everyone will eventually give up on you. In adulthood, no one wants to take care of someone who won't take care of themselves.  So don't give up on yourself. Take care of yourself. Give yourself a chance for a normal life before it's too late. When you're young, people care enough to work hard to get you healthy... Years from now, people won't be so sympathetic and you'll be on your own. So do you want to be alone with your eating disorder, or do you want to have a normal life focused on friends, family, traveling, kids, and a good career? Because it's your choice. Completely your choice.",False,False
