It was not your intention to hurt anyone. You did the right thing by not encouraging any disordered habits. Perhaps it would be good to send another message to discourage them, maybe talk about how your weight has negatively impacted your life.  But I also don't think you'd be wrong for NOT doing that, you know? You're not responsible for other peoples' actions if you didn't outright encourage them. It's fine for you to do nothing. Don't feel guilty okay?",False,False

If it weren't your picture, they would have found somebody else's.  But that said, I think taking it down and avoiding giving out numbers/tips would probably be a good way to move forward.",False,False
