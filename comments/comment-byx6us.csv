Yeah, I suppose hair growth isn't the fastest sport, but thank you for all tips on how to treat it nevertheless.  You stay safe as well, and I wish you all luck on your recovery! 💛",False,True

It’s also getting (slightly) healthier. There’s even a good bit of new growth! Which is pretty neat!   NONETHELESS, some stands *still* fall out? This same? Exact? Fucking? Way??  Which I don’t? Even understand?! But yeah! I feel ya.  :(  I was losing *huge* clumps of hair with every shower for while there... And like. Shit. It’s legitimately disturbing that I was SO MUCH more upset by losing my *hair* than I was by losing my period and like, u kno, potentially damaging multiple organs or whatever (and I’d probably *still* feel similarly to be real, hehhh, but aNYWAY).  AT SOME POINT, I made a collagen + biotin powder thing part of my almost-daily routine. And for what it’s worth, that was helpful! 10/10 would recommend.  At least, it seemed to noticeably slow down the hair loss...for me anyway. Did *not* stop it altogether of course, but slowed it down for sure and seemingly improved the Hair Situation overall.  For the most part, I used half a serving to one serving of [this stuff](https://www.amazon.com/d/Collagen-Supplements/Multi-Collagen-Protein-Biotin-Hyaluronic-Glucosamine/B079ZLGLGL) (15-30 cals, 3.5-7g protein) which I’d put in my First Coffee Of The Day, stirred in super well with a lil bit of unsweetened, nondairy milk or creamer + stevia drops. (Frothy! Just not a super awesome taste without the stevia or some variety of sweetener.)  If you’re not okay with animal products or if you wouldn’t want to add anything too significantly caloric, there are also straight biotin supplements meant for hair &amp; nail health that might potentially help some, in addition to taking a multivitamin + iron supp if ya don’t do that already. Stay safe out there, friend. 💛",False,False

The idea of putting weight on, undoing all my progress. I’ve been thinking to myself fuck it it’s just hair &amp; then not wanting to recover. Or thinking if I just take supplements it will come back. I’m scared to give up that control too. Good luck to you, I hope your hair grows back healthy &amp; I hope you recover one day💗",False,False

I hope to break out of this cycle myself as I'm aware that this is what's going to kill me if I don't stop. Although, the very idea of just ""giving up"" that control, terrifies me :/ But oh well. Again, good luck on your journey!",False,True
