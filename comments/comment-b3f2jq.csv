It's really, really miserable to gain (or at least it was for me) and I didn't want it. But it's happened, and... I'm okay. It's not the end of the world. It doesn't mean you'll keep gaining forever.   The weight is what it is regardless of whether you choose to beat yourself up about it or not. I have come to believe self-loathing is a useless, even detrimental emotion. Thanks for sharing your victory here, I think posts like these are important.",False,False

Getting over some of my social eating issues was the biggest improvement I made, so many things are planned around or involve getting food with other people. Being able to be a part of that even if I‚Äôm trying to restrict to an extent while doing it has made me feel so much less isolated.

Thank you for sharing, OP. I think everyone here needs to see more posts like this.   On that note, keep doing what you're doing! Life is so much more pleasurable with good food and good company. Just keep reminding yourself that.  If you ever need to talk, or really anyone who needs that reminder, don't hesitate to PM me.
