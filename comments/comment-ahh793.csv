I would just think of my skinniest friend changing whenever I was restricting or even purging (shudder).  Eventually my skinniest friend gained weight and I lost and ended up being about 25 pounds lighter than her.  That was a trip.,False,False

I have to be skinnier and when I do I see more people even skinnier and then I have to beat them. But I also suck ass at losing weight so I often end up feeding other people a lot in an attempt for them to gain weight so I look thinner in comparison h a ah a a (kill me),False,False
