I worked as a consultant and had meltdowns before any onsite client meetings.   I wish getting dressed up and presenting one’s self as a polished professional didn’t feel excruciating, but even if it’s fucking hard, it won’t stop you from a career in media (or anything else you love and want to do)!  &amp; you definitely deserve a partner/friend who can support and encourage you through your getting dressed anxiety.",False,False

But remember that the presentation itself is a lot more important than the clothes you wear - a week from now, no one is going to remember what outfit you picked.     Good luck tomorrow, and congratulations! &lt;3",False,False

I cry every single time I get ready to go out with friends.. not so much for work because I have very specific outfits I wear and it’s very repetitive.    I went to the store to try on clothes and nothing fit. I cried in the dressing room. :) :) :),False,False
