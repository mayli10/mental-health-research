My other coworker ate out for pretty much every meal, either bringing in prepackaged sandwiches or takeout. My horror was mostly from a financial standpoint (like seriously, how did they have the budget?) but now with my ED kicking up I'm especially like ""god I could NEVER""  But I do remember they both had a gut on them, even though they were both decently young dudes (upper 20s?), and that makes me feel better.",False,False

Most of them are probably men, bigger than you, burn calories just by existing. More muscle mass = more calories burnt. Their NEAT is higher. They may be eating constantly but in the evening their portions are smaller.  And they may be working out after work (or before, just like you). You don't know. You only know what you see, you see them eat. But there're no way the calories they consume just disappear. CICO. You're not following your coworkers around all day and night, so you don't have a full picture.",False,False
