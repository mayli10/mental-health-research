If I'm going OUT it's not to eat salad ðŸ˜µI want something gross and disgusting aka 'normal '",False,False

I hate eating food that's bland or disappointing in any way. Eating is already such a drama, so at the very least the food needs to taste good.  Relatedly, my dad bakes a lot but recently started making everything super low sugar, to the point that it tastes actively bad. I should be grateful bc it makes me not want to eat what he makes, but at least once a week I end up eating a piece of something anyway. And the guilt is all the worse because I didn't even enjoy it. If I'm gonna eat loaf cake I want GOOD loaf cake. Not this ""what if bread, but slightly sugary"" bullshit.",False,False

I was actually thinking of making a post just like this in fact. Like I spend so much time fantasizing about what food I want to eat. Like legit lately I canâ€™t even decide what I want to binge on because I want it to be perfect.,False,False

Everything that I eat has to be a 10/10 or itâ€™s a waste of calories. But Iâ€™m also afraid of a lot of junk foods and Iâ€™m vegan so a 10/10 for me is a clif bar or hummus lol.,False,False

More times than I'm proud to admit, I've literally driven myself to tears because I'll eat nothing all day ""saving up"" for the exact food I'm craving, and then I'll realize that food isn't actually available to me for whatever reason (usually because the store or restaurant is closed or has run out of the thing I want). By that point, I'm so hungry and frustrated that I end up ugly-crying and justifying to myself how ~the universe~ is clearly sending me a sign that I'm obviously disgusting and don't deserve to eat anything at all.
