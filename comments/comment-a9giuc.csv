As a big girl myself, (BMI 29) I would understand if my boyfriend was concerned with me consistently gaining weight. Not like 5lbs, but 10-15+ lbs would be something worth talking about. I agree that the way to approach it as getting healthy together, not just about weight. But it's ok for it to upset you, it really is. ",False,False

My SO is obese and has been for a very long time. Hes gained a lot since we met and we have literal no sex life. I think im asexual anyway, but its so hard to tell when you also arent attracted to their body due to sizing.. hes losing weight right now though so maybe ill find out",False,False

I lost a bunch of weight during my last relationship (BMI 29 -&gt; 24), and my ex thought I was still too fat. It was hellish, and I broke up with him because he didn't find me attractive.  My current bf has a BMI of 27.5 (it went from 28 to 24.5 to 27.5 [I actively encouraged his weight gain]) and I currently find him at his peak of perfection. Granted, most of it is muscle because he lifts, but just because you're not attracted to him at his current BMI doesn't mean other people aren't. Cut him loose and let him find someone who loves and finds him attractive as is.  My current boyfriend literally loves me for the whatever weight I am, and ironically, I actually was finally able to get to a healthy, normal weight (hopefully that number goes down more though) with him, even though I tried so hard to get skinny for my ex. It just doesn't work if you don't love him for deeper than skin-deep.",False,False

I am only telling you this because you did ask for criticism/thoughts. I feel like seeing you talking about ""hating"" their weight gain and feeling ""less attracted"" is stressing me out on their behalf.  I speak as someone who is aware that I prefer slim bodies and I struggle with this issue myself. ",False,False

I can't even get into a relationship because of fear if expressing these thoughts.  You have to go to a therapist and tell them. You can't work this out on your own or forever suppress it. You need a long term plan from the outside.  ,False,False
