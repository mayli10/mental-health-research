Talking to someone about it does make it easier in my personal experience, but to get to that point is a hell of a ride and trust me- even just opening up here is a good first step. I understand how you feel about ""not just skin and bones"" but that does NOT invalidate what you are going through or what you are feeling. Im sure that if the other person is compassionate and would be willing to listen to your struggles they wouldn't brush it off as just seeking attention. Eating disorders is a MENTAL illness, the physicality of it is merely a symptom. I hope that your day or night goes very well &lt;3",False,False

As much as I'd like to restrict to get thin, I'm really trying to push to be more ortho and be obsessed with making sure I make the most of my food and getting the nutrients I need. That's how I cope. Choose healthier obsessions. It's not *healthy* in itself but it's better than eating one carb heavy granola bar a day.",False,False

I wish i could just talk about this with someone in real life, maybe it would just make it so much easier, but i feel like because I’m literally not just skin and bones they would brush it off as just seeking attention?? I don’t know, i’m just happy there is a community of such lovely people that are supportive and kind. ~hugs",False,True

I understand how self diagnosis can be a scary thing especially in things like EDs, but its pretty easy to spot disordered behaviors and honestly I consider most disordered behaviors that insist to stay in your life for prolong periods of times at least EDNOS ( but yknow im no physician so) But having something to associate yourself with is weirdly validating? Im not sure haha- im going on a bit of a rant. Im sorry that you are going through  this.. If its possible please try to go about it more healthily... and if you find yourself back there anyways please at least try to take your vitamins and electrolytes as that can prevent many health complications. I honestly dont think many people here are coping with it well- and when I do see people coping its usually in self destructive behaviors... I hope that you will be able to see  day without such disordered thoughts as you seem like such a lovely person and it hurts to see you suffer like so..  hugs-",False,False
