Unfortunately there's still a lot of misinformation about EDs in the medical field.   Not being believed is one of the worst feelings, but this forum is a great place to share your worries and concerns where no-one will doubt you. Please take good care of yourself &lt;3",False,False

BMI is such an awful measure of eating disorder! It tells you absolutely nothing about somebody's psychological relationship with food. Please don't feel like you're not genuinely affected just because your BMI 'seems' normal. Many people may have a 'normal' BMI yet still be incredibly ill (with any kind of disorder or health problem). It is not an absolute measure of health.   &amp;#x200B;  I would suggest you try and change GP/get a second opinion? It's such a big step to go to a medical professional for help and I would really hate for your first try to be ruined by this unprofessional doctor. Please stay strong! &lt;3,False,False
