I have struggled with anorexia since my late teens.   You will see in my other posts I have spoken about the things I have lost as I lurked from crisis to crisis.   I am sorry you missed out on so much and I am sorry you got triggered by work, don't give up. The fact you posted today show's your still fighting to control your life.   You still have the strength to live your life. I use to think life was lived from point A to point B . It can't, Its free and it roams as it wants.   I know the pressure is immense at the moment and you can't see any other life. I Believe you can change the second act of your life.  Your not alone, don't give up. Your dance is not yet over.",False,False
