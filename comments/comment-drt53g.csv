It depends on my mindset as to what is high vs low though, I used to count by deficit and my normal was -1200.",False,False

So maybe 1000 +/-? Low for me is less than 600,False,False

For some dumb reason I thought ""high restricting"" meant EXTRA restricting (In my mind, that's sub 500) whereas low restricting would be ... less restrictive (\~900 or so).   Everything makes way more sense now. I'm dumb.",False,False
