Recovered it, but now im currently back to restricting to one meal a day, about 3-500 calories a day and gym 6 days a week.  I haven't seen any family or friends for months.  No one calls, no one checks in, when anyone does see me they compliment me rather then seem concerned.  I'm about to hit size 00.  I can count my ribs.    What the fuck is even going on anymore?  Sometimes I try reaching out to certain people I thought were friends...  I've tried opening up and they almost get competitive about losing weight themselves and turn the conversation into how little they've eaten today or this week, how fat they are and feel, etc... I ask if they wanna go for lunch because I have days where I genuinely would go eat a meal if someone would just give me some company.  10/10 no one wants to go eat because they say they're watching their weight, but it seems like it's only around me...  Does this happen to anyone else...  has anyone thats lost more weight then their friends/family had it cause those people to suddenly avoid you because they can't seem to handle the discomfort of being bigger than you suddenly.  Like fuck, my sickness isn't about you at all Karen, please just be in my presence without being self conscious and making it about your vanity ffs.    I feel like an egotistical pos even thinking that's the case but it keeps happening so consistently that it just cant be a coincidence this frequently.",False,False
