I actually cannot help but feel sorry for how the supersize woman was called out like that by the superskinny woman. The worst part? How they followed her up the stairs when she clearly said ""DON'T follow me!"".",False,False

'Tony only eats 1300 calories a day!' and yet the 'supersize' gets nothing for breakfast, an energy drink for lunch and a slice of toast or a chocolate bar for tea? Where are the other 1,000 calories coming from?  I only saw this discrepancy addressed once and it was in the opposite situation, where the supersize was giving the superskinny fairly small meals despite weighing 340lbs. It was sad but weirdly satisfying to hear someone finally say 'you didn't get to how you are now by eating this'.",False,False
