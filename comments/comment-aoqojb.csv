Impulse bought it for myself as a Christmas present and I‚Äôve worn it EVERY day since then, I think the longest I‚Äôve gone without were two hours. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm my own tamagotchi. The first few days I‚Äôve been obsessing over my heart rate too, like doing various things while staring at the watch lol   Now I‚Äôm just obsessing over everything but it really made me healthier. Or at least, I‚Äôm more active and drink more water I guess. Best money I‚Äôve EVER spent ",False,False

I also find it funny that I can see when my meals are because my heart rate goes high from the anxiety  I got as a Christmas gift and I was disappointed but the anorexia was super excited about it.   I haven't gotten obsessive about steps/calories burned surprisingly but that can always  change,False,False

But seriously you‚Äôll grow to be ‚Äúhooked‚Äù on the data it gives you.  My favorite is obviously the calorie burning and the sleep tracking.  Good buy!,False,False

Mine seems pretty accurate (from tracking calories in &amp; weight loss) but I‚Äôve read that it can be very inaccurate person to person.   I also have a Fitbit Aria scale which syncs up so it makes tracking everything so easy!! (To my own detriment idk?),False,False
