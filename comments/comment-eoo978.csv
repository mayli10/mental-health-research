It's a shitty thing to have to deal with. I used to be the receptionist and everyone always commented about how nice and cheery I was - in the end it's easier to literally move into another area of the mind and put on a mask of sunshine.  If it makes you feel better, I wish I could go back to reception. It's probably the best place to be in the company in my experience - overseeing the shitshow but not having to get involved in all the politics.",False,False

I have a similar job and I hate having to see people every day. Many mornings I lie in bed and wish so hard that I could just not leave my house. I don’t bother putting on makeup or dressing super nice which my bosses probably don’t like about me but that is just exhausting. I wish people could just understand :( sorry you are going through this.",False,False

I began hosting in restaurants and I become so self conscious. I would compare myself to the other girls and there was this one girl who was white, thin, long hair, and everyone wanted her. I was in the beginning stages of losing weight and all i could think about at work was damn, i wish i could be her.   Forget about the fact that she had a poor work ethic and finances were jn shambles, i just wanted to be her because she was thin.   Sadly I still think about her.",False,False
