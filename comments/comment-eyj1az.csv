Hence very few movements when restricting/starving.  Eating triggers digestion and intestinal movement, so eating a lot (or even just more than usual) for one day can be enough to really move your intestines.  So, likely, if you've just stepped up your intake, you did release some older waste from when you were restricting. I don't know how to say this without being TMI but I have definitely noticed this in myself before haha.  Also water + fiber has a huuuuge impact on your digestive system and you will see ""results"" a lot more regularly if you have a lot of fiber and water in your diet.",False,False

I usually go once a week but lately I’ve added more veggies to my minimal diet and can get around 2-3 out of me which has been GREAT.   A teaspoon of chickpeas has also proven very beneficial to help that too! Fiber rocks!,False,False
