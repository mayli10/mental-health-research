Right before I am about to binge my brain kind of shuts off. I know I shouldn't do it but I do it anyway. I'm in college, and I will rush out of class and head straight to the dining hall as fast as possible. It's as if taking my time getting there would force me to stop myself from binging (which I don't even want to do) but can't stop myself. Then I basically eat as fast as possible, not allowing myself to process how much food I am actually consuming.",False,False

It's an attempt to ground yourself if something has happened to your energy field and there's a loss of energy, like a psychic attack. After an argument for example you can feel drained and like you were ripped off and your aura weakens  I think sometimes there are parallels existing between myself and others and we're interconnected. I think bingeing is related to being stuck in your head. You're ungrounded when you are bingeing. Childhood trauma and any kind of trauma fuels it also. It makes it difficult to regulate your eating habits and your relationship with food becomes dysfunctional. Other triggers include/may involve weight too low/weight loss and being under fed",False,False
