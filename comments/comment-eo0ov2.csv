I bought basically what i can have for the week and then some stuff i already had at home. The peanuts and sunflower seeds are one big bag each (about 1 lb) that is all my fats.   Of course on day 1 i realize I don't really like sunflower seeds or peanuts. (Yes peanut butter though.) But the point of this was to get the good Vibe of ""restricting"" without restricting sooo suffer bitch! Tough shittt. I made the diet to max all my vitamins &amp; shit on cronometer, but then i didn't find collard so i kinda already fucked up. I also had a carrot and some beans that weren't ""on-plan"" but they are WFPB so i'll just add the price in. So today was like &lt;$3 of food, \~1800 cals. Good times. But idk how to count coffee from beans since I don't know how much my coffee machine thing uses... I'll just say $0.1? So today was about $3. Nice nice nice nice nice.",False,False

Working at this Chinese Restaurant is torture...bugs roaches dirt. And what sucks is they're paying me better than my high end Chief job in higher downtown. So if I quit I def won't be able to afford my rent but I'm desperate to get out of this kitchen it emotionally and mentally haunts me. I hate having to pack food for deliveries....take orders...and deal with people constantly wanting food this way or that way. The smells are so intense. I refuse to eat any of the food here....it's tasteful but we are literally surrounded in roaches I'm surprised we passed the health inspection.   What's worse is that the roaches come and go depending on how they feel and then when they go we have smaller bugs that enjoy lingering. Non-withstanding it's a popular spot  and everyone loves our Chinese Food....all except me. To be completely honest I'm SICK of working in the restaurant service industry. It's terrific for staying on your feet and losing weight but awful for my  fast days \*Which are mostly everyday. I grow ill of hearing people binge on how much food they NEED when I'm literally dying to feel content to eat a meal and have the mind to eat FRIED rice....I scoff at the idea of actually requiring what they do when ordering....it's always large portions and a soda.   I become disgusted by my environment and by people always WANTING something to put in their belly. Working here has enhanced my ED I often get home late and don't have the energy to even eat a meal for myself....who feels like washing dishes after a 12 hour shift full of whiny humans and rodents? NOT ME.   So super depressed and my SO is hurting because I'm hurting so often. And he's aware when he's not around I don't eat. He's been trying so hard to be present so I don't end up back in the hospital.....yet he struggles and has so much in his life that's bringing him down too. When we started dating I appreciated his Dad Bod...he works and is active as a construction worker but doesn't eat that great... He really helped me began to love my body until I was triggered late holidays to drop 22 pounds.  Now when he tells me he's hungry or complains I want to scream muthafucker I only eat 15% of the time throughout the week every goddamn week. He has supermodel legs but the belly of a father and a mountain man which he is both and 12 years my senior so I get it. But I also envy how he gets to live selfishly and I more concerned of my weight than he is because he really doesn't have much room to be worried about it.   So here I am hungry always hungry. I binged Saturday and that was only cause I'd had the shits all week couldn't hold food down and dropped extra weight and then after it all I'm back at starving. I just fucking hate this. I just can't stop thinking about how great it'll be to be thin.. And of course my tips are high as usual since the weight loss. I'm not sure what our society enjoys about the starving model female or the skinny hungry tall girl who has a weightless fake smile. That's me describing myself because trust me I'm faking the hell outta my happiness at that counter I am desperate on the inside to feel peace.   What hurts is I've been suicidal everyday. I only keep going because of the look of desperation in my Cat's eyes...he loves me so much. Every time I come home he runs to me and cries out and never leaves my side. I can tell he knows my true feelings. I often look at him and say ""You're eating for the two of us."" I wish I was a cat...lay around eat all day and play. DID I MENTION HOW GODDAMN COLD I AM? FUCK! I cannot seem to get warm at all no matter how much I wear. I'd def blame it on such a fast weight loss and fasting during the cold season. This shit is miserable.
