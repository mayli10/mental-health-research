If sheâ€™s trying to be heathy then encourage her. Hopefully she can do the same for you too :) comparison is the thief of joy! Remember that. Donâ€™t compare! ,False,False

I know he genuinely has good intentions and heâ€™s not even a yo-yo/fad dieter but I just feel fatttttt. He tells me I need to move more, and heâ€™s right but I feel so pathetic and repulsive when he says that.",False,False

Sometimes it can be helpful to have an outside person help you voice these things.   I would hate that too. Whenever it does still happen that Iâ€™m in a situation where I need to eat more or something harder and others are eating less or â€˜healthier/cleanerâ€™ I try to remind myself that I need to eat regardless of what they put into their mouths. My recovery is independent of their snack/dinner/meal. ,False,False

He just lost a lot of weight and is *still* talking about his diet, at every meal. It's so frustrating! I'm sorry you're going through it too, it's making my recovery ten times harder.   You're totally right to be annoyed, she's being really unhelpful and triggering, and if she means to, that's disgusting of her. If she doesn't know though, you should talk to her. It may be obvious to most people not to talk diets around someone recovering, but sometimes we're all a little tactless and blind. She may need you to tell her explicitly that she's hurting you. You can say something like, ""hey mom I'm trying to be better and it would be really helpful if you didn't involve me as much in your dieting and eating habits, because I'm still in a vulnerable place and it's not serving me. I would really appreciate it, and it would help me recover faster.""  I hope this helps. Talking to my dad was no use at all but except for this winter break I'm usually on campus so I don't have to deal with it most of the time. I hope it goes better for you! Hang in there, you're doing great ðŸ’— I hope you enjoyed that pasta, you deserved it.",False,False
