I DON'T COUNT CALORIES ANYMORE THOUGH- has improved my life so much. i'm not beholden as much to numbers.  &amp;#x200B;  in short, it is so fucking worth it but also some of the worst weeks of my life to get to this point. crying, sobbing, screaming to therapists, crying when i had to have salad dressing, having a panic attack over an m&amp;m cookie, agonizing over picking the lowest cal options i could in treatment.... it sucked but i'm here now",False,False

I‚Äôm 30 now, and mostly recovered, I guess? The last 17 years have been inundated with anxiety and depression, restriction, bingeing, binge drinking, drunkorexia, bulimia, attempted suicide, self harm, drugs, and a side of fries. I truly started to take a turn for the better about 5 years ago after I started planning my suicide, which scared me straight to a psychiatrist and onto SSRIs. Getting help for the underlying mental illness was the catalyst for me to slowly work toward getting my life in order, one doctor at a time, one day at a time. About 2 years ago, my weight finally stabilized, and I stopped counting calories. Life has been... easier. There‚Äôs no longer this heavy weight on my heart that pushes me to fast. The anxiety of eating has diminished greatly‚Äî I mostly only feel like shit when I eat greasy food, and it‚Äôs not an emotional pain, it‚Äôs a gastric thing. The poops come regularly. The mental stability is refreshing. And I no longer hoard free snacks in my pockets at networking events. Food has stepped back from being center stage, and that has made everything else infinitely more enjoyable. There are moments where I waver, especially when the birthday cake gets delivered to the office, but the feeling of existing without the shackles of food is worth not relapsing.",False,False

Used to be terrified of cheese. Nothing bad happened. I'm okay and later I'm gonna take a shower. If I was still actively choosing to listen to every ED thought I would have gotten some boring ass salad and it would have sucked. Idk if that's inspirational but it's my truth lol.,False,False

My life has completely changed, I feel like I got back all the positive aspects of myself I had before the disorder. My relationship with food it‚Äôs still a bit weird but I‚Äôm slowly but surely getting over it. I look in the mirror and I realize I see myself more objectively, I look at my body and I say ‚ÄúI am... normal???‚Äù, this is the greatest accomplishment, I finally start to feel normal. I‚Äôm not that scared of carbs anymore, I don‚Äôt care if I eat pasta or bread for lunch, I don‚Äôt care if I drink milk or eat full fat yoghurt. It really does get better, you‚Äôll want to go out and have fun, you‚Äôll find yourself doing stuff you‚Äôve dreamed of and you‚Äôll realize that being normal and balanced it‚Äôs the coolest thing ever. Fuck that being edgy and skinny bs, being your own version of normal is the coolest thing you‚Äôll ever be. You will be able to see yourself and you‚Äôll be able to forgive the person you see in the mirror. You‚Äôll love her and trust me, she‚Äôll love you back.",False,False

My recovery involved 28 days of ED/SIRS rehab, 28 days of drug/alcohol rehab, 5 years of outpatient therapy, bipolar medication, but most importantly: *living with myself and believing that I'm going to be okay*.  I'm 26 years old now. I consider myself recovered but i relapse on restricting occasionally. I'm married with two cats now. And I'm super happy. It gets easier. Just remember that this moment will pass. And even if you don't believe it at first, tell yourself that you're beautiful until you start to believe it. And believe it when other people say it too.  Sorry for being so cheesy. But just remember that you aren't alone.",False,False
