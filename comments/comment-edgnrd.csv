I use Garden of Life liquid multi and it's chock full of good stuff. :)  I think the chances of actually absorbing the nutrients are better than with a hard pill too.   I've considered gummies but I think I'd just eat them all like candy. ðŸ˜›,False,False

As you said, injections is not a long term solution (even though they say vitamins arent a long term solution either but the best it is until this ED vanishes from my mind). Thanks for the suggestions!",False,True

I currently take an off brand of  flinestones that is also dosed for adults and the only problem I have is the after taste (it has iron in it as well) which goes away after drinking something,False,False

(No doubt Google can corroborate)   So, when getting enough from food isnâ€™t happening, the supplements are pretty critical. Sometimes having even a little food makes a big difference (eg. a few saltines) and sometimes taking them later in the day helps me. There might be injections, (I once had one for B1) though thatâ€™s more a course correction than a sustainable solution.",False,False
