I regularly text my boyfriend asking if he’s sick of me, or mad at me, or if I should stop constantly telling him about ED stuff. It’s been so helpful to voice those thoughts because his reassurance makes me realize that it’s just my brain being mean to me. I also really relate to the “he’d like me more if I lost more weight.” I know it feels so true but try as hard as you can to tell yourself it’s fake, because it is.
