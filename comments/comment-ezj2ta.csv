I had delayed gastric emptying due to constant purging and had to be on regular for a while, so even if Iâ€™d waited an hour or two I might not have absorbed the meds.    Maybe an alternative route of administration would be helpful",False,False

The vibe I got from my instructors is that they 1. Had disordered eating habits themselves or 2. Didnâ€™t know how to actually handle a person with an ED. It wasnâ€™t until I had an actual psych nurse who worked in the eating disorders clinic that I learned more truth to the nursing aspect of eds. It truly is a specialty!   Also f that statement about choosing healthier diet options...ya Karen like thatâ€™s gonna do shit all,False,False

I'm a nurse practitioner and can say 95% of what I learned in nursing school is irrelevant to my speciality (neonatology). It's unfortunate that such little time and effort is spent on eating disorders in nursing school, but I think it is important to remember that there are so many specialities and subspecialties that everything can't be taught. In school we truly get a brief overview of a huge array of diseases and the common treatments. It just isn't possible to teach everything. When you graduate and start your first job you will learn more during your orientation about caring for those specific patients than you did in all of nursing school.   Anyways, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry you have had some terrible experiences with nurses during your treatment. Use those experiences to guide your nursing practice. You are going to be an amazing nurse and have such a positive impact on this world!",False,False

In my program (more than a decade ago) we had one or two days total on nutrition. We had a group project at the end where we were given patient scenarios and to outline nutrition recommendations. One was an overweight teenage girl who wanted to lose weight. My whole group was in favor of telling her to exercise and stop eating junk food. Thatâ€™s when I left my group and finished the project on my own.   I take care of a lot of people with soft pressures who get syncopal pretty easy and getting sugar into them can really help, but relatively few nurses have personally passed out from low blood pressure/low blood sugar so they donâ€™t watch for early signs in people who have a tendency not to eat.  Having an ED has definitely made me a better nurse to my patients.",False,False

All they really cared about was weight restoration and then the patients were discharged. Like thatâ€™s not gonna do shit. If anything thatâ€™s just gonna trigger them to lose all the weight again plus more. It was so frustrating working there and I felt so bad forcing people to eat.",False,False

And worst part is, one of my clinical rotations was an eating disorder unit ðŸ¤¡. I was so triggered I was honestly thinking of dropping out and taking a break from school. I managed to get through it but my eating disorder took a turn for the worse that semester. Right now Iâ€™m doing my final rotation on a mental health unit which is also really triggering for me. It sucks how ignorant some nurses are. But I canâ€™t really blame them, weâ€™re not really taught much about EDs and mental health.

Shit that's a lot of acronyms. lol Even in my psych np program, the teaching on EDs is minimal and I think the only things they teach are to treat bulimia with Prozac and never give Wellbutrin.
