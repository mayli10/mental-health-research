OMAD is not disordered for someone without sm ED if they eat an adequate amount of food. However, no eating disorder dietitian would ever recommend OMAD to someone with an ED. It can be detrimental to people of various diagnoses.",False,False

If your OMAD is only 500kcal then that is probably disordered, but you also have the right to share your experiences here, in a safe space to talk about ED behaviour.  When I said ""they might've forgotten which sub they were in"" I meant tofu\_snob, the person I was responding to, because the way she wrote her comment (""this can lead to disordered eating/EDs"") struck me as unusual in a sub made for people who already have disordered eating/EDs. The impression I got was that she thought she was reading a post about OMAD-ing in a regular weightloss sub, so she was warning non-ED people about OMADs leading to EDs. I didn't mean you, sorry for being misleading.  TL;DR: Wrong person, OMADs aren't disordered but if your OMAD is only 500kcal I would consider that to be disordered eating, but that doesn't mean your post doesn't belong.",False,False

I know what sub I’m in but I didn’t consider this disordered behavior.  I know I’m not in 1200 is plenty.  Sorry if this came across as inconsiderate, I thought it was a good idea. :(",False,True

If you disagree with it then explain why but we're literally not supposed to be endorsing ED behaviours and this person has a point.

People with ED histories also might use OMAD as an excuse to restrict.,False,False

I'm far more comfortable eating pretty much whatever I'd like so long as it's just one meal a day. It helps me keep things feeling normal. Just be sure to keep your meals varried and hitting all your nutritional needs.,False,False
