I don’t think it’s ever not been part of a binge for me.  That said, if it was just one bowl, it’s a standard amount of calories for one meal.  It’s okay.  Normal people eat cereal occasionally.  But if eating cereal makes you feel like shit, maybe take a break from it for a while.  No harm in not doing something that makes you feel shitty.  Maybe if you try something generally considered healthier for your next meal you can avoid a spiral.  You don’t HAVE to spiral.  No one can make you eat or not eat.  Good luck.  I’m rooting for you!",False,False
