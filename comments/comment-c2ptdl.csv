(But then, this is Netflix, home of 13 Reasons Why.)     Much as I often long for more ED-related media - partly *because I want to trigger myself* - I'm convinced it's next to impossible to portray EDs in fiction without creating inadvertent triggers/thinspo, or even actual ~tipz &amp; trickz~. Generally speaking I'm of the ""morality is irrelevant"" and ""you can't obsess over hypothetical triggers"" school of art, but not when it comes to media you KNOW will be consumed by a highly vulnerable demographic.",False,False
