Kombucha has always helped me- but start slow if you start with that! Accepting that my body adjusting (radical acceptance) was a huge help too. You likely hurt your body for a long time, so you can’t expect it to recover overnight! Be patient and do your best to cope with the stress of the digestive pain- because stress only makes digestive pain worse!   I had to recover on my own from Anorexia, so I gradually increased the volume; i Increased my calories quicker than I did the volume (shout out to peanut butter), but food can come so dense or with so much volume! Since I literally lived off liquids for the months leading up to this,I just started with soup/pudding/semi-Solids/etc with a meal shake in small amounts, then moved onto a piece of bread with a meal shake, until I worked my way up to bowls of cereal and sushi or bread! This may or may not be a factor; my body just wasn’t used to digesting so much, nor was it used to having Such a full stomach!",False,False
