I've been attempting to maintain 800 calories average per day so as to extend my weight loss to become a habit rather than going straight back into binging which happens everytime I restrict down to 200.  To make the most out of this average I I've added the 800 * 7 and divided it between the days so most days I end up with 500 maximum most days, but on the weekends I'm supposed to eat 1250... the issue is it is now Saturday and I have yet to eat anything and it is already 2:50 here so now I'm too scared to eat ...

Im trying really hard to like lentils but it just isn't it for me. At best they're tolerable.  So far the only thing I've made with lentils are lentil patties. They're alright, but I've been eating them with ketchup, and tbh i might just throw the rest away. I think they might taste better if they were thinner and crispier. I've looked up recipes with lentils but I'm skeptical of making soup out of them. I just don't think I'll like them. I really want to like them though. I just think that no matter what i make them with, I'm not gonna be able to move past the taste if i even slightly detect the lentils.  Growing up, i hated refried beans and i still refuse to touch them. I haven't really tried other beans before though so this is me trying. I like garbanzo beans, but that feels like cheating.  Anyway, i guess I'm just wondering if anyone has recipes/advice? I genuinely want to eat a wholesome and varied diet and im pretty open when it comes to foods-- beans have always been my one weakness though. I'll happily eat literally anything else. Is it just a matter of sucking it up and getting ised to it sometimes?",False,False
