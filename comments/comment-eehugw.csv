[I alter this recipe a bit and it‚Äôs always a hit.](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/skinny-buffalo-chicken-dip/) With my changes, it‚Äôs like 170~ calories per serving (based on 10 servings in recipe).   Changes: I add one packet of ranch powder mix (0 calories but tons of flavor!) I take out blue cheese and instead add like a 1/4 of white cheddar. I‚Äôm not a fan of blue cheese and the recipe is already quite flavorful. It‚Äôs always a huge hit at parties and I constantly have people asking for the recipe.   I make it with raw chicken in the instant pot or slow cooker. Raw chicken, ranch, and buffalo sauce go into the pot. Cook until shreddable. Mix in the cheese and stuff. You can keep it in the pot, or put it in a dish and top with a little cheese and broil in the oven. It‚Äôs up to you!",False,False

Yesterday we were at my aunt‚Äôs for dinner and I‚Äôd already reached 1300cal for the day and planned to just not eat there. I felt bad because she called to say she made sinigang for us (one of my favorite Filipino dishes), but she always uses the fattiest cut of beef and i could see all the oil separated from the broth. I just said I‚Äôm ok, thank you and asked her how her kids were and stuff. I‚Äôd usually give in to the guilt tripping or whatever, but it never ends well for me.
