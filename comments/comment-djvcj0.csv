When we tell a patient we’re not going to operate on them we do so with the knowledge that they can go down the street and find someone else to take their money and that surgeon may be less capable of providing decent care.    &gt;Plastic surgery is such an ethically gray area   Plastic surgery is still largely reconstruction and complex wound care. Most of my patients work in meat packing facilities or factories and need reconstruction of various body parts to function normal. Which isn’t a uniquely gray area in medicine. Some plastic surgeons don’t do cosmetic surgery. Lots of surgeons who market themselves as *cosmetic* surgeons are not plastic surgeons at all.    &gt;honestly some of that shit should be illegal   Maybe, but right now law enforcement is focusing on pill mills, which do greater societal harm. I suspect unethical cosmetic surgeons (or surgeons in general— spine surgeons do plenty of unnecessary surgery) will never rise to that level of scrutiny.",False,False

Depending on the type of lipo, you can end up with visible divots in the skin that are more disfiguring than the fat itself was. If you don’t have a fatty deposit (like muffin top or saddle bags), the surgeon may end up doing surgery too superficially and put you at increased risk for a deformity.    Doctors shouldn’t do surgery on people who are not candidates, and if they do, that’s unethical because the risks outweigh the benefits. There’s actually a fairly high mortality rate after lipo (usually when the volume removed is excessive).    In someone who doesn’t need lipo, the doctor may end up taking out 100-200ml total, because that’s all they can safely do, and less than half of that will be fat (most will be tumescence).    Liposuction doesn’t address skin and I’ve seen very thin women get their inner thighs and medial knees done because it’s the only fat left on them, and then they have these weird  skin flaps left in those areas. These were office workers too, taking advantage of free surgery they didn’t need and I don’t think they were happy with the outcomes years later.",False,False
