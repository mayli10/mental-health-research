The same way that Ed's can cause heart damage that does not reverse after recovery, damage to reproductive function can not always be reversed.",False,False

It won't fuck up your metabolism, but your weight post recovery may be higher/lower than pre-recovery. Depends on the stage in your life you were in before your ED, hormonal levels and several other things. But your metabolism itself is highly unlikely to be damaged permanently. For that to happen you need to have either fewer cells or a slower rate of cell respiration. If you're lighter you have fewer cells and a slower metabolism. If you're less active your rate of cell respiration is lower because you need less energy. I'm not sure how having anorexia would reduce rate of cell respiration other than having low weight/no energy, but I am not an expert.",False,False

I even consulted my endocrinologist about it and he said it was very unlikely to happen (however, he didn’t say ‘impossible’, so who knows).  regarding infertility, I have no clue, but I read some comments of people with anorexia who also have kids, so I guess it depends on how low your weight is and how much your hormones have been affected by the disorder.",False,False
