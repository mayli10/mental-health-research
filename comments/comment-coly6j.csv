But your claimed ""weekly net average"" calories (even if you mean *per day, in a given week,* and I'm taking you at your word) is unquestionably at an anorexic level. Yet you are gaining weight, you say, and I believe you.   If you truly need to lose weight, this has to be driving you batshÂ°t. I won't insult you with simplistic explanations. I just affirm you, and I suggest you give your regimen time. Our metabolisms are complex and even when we are healthy with no eating disorders we are prone to get conflicting or idiosyncratic outcomes at least in the short term. But absent any pathology, our bodies stabilize with time. So patiently track your intake, weight and other metrics, and make prudent adjustments.  Don't despair, and certainly avoid panic. Stay safe, and I wish you well.",False,False
