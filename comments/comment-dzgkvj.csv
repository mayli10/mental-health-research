I've spent most of my childhood and teenage years consumed with thought of being worthless and a failure and have based most my life decisions on that. I have no concept to who I am outside my eating disorder and that's scary.,False,False

I feel like as I’ve gotten older (29, married, fat) I don’t have a lot of the stuff that made me me when I was younger, including my ED. I also have bipolar disorder, and since getting the right meds I’m not as artsy or spontaneous or interesting as I used to be. It’s a tough trade off because my disorder was constantly making me miserable and fucking up my life, but it also made me me. I liked/made music, books, film, weirdo fashion. Now I’m a normie adult and often feel like I don’t have a personality or interests anymore because there’s no connecting thread—obsession with weight loss, casual sex, other young people stuff.   I think losing the ED can feel like a partial loss of yourself. But maybe part of it too is accepting that you are older and not the person you used to be, which then brings the question, well who am I now? But that is part of aging and could be exciting in certain ways. Without an ED (and maybe some therapy for the trauma) you can be more than that, and it’s ok that it takes time. 28 isn’t youth but it’s definitely not too late.",False,False

Just turned 28 and kicked my drinking habit, only to relapse back into restricting. I really relate with feeling like you don’t have an identity past the ED. For me, even tho most people don’t know I struggle on and off with an ED, I’m still labeled as the “tiny, thin girl” and I have internalized that as my personality and identity. Without that, I’m just, I don’t know what I am.",False,False

I really can't talk about it: I can say that your not alone in your feelings and actions about this.  I am 49 years old.... I feel VERY similar, and I don't ever see it changing for me either.   I can say that FUCK them, it isn't and has never been your fault. (hugs)",False,False

I am 35, as long as I can remember I had a problem with food. It was only in my formative years I saw it as a problem. I have written about it in other posts so I won’t go into too much detail basically to sum it up.  I began to lose weight in my late teens early 20’s. As I gained independence and attended colleague. I began to perform dangerous levels of exercise, food restricting and alcohol consumption. This behaviour continued post-graduation and through my career as an engineer.   It was only when I reached a weight (that I have spoken about in other posts) that I was forced to seek treatment. Though I drift back in and out of my ED.   My ED years I refer to as “the things lost in the fire.” My life became defined by ED behaviour. I picked the events I attended based on my ED. Made friends based on my ED and chose career paths based on my ED.           I volunteered as a first aider and with local charities because I wanted to offset the shame and guilt I felt from BP and restricting. I never progressed as an adult. I never matured. I moved back with my parents and when my friends married and progressed their lives, I kept living safe me and my ED. I have a good job. Worked on a lot of big building projects but at the heart of it. I don’t want to commit to anything cause when I have to choose, I will choose my ED.   Don’t get me wrong I wouldn’t miss a shift with my charity groups or miss a wedding with friends. I would just plan it around my ED.   I never really do or did what I wanted I only do or did what it needed to hide or protect my ED. Its who I am.   Like you I never created personality based on what I wanted in my teen years. I lived my choices for my ED.   I just wanted to post and share. You’re not alone, you’re not the only one I guess. Hope my posting helped.",False,False
