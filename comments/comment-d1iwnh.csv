If I’m eating semi-normally I’ll barely notice how other people are eating but as soon as I’m restricting more I’m all “omg have you eaten yet today? Can I make you something? It’s so important to eat three meals a day! Oh dw I already ate :) you should eat too!!” while sitting there with no food in front of me,False,False
