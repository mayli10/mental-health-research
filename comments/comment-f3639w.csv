You‚Äôre definitely right.. I don‚Äôt want to admit that I can‚Äôt control myself when I‚Äôm high, but I know I literally use it as an excuse to binge. It‚Äôs like if I‚Äôm high I don‚Äôt have ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù over my actions so if I binge it‚Äôs not my fault bc I was high. Some backwards enabling thinking huh  I have to stop associating being high with food. Every time before I smoke I tell myself I don‚Äôt need to eat a bunch of food, and that I can just do other stuff high and be totally fine. But I always end up caving in and eating everything in sight.. I regret it every single time. The binge is never worth the outcome is it :(",False,False

Munchies are extremely common and it sounds to me like you probably accidentally built a habit. Maybe I'm projecting but that was a huuuuge thing for me. I'd do the same thing where'd I'd consistently overeat whenever I got high.  What worked for me was breaking that specific habit of eating after smoking. Or, specifically, eating when I got munchies.  The first smoke while trying to break that habit freaking sucks. All I wanted to do was get some snacks! But waiting out the munchies is what finally got me out of there. The second time is easier. The third time is even easier than that.  The key for me was just getting through that first smoke sesh &amp; munchies without eating. If you're like me you will wanna give up. But stick it through! Try to stick it through for just three smoke sessions. Get yourself a bunch of drinks (they don't need to be low calorie either, just pick whatever you like!) and try to set yourself up with something distracting like a movie or video game. If you decide you want to ride out this high without eating, commit to that decision! (But don't beat yourself up if things go differently)  I feel shady giving advice that essentially equates to ""don't eat for a while"" but I'm not suggesting restricting or cutting calories or nutrition at all, just breaking the habit of eating after smoking. Honestly I would never suggest it except that it helped me feel so so so much better when I was able to assess my habits and stop them from taking me to dangerous places. I related to your post a lot so I thought I'd share. Oh god sorry this comment turned into a novel",False,False
