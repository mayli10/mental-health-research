Recovery isn’t about the numbers - it’s about making peace with whatever is your focus (food, body, weight, calorie numbers, control, etc) and moving to a neutral place with food. If you were malnourished enough to be tubed (or defiant, or both) they likely won’t give your concerns about calories the time of day, because it’s an ED behavior to hyperfocus on such.   I don’t know if you’re sanctioned (I’m assuming you are given the circumstances), but if you are, make the best out of it. If you’re sanctioned, you’re not getting out of there Until you meet their predetermined goals, no matter how much you may disagree. So, why not give it a try? The worst that can happen is... you get out sooner than later &amp; are able to enjoy more of life? Mental health facilities SUCK.   Look- either way, ED behaviors will always be there when you get out, but if you’re stuck there regardless, might as well give it a genuine shot? If that makes sense. Best of luck and much love. ❤️",False,False
