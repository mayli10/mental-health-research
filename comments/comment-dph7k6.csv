I can’t properly digest food so I’m either diarrhea-ing everything or being forced to purge from the sheer discomfort and pain (like wtf? I think my pancreas is fucked because I get stabbing pains in the pancreatic/gall bladder area when food is left too long in my body). I legit had the same meal tho in the morning of white rice and stir fry veggies but of course I decided to binge on all the rice and purge because I was very very uncomfortable with the food I initially ate. Seriously, there’s nothing I can eat at this point. Can’t even properly process soggy as vegetables that literally dissolve in the mouth because I’ve boiled the shit out of it. Like I’m literally at a loss on what to do. As the day goes i feel like I’m getting dumber too cuz no brain food. Can’t be productive and get shit done. I’m a human vegetable b/ping my day away or sleeping beyond normal from the sheer exhaustion of it all.",False,False

The more often you eat, the better your bowels will heal and the less uncomfortable you'll feel when you eat. Avoid any spicy food. If you have to eat only oatmeal for a week, just do that. But make sure that you make your digestive organs work continuously. Purging is incredibly damaging and can sometimes take months to fix.  My psychologist told me that if you purge every day, then you just choose one day a week where you don't purge. Then after a month, you choose another day, etc. It might take a year to have a 3 or 4-day streak. But it's always so much better than purging everything.  It's also important to not feel hungry. You want to eat but you're scared of calories? Eat an entire cucumber at 11pm, it's like 20 calories. I know that impulse eating is something I struggle with and I like to have only ""empty calories"" when I feel this happen. It's important to NOT keep triggering foods within reach. You have to make a special effort to binge. Make it difficult for yourself. Make it embarrassing. Go to the same store and meet with the same cashier every time. Yeah she saw you yesterday with enough food for 4. And she will see you again today. And maybe tomorrow. And maybe day after tomorrow you'll be too embarrassed to get your binge food and you won't b/p.",False,False
