I used to only restrict and then once I tried eating normally to recover, I started purging. Look up purging disorder, it’s different from bulimia. It’s really hard because trying to “fix” one behavior just kind of triggers the other. If I eat enough food, I have a compulsion to purge it. But if I try to avoid purging, I restrict. You’re not alone with this. &lt;3",False,False

Purging will end up destroying your entire life and mindset even if it seems harmless at first, so don't go down that road. It may be tempting to do it again (although it doesn't sound like you want to), but it's not worth it.  Also, lenny and larry cookies are like crack. We've all been there, it's okay.",False,False

I doubt that these protein cookies would have made you gain and if anything they probably would have helped with building back muscle considering how much you exercised.   I was once in your same position some 4 years ago and that led to a bulimic cycle (b/p) up until recently. You will not gain weight from one binge; I gained weight from almost daily b/p sessions over the course of several years. Key word: several years.   Please please talk to your therapist about this. Maybe they can help you work out some techniques to stop the binging when you want to binge. Drinking water and waiting 15 minutes, going for a walk, eating a little of what you want to ""binge"" on and immediately putting that item away. But please just try to remember that what you ate with those cookies was definitely not enough to make you gain. Purging is definitely not a habit you want to keep up.  Stay safe.",False,False

This is pretty common - my therapist always says recovery is like a game of Wac-A-Mole because EDs are sneaky. You’re not alone, OP &lt;3",False,False
