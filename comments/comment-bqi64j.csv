Before I was very overweight (434 lbs) and I was constantly hungry. I'm not 100% sure but I think I might have just been malnourished and that's why I was hungry all the time. Even being painfully full I still wanted to eat. I basically just lived on carbs, lots of bread, pizza, cereal, frozen burritos. My thinking is maybe if I ate more balanced then I would have been satisfied and not needed to eat as much.  I ended up doing keto and fasting and lost all the weight but now I'm terrified of going back to my old self so I find it hard to allow myself to eat but I also crave getting to a lower weight as it's one of the only things that makes me happy. From the fasting I've gotten used to the hunger and it no longer bothers me. When I have tried to recover I've gotten extreme hunger and it reminds me of my old constant hunger. Maybe your dad is in the same situation. I remember being frustrated that I would eat until my stomach would hurt and then maybe an hour later i'd be wanting to eat again. Nothing satisfied my hunger and towards the end I kinda hated eating since it was never ending. Because of this I lived on Soylent for a few months before keto but that only made me crave food more.  I found this video interesting in regards to always being hungry and being overweight. https://youtu.be/KHaCKudtVi0",False,False

Trying to get my mum to lose weight hasnâ€™t worked very well tbh but the most progress Iâ€™ve had is when I havenâ€™t really talked about weight but how I want her to get stronger and healthier so that sheâ€™ll be more mobile now and in her old age. Expressing worry about the things that weâ€™re able to do together, having fun, even going on a simple walk!! Like she had to refuse because she was so inactive and got foot pain.  These kinds of concrete experiences that sheâ€™s missing out on was far more important and tangible than getting down to her lw or getting nice clothes.   So for your dad I think that you should try to express your worry for him in whatever way you feel is appropriate. Idk if thatâ€™s a sit down serious conversation and you said that you donâ€™t think thereâ€™s anything you could say. Well I thought that to but doctorâ€™s advice, vague â€˜we need to be healthyâ€™ never worked. It was genuine: I want to have a better relationship with you, I want to spend time with you, Iâ€™m worried all the time, the future, super stressed etc that actually helped things click",False,False
