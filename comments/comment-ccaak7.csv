Whom I told about meeting a (new) friend and deciding to eat a burger on a very full terrace cause I could tell friend was hungry. When she asked how I managed to eat a burger I said burgers aren't that big of a deal, bacon is the worst part.   Psychologist somehow assumed this ment I was over the disordered eating cause 'I said it wasn't that big of a deal. But I simply ment it didn't have to much calories and was in my limit.'.    So next appt she says she thinks I have lost even more weight and I said it must be the clothes since scale keeps saying I'm the same. For multiple days now.    She asks me if I'm still on a diet....      Turns out I'm her first ed patient.      My gp also acted like an ass and must also not have any experience with Ed patients.     You can select doctors on their experience, you can forgive people for mistakes.    People are human.  Sometimes nothing one will say will be OK.   That's why venting and rants are nice.    Sometimes all that works is accepting that asking for help means that everything will be harder at first.   But life is worth it.",False,True
