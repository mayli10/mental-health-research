We'll I hope no matter what weight you're at you have an awesome prom!

I am now thankfully moving into recovery.  The typical talk about starvation mode is pretty abstracted from real research. I do know that at my low weight (BMI 16.9) I was gaining weight despite supposedly having a TDEE of 1800, eating ~1000 calories a day and burning ~400 in the gym 6-7 days a week.   But, it took me 8 months of severe starvation to get to that point and I still haven't seen any actual scientific evidence supporting what was happening to my body, so maybe something else was going on.",False,False

I will definitely keep those things in mind. I surely don’t want to fall into this binge/restrict cycle again.

Your ""metabolism"" will not ""tank"". That's not how it works. The only thing they're right about is that an extreme caloric defect could lead to muscle wasting if you don't keep up your resistance training and protein intake.   ""Metabolism"" is just all your body's processes, not some mystical force that can go awry and make you fat. u/sugafreedreams explained it very well. Your body takes less energy to run when it is smaller, and if you're undereating you will likely expend a little less through fidgeting and other subconscious habits or forms/speed of movement. This all might amount to a couple of hundred calories *at most*, and it will not happen in a sudden or unmanageable way.  40lbs in 3 months is a lot, and that speed of weight loss will likely be unsustainable. You will get very hungry, and likely have a hard time keeping it up. I'm not sure exactly what you're asking in your op... Are you asking someone to tell you how to make this happen? Or to tell you that you're not going to do any damage by trying? Where did the 40lbs in 3 months goal come from? ",False,False

Your total calories burned may be like 100-200 calories lower than expected after extreme weight loss. It's not something that you can really blame weight changes on though, because if you do end up re-gaining the weight after losing it, that 100 calories had very little to do with it. You can also make up for it by eating a high-protein diet, which encourages muscle growth and increases the amount of calories your body burns digesting food.  The bigger problem for you would face with 500 calories is the persistent hunger that will hit you once you hit your goal. 500 calories for months signals to the body that a period of famine is happening, so your body gets ready to eat as much food as possible when the starvation is over so you'll survive the next famine. This is why many people experience extreme hunger and aren't satisfied unless they eat +4000 calories every day when they start to recover from their ED. ""Hunger debt"" from intense caloric restriction has racked up over time and strikes back when calories are increased to maintenance and the body notices food is available again. This extreme hunger is also often described as ""falling into a binge cycle"" if the person doesn't intend to recover.",False,False
