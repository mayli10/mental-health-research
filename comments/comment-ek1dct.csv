I feel so awful and disgusted. Iâ€™m having trouble going back to restriction but hoping I can get back to a weight where I can be happy and social again.,False,False

It was too easy for me to let go. A whole year of progress was wasted in 5 weeks.  Now I don't want to be social or leave the house until I lose it, but who knows how long that will take me with my food addiction..  So sorry you are going through this.",False,False

It got so bad that I couldn't leave the house anymore (it took a year before I was able to again), and it just seemed like no one cared. I also got the closest I have ever been to killing myself, but I got picked up by the police.   I lost the weight, got nearly back to my low weight, and then it happened again. Only that time I started purging. I still gained weight, but it was slower, which made it easier. Not great for my teeth though.  Now trying to lose the weight again, because otherwise I can't get help. right? If no one is worried that I'm going to drop dead, what is even the point? (I'm an idiot)  I hope things get better for you. It's an awful spot to be in.",False,False

Anorexia snaps, turns into binge/purge, but you can't really overcome the binging so you put on weight and instead of hungry but in control you just feel like a sick crazy person.",False,False

I thought it was what I was supposed to do and I gained 40lbs in like 2 months.   I lost my mind immediately. I spiraled so badly it was insane.  I have now lost 30 of those pounds and my relation ship with food is so much better.  When I was heavier I felt so out of control and like I wasn't myself. I felt like an imposter had stolen my body and mind.   Pushing restriction eating disorder suffers into the opposite spectrum....is still an eating disorder. It really shows that people don't know the wide array and spectrum of EDs. Many people refuse to believe binge eating disorder is a real thing despite so many people suffering from it.,False,False

I'm so touched by your words and infinitely grateful - no joke. Thank you for taking the trouble to write this long text, it means a lot to me. Right now that I'm struggeling so bad, your encouragement is balm for my soul. I very much hope that everything will get better soon.

When I got to a higher weight due to binges I felt utterly lost, as if everything was taken away from me and I didn't know who I was. I went from somebody who exercised regularly, made sure to eat 100% clean, to somebody who didn't exercise and ate like crap. I couldn't even do some moves I used to do. I refused to meet my friends, made up stories that ""I was away"" or ""travelling"" and all that bullshit because I was too disgusted with my body. I couldn't recognize my face in mirrors. It was horrible. Much, much more horrible than being underweight. I actually loved my life when I was underweight.   Unfortunately for me, I don't think I can return to seeing things normally again after all of this. I'm slowly getting back to my lw, and I am somewhat glad of those binges because they taught me an important lesson: both about myself and about others.    I know you're going through hell right now. I can't say anything else to you besides the fact that you're not alone... Other people don't think about you as much as you think they do, and even when they do, don't let that get to you, because you are the sailor of your own life, you are strong and beautiful, and don't have to listen to them. Let them speak, because they don't know any better. Everything is going to pass, maybe like a gentle breeze of wind, or maybe like a tumultuous hurricane, but in the end, everything will pass :). I wish you all the best from the bottom of my heart!!",False,False
