I'm sure i would on 1500 too but I feel more comfy in the 1300-1400 range. 1600 would probably be slow loss but definitely below maintenance/gain if you kept it up.,False,False

You mentioned you have an active job and walk to class so your TDEE is likely much above 1600.  Our disordered brains normalize such weird shit that seeing a normal calorie amount makes it seem really high.,False,False
