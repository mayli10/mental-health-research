That way you're getting a balance of nutrients. I'd steer clear of Boost and Ensure if you can (especially Boost) but those are also options if you're desperate.  Also, could you reach out to friends/family? It's hard to do it alone and you deserve some love and support in this. Good luck &lt;3",False,False
