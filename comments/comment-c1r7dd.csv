I too am trans, with an unsupportive mother, and my ED continues to be all caught up in those things. You are in a very tough position right now. But if there's any chance at all you can get help for the ED separately from your gender stuff (I know this sounds nonsensical to you right now), I would encourage you to try. Anorexia gets more and more difficult to treat the longer it goes on. You are currently in that golden window where there's a really good chance you can make a full recovery. That is truly a gift...please consider using it. EDs are a common but very dangerous coping mechanism for situations like yours.  Does your mom know about the ED, and is her position that you now aren't allowed to get medical treatment for *anything* (unless you agree to desist, I assume)? In many American states, that is medical neglect, and it's illegal. Are you in the U.S.?   I'm so so sorry you're going through this.",False,False

I was in this situation when I was 14 and getting help is so so worth it.,False,False
