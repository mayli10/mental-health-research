I like playing a math genius in my head. I have to be skinny for this role. So I'm a genius and because all my existence is completely dedicated to my math I forget to eat. If I don't forget to eat I'm not a genius but I can do OMAD as a replacement for forgetting about food too, because I'm so completely dedicated to my math or art I can only make time for food once a day.

When authors describe seeing a character for the first time, I always try to imagine how I'd be described. It feels like setting myself up for failure, but I'm determined to have someone say I'm lithe and cat-like one day.",False,True

I want to be an ethereal fantasy character who is above human folly like eating and fainting and weakness. I want to be the girl with a dark and mysterious secret, the one everyone wonders about because they know something's up but they don't know what. I want to be at a distance from everyone else, special, unique, like a withdrawn heroine in a fantasy adventure.",False,False
