Kinda like fatlogic itself.,False,False

Like if i went somewhere for honest feedback and was told ‚Äúyeah, you do look xyz‚Äù I‚Äôd be devastated, whether they were serious or just a troll who hadn‚Äôt gotten banned yet  Overall though i think it‚Äôs a good idea, esp for ppl w body dysmorphia since i have no idea what i look like lmao. But it might be hard to pull off",False,False

It was just a last resort because it‚Äôs the only sub that‚Äôd let me promote. I tried r/bodypositive and r/curvygirls but they said that they didn‚Äôt have room for that.

Also you‚Äôre saying in this post that it promotes body acceptance but the actual sub‚Äôs description doesn‚Äôt really give any indication of that. Also the subreddit you promoted it in isn‚Äôt exactly known for body acceptance.   If your intentions were to promote body acceptance that‚Äôs one thing, maybe you‚Äôre getting downvoted because it didn‚Äôt come across that way.",False,False

Maybe not inherently, I'm sure you had good intentions (I.e. how do others ee me because I can't tell bc of body dysmorphia) but there's a lot of unkind and unfriendly people out there. There's whole subreddits devoted to the vitrolic hatred of overweight people. People rushing to say underweight people are ideal. A whole bevvy of other negative thing towards others bodies- hell I look at some of those subreddits to trigger myself, and I have a feeling that's what would happen in a subreddit like that.   Also- you chose to promote it on lat fogic, a sub literally dedicated to making fun of larger people, and who have their own distorted view of weight- are those the kinds of people that should be labelling whether people are skinny or fat? There's just too many things logistically wrong with the odea for it to be viable.",False,False
