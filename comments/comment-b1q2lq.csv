That's when I started carrying it in my bag. I switched to mornings because if I forget at least there is no 6+ hours delay if I miss it, I usually realise it after a few hours. And my wake up alarm clock serves as reminder. While I work it's OK because I don't eat breakfast. But when I'm at home I sometimes start eating earlier and you know the rest.   Another reason why I switched to morning is because I used to smoke weed in the evening and it's not the best to combine with THC as it can increase ovaries/uterus cancer risks (and I was so stoned I would just forget what the alarm is for). I don't smoke now so I'll try switching back haha ",False,True

I keep the packaging on my bed stand and that's how I remember it when I'm at home. But that doesn't work for when I'm not and I end up forgetting it a few times every month and it's really not good haha.   I'll try to change it to evening again, because morning is definitely not for me ðŸ˜…",False,True
