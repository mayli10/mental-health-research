That way she’s doing some of the work for you. You can even say “I liked your profile because of XYZ, do you have anyone you recommend?”  Is there anyone else in your life who can help make the calls for you?  Hang in there. The process sucks a lot, especially at times like this and it’s totally normal to feel tired and like giving up.   Having been through the process a few times myself, I’ve always felt that it was worthwhile once I was “on the other side” and finally matched with a clinician I liked but before that point I remember feeling frustrated and discouraged and just exhausted.   Hope you find what you need!!",False,False

Please know that it’s also ok if this therapist isn’t a perfect fit or doesn’t have openings for new clients.   Finding a therapist can take time and that’s normal too. Try to keep your motivation up if that happens.   Good therapy is worth it!!,False,False
