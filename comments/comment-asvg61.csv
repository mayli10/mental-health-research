And it took me a long time to handle it in a way I can even talk about it. And over the years I realized I was slowly becoming a black holes by grieving as hard as I was ( I stopped eating, a lot of alcohol was involved.  It was rough. It's hard to think about still. )   But, one thing dawned on me one day after I survived a suicide attempt due to my sorrow.  My epiphany was that I'd never want to see my mother suffer this kind of pain over me. I think she's the most beautiful woman in the world, the strongest woman in the world and above all, I never want to see her be sad, especially over me. I'd take all her pain in life if I could. But I realized by trying to kill myself, I was going to make her suffer pain.  &amp; After that I realized just like my thoughts about my mom, if my child was here they would have wanted me to be happy and healthy. They would've looked up to me. They would've seen me as the most beautiful woman in their life..No matter my flaws, no matter my weight, no matter my mistakes. Just like I view my mom  ...So I chose to start trying to honor myself as a way of honoring them and as a way of honoring my mother. I finally quit drinking, I started to gain responsibility again, I stopped worrying about my weight so much, I tried to be happy for my baby. Even if they aren't around.   I don't know if this will help you find any comfort but it helped me.  Your child would love you for who you are. Even with the ""extra"" pounds.  Be strong fellow Mama. &lt;3  You are loved. I wish you the best of luck in all your endeavors.   If you ever need to talk or rant, feel free to message/chat me or join us over at r/mothersofangels   ",False,False
