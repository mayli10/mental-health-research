Like a dog doesn't really do anything, it's just itself and we love it anyway. Cats can be little shits but we still love them just because. They don't have to do anything to be enough (that's if they're in a solid family, if they're being mistreated that's on the abusers).   Anyway I know I get a lot of thoughts about not being pretty/skinny/smart/successful/productive/happy enough, and then I think about my cat which just wandered around the house and sleeping and yet we all loved him so much. We're enough for 'just' existing too üíï",False,False
