Doesn't help than my TDEE is very low because of my height and sedentary job. Years of extreme yo-yoing in weight have taught me that I can't just ""eat intuitively"" because I always overestimate how much food I need based on what the taller, more active people around me are eating. I definitely cannot eat the same calories as my 5'10"" active husband, but dammit if I'm not counting I will.   Also, a decade plus of disordered eating pretty much ruined my ability to eat intuitively so idk if that works for other people tbh. My mom seems to be fine not counting.",False,False
