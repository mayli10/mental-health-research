I started upping my calories closer to maitenance lately because I was having scary symptoms and getting too close to being underweight. Well, then of course I feel guilty and like I'm going to surely get fat again. It's an ongoing conflict in my mind. When I feel like my body is shutting down and my health is going downhill, I panic and start eating more; then, when I feel better and am actually functioning again, I panic that I'm gonna get fat and start restricting again. It's a predictable pattern at this point. ",False,False

I cry when i have to eat on a regular basis, and i cry if i go a day or two without food. It's honestly extremely exhausting, especially with my other mental disorders. I send hugs your way",False,False

I had a near panic in my Uber today because I was having level 9 anxiety and wasn't sure if my heart was going fast because I haven't had enough CALoRiEs yet today or if my heart was going fast because I've been anxious all day or if my heart was going fast because I started medication for anxiety and depression. I then scarfed down a luna bar and I regret because now I can't have a usual sized dinner tonight because I'm so close to my CALoRiEs. Anxious I'm gonna die if I don't eat. Anxious I'm gonna get fat and deserve to die if I DO eat. Fuck me. ,False,False
