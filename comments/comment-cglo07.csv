I make up this whole conversation in my head where I lie about having eaten and they ask me about it just to kind of talk. So I have started taking measures to avoid having to talk about it too much. They think I’m just being tidy but I wash plates/bowls and utensils after I finish eating so even when I’m lying I have done my usual after food thing.,False,False

I’d leave a bowl with the smallest amount of milk and like one cornflake or whatever so that my mom would get mad at me for not putting my dishes into the dish washer vs her hounding me for not eating.  Now, being older and whatever I just kind of don’t bother unless I’m doing extended non food periods. I try to eat small things through the day so she’ll see me eat dinner or whatever and feel okay about my food habits ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",False,False
