It’s ok to tell her you need some space to let go of your feelings before you try and just be friends.   How are you supposed to go from kissing and sleeping with someone for months and then just not even touch them the next?  The added weight might be your body just holding onto water bc alcohol is very dehydrating. I know this is hard to do, but try doing something new that doesn’t involve your ex. It helps get your mind off of them and it gives you something else to talk about with your friends. Come here if you need to chat about the breakup.   Go with your friends to help distract you from your break up.",False,False

My gf broke up with me a few months ago for the same sort of reason, to work on her mental health. We tried being friends but she ghosted me after a while. I know she was concerned I wasn't going to get over her if we still talked...which was true lmao.  I had never been dumped before either, it's a uniquely bad feeling and it has for sure triggered a relapse for me.  Not to make your post about me, just trying to show that at least you aren't alone in how you feel I guess?",False,False

I've never been broke up with before, it's always been me making the decision. And it's such a weird situation because we both don't really want this. It's amazing how much it just hurts.",False,True

So sorry you are going through that. They kill self-esteem and all we want is security and love again. They are brutal. You are worth it. You will make it through. I tried being friends with an ex so I understand how rough it is when the feelings are still so strong. Sending good thoughts your way.,False,False
