My beloved sister is getting married in 2 months and I'm sooo scared of not losing enough weight by then. Like it's definitely crossed my mind to not go if I don't look good enough. I'm scared of ruining the wedding photos with how fat I look and having those pictures as a constant reminder that I failed. It feels shallow, but it's mental illness and we can only do our best to cope however we can and sometimes that means making sacrifices and putting ourselves first, even if it feels really shitty at the same time. Best of luck!",False,False
