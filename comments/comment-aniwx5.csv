But I think most people just don't have any experience with it. They treat EDs like a legend that only exists in textbooks, nobody *really* gets those these days! /s",False,False

Just burn more than you eat and you'll weight-you don't even have to be hungry if you make really good food choices because you can eat a lot of veggies and the like""   Blank stares half the time.  I've had a lot of people argue with me that's there's no way this works because they tried it and it didn't work for them.  I have to be doing something else like keto or whatever.  Then I being up my 600 pound life. Most of those people say diets never worked for them but as soon as they start to follow doctors advice they lose rapidly. So that's kinda proof to me.   I have PCOS and there are A LOT of people in that community that say that it in and of itself makes it impossible to lose weight. I'm here with my severe case of it (that needed surgery twice) to tell you that's not the case.   Losing weight can be hard and frustrating though sometimes even when you aren't disordered so I try to just let it ride.     🤷🤷🤷🤷🤷🤷🤷🤷🤷🤷🤷🤷🤷🤷🤷🤷",False,False
