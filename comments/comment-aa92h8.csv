I'm currently staying with my mum for the holidays and I'll be leaving next week. I think when I get back I'll be in contact with my uni's healthcare. We were talking about the possibility that I'd stay here with my mum to recover but I just can't leave my studies even though I've been really considering staying here for a while.    For now I'm slowly increasing my calorie intake first to 1000 and then by 200 every few days. The whole refeeding syndrome kind of freaks me out, it would be pretty ironic if I accidentally killed myself by eating after killing myself with starving lmao. Even though I don't exactly feel like I'm at a risk of that, or maybe I'm just shrugging off my actual condition I don't know. Even now I still don't feel sick enough and that's honestly so ridiculous.    I'm just not sure how I'll ever be able to eat enough to actually start gaining weight. Sure it will be easy to maintain I guess but obviously no one should be maintaining a weight this small. When it comes to frequency, is it okay to eat every 2 to 3 hours or should I be eating more often or farther apart? Should I eat when I feel like it, even if it was pretty much all the time? I'm quite scared of losing it and not being able to stop eating even though that shouldn't be my concern at all right now.    Again, thank you so much to you and everyone who has left a comment. I really appreciate you all. Take care. ",False,True

I made myself very very sick trying to refeed on my own (I lost even more weight, and my liver function was 10 times the normal amount, among other electrolyte abnormalities, low blood sugar, and fuck-y heart rhythm), now I'm looking at \~6 weeks in hospital. If you really can't go to the closest emergency department, or insist on doing this yourself, slow and steady is the key. I don't know how helpful this would be for you, but for reference, my experience (once in hospital) has been \~700kcal via tube feed, plus around 600kcal oral intake, increasing according to various parameters in my blood work (electrolytes, liver and kidney function, etc); the tube feed was increased to \~900kcal a couple days ago, and I'm on a oral meal plan of maybe 1000\~1200kcal. NO ACTIVITY I cannot stress this enough, you literally can't afford to use energy for anything but simply keeping your organs from shutting down.

They won’t admit you immediately because it’s not immediately life threatening but they will see you that day and hopefully arrange some kind of referral for treatment.  I started writing out suggestions for TDEE and gradually increasing your calories per day but 39kg at your height is so so low. I’m 171cm and when I was 47kg I was a stick so I can’t imagine how thin you must be. Please just seek medical advice ASAP. ,False,False

At this point, I don’t think 12-30 year olds on the internet should advise.  There must be a way for you to access medical care (hospital or clinical).  Are you in college?  Then care would be free to you.  Until then, add some ensures to your day.  Get at least 800 calories if you’re only eating that much.  Don’t exercise.  Please take this seriously.  ",False,False

Of course, it's less risky than continuing on the path you're currently on, but the risk for refeeding syndrome is quite high at your stats. If, for whatever reasons, medical help isn't possible, I do know a few things you should keep in mind-  You need a helluva lot more calories than you'll think you do. Not only do you need to be eating enough calories to gain weight, you need to eat *even more than that* so that your body has extra energy to use to heal itself. When I was in inpatient, they doubled our TDEEs for our daily calorie intake.   Intuitive eating is simply impossible after such an extreme period of starvation. Your hunger cues are all wacky and on top of that, unfortunately, eating is going to be quite uncomfortable and that will make you inclined to stop before you've had enough. Heating pads, hot tea, stretching, and gentle walks can help relieve that discomfort. Antacids and bubbly drinks will be your friends.   You don't have to worry too much about eating healthy right now. In fact, the high fat, high carb foods that are often scary for people like us are *exactly* what you need. Furthermore, eating high calorie foods can often be more physically comfortable because you don't have to eat as much of it. An 800 calorie cheeseburger won't hurt a stomach that used to being empty as much as 800 calories and fruits and veggies would.   On a final note- Fat. Is. Not. Bad. I know that by our nature we feel like it is, but it's not. It is as vital as any other body part. Healthy people have fat. You will gain fat, but that's exactly what you need to do. You need fat as much as you need your heart, your skin, your kidneys, etc. You will, eventually, gain muscle. In the beginning though, the majority of the weight you gain will, likely, be fat, because thats what your body needs *immediately.* Once you're healthier you will have all of the time in the world to use the new energy and vitality you'll have to get fit and toned.
