It doesn't matter if she sees it as teasing, its still okay to stand up for yourself. I used to be in the same situation where my colleague would comment on my meals *and* compare me to her daughter who was also diagnosed with an eating disorder. I spoke up even though it was awkward and shared an office with her, but she did stop.   I was just playing devil's advocate because intermittent fasting was recommended. And yes, people eat more than one sandwich sometimes. Not everyone is an intuitive eater, but there are times where I am not satiated by one sandwich (namely because mine are not very high in calories).   I never said she's the victim. She isn't. I am just trying to point out the way you discussed the situation can be hurtful to others in this community that are also overweight, but more importantly give advice about how you can help the situation.",False,False

First I was a little concerned you didn't season it at all but figured that's your choice. People have food aversions and stuff.  Then you said you used salt, which IMO isn't the same as ""not seasoning your food"". Salt is enough to bring out the flavour of the meat itself (idk how you cooked it but especially if you browned it), and meat + veg is a solid flavour combo. Like yeah it's gonna be plain but there's a difference between plain and flavourless.  Then I thought, do sauces like teriyaki, marinara or mayo even count as ""seasoning""?? Your coworker wigging out about not seasoning your meat but then only thinking of putting premade sauce on it is... confusing to me. To me seasoning food means adding herbs and spices as you cook it to complement the flavours of whatever you're cooking. Putting teriyaki or marinara on it is just... putting sauce on unseasoned meat to make it taste like that sauce. I don't see how it's any better or worse. What if you enjoy the taste of the meat and you don't want it to taste like sauce???  Then people in the comments comparing salt to cyanide...  Whatever, OP. You do you, your lunch sounded tasty enough to me. Don't eat meat any more but when I did sometimes I just wanted to taste the meat, you know? Not your problem if she has to mask the taste of her own cooking with jar sauce.",False,False
