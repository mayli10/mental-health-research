I won't tell you what to do with your relationship, because it's not my place. But PLEASE evaluate things. If abuse (physical, mental or emotional) is his go to during an argument or communication breakdown, it's quite a large red flag and doesn't bode well for future arguments.  On another note, I solidly agree with the person that said if you're not comfortable divulging ed being the reasoning behind you not wanting a restaurant, definitely focus on the lack of decent vegetarian options. Pescatarian now (thanks ed for fixating on seafood the past 4 monthsü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è), but vegetarian for about 2 years before that. One of my biggest pet peeves was going to a restaurant and my options being salad, some greasy mixed veg shit, or fried food üôÑ. Even before this latest relapse, I fixated on menus, simply because I wanted to make sure I had decent options.",False,False

That's absolutely not acceptable under any circumstance and certainly isn't your fault. I think that should be a line that you can never accept somebody crossing. Once a person hits you that should be it. I hope that's not what you meant.,False,False

Also, did you tell him you didn't want to go to that place cause they had no good vegetarian options? Cause that's legit, ED or not. I fucking hate the ""roasted vegetable sandwich"" lazy ass vegetarian option on every menu. 99% of the time they are tasteless, oily, and gross (imo).   If it weren't for the details of the fight (not just the physical part), I would say think you should be more open about your ED with him. But with that, I'm not sure it's safe for you (emotionally) to. It doesn't sound like he'd be very understanding, and that's the kind of thing abusers can weaponize.  And when I say abuser, I just mean someone who has a tendency to default to abusive behaviour in conflict, not intentionally or maliciously. But screaming at you while you ask him to leave, the physical part, etc., Shows patterns of abusive behaviour.",False,False
