It‚Äôs weird because I remember actually really liking that feeling - it was almost like the soreness you feel after the gym (like you made a difference).  Pounds started dropping this way and I got so excited that I eventually decided to ‚Äúreward‚Äù myself... which quickly got out of hand and resulted in me eating absolutely everything until I couldn‚Äôt budge. That‚Äôs when I discovered how easy it was to erase it all with a quick trip to the bathroom.   Then from about 19-28 this continued on with small weeks of recovery (which usually led to me gaining the weight back thus starting the whole cycle over again).  I‚Äôve been fluctuating between 135-155lbs and experiencing the many symptoms that come along with it (dry skin, irritability, missed periods, ulcers, yellowed nails, loss of enamel on my teeth, etc).  I‚Äôve tried everything to stop and want to SO badly. But I feel like food has become my heroin and I‚Äôm just stuck in this awful never ending cycle that will eventually ruin my life, my relationships and possibly even kill me.  I have never written about this before, but finally decided it was time to put it in a place where people might understand and relate to me.",False,False

Kept getting worse until I realised I was emotionally/boredom eating. Kicked the habit fairly easily and lost most of the weight in a healthy way. Then fell into a overeating or bingeing/restriction cycle, likely as a result of eating below maintain for about half a year as well as being obsessed with the results. Paired this with overexercising. I think it'd be classified under OSFED if anything? In my mind, I'm over my BED and 'healthy' so I'm no longer disordered..",False,False

I first developed ana when I was 16, and between the ages of 16 to 18, I would fluctuate between ana and BED every other week. At 18, I became vegan and relapsed into ana &amp; orthorexia until I was about 19. About a year into college, I realized that I was compulsively eating due to stress, so cue in BED from ages 20 to 22. When I was 22, I also started the 16/8 IF method. I‚Äôm currently 23 and for the last year, I thought I was finally recovering, but then I realized it‚Äôs pathetic that the only thing that enables me to eat semi-normally is because I‚Äôve incorporated two restrictive diets‚Äîintermittent fasting &amp; veganism. So as of lately, the stupid voice in my head just kinda decided fuck it, looks like recovery is never happening, and now I‚Äôm headed back into orthorexia &amp; ana territory.

And I write down how much the food weighs and how many calories it is and how much protein it contains (I don't write down the fat/carbs because for some reason none of the other things I do would be insane, but I consider writing those down going too far into the realm of cray-cray.) And I weigh myself twice a day and write that down. And I write down how much exercise I did per day, how many calories I burned.  So... yeah, the ""obsessive"" part is still there, but I have it under control. Technically I'm slightly underweight but whatever, my obsession nowadays is more about increasing muscle mass and decreasing fat. I'm technically slightly underweight, but I just don't want that fat there, if I can replace it with muscle, I will replace it muscle. (not like bodybuilder muscle, just nice and lean.) So... Yeah, the disordered thinking is still there. Physically, everything I'm doing eating/exercise-wise is within the realm of healthy for an athlete, but unfortunately it's running on an ED operating system.",False,False

People with orthorexia nervosa are described as being ""solely concerned with the quality of the food they put in their bodies, refining and restricting their diets according to their personal understanding of which foods are truly 'pure'."" This differs from other eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, where those affected focus on the quantity of food eaten  TLDR: an obsession to eat what is perceived healthy and follow strict rules of eating.",False,False
