It isnt like body builder muscle, but not like model lean muscle either. Kinda in between. However, the way I do it is do regular training on deficit days and then have a ""binge"" day where I get within 100 cals of my TDEE in either direction and do heavy training with more sets but fewer reps.   Of course, that's how I do it when I can manage to restrict and ""binge"" the ways I want to and not in a completely uncontrolled manner",False,False

But as far as protein goes, tuna has always been a safe option for me. Like maybe mixed with some hardboiled egg whites over a salad with some kind of seeds or black beans. Beans have protein and fiber. Plus with that stuff in the salad, you don't even need dressing.  Greek yogurt is another favorite safe food. So many options. With fruit, like any fruit, or by itself, or as a dressing, or a dip with spices mixed in. Or add it to the tuna and egg whites for sandwiches.",False,False
