A lot of things can be prepared with alternative (for example with water or margarine that you can then drain out). You could also try to cook in the microwave, it eliminates a lot of things too. Give it a try, veganism requires a lot of experiments to find what you like.",False,False

You can just request the person in charge of groceries to buy large quantities of cheap food. I like to snack on green beans or green stuff in general (except brussel sprouts, ew :p) so I just asked my parents to buy tons of frozen veggies. I don't know where you live or your house situation but that would be even much cheaper than having any sort of cake or biscuits.  If you like chocolate or things like that, you can also buy rice cake and vegan chocolate spread. The process of having to ""prepare"" your thing, instead of just taking it from a bag, might even cut your binge a bit.",False,False

I think you should not bash yourself if you have one mishap. You can't force yourself to be a vegan if you're not ready.  Try to find alternatives. There are vegan chocolates. You can find them in Jewish stores mostly (and they are honestly better than regular chocolate if you're not a milk person).  I was vegan for a very long time and never felt like I was restricting, but it can be difficult if you actually restrict, because your body will always crave high-calories food. You should try to eat at least at maintenance and make sure that you have enough proteins and you will not feel the need to binge on non-vegan stuff.",False,False
