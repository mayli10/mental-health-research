And I was freaked out, like am I ever gonna be normal? But, think..how many year I fucked up my body’s natural process?   19 years of here’s some food to digest..actually nope lol  So now I legit look like a frog, no one calls me beautiful anymore BUT I’m alive, and I so easily could have ended it all with one mistake   I’m a very lucky frog 🐸   It’s been 3 years since I was regularly vomiting  (Minus a week or two of very bad stress here and there that had me falling into old habits but luckily nipped that shiz in the bud)   3 years and tbh I don’t know what normal is,I just know I’m alive  Edit to add I don’t mean to be a downer, really it’s better now without the acid burns, the burping, the teeny goat poops, the guilt, shame..hiding food stashes and even hiding vomit (so glam) bits of vom in my hair..my hair grows now! It’s not all bad and you will feel much better promise xx",False,False
