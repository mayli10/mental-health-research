I’ve lived alone for so long that I have no idea what this looks like   I go to the supermarket every single day and either walk round and stare at everything and buy nothing, do a weekly restriction shop, so pick up *everything* and read the label despite the fact that I already know the info for everything I buy, OR, doing the quickest binge food sweep i can.   Watching a normal grocery shop would be so fascinating!",False,False
