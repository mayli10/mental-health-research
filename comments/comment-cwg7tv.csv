I specifically use a brand called Nuun and can recommend it but there are plenty of others.  With Powerade/Gatorade and things you have to watch out for the added sugar, they're normally loaded. I'm not overly familiar with coconut milk because I dont like the taste, but again it will likely be better if it doesnt have much outside of water and electrolytes.  Anything for harm reduction I *think* is allowed here, because I'm always preaching about electrolytes. Side benefit they help me with bloating.",False,False
