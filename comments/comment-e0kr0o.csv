This year I decided to experiment to find out how to scratch that itch and I think I've come real close. Grande Blonde Roast coffee 2 pumps skinny mocha sauce (15 cal each) 2 pumps peppermint syrup (20 cal each) Splash of almond milk. Sometimes I add whip too just because I beat the system.",False,False

My go to peppermint coffee recipe is 1cup strong coffee with 1 tsp espresso powder, 1/2c unsweetened almond or any other non dairy milk, and 2tbs sugar free peppermint coffee syrup. I usually put the syrup and milk in the microwave until its steamy and whisk the hell out of it . then I pour the coffee into it(down the side of the cup so the bubbles don't pop) and top it with lite reddi whip. Its all about making it feel fancy so sometimes I even put a couple sprinkles if crunched up sugar free peppermints on top and drink it with a pretty straw. Its about 40 calories a cup and doesnt take much",False,False

You can also do any of the flavors with a cappuccino instead of a latte, which would come with less milk and less calories as a result. Try a small (tall) blonde espresso cappuccino with one pump of peppermint and one pump of mocha, or one pump of chestnut praline or the caramel brûlée :)   I also follow a barista on Instagram who posts recipes for lower cal drinks from Starbucks, check him out! @themacrobarista",False,False
