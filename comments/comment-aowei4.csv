Please dont beat yourself up! If you get an intrusive ED thought just remind yourself that your body is SO THANKFUL that you ate what you did. It was like ""hey good job dino_bones72! I love this! Thank you!""  I hope recovery takes a turn for the better for you, you deserve it so much!",False,False

I've hit my LW (despite being in recovery - ha! yeah ...) I spent the morning at a toddler birthday party and I was FREEZING. I was shaking, my teeth were chattering. My nails are blue. I'm dizzy and weak. I'm on long term sick leave from work because I'm just not able to do my job anymore. I eat about 600 a day, if I'm lucky. I'm, quite frankly, a bag of bones and a mess.  When we got back to the party house to have food and presents and stuff it was just chaos and I couldn't face trying to sort out ""anorexic snacks"" (it's my sister's kid, so all my sister's friends who I don't know as they live about 8 hours away. Not that they would care - I'm very obviously Very Thin and we're British so nobody would say anything). Instead I just grabbed a plate and hit the buffet table. I ate pizza for the first time in nearly a year. It was only 2 slices from a 14"" pizza and a grabbed a bunch of salad as well but honestly I felt my hands and feet warm up - my nails are a normal colour! I think my body ACTUALLY WANTED THE FATS. I even had some chocolate birthday cake because let's be honest, rude not to ðŸ˜‚  Emotionally I feel quite wobbly about it all but physically I feel the best (and warmest!) I've felt in months ðŸ˜Š",False,False
