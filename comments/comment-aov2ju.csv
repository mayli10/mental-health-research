Maybe it's simply because pounds mean something to be and kilos don't.   It feels like it's a superstition with us and numbers. Something magic will happen when you hit a certain number. Life will suddenly make sense and things will be good....but only when you see that number. I like to think it's happening in the same part of the brain as OCD tendencies. We all know these things aren't true, but we continue to believe 'just in case'.",False,True

I've been trying so hard to get under 100. I'm at 103.4 right now and 2.5 days into a 7 day fast, which should push me under. I haven't been under 100 since freshman year of high school, and I just need that number (even though I'm currently at my lowest adult weight).  I would love to know what makes people with EDs so number-focused, it's such a common thread among many of us. I sometimes wonder if switching to metric would help solve that need I have for the double-digit number.",False,False
