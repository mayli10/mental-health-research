She objectively a bad person, ed or not. So I guess I feel pretty neutral. Me feeling bad her killing herself and her being a crappy person kind of balanced out to this thing where I don't really like or dislike her.",False,False

She is a liar, a manipulator, and an abuser. She lied about being raped (and actually was the one who raped and abused the person she accused), she manipulates her viewership constantly, and she even has a damn video called ""things I've lied about"" going over the more minor stuff. I don't give a shit if she has an ED, she's a garbage human being.",False,False

I lurk r/amberlynn more than I watch her videos at this point—to keep myself from binging—but I feel bad about it. I do bad for her at the end of the day.  Yes, she’s frustrating, and she needs real help immediately. It’s really maddening because there is absolutely nothing preventing her from getting inpatient treatment of some kind.   She has the money. She has the time. She has no obligations outside of YouTube (as far anyone knows), and she needs it! She can’t go on like this for much longer.  She demonstrates little to no self-awareness and definitely fails to take responsibility for herself in any sort of consistent, meaningful way. It’s fucking hard to watch an adult broadcasting that kind of behavior, intriguing but hard.  She is deeply stunted though and extremely unwell for sure. And I don’t think it’s fair when that’s not acknowledged at all! People on the sub make fun of her for saying she has an ED when like...she *clearly* has an ED. I hope she wakes up before it’s too late. Her eating disorder isn’t actually any less valid just because people have a harder time glamorizing morbid obesity.",False,False

And when shes ""being healthy"" its not real, she has not shown anyone that she actually wants to be healthy and weight loss  because right now shes dying and not helping herself. (also not really anything about facts but i find her personality very annoying and her voice makes me want to stop listening to it quickly just the way she talks annoys me so i'm not that informed on her, then the videos i see on her, but not the meme ones like ones with people getting facts and good opinions)",False,False
