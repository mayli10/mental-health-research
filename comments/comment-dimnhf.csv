I did get to my LW with it but I IMMEDIATELY gained back all the weight plus more within the months that followed. so I don’t recommend it tbh. I’m doing the SGD right now and finding it WAY more sustainable and easy to stick to - therefore no binges and overall better loss. but maybe I’m just weak lool,False,False
