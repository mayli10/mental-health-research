If you've gained some weight after restricting for a long time, refeeding syndrome (even mild) can cause it. Or just normal restriction, if you're not getting enough nutrients.   That same thing happened to me before (except in the middle of the night). It happened a few more times with varying severity. The doctor was really unhelpful--they took blood tests, but since I also had a minor flu, he dismissed it as a virus. It went away on its own after a month.   I wouldn't say it's a bad idea to make an appointment and get a blood test, but you should specifically mention electrolyte imbalances, or any concerns about your diet. This stuff can be deadly.

Something with potassium and/or magnesium like a banana or leafy greens would help, but if you can't, supplements should work? I know we like to trash the fasting subreddit here but they do have some good information on staying safe during a fast, so maybe check that out. Also drink lots of water! I'm sorry you're having a hard time :(",False,False

I'd really recommend not maintaining it, but then I'd need to heed my own advice since I feel like this every day.. Since every day is low restriction lol. I've not had the throwing up, though.   Is there a possibility of refeeding syndrome?",False,False
