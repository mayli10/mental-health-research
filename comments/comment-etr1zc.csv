As someone who's worked in healthcare, if a patient said, ""hey, my weight is a tough subject for me. Can I just close my eyes and you not tell me what it is?"" I would not judge one bit. You're almost certainly not the only one who's asked for that, either.",False,False

I have refused to be weighed at the doctor for 5 years now.   Sometimes the nurse will say you have to, but what they mean is that they need to enter a weight into the system. I usually tell them to use what it was last time. If they say no, then I say “ok, the last time I weighed myself I was X” (using a weight that is in the realm of possibilities, and that doesn’t trigger)  Sometimes you need to to be weighed for medical reasons (like if you’re getting anesthesia), but for a check up, when you’re not going because of unexplained changes in weight, you 100% do not have to",False,False

They deal with a lot of stuff. They won’t go home ruminating on why you asked not to be weighed, but if you got weighed you’d be fixated on it. A slight momentary awkwardness (if any) is worth it.",False,False

I was in the same position a few months back, has a gyno appointment and really didn’t want to see the number on the scale, so I started researching if I could say no to the weigh-in. I ended up doing it anyway, but the Internet seemed to be pretty favorable to you being able to just say no.",False,False
