All of our struggles are real. I know exactly how you feel, with the mentality ""oh im not under xxx bmi or xxx pounds, so i don't really have a problem.""

Passing out is possible at any weight, it happens to me often but generally Iâ€™m so ill Iâ€™m lying down already or my boyfriend convinces me I need to rest and gets me to sit down so I donâ€™t fall.  Passing out at work is a very real and present danger and Iâ€™m really sorry youâ€™re at that point. If you start feeling faint or lightheaded or you think you might black out try and sit down or something and wiggle your toes. It sounds silly but sometimes it increases blood flow enough to prevent collapse. Sit down definitely though.  The only real solution is to eat... but I know how you feel. Itâ€™s not easy and recovery is a hard goal and Iâ€™m not ready for it yet either. You donâ€™t have to try and recover right away if you arenâ€™t ready but if you think you really are going to pass out try and eat at least something small or do something else to keep your electrolytes up. If you canâ€™t do that, make sure you sit down to minimise damage.  Iâ€™m sorry youâ€™re struggling so bad but Iâ€™m here if you need support.",False,False

Iâ€™m now moderately UW in my latest restriction spiral and havenâ€™t even once (though Iâ€™ve been close to it). I think the biggest thing is that I was restricting a lot harder last time around, and lost the weight very quickly. I also was very very sedentary. It would always happen when I stood up from sitting/laying.   Something worth mentioning, if it helps - when I used to pass out, there was always a lead up. It started with progressively getting worse - Iâ€™d be more and more dizzy every time after getting up, until a point where Iâ€™d find standing up and getting light headed meant my ears would ring and my vision would start to go. Then, after it got a bit worse, I would actually find Iâ€™d stand up, take a few steps and then everything would go black and Iâ€™d wake up on the floor. This happened regularly until I started eating again, all over the course of maybe a few weeks of very heavy restriction? Biggest tell was getting very very dizzy and lightheaded.",False,False
