I did but it was a slow loss that would fluctuate a lot due to water weight. It was like stall, stall, stall, woosh, stall, stall, stall, woosh. ",False,False

I can’t imagine eating 1200 a day and then having one cheat meal or unplanned night out fuck up your progress so heavily. ,False,False

You just have to keep at it everyday, and the weight does fall off. It was the easiest time for me. Now, eating under 1000 causes me to binge eat, whereas 1200-1300 kept me satisfied for literal months. ",False,False

Eventually you'll reach a point where your body is once again disposing of waste at the same rate you're eating more food. It can definitely be disheartening whenever you eat more than usual, but not enough to gain weight, and yet you still notice weight gain. The issue is that you're just more full than usual. Those calories aren't magically worth more than other calories. You still need 3,500 calories to gain one pound and you still probably burn around a minimum of 1,300-1,400 per day regardless of physical activity. If you really are eating only 1,200 calories per day then you will still lose weight over time. It will simply take longer than when you were only eating 500.",False,False

When you eat regularly you always have food in you. I know this sounds reductive and perhaps patronizing but I had to realize the same weight I've recently been losing and gaining is equal to an empty bowel. I've probably stayed the same and when I restrict I think I lost weight when in fact I just lost poop. Then I eat more, immediately gain weight, and vow to start restricting again. ",False,False
