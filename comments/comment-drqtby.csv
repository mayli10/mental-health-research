Scary stuff and it’s that kind of bs that makes people afraid to go to recovery,False,False

I only made my comment because you said your fear of medical issues relating to obesity is what is keeping you from recovery and trying to point out that in of itself is flawed as being underweight has severe health issues as well,False,False

I won't keep bread or tortillas or cookies or chips or cereal in the house. They're too easy.   If I want a carby bread based meal, I can make homemade waffles myself. If I want a dessert, I can whip up something with my own ingredients or dip fruit into Greek yogurt or chocolate syrup. If I want a turkey wrap, instead of having a tortilla (which sets off binges), I make the wrap out of cooked egg whites. In general, stuff that is easy to grab out of a bag or box is too easy to binge and is usually stuff that has been engineered to hit that salt or sweet addictive point.      I don't cut out any food groups and don't feel like my diet is restrictive at all in that sense, I just don't eat big enough portions. On a daily basis, I eat a variety of foods: meat (deer, turkey, chicken), vegetables (spinach, tomatoes, cauliflower, salsa, sauerkraut), legumes (lentils, black beans, black bean burgers), dairy products (cottage cheese, American slices, parmesan, feta, sour cream, Greek yogurt), almond milk, carb heavy stuff (instant mashed potatoes, homemade waffles), fruit (strawberries, blueberries), along with additional stuff like eggs, shirataki, SF pudding, and SF jello.  All of these items require preparation (the easiest being instant potatoes, jello, or pudding), but none of them are things that I can just sit on the couch and mindlessly binge on, one after the other, out of a box or bag.   I don't think you're wrong in keeping junk out of your diet even in recovery, and if/when I decide to recover, I see myself eating a diet verrry similar to what I currently eat, while maybe adding back in some fear foods (real pasta, occasional cereal, bread) and eating more of the items that I don't consume a lot of right now due to calorie content (things like meat or peanutbutter, which I do eat but in very small amounts right now while restricting).",False,False

Like a lot of people have a mindset of like, ""I'm gonna eat chocolate and soda in moderation because I enjoy those things"" and while I obviously don't have a problem with other people doing that, I don't feel like that's realistic at least for me. These things are designed to be addictive and ideally I'd rather not partake in them at all instead of supposedly in moderation. Like, if you're an addict, the goal isn't to be doing drugs 'in moderation', you ideally want to not be doing them at all.",False,False

There's other healthy foods to enjoy. I'm in the US too and I recently moved from an area that was all skinnier than me to a place FULL of obesity. I understand what you mean, like how it's one or the other. Either super fit or super unhealthy.  The thing to focus on in your recovery is getting to that point where you're confident with your healthy food choices until it becomes a habit to turn to fruit or lean meats instead of Doritos or McDonald's. Eventually it will become second nature and you won't have to think about it. Good luck on your recovery!",False,False
