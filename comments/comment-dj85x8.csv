Lately I have to do the same thing for myself, just stand and hold the wall and breeeaaathe until I can see and hear properly again. Loves it. Makes me giddy in both senses of the word.",False,False

I used to have to hold the walls as I turned the corner out of classrooms in highschool, walked around like I was actually drunk, and at one point started randomly having my vision black out and losing feeling in my body/falling? Pretty sure that was basically me fainting but idk.   Like 10% of me misses it tho.",False,False
