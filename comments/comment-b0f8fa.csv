I pretty much live off snacking. Fruits, veggies, crackers, protein bars. Or things that are really quick to make or only have a handful of ingredients like smoothies, eggs, and tofu with a side of vegetables. I think I do it so that I minimize my time spent around food.",False,False

It’s honestly so boring to me. And so time consuming. I hate figuring out recipes and ingredients.

All I can think of is, look up recipes you can make with just one frying pan, like chicken pasta. It's quick and produces less mess.   From what I have learned it is acceptable to serve for a woman to one-pan type meal to the family for dinner in North America and if this is true, all you have to do is learn how to make variations of pasta that have both protein source and vegetable.",False,False
