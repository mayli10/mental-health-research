The second half of the post made me slightly worried because it sounds like you might've been using a joke to disguise actual romanticization - it was very poetic and beautifully written, but that's also why it set off my alarms. It makes that situation sound very appealing and evocative which could encourage copycats.  I also feel like that wasn't your intention, but I checked the comments to see if anyone else got the same vibe, and, well, someone did. So I wanted to say my piece too. I'm glad it was a misunderstanding and not your intention. You are a very good writer and that can have extra responsibility sometimes.",False,False
