Since I binge purge rather than eat, I plan very carefully my binges and my normal meals and I adore being by myself. I can throw away whatever I don't want to finish or purge without counting the minutes until which it becomes suspicious.",False,True

I only eat one meal a day, so I need to organise it and know what I'm going to eat, or else I panic.  My mom is cooking dinner this evening, and I can't skip it.  So I guess that'll be my meal for today, but is so damn difficult to sit there and eat ""like a normal person"". I love eating by myself, since I only eat once, I'd like it to be a pleasant experience.  I hate myself for having to think so hard about what I eat, to literally organize and count everything.
