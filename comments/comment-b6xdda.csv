By the time of my first relapse I was already on birth control so not sure if I lost my period as I was not taking pill breaks so I didnâ€™t get them anyway.  Iâ€™d miss the odd pill here and there, in fact I was really sloppy at taking it (I forgot at least one every month). But I didnâ€™t get pregnant so in the back of my mind I assumed I was infertile.  Then I had another recovery, and as soon as my weight reached normal BOOM. Two pink lines. Iâ€™ve been pregnant a number of times since then so AN definitely didnâ€™t leave me permanently infertile, but not everyone gets away with it. (Not everyone gets away with assuming their ED will take care of contraception for them either, itâ€™s worth noting!)",False,False
