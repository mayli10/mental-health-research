I strongly believe that by being honest about your worries and also honest and open about your own issues, that it will make your sister trust you and value your opinion. I'm 27, almost twice the age of my sister, but she tells me everything in her life, it means so much to me but hopefully it also means she feels safe and loved. I'm an adult but she sees me as one of her peers because I answer all her questions honestly. I think the most important thing is to be open, honest and not too judgy. I tell my sister when she's being a brat and she loves me for it, because I let her know that though she can be a brat I still love her dearly.",False,False

I try to talk to her about how it's very unregulated and that lots DF videos show unhealthy dangerous things. I like to think that because she knows about my ED history and how much I've regretted wasting my youth trying to lose weight, she can sort out most of the bullshit. I still worry though, bit about tiktok and her use of Instagram. Here's to hoping she won't become ill as I did.",False,False
