Makes me feel so huge and ugly sometimes, but more than once heâ€™s sat me down and told me that he think theyâ€™re attractive but that Iâ€™m the most beautiful woman heâ€™s seen. Which is a load of bs to me, but I know he actually means it. Especially since he says Iâ€™m beautiful without being photoshopped or filtered.",False,False

Probably cause in this movie all I could focus on were her bones. But in a way that makes me more triggered.

Like she's super skinny but it's mostly her top half that's bony-skinny. If you get a chance to see her in Colette she wears a leotard in one scene and she has hips and kinda (comparatively) thick thighs. She's like a healthy weight I think tbh... makes me feel like maybe I shouldn't lose as much as I originally wanted to...,False,False
