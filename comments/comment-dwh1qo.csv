My coworkers all know I work out at lunch so no one thinks itâ€™s too big of a deal and surprisingly my makeup holds up pretty well!",False,False

I work 8-10 hrs everyday, in a desk for health insurance. I get up every hour and walk for about 3-5 minutes. It helped so much with the guilt of sitting all day.

Ah i mostly work in editorial work and commerical animation. But the best way to get into commissions is just to establish a following draw some fanart of stuff you like and then showing more work. They say not to undersell yourself but i recommend it just in the beginning. I did $1 and up post it commissions when first getting started, like id tell people id do an ink/pencil sketch of a picture they sent me and scan it w my phone. Usually I could crank dozens out and most people give $5 for them. Its a good way to gain attention. Also asking other artist friends if theyd be comfortable bumping ur commission posts on insta stories or rting them!  (Also furries. They pay really well for reference sheets and are really nice clients and loyal if they like your style if youre ok w drawin furries)",False,False

I never liked jobs with inconsistent schedules because id wake up late and not be able to manage my life that. Im a freelance artist on the side and getting home at a normal hour to do work for that, have my evenings to myself and be able to plan for weekends and ask for time off.

At least here i  have consistent hours and days off and my own desk i can stock with safe foods.
