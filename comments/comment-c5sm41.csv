I'm also doing fasted training 5x/wk for a powerlifting comp in a couple of months.   I usually try to limit myself to high protein low cal foods during the day and I'll eat a 'normal' meal with my SO (we share plates so I mostly just let him eat a majority of it). My coach had me to gain a bit before cutting down in time for comp which I did for about 2 weeks (aka hello binge phase!). I gained ~5lbs but seeing the higher number on the scale just scared me way too much so I've been back on my bullshit for the last 3 weeks. Currently in a pretty bad binge/restrict cycle :/",False,False

IF killed my gym strength and I started getting discouraged and sad. I kept failing sets. And then I wasn't losing weight like I thought I would. So I did a week long fast and dropped a few and was even weaker after that obviously. My motivation for lifting disappeared and I all but stopped working out, started fasting regularly... My bulimia has never really ever gone away but time length between short relapses were pretty long. Like far and few between. Then that came back. Now it's been a year since I've stepped in a gym and my quads and videos are gone, I'm still more or less the same weight but all sorts of neurotic again.  I know I need to just step into the gym again and fuel myself with real food to kick this again but shame and fear is stopping me.",False,False

I take a pre workout before, but donâ€™t eat anything. After my workout Iâ€™ll usually have some oatmeal and a protein shake to get some carbs and protein into my system.  I really try to focus on making sure Iâ€™m getting enough protein, but also some carbs and fat to feel more full.   I feel like the timing of when to eat doesnâ€™t matter so much as how you personally feel. For me, I feel terrible and like Iâ€™m going to throw up when I eat before I workout, so I eat afterwards.",False,False
