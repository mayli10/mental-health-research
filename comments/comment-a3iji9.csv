The struggle now is to STOP myself from reaching my latest goal weight.  If you can get this person out of your head, PLEASE DO.  You could get to the stage where you're actually a lower weight than her but you don't see it.  Just a warning from someone who experienced it.  I'd say it's pretty common with an ED.  ",False,False

Sometimes I look at really beautiful actresses and models and I just think heck I will never look like that no matter what. Someone posted the reddit sub the other day that points out all the editing instagram models do to make their body look a certain way and it made me feel a bit better. Like they still look good without the editing but even they don't look like themselves ya know? Or when I'm watching a movie but I think well that actress probably dieted way down temporarily for the role or scene and doesn't look that way 24/7 every day of the year. Even victoria's secret models say they eat a special diet leading up to the show. Idk somehow realising that even people who I wished I looked like either 1) don't really look that way/look that way all the time or 2) literally get paid to look that good it makes me feel a little bit better.,False,False
