I don't want to make a huge habit out of it or whatever but those binge urges can be intense and I would rather do this every so often than eat so much I end up in pain and sick and possibly purging. Ideally I could just like... not binge... but you know ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è haha,False,True

I used to c/s all the time and I still do it semi-regularly so I know how addicting it is. But as someone else mentioned, itll make your face puffy, and on top of that, as I started c/s-ing more and more food, my jaw started locking and clicking from all the aggressive chewing. The crazy volume I was c/s-ing also translated to bigger binges and an inability to stop. Just be conscious of these things!   Oh and last thing, if you c/s and spit into chip bags, throw them away asap or double bag them, I forgot about one of my bags and then it split open and spilled nasty liquid everywhere :/",False,False

You end up with realllllyyyy puffy face.,False,False
