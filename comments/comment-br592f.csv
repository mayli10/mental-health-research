I believe in the right to die which is pretty controversial, especially in situations of mental health rather than terminal physical illness... but I believe eating disorders and other mental illness can be terminal, too.   I don't think *everyone* should be free to opt out of treatment, though.   For example, the first time I was hospitalized against my will I was legitimately in denial. I did not understand or accept that I would die without intervention and so it was, in my humble opinion, ethical to detain me and issue medical care.  But now, after multiple stressful, expensive, and unsuccessful attempts at treatment, and that I understand the potential lethality of my situation, I think I am entitled to just let go.   I'm not going to get better. Even when I want to I am unable to. Usually though I don't even want to and I agree that the resources I use in forced treatment would be better spent on somebody who has a chance/wants a chance.",False,False
