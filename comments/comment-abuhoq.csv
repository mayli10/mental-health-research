Lots of cultures and families Express their love with food and feeding their loved ones.

I've been dealing with this shit from my parents my whole life and my dad only occasionally backs my mom up. They been married almost 43 years. ,False,False

My ex's mom was like that - they were Italian. I basically had 6 course meals shoved down my throat and the portions were HUGE! I faked celiac and lactose intolerance after the first dinner we had together lol,False,False

Explain the issue to your bf if he doesn't know already so he can mention it to his mum. Also, stop worrying about pleasing her and start standing up for yourself. Only eat what you want to eat - it's literally your own body, why does she have the right to control what you put into it? It's horrific to make someone eat something they don't want to/are allergic to!!   If she continues to be a bitch, the only way to resolve it is to avoid putting yourself in that situation. Maybe avoid being there at mealtimes? Or try to go to their house less? You got this! Stay strong ðŸ’ª",False,False

Even if you didn't have an ED, this would be way over the line. But if he knows you do, how can he not see how harmful this is to you psychologically? And eating something you're allergic too should never even be on the table. ",False,False

Something like, I appreciate the special attention when you get my food for me, but Iâ€™d love to feel a part of the family just like everyone else! Also, I donâ€™t know if I ever told you, but Iâ€™m allergic to XYZ candy, which is really unfortunate because Iâ€™d love to eat it if I could!   Kill her with kindnesssssss",False,False

I really think you should try to stop visiting his parents. It sounds very stressful.  I've been around other people trying some of this other stuff, like a hyper-focus on one persons consumption (sometimes it's out of a weird care-taking compulsion)... but this sounds like it is beyond that. It sounds like you are really feeling the pressure and feel over-powered, and that sounds harmful to your emotional health",False,False
