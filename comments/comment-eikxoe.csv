If I had a bad experience, the first thing I'd do is do anything in my power to rake a program across the coals... so to the OP, you're probably seeing what is worst rather than what is normal. A program's website probably will contain positive testimonials if you wanted to balance it out a bit.",False,False

I've heard good things about the week-long family program; you would have to go with a parent or designated caregiver though. Lots of programs do inpatient for adolescents, so it seems like it's a geographical problem",False,False

So it could be a good program but they were mad about it and after working in the health care industry I've seen more people leave reviews when they are mad verses when they had a good experience.  I'd figure out what your health insurance is and call the insurance and ask them where your best options would be to go. Just in case you do check yourself into a program then you know it will be paid by them.  Then once you have a list of hospitals/programs from the insurance company I'd call the different hospitals/programs and see how soon you can go in for an evaluation and ask them questions about their success rates, support groups and what age range they treat.  The hospital you choose may just start you on an out paitent program where you see a doctor and nutritionist a few times a month and see a therapist weekly.  I hope this helps!",False,False
