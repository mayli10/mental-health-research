It also invalidates people and makes them feel ""not sick enough,"" which is not a valid phrase anyway. I have had an eating disorder for 12 years, and I've given up on having a goal weight. I've never been happy with my weight (no matter how low I've gotten), and I never will be. So why set yourself up for failure, and trigger others in the process?   I'm sure this will be highly downvoted, but I don't understand why it is necessary to share goal weights with other people with eating disorders. Because of the nature of the disorder, no one's goal weight is going to be sustainable or gratifying. What upsets me the most is when I see young teenagers and kids on here trying to aspire to something like this. I've had my eating disorder since I was 15 and I'm about to turn 27. All my eating disorder has given me is misery, despair, deprivation, health issues, and alienation from everyone around me. I never thought when I was 15 that I would be suffering this long. Why would anyone encourage others to keep going? I would not wish this disorder on my worst enemy, so why is it okay to encourage some random strangers on the internet to fall deeper into their illness? This post honestly makes me really sad that there are people out there that seek validation from people on the internet to fuel their eating disorder.  I've said my piece, and I'm sure it will go unheard by the many that need to hear it. But if I help anyone to rethink the need to post their goal weight on this post, at least I helped someone not go deeper into the rabbit hole of their eating disorder.",False,False
