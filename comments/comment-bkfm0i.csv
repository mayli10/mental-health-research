And get a pep talk before if you’re feeling nervous. Telling my parents that I wasn’t religious terrified me and I put it off for a long time. Obviously they weren’t happy but the relief was unreal and they got over it. Best of luck,False,False

You honestly sound like me when I was your age. Same thing, I wasn’t allowed to go see friends, have sleepovers, do anything really but go to school. They even controlled the tv I was allowed to watch and magazines I was allowed to read (for example, I wasn’t allowed to read Seventeen because I was 15, not 17).   Anyway, as someone above also commented, your ED probably developed as a way to have control over at least one aspect of your life, since your parents control everything else. I don’t even think telling them about your ED would help, they’d probably just become even stricter, not allowing you privacy in your room or even bathroom. Is there a trusted adult you can speak to about this? Like a teacher/counselor/aunt etc? And maybe have them try to talk to your parents, because they don’t seem like the type to listen and actually hear YOU. If there isn’t, or it doesn’t work, just remember in 2 years you’ll be a legal adult and can move out. Meanwhile, try to focus on yourself, your education, read, anything to better yourself and prepare you for “the real world” and to minimize their effect on you psychologically. Remember you’re not alone, reach out to people online, PM me if you need to chat. This situation with them is not permanent, you will get out, and no longer have these strictures placed upon you.",False,False

Definitely stay on this sub for support!!! But some more social interaction would probably help. If your parents are really controlling could you do some sports? Perhaps your parents might find that more acceptable. This may seem dumb but have ever told them how this is making you feel lonely/ how do you think they would react to that? I assume your parents are putting these rules to protect you which means they care in their own way, so they really want the best for you.",False,False

These are valid frustrations. I would feel horrible if my parents had been very personally involved in my phone and didn’t let me go out. You are a very self aware person to understand so deeply how your ED is effected by all of this. I hope things improve.,False,False

There is no objective way to measure emotional pain and hardship.   Now, I can relate so I wanted to reach out and tell you what I wish somebody told me as a teen. My ed is the same way- and miraculously, when I moved out, it largely went away on its own. Essentially - being in an environment where you feel as though you’ve been stripped of everything and aren’t able to make many choices or assert yourself can lead to you scrambling for SOMETHING to control - to ground you.   Yes your parents have the right to ground you, but it sounds just excessive and unreasonable to me. Again, I can relate as I am the same way. My parents would go through my trash looking for incriminating garbage or read my journal looking for big secrets I never kept from them. They didn’t give me any boundaries and made it very hard for me to have friends; not to the extent your parents did, but close.   I later came to realize that my parents were abusive in a plethora of ways, and I came to find that their rigid control of my life and attempts to sabotage friendships  were merely means of isolating me from supports - which abusive individuals do.   I hope that’s not what’s going on- but if you need to talk or anything please reach out. You won’t be there forever and soon enough you’ll be able to live your life how YOU need to!  All the possible love ❤️❤️❤️",False,False
