Then I became a severe bulimic purging like 8-10 a day for two years.   I recovered four years and now I'm in this wimpy high restriction thing and I feel so fake. Like on the one hand yay because I'm not killing myself and I don't want to be underweight anymore but on the other hand this still sucks and the rules take up 50% of my brain power.  Ugh,False,False

I have some combination of orthorexia/anorexia, so it's really easy to convince myself and others that everything is fine, fine, fine... until very suddenly, it's not.  I had a devastating binge last month that led to me calling my parents in the middle of the night, confessing some deep secrets about my ED thoughts, sobbing about how I wanted to die and I couldn't take it any longer. I've never been so abjectly raw and humiliated but desperate for help. Yeah, well, now we're all pretending that never happened and I'm disgusted at myself for asking for help.  But guaranteed, if someone expressed genuine concern or sympathy, I would 100% burst into tears again. Otherwise, it's easy to be stoic and laugh off your own moments of weakness. ",False,False

It's just as you say, it's just so easy to invalidate yourself?

Comparing your illness with another person won't get you anywhere but back. Focus on your own health and what feels wrong/good to you.   You feel like you can stop at any time yet you've been doing this for years, say you don't feel like you have an ed yet your actions speak the contrary. And you must know that eds are horrible and its consequences more so, yet you don't stop. I won't go into deep analysis since I'm very fucked up myself and not a psychologist but... There is not a manual on how to behave/act/etc when you have an eating disorder. There isn't even a list of things you need to meet before even considering getting help or accepting the fact that you do indeed have a problem with eating. A serious one.   I shall add that is also very common feeling like you're ""faking it"" as well as being ""in control"" and thinking you can stop anytime. It is very common for eds to make you believe you are in control but then again... it's been years and I also believed I could stop whenever I wanted  to yet this is a vicious, neverending cycle. It is addictive as well. ",False,False

I've hit lows where i've really thought about seeking out a school therapist or smth like that only to wake up the next day and feel like i was just 'being dramatic'. I mean, if i were to hear that a friend was cutting herself, or going through b/p cycles, or eating less than 500 calories a day, I would feel worried and would def tell them that they need to get help. But when I think about myself, it feels like I can tough it out because it's not *that* big of an issue yet. Like imposter syndrome almost, rip :') Since you are already meeting with a psychologist, see what they have to say; i feel like a lot of the time we don't really realize how much we're dealing with since we always just keep it to ourselves and it eventually becomes some sort of 'norm'  Best of luck!",False,False
