Turns out obsessing over wellness can lead to seriously messed up self perceptions.   But it's not an eating disorder because it's ""healthy"". It's not an eating disorder when you refuse to eat swaths of foods because they have toxins or the wrong PH or aren't nutritionally dense. It's not an eating disorder when you feel faint or have the fasting manics because you are transitioning to your best self.  It's not an eating disorder when you haven't had your period in 3 months Because you are cleansing. It's not an ED when you take excessive laxative teas or juice fast because you are getting rid of toxins. It's not an ed when your friends and family are worried because they just aren't fit and healthy and committed like you are.   I'm not trying to throw shade at this gal.
