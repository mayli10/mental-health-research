I can suggest that ""talking"" about what issues you have helps. Even if you just write them down for yourself. If you can find a friend you can confide in. I k now that is a big ask; but think of it this way: You are brave to break the silence! The silence and lies is what helps foster the ED.   Continue to try to be safe, and know there are guys out here that understand.",False,False

As a woman I do not personally relate to this, but I have a teenage brother with anorexia who has gone through the same thing. It took him so much longer to address with our parents and seek help than me because no one even noticed how unhealthy he was getting until he was already underweight, because people just don't look for the warning signs in guys like they do girls. I'm sorry I can't give any actual advice that's more helpful, but just know you're not alone, this can affect ANYONE, body image issues are NOT just womens issues, and there are other people like you out there who are getting the love support and help they need and DESERVE.
