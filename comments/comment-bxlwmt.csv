exk8gpi,t3_bxlwmt,t3_bxlwmt,waywardkittymama,1,2019-08-21 04:08:48,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/bxlwmt/did_anyone_else_develop_this_problem_later_in_life/exk8gpi/,I'm 29 and didn't develop disordered eating until I was about 27...not really sure why/how it developed other than I wanted to start getting fitter as everyone at  work always talked about the cycling/running/walking they did and I much prefer to read books! Bought a fitbit and started tracking calories and it spiralled from there. Only very recently did I go to the GP and am now an outpatient steadily gaining weight. Definitely not a 'faker' and it is heartening (if that's the right word) to hear other people developed problematic relationships in later life as everything I come across mainly deals with developing an eating disorder in teenage years. Sometimes I feel I should have had a major 'trigger' event to account for it but I don't think I do...I could philosophise about it and come up with different hypotheses but that won't really get me anyway I don't think so just getting on with eating and writing about it instead :),False,False
