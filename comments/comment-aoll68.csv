He said I was trying to stay skinny and not get fat once. And when my little brother asked why I picked at my food, he said i was trying to starve myself. He's made many comments about me being ""skinny"" even though my bmi is ~19. Everytime he says something like that I just want to isolate myself. Fml.",False,False

Then when I turned 21, I just stopped eating.   And guess what he said? ""You look normal now,  keep it up!"" He smiled as he said it.   He isn't and won't be the only one responsible for my relationship with food. My mom, dad and uncle also did similar things. I avoid them at all costs. I even considered body shaming them but what's the point?  They did it to me for years, body shaming them once is only going to make me feel guilty.   I get what you mean though OP, my sister tries to encourage me by saying ""you're doing so well, you've lost so much weight and you're eating properly"" it makes me cringe because I still hate my body and what  food does to me.",False,False
