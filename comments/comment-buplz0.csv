I really hope you will be kind to yourself and make the trip about the city. About your company if you like your company. Maybe you'll retain some water but if you are going to see any Paris you will get quite the workout. Enjoy yourself. You are worth it.      (I have always believed in the math lowcalpal provided you with. The trip isn't going to make you fat, and it's also not going to be enough time to burn 6 chloting sizes. It is however enough time to be kind to yourself. To forgive a little more food that normal. Normally you ain't in Paris either.

Fuck that, I KNOW I have eaten way more in the past; I remember lots of times when I have..I just don't usually count Calories..I mean I can't.  2) The fact that I didn't even feel full, but the only reason I stopped was because I could see and feel the physical signs and got very scared. My stretch marks looked inflamed, it was very hard to walk, and because I've lost weight, my distended stomach is a lot more obvious than when I was heavier. It scares me that I'm crushing my organs with food and almond milk.  3) The fact that after my purge, I actually lost weight. A normal person should not eat 5,500 Calories in 40 minutes and lose weight from it. Well, the sad part is, mid-purge, I fell into a trance and shoved like 1-2,000 Calories of chocolate into me, so that's even more Calories. It was liked the quickest I ever ate chocolate in my life; the transitions between mini chocolate bars were so seamless, ingesting them in one bite while opening the package to another, so quickly and smooth.  I'm pretty sure I've had around 11 or 12K Calories or more in me from straight BED in one day, but I wonder what my maximum is for bulimic phases...I bet it's over 20K  I don't know why I get a sick sense of pride from purging all this.
