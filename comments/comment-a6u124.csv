It makes me feel powerful, it makes me feel in control.  Bizarre af as when I’ve “recovered” (been forced or guilt tripped into recovery) in the past these were the two major things I’d felt brutally stripped of.  I’m making the choice. My choice. And when I resist the temptation to leave some of my food, and when I get a gain and overcome that little jolt of cortisol then I feel like a fucking winner :))  ",False,False

You deserve to eat, you deserve to feel good about yourself, you deserve a healthy life where your stress comes mostly from long hours working to get the money that'll help you get what you want and studying so you can become what you wish instead of stressing over calories, food, your weight, etc... You will never be perfect in the eyes of everyone, but you will always be perfect for the people who truly love and care about you... and people who you are yet to meet, better recover so you can meet them! And of course, you. Accepting yourself is hard but once you achieve that? You'll be unstoppable. You'll find the perfection you seek in your flaws and your virtues because all that? Unique, there's no one else like you. You are unlimited edition so you better enjoy yourself and please be kind and share your awesomeness with the rest of us! The pro of recovering is getting back your life, your body and your mind.  Don't let a disease take away all that you are. You will probably fall a few times but once you get out it'll be hard to even believe you once considered staying where you were. ",False,False
