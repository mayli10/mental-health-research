My sleep schedules been super off, so I definitely haven't been eating as much as I should, but I have been trying to eat more? I didn't even get through lunch today before I got cramps and started to feel sick to my stomach. It was super sudden too, and I had a big appetite before eating. I was hella excited for the appetite because I hadnt had one for the last couple days.   &amp;#x200B;  my intake is wonky though, maybe thats why??? i get super intense right-under-the-ribs cramps and i usually have to take nausea medicine and eat some lightly medicated ginger candies for it to die down a little bit. my water intake hasnt been great either. would that be part of it???",False,True

Bodies can do strange things when food starts coming in. It's really common for people to get increased physical symptoms when refeeding but having them go away once the body gets used to food coming in (think months here). When I was refeeding, it was mainly a case of enduring the physical symptoms and reminding myself over and over again that they will pass.  It could also be anxiety related to having to eat, that wouldn't be uncommon with eating disorders. If I've eaten something that makes me anxious I get fuller quicker and tend to get more physical symptoms.",False,False
