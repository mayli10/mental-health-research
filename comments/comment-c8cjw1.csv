""*Real* anorexia/restrictive eating disorders are about control!"" like idk maybe a lack of control in my life is some underlying sense that informs my vanity, but that doesn't change the fact that I look at skinny people and go ""I want to look like them"" and then starve myself to look like them.  Like it will always be a post that's like ""separate yourself from the media image of being thin"" and someone will be like ""real eating disorders are about control, not meeting beauty standards"" and it's like... Fuck you???  I'm gain as hell???",False,False

There’s a reason so many of us don’t get better in treatment: because they have no fucking idea how to treat it and if your particular brand of neuroses deviates even mildly from the general narrative then you’re just “not trying hard enough”.,False,False

There are are a lot of varied reasons for it and it’s not just body image or just control. I guess I just got really frustrated because in this context it was on THAT post from fasting as a reason why we should not be concerned about a borderline underweight person starving herself until she’s underweight so I got really angry, especially because it was just some dude acting like he was an expert on the causes of anorexia :-/ you know",False,True

We need to just accept different things cause it. When I was in an ED unit, the majority of people with anorexia did say it didn't come from a body image thing. Maybe it started at that, but the majority of the time it was control issues, and in some cases, things like autism.   I'm not disagreeing with you completely because again I agree with the principle, I just disagree that EDs stem from body image and weight loss the majority of the time. It probably does to start with, but no neurotypical person starves themselves until they are very underweight for that reason.",False,False

""Its not anorexia because she's not technically underweight"" and then if she is underweight, its ""anorexia is about control, so clearly this is different"" or its ""Asians just naturally have a BMI of 16, so obviously it's not anorexia!1!"" Like for fuck's sake theres no catch-all condition. People need to take responsibility for their fucked up preconceived ideas of eating disorders and FIX THAT, instead of just trying to twist the definition around so they don't have to consider that they might be wrong or unhealthy or immoral. God forbid these men have to face the idea that the body they're so attracted to is actually a product of someone's suffering.",False,False
