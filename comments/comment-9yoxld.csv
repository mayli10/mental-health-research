Friends though, I feel a sense of duty to not let them down. I made plans with a friend tonight to go shopping when I’ve lost this weight and not letting her down is what’s driving me to not eat tonight",False,True

I think maybe it's getting that praise, or maybe the feeling that I have done something good enough to deserve a reward. I tell myself ""oh I've done so good, a plate of ______ won't hurt anything.""  Ugggh then I don't stop.  ",False,False

If you want to tell someone maybe you could just say ""I lost 4 pounds recently!"" not specifying the length of time. I doubt they'll ask.",False,False

Congrats!!  (What you can do if you still want to share your progress and pride is just tell people you've been eating at a healthy deficit and that you lost 2lbs instead of 4. You'll still get the accountability and congratulations, without being scolded about your method and actual weight) ",False,False
