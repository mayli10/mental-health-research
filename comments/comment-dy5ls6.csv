But tbh, it's been basically impossible to recover realistically on my own. I'm just doing damage control to help regain some elements of normal life back. So far, I've managed to basically stop  b/p sessions, even though I still restrict even on days when I eat a ""normal"" amount. I'm proud of what I've done, but my eventual plan is to get a therapist and REALLY recover.",False,False

I’m currently in Phase 1, the weight restoration part. I only see a therapist, but I see her twice a week, and when I see her, I have lunch with her. Then, outside of therapy time, all my meals are supervised by my boyfriend and his parents (I live with them) or my best friend, if I’m hanging out with her that day. When I didn’t have completely supervised meals, I would also restrict and purge all the time. FBT is an alternative to residential for me.",False,False

I  D O N ‘ T On a serious note though, I don’t get how true recovery’s possible on your own cause I go to therapy once a week and that’s it and the most I do is eat at a healthy deficit or maintenance which I don’t think counts as actual recovery",False,False

I had coping skills but I threw those out the window when she said that my parents needed to b in the picture. For those who recover on their own that's crazy. But I think the intervention part is crucial for the youngins or those who can reach out to their fam.,False,False
