I get it :( Iâ€™m so sorry youâ€™re feeling this too. Sometimes itâ€™s lasted 2-3 days. Itâ€™s hard but drinking extra water does seem to help. Reducing salt for the day also seems to help me. Itâ€™s helped me avoid eating so much since the last time it happened when it did last 3 days because god, I donâ€™t want to feel that again.",False,False
