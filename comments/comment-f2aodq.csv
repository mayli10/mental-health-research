When you have no carbs or glucose for your body and brain, your body is forced to synthesize ketones from lipids as an alternate fuel. This fuel is inefficient, which changes your metabolism. Which could in turn cause shivers due to your body‚Äôs lower body temperature. Additionally, low blood sugar, or blood electrolyte/vitamin deficiency and imbalance can cause those symptoms. LONG story short, there are a lot of potential reasons, best to have a doctor check you and see what the root cause is",False,False
