My therapist didn’t get my family involved until I lost a certain amount of weight. And she warned me, “if you continue to lose weight, I will call your parents.” I’m sure they will eventually pick up on everything. Hoping for the best!",False,False

She was my sorority sister and reached out because she recognized my behaviors. After I opened up to her a little bit she asked me if I wanted to get help and offered to come with me to the schools counseling center. She sat with me during my first appointment (it was sort of like an assessment to which therapist would be most beneficial to me) and I am SO thankful for her. I ended up getting the most amazing therapist. It wasn’t easy. Do you think if you offered to visit your schools counseling center (if they have one) with your girlfriend, she would be open to it?",False,False

It kinda sounds like she relapsed before you really noticed, because before my most recent relapse into restrictive behaviors I told my boyfriend that I was trying to avoid it and to not believe me if I said certain things because it was literally just the eating disorder.   Try to offer your support whenever you can, and find out what her safe foods are. Encourage her to go after her health, to go to your school's counseling center, and to get help, but telling people behind her back can make things worse. She needs to either be ready, or ready to be ready (which might look like her talking to you about the eating disorder). Ask her to make a plan in case she does become suicidal. Offer to eat with her. Try not to make negative comments about her food (Like... ""I don't think that's enough food for you"" is fine in my experience, but ""I'm proud of you for eating something so calorically dense"" or ""Oh you're eating olives? Those are gross"" tend not to be helpful).   If you do talk to someone, maybe just ask for resources without divulging her information. She needs to be able to trust whoever she eventually seeks help through, and she needs to be able to trust you.",False,False

It might help for her to have someone neutral to talk to about it.  there are resources out there for what to do when your loved one has an eating disorder if you want more info. but, I was exactly in her spot before. in college, deep into Ed, didn't want anyone to help me or know about it except a trusted fee who I told. you can ask her what she would like for support specifically, tell her you won't force her to do anything but you just want her to be okay and not hurt herself. if she ever complains that she's hungry or mentions not having eaten yet, you could gently offer her a safer food (idk about her but smoothies are liquid calories and I hate them even if I'm starving) like fruit or something low cal and prepackaged. whatever she feels safest eating.  it really depends on the person, so I can only tell you what I would've liked at the time: ask her how she's doing/feeling each day, ask her if she has eaten yet or wants to eat something, don't make any comments on her body, any at all. she can really only get help or change if she wants to, so just try and be a safe, comforting presence for her when she feels she needs it. and most importantly,  like I said, ask her what would help her best. you're a good person for reaching out on her behalf",False,False
