I would just assume that they are living in my room somewhere, but nobody else in the family has these bites, and they've been in my room plenty of times and even slept in my bed a few times (it's pathetic but if I can't keep myself safe through the night my mum sleeps next to me in bed)",False,True

Every time you'd go in there, you'd get flea bites on your ankles but not from anywhere else in the house. You can sprinkle FOOD GRADE diatomaceous earth over the floor. If you've got hard floor instead of carpet, use a broom to spread it around. This will basically put microscopic cuts into the fleas and they dehydrate and die but it's safe for humans and pets. Also clean your room and wash everything.  You should also definitely see a doctor but treating for fleas even if there aren't any is cheap and doesn't hurt.  ",False,False

The stuff they use there is some badass flea nuke shit.  Secondly, it’s likely to be malnutrition that’s stopping you from healing. You need protein and essential fats for cell repair.  Signs of infection include, redness and swelling around the area, pus, and fever. If you have any of these symptoms or you feel unwell you should consult your physician.",False,False

Idk abt fleas but poiso ivy reactions can get into your system and pop up new places without being exposed more than once. Definitely would recommend seeing a doctor, sometimes it takes steroids to get these things under control.",False,False

Cough plus rash and fatigue could be any number of things. You're right in that it most likely isn't fleas or bedbugs as no one else in your family is being affected. ,False,False

It could be that your inflammatory response to the bites is just a lot more readily apparent because your skin's ability to protect and heal (and immunoresponse system overall) is depressed. Are you taking vitamins? This isn't to push you into something you don't want to do/aren't ready for, but even temporarily upping your intake of good nutrients and taking a multivitamin could help a lot. Good luck!!
