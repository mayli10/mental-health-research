Just like they insist on people gaining to get to a healthy weight, you should be given help to get to a healthy weight. That's a long term plan... initially it's probably more important to stabilize behaviours... but I'd advocate for yourself for their helping you get to a healthy BMI. Does that make sense?",False,False
