I'm as mentally healthy, wanting to get better, sick and tired of ED's bullshit as ever, but remaining 80~100lbs as a grown man always leads me to relapse. I know I need to get over that hump of gaining the weight in order for the mental stuff to stick.",False,False

Seemed outlandish AF to go back under 18.5 - didn't want that for myself at all. Now I'm so deep into the relapse, I hear Kill Bill alarms in my head when I get to about 4kg under 18.5 - shit is seriously so warped and insidious it makes me want to cry when I realise how the goalposts just keep shifting.",False,False

Unfortunately, that’s not possible when you’re 80 lbs.  (I don’t have an ED, but I have multiple disorders that make my relationship with food..... let’s just say not fun.) I recently learned of something called ACT therapy, and I feel like it can be really helpful for anyone who knows that their thoughts are atypical but who can’t seem to get away from the emotion that’s tied to those thoughts that pop into their brain. I started it myself and it can really make a difference",False,False
