I hate the fetishization of lesbians to be small petite little things but at the same time it's exactly what I want to be?

It’s so crazy that I think exactlyyy like this and see no end in sight of ever not thinking like this but seeing it said by some random internet stranger just makes my heart break for them wishing they didn’t have to feel that way and thinking if I just tell them something uplifting it might help knowing damn well nothing anyone could say to me would change my own thought process of this. EDs are fucking fucked.,False,False
