I'm in a relationship right now that has a foggy future because of both of out mental health problems. But, I still think that ultimatum is a shitty thing to throw at somebody. I'm not saying she would be a bad person for leaving him over this, more that neither of them seem emotionally prepared for the situation they're in. And if she does end up leaving him over this, good for both of them. Ultimatums are a good way to make both people feel trapped. I mulled over giving my boyfriend ultimatums before, but any way I sliced it, it ended with either or both of us unhappy. I guess ""dodged a bullet"" was the term meant to make OP feel better, but I should've been more honest and specific.",False,False

You deserve to have your struggles respected. That's not to say that she shouldn't hope for you to get better and encourage it, but trying to force it like this is unfair to you. It's not like you chose to be this way.",False,False

In the end it is not her responsibility to be looking out for OP. Being there for someone who is mentally ill is draining, especially if she‚Äôs trying to take care of herself and not relapse. It doesn‚Äôt seem unreasonable to ask him to work towards recovery and if he can‚Äôt do that, she has every right to leave in order to help herself. That doesn‚Äôt make her a bad person, it makes her mature and human.",False,False

Not only do you have the burden of keeping yourself in check, but you have your partner who can trigger a relapse with their own relapse.   It really sucks, but you have to take into consideration that shes holding both hers and your health above your relationship. If that means breaking up, then so be it.",False,False

If you‚Äôre interested and open to exploring recovery, that‚Äôs awesome and I hope she would support you on that path, but threats and ultimatums are definitely not effective support. If you decide to pursue recovery, I‚Äôd suggest having a conversation about specifically what forms of support can be healthy and effective for both of you. ‚ÄúBoundaries‚Äù can feel like an annoying buzzword but damn are they ever important to establish and maintain! It makes it so much less stressful for everyone, I swear.   And all that said, it‚Äôs also ok for one or both of you to decide you‚Äôre just not currently in the place to be able to have a healthy relationship with each other. You are absolutely not obligated to recover for her. But she is also not obligated to stay if that‚Äôs not good for her or if she sees she‚Äôs unable to offer the support you deserve. (I mean that with all possible compassion for you but I‚Äòm struggling to find the right words.) Of course, I‚Äôd hope this would be done in a mature and emotionally honest way and *not* an angry blame-ridden door slamming way.   (Story time) My ex-fiance called off our wedding when my destructive actions landed me in the ICU. That hurt like hell, but in retrospect I really wasn‚Äôt healthy enough to foster a relationship that was a true partnership. I was consumed by my pain and taking way more than I could give back. Worrying about me was taking a significant toll on his own mental health and on his job performance. We spent some time apart while I got help and got healthier. Currently we‚Äôre close friends, and who knows where the path will lead... Life is a wild ride. Wishing you all the best. I hope you find love and support.",False,False

But if you fail to meet her expectations with YOUR health, that's not a good reason to break up with someone. I'm being judgy with this next part, but from what you said it feels to me like she's worried your disordered eating will trigger her ED. If this is the case, it seems like she's more worried about you recovering for her sake, not for you to be healthier.
