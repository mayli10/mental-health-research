Guess what keeps me going with my ed behavior although not as severe as it was. Hint apparently my looks are the only thing I have going for me.   You can't win apparently  It's a self esteem problem inherently imo",False,False

People didn't like me when I was obese. People don't like me now I'm at a normal weight. And this is because who I am as a person is defective and that has very little to do with what I look like.,False,False

And sometimes I still do, but I took a leap with this one guy... and he has totally changed that for me. It’s not that I don’t think I’m fat anymore, it’s just that he seems so into me that it doesn’t matter. It’s been really healing and taught be not to be so hard on myself. If you can just get halfway there, maybe someone can meet you and help you make it the rest of the way.",False,False
