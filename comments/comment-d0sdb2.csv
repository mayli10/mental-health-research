I’ve had two job interviews. I haven’t been eating. I look different to those around me. I got my period so I’m sensitive and also kind of tired of socializing. I love my friends more than anything but I’d like to isolate for a while until my hormones are back to normal and I can behave somewhat regularly. But I’m a special case and am getting used to having friends after like 6 years of complete isolation. I think reclusion has always been my preference. Still dealing with breakup, still talking to guy who apparently is into me but I’m not so into it anymore which is good because it makes talking to him easier and I also think he was lying/horny when he told me he liked me. Every day I wake up and realize people know me now and after each interaction I have this stupid thought “so this is what it’s like to be seen” because I genuinely just don’t understand how more sociable people have kept up with doing this without taking years off. It makes me anxious but also fulfilled. I haven’t binged in a long time and don’t think I will either for a while. My attitudes towards hunger and boredom have changed drastically which concerns me but only for brief periods. This is like the longest post I’m so sorry and it’s a huge wall of text too. I just love the release of speaking into the void.",False,False
