I’m on a much lower dose this time and I haven’t had the same reaction which is good, but these side effects are hell. I’ve been nauseous, lightheaded, had killer headaches, liquid shits and vomiting, extra sweaty, drowsy, idk there’s probably more but I can’t think of it rn.   It has only been 5 days so far and I know it can take a few weeks for it to settle but rn I’m just hoping that all these side effects will be worth it y’know",False,True

I’m on latuda and it’s okay for controlling the symptoms it’s supposed to control but the side effects suck and in general I’m scared of antipsychotic medication even though I need it.,False,False
