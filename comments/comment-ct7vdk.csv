At my lowest weight, I had people literally freaking out over the fact I looked like I was dying- and I liked it. I liked it because I felt it gave me permission to binge without having to worry about becoming ""chunky"". Being thin IS attractive, but so is being ""thick"". I personally think that society is actually deviating away from the unrealistic beauty standards, and it will take quite some time to get to an all inclusive point, but it's a lot better now than it was in the 90's or something.  &amp;#x200B;  Being thin IS attainable without having an eating disorder. It's being super underweight that is a struggle since it requires starvation and over exercising- but regular people don't find starving looking women to be more attractive than a ""fit queen"". It's ok to have whatever body you want to have- as long as you aren't on the verge of death or major health problems. If being ""thin"" is the goal, than why can't we make the right choices to be there? Cause junk food tastes good? Cause working out is strenuous? If we make conscious choices and learn self discipline along with self love- we CAN have the body we want without being depressed on how to have it. I would know- I used to be thin by just eating 2 salads a day with extra protein, having a low cal snack and working out. After I developed depression, well, all that went out the window and I developed my horrendous ED.  There is hope, it's not black and white where thin=starving and fat=gluttony.   You can be healthy and have a flat stomach, you just have to learn how to eat properly/work out properly.   &amp;#x200B;  I hope this post doesn't come off as antagonizing or condescending- I am only writing all this because I know exactly how you feel. It really does suck to experience both thin privelege, average treatment and than ""fat/ugly"" girl treatment. The difference between the 3 are eye opening and it definitely makes me paranoid to gain literally ANY weight. I am currently 96 lbs at 5'2, and my ED brain tells me I need to go lower. I have had people tell me to put on weight because I look scary, and I have also had people like the way my body is at this point. Knowing me and most girls who have had issues with being underweight eventually gain a BUNCH of weight back and it's terrifying. Why? Because of the lack of self control- the way you feel after LONG periods of restriction to the point you can't stop emotional eating. Being underweight isn't the goal, being thin and healthy is. Sustainability is.",False,False

They don't give a SHIT about you. Or me. Or anyone else with an ED.  Those popups exist to cover their collective asses.  You want to know how to be openly pro-ED in this environment?

When r/proed was taken down, I was so pissed. It was a decision made without really trying to understand the purpose of the community, and it felt like the only safe space (other than peach) where people with all types of EDs connected and related. I‚Äôm grateful for the r/edanonymous community for that reason.   On another note, I totally agree with your second paragraph. It‚Äôs definitely challenging to attempt recovery in a society where thin is always the standard, and weight gain is almost always seen as negative. Thank you for sharing your thoughts.
