I'm starting to think that maybe the nurse weighed me wrong, but after starting ADHD medicine I dropped a whole bunch of weight. I was eating just as much as before, but I found that the appetite suppression actually helped me eat healthier. I used to do OMAD because I would get scared about binging late at night if I didn't. I eat small portions al throughout the day now and even have drinks with calories sometimes. The only two explanations for my weight dropping than going back up with no changes to diet or physical activity are that eating better helped with my GI problems and reduced bloating or that I was weighed wrong. All I know for sure is that my eating habits went back to being garbage after my doctor threatened to stop prescribing my ADHD meds if I lost any more weight. It fucked me up pretty bad because I force myself to eat sometimes now which makes me feel sick and triggers my anorexia so then I restrict and of course feel sick in different ways but then also worry I might actually lose weight. My eating habits are all over the place now... (*I also carry a heavy backpack around every day for school and the other day I actually looked up how many more calories that burns* ðŸ™ƒ)",False,False
