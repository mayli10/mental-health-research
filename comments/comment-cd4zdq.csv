Because I don’t *think* it’s water weight, i don’t even know how i’d know whether it is or not, so i think this is why i’m panicking over that cake :’))",False,True

BUT! it’s two slices of cake. and i’m assuming they were pretty delicious. i’m hoping you got to at least savor the taste of them. there is no way two cake slices will lead to any actual weight gain. just remember, in order to gain TRUE weight (i say true bc the scale could go up but that’s water weight/the literal weight of the food in you) you’d have to eat 3500 calories plus your tdee! everything will be perfectly okay 🖤",False,False
