Then I drink another mouthful of milk to neutralize the acid along my throat. Then I clean myself up, with a hot shower (its so relaxing esp aft an exhausting purge) or just wash my face (if I dont have time for a shower). Then, I'll brush my teeth to get all the disgusting shit I ate stuck on my teeth out and pee. Change into new comfy clothes and throw the purge stained clothes into the laundry. Drink tons of water (~2 litres) to make me full, weigh and eat an apple and a cup of milk and note down calories. Because my hair is falling out like mad, I have to eat something after a purge and apples, low fat milk are my safe food so its alright and wont lead to a binge. Might get some wholemeal bread an hour later if I'm still hungry for the sake of nutrition.  If I'm outside, I'll wash the vomit off my hands, and my cheeks. Reapply lipstick. Smile, leave the toilet, pretending nothing just happened.",False,False

Late at night, normal dinner purge? I'll shower and go to bed.  Meal with family/friends at my place? Redo some of my makeup, fluff up my hair, mouthwash. If my eyes are red I'll say I was rubbing them. Take my multivitamin.  Meal with family/friends at a restaurant/out somewhere? Rinse my mouth, blow my nose, touch up my makeup if I can, eye drops if I have them with me, scrub my hands.  Work? Rinse my mouth out, get gum, wash my hands several times, rinse my eyes if I need to, hand sanitizer when I get back to the office, gum, drink hot water to reduce abdominal pain.  Really bad purge at home? Shower if I can, flush with water a few times, blow my nose to excess, eye drops, change my shirt to something more comfy, drink hot tea and eat some crackers so I stop shaking, take 2 doses of my multivitamin.  Really bad purge while out? Fuck me that shit sucks. Wash as much as I can at the sink, rise my mouth a ton, blow my nose a ton, hand sanitizer to excess up my hands and forearms (and around my mouth if I think I need it), gum, drink water (hot if I can), fluff up my hair, hope for the best?",False,False

The massage seems to help me a lot with reducing facial swelling. immediately after purging though I usually just make sure everything appearance-wise looks normal, rinse my mouth with water and chew a tum and swish it around in my mouth, and clear my throat a couple times because I ALWAYS have puke/phlegm stuck ðŸ¤©",False,False

It helps relieve some of the abdominal pain. Gives me a chance to think and reflect. Clean myself up.   I use a lot of cafeine drinks and carbonate drinks to purge so it helps reduce the water weight.,False,False
