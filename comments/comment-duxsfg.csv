Having such an area of damaged skin comes with a risk of infection, so watch for those signs and get medical attention promptly if you suspect infection. I don’t have personal experience with burns, but several of my abrasions have gotten infected and required antibiotics.    Lastly, if this came out of a desire to hurt yourself I’m so sorry you’re feeling that urge and I hope you’ll consider talking to someone about it. &lt;3 You do not deserve pain or injury no matter what anyone (including your own brain) tells you.",False,False

Typically it’s essentially the same, though. basically don’t pick any scabbing or blistering off and apply some triple antibiotic (neosporin) and bandage. Do NOT use any cloth-like bandage: use something with a smooth coating. As it heals, it WILL grow into the fibers and then when you take off the bandage you’ll be ripping off skin. Change this twice a day. Wash it daily, gentle soap and water. Again, don’t scrape off any scabbing/blistering. Watch for it becoming super red and swollen- burns are very susceptible to infection. If it does become infected, you will have to go to a doctor for antibiotics and a full cleaning. If it’s a really bad burn- 2nd to 3rd degree- you will have to slough off the skin yourself after a few days when the blister pops. Dead skin will form, collect bacteria, and cause infection. It hurts a lot and is the worst part of it all. It should heal in 3-4 weeks if it’s really bad. If it’s shallower (only burned through a couple layers of skin; flesh should not be a super dark/shiny pink/red), it’ll heal much more quickly and take less upkeep.   I’ve been burned a lot. This is what I’ve done for myself. I’ve never gotten infected and have had minimal scarring.",False,False
