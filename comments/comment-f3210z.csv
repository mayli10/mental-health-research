That's progress, and b/p-ing once does not negate any of that. we all mess up, but in the long run (and honestly short term as well) those mess ups won't make up much of a difference (especially body-wise, excess calories for a day won't leave any, or at most a *very very* tiny amount of effects on your body).  Tomorrow you will wake up not feeling so great, but you've still got the whole day to turn that around! What's important is not what you did today, but how you'll manage that tomorrow and how you'll keep progressing.  You are 100% deserving of your mom's love. You are deserving of everything good in life. Messing up once is not disgusting in any way shape or form (and if anyone tells you that it is, A) they're wrong, and B) send them to me so i can Firmly Talk To Them). You still went a long ass time without bingeing or purging and you deserve to be recognized for that accomplishment and you should be hella proud of that!! Eds are hell but you are so damn strong and amazing for surviving it and trying to move towards recovery. One day, this will be a faint memory in your mind, because recovery one day is always possible as long as you keep moving forwards.  I really hope that didn't sound stupid oml... if it did im really sorry!! we are always here for you, and if you need you can always message me :). Please don't be hard on yourself we love you and you are a wonderful human being, even if you don't feel like it atm &lt;3",False,False
