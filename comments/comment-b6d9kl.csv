I'm sure you look fine, but people are also attracted to qualities like confidence, ambition, kindness, etc. And online dating really isn't for everyone. Try meetup groups for a change. That said, don't worry so much about how others see you and just continue to focus on your own self-improvement. You're doing awesome. And congrats on losing 30lb! ",False,False

Before my ED I thought that if I were to lose weight, then I would become at least moderately attractive. I started dieting to lose 30 pounds which then turned into an ED and resulted in me losing more than 70 pounds and I'm still ugly, just a smaller ugly.  The way I feel about my looks has dragged me into a very dark place. Just these past few days, I've stopped talking to my friends and family and the guy I like because I'm seriously just...ugly. I don't wanna show my face to the world anymore and I don't want to wake up another day trying to convince myself that I'm pretty. All of my four siblings, older and younger, have been in relationships and get compliments about how pretty, beautiful,  and handsome they are. Meanwhile I'll be 26 this year and I've never even held hands with a guy. My ugly is pretty much the gasoline to my actively burning ED. Might as well destroy myself. ",False,False

The majority of women (who are looking for a relationship) place value on other factors other than, like, hotness. Maybe think about other things affecting your problems. If you're constantly being self-deprecating and self-pitying when you talk to women online (not saying you are), they're not gonna want to talk to you anymore. Focus on bettering yourself in other ways, ask yourself: ""would I want to date someone like me?"" Women (like most people) want to be with someone with good QUALITIES, so be kind, treat them with respect, and try to make a connection that's not just validation or getting laid.  Sorry for unsolicited advice but i just think some introspection could really help you out here.",False,False
