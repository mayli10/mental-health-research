The only time I've ever eaten in a way that wasn't super controlled was when I was overweight. I know if I ever get back to that everyone will think the same way as you. No one actually cares about the mental aspect of recovery, people just look at you and judge your recovery progress based entirely on your weight.",False,False

I too worry when I look up ""anorexia before and after"" on Google. It's all deadly skinny --&gt; teetering on obese. I agree with everything the post said, it's so hard to want to recover when the only people you have to look to just said ""fuck it"" and went all out. I don't want to ""fuck it"" and get chubby, I want to be healthy. Like you said, good for them that they're happy now, but I want to be healthy, happy, and pretty. Jameela figured it out, so that means there's something that can be done to get a good balance of it all.",False,False

After yoyoing between restriction, binging, etc. it takes awhile for the body's hunger cues to get reset. Look at the model Crystal Renn.
