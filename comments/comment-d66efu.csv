Cheez-it’s have a lot of sodium, sodium causes retaining of water.   You in no possible way will gain anything from this. Trust me, I have binged on 3000+ calories three days in a row twice this year and after 2-3 days of eating the same as I normally do, my weight goes back to what it was before the binges. You will be completely fine.   Honestly your body probably desperately needed that food. If you think 1100 is a binge, you more than likely are eating a really low really unhealthy amount of food and your body needed some nutrition.  Don’t stress, keep drinking water to flush out the sodium and water weight, and try to forget about it :)",False,False

They flush you out faster but it isn't like going to confession for your (calorie) sins. You don't repent with your burning ass on a toilet and then have a reset button any more than you have a reset button when you take a deep breath and realize you messed up and promise yourself not to binge in the next x amount of hours.   2) If you have been eating below or at your TDEE, even a binge that brought you above it shouldn't make you gain real weight. Not from one indulgence of a little extra.   3)  Your scale might fluctuate in the next 24 hours. You might flip out. Weight fluctuates. When I was underweight and did a water fast, my weight fluctuated 5-10 lbs difference the entire week.   4) back to laxatives. They can be good for when you are genuinely blocked up or your doctor instructs you to use them, but as someone who has abused them, don't use them as a reset button. I'll repeate: they don't delete calories. But when you use them when they aren't supposed to be used, they can wreak havoc on your body.",False,False
