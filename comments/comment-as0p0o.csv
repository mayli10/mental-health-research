I could be completely up my own ass and self absorbed for saying this, but I feel like its so disrespectful and uncalled for to compare or draw parallels between someone's disorder/illness and something else (unless it was in an appropriate context of discussion or a therapeutic setting obviously). It doesn't matter if you think there are parallels or if there are parallels, its just rude.   I've had people compare my bulimia to so many things or had people tell me that they know how I feel because they've watched someone struggle with addiction (to _smoking_ of all things). I've had people say that they understand what I'm going through because ""I've had bad habits too!"" I did not fucking ask for what you think is comfort/reassurance/relatability. ",False,False

I kept my bingeing a secret for years from my friends and the amount of times my bigger friends assumed to my face that I didn't know what it was like because I'm 'skinny' and don't eat was infuriating. But also it's a totally different level of bingeing so I can understand the frustration of that comment. Probably he/they were just trying to let you know you're not alone, without realising how different it can be ",False,False

People who don't suffer from an eating disorder have no idea how ignorant they are of them. Before I began to have any problems I fully believed that eating disorders weren't a real problem because it's not often people openly talk about them so I just had no idea. Anyways, sorry he said that. Congrats on your progress!",False,False
