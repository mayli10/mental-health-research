And since a can of tuna makes 2 sandwiches, that's pretty solid. However, if you're interested in a vegetarian option, I've had a ton of luck with chickpea salad! I always cook the chickpeas first (didn't the first time and HATED it. Texture was off and my stomach killed me for days.), season/sauce like I would tuna salad and tear up a nori sheet to mix in to give it that ""fishy"" taste. Sooooo good!",False,False
