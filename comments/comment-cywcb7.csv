Your friend may never change. That's a sad reality. Consider people in a crack house. One of them finally becomes drug-free. Should that person feel bad they were the first one that became drug-free while their friends still addicted?  Thinking about someone stuffing an entire pie would be a trigger for anyone :(,False,False
