Its like im constantly on a teeter totter trying to balance -eating enough to get protein in/not feel dizzy/have energy to lift and also -stay lean/get leaner/have muscle definition/abs. Im sorry I dont have any advice. I KNOW I need to eat more to gain muscle but im terrified that I wont be able to control myself and ill just end up in a binge spiral. Or that the food wont turn to muscle and ill just gain fat. I still workout everyday even in a deficit just to retain my muscles I do have, but I think its futile.",False,False
