I didn’t change any of my habits and got so worked up over it, I was totally trapped in my head. The following month I stopped and it was all gone within the first week! Luckily my guy is getting the snip snip and I won’t have to deal with altering my body chemistry anymore, omg.",False,False

I've had to try a couple of different birth controls before finding one that works for me best. It'll be ok, though, and will work out eventually. The doctor also may want you to keep using it for a month or however long, but if you're still unhappy with it, there are literally so many different birth controls out there that you've got a few options.",False,False
