I feel so full that every time I move I'm almost sick. I really want to go work out and burn it off but I'm afraid I'll puke if I do and that's too emotionally close to purging - and I haven't purged in a decade and I desperately want to keep it that way.  So I'm sucking on sugar free mints trying to calm my stomach and wait for the bloating to subside so I can go walk/run for an hour or two and shut up that mean bitch that lives in my head.,False,False

I did eat a bit of an Easter egg for breakfast (shared with my mother) as I wanted to enjoy it like anyone without an ED would. I did enjoy it but now I‚Äôm kicking myself.   I have two Easter eggs and I‚Äôm going to try stretching it out so I don‚Äôt binge them at once. To make it worse, my mother was too sick to do the Easter dinner she always does. On one hand, that‚Äôs good as it meant I could just have a chicken chargrill and sweet potato fries but on the other, she‚Äôll probably do it tomorrow.   Why can‚Äôt I just enjoy it like anyone else?",False,False

My last month of college.   Today is Easter- e.g. a socially sanctioned opportunity to have a cheat day (a whole day, rather than just a meal. Can count the number of days like that I have per year on one hand). And under most circumstances, I probably would have at it and just restrict for a couple days after.   But due to my stress, I'm not going to. Because it will turn into a binge. I have not stress eaten AT ALL this entire month of being completely on edge, and that is such a huge victory.  I'm going to get through today. And the next ten. I'm going to crush the two standardized exams I need to challenge. And I'm gonna be ok.",False,False

I still live with my parents and we've been living next to them since 2011. It's a single mom and young adult son.

Puts on the worst imaginable Dutch house (yes, house) so loud the walls vibrate. Now that it's warm out he hangs out with his friends in the backyard, being obnoxious and waiting for someone to confront them (because negative attention is still attentionnn). It's year after year and I'm getting really fucking sick and tired of this game. I'm in a really bad place right now, and being at home is frustrating and anxiety-inducing. I'm really pitying myself right now, but I feel hopeless and like I have nowhere to be. Going outside isn't always an option because severe depression.",False,False
