I remember someone trying to politely ask for clarification of which was the before/after picture and it was massively downvoted and only got comments like ""don't be a troll you can TELL which is which it's OBVIOUS"" and I'm like  I know that if I posted to a before/after sub and I got asked which was before and which was after I would be kind of gutted, but like... what else am I supposed to do? Just nod politely and compliment them regardless of whether I can tell they lost weight or not? I mean I guess that's not the worst option bc it can motivate them to keep eating healthily, maybe. But OTOH, sometimes I'll see posts like ""lost 4lb and I can already see a huge difference!!!!!"" and I'm like. I'm sure you can!! I'm sure you can tell where your clothes fit differently and how you move differently and how you feel better!! Those are all real! But at the very least, in these two unflattering photos, I can't tell a lick of difference lmao  I think there should be a sub-wide rule to label your befores and your afters regardless of how obvious you think it is. They refuse, for whatever reason, to enforce a strict left/right policy so if people had to add labels (or specify in the text, e.g. ""before on the left"") then people could put images in whatever order they wanted. Boom. Problem avoided totally. :/",False,False

When you upload the photos you upload as before then after but they get ordered the same way paper is when you print it. The last upload is the one furtherest on the left so we end up seeing it after THEN before.,False,False

I get in arguments all the time when I say the only way to keep weight off is to eat healthier foods all the time as a lifestyle change.

I honestly thought those subs were cultish enough that the people stuck to the lifestyle.
