When in reality this is the same as trying to put out a fire with a waterbottle. It wont work.   They have the best intentions, but lack the knowlege to actually help OP. I hope that deep down, OP does want help. If so, OP should simply talk to others and explain him or herself. And say to them that OP needs to talk, and that they can react when OP is done.   That is the first step in a large procces of rehab. ",False,False

And people always want to offer solutions as soon as they hear about a problem, whether it's an ED, depression, or anxiety. They are on the outside looking in and the 'fix' always seems so simple to them. They just cant mentally understand how the problem works in our minds.   It's hard to find someone that can just listen and understand. But hey, that's what this sub is for :D",False,False
