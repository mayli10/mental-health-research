Yeah, losing again, altho not really in a restrictive fashion, just stopped spending that much money on binge food (who knew that would’ve been the reason I “flipped the switch”). Really wish I could’ve actually done that, like, buy clothes that fit now and be confident in a body that’s albeit bigger. Honestly it would’ve been hard yeah. There aren’t that many clothes that I look better in fatter vs skinnier. And I really would’ve felt quite bad for wasting money especially on buying clothes which I have to record and that I wouldn’t be able to wear in a few months. I really just want a fuller chest area tho goddammit. Like a sexy and tight off the shoulder top around a voluptuous décolletage. DAMNIT. I need bigger boobs lmao.",False,True
