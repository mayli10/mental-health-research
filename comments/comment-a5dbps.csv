""disordered eating"" to me means simply that it's interfering with either my health or my relationships.  and orthorexia has the health angle covered (lolllllllll), the main one I still struggle with is relationships.  so, to recover I am trying really hard to embrace and accept that part of me that sees food as a social thing.",False,False

Makes me binge and then restrict. I'm trying this because I've never had a high fat (or even moderate fat diet) and I'm hoping that I can level out my hunger signals. They're so fucked up from being in ED mode for so long. ,False,True

I can’t seem to complete a 24 hours fast so I give up but not completely. Gonna do it 16:8 / 20:4. I need to get disciplined in something so I can adjust from that. I tried once the Whole30 lifestyle and it was AMAZING, My natural smell was incredibly delicious, but after I first cheated I couldn’t go back. ",False,False

I wanted to tried keto many times. Idk if it was because of my ED or keto wasn't for me, but I couldn't maintain it. Always want to try again too because I heard so many nice things about it.
