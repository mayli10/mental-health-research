She frequently lashed out in anger but thank you so much for your perspective. It makes me look at things a different way...,False,True
fdc7lav,t3_ekkzon,t3_ekkzon,realschmeal,2,2020-01-05 17:57:42,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/ekkzon/need_advice_support/fdc7lav/,"I'm sorry this happened to you.  I'm not sure who the 15 year old is (your sibling?) but it sounds like there may be a couple things happening. First, I'm proud of you and your recovery and you should absolutely be too. Second, being 15 is a veryyy sensitive time especially for things like developing an ED. It could be a weird projection coming from your sibling...  That being said I would talk to her and firstly tell her that was inappropriate and hurt your feelings, but also mention the dangers of having an ED and that you're there for her if she feels like she might be developing a bad relationship with food. I honestly don't think this has anything to do with you. It sounds like she wanted to see a reaction from family from such a sensitive topic...which makes me concerned for her.  Hope this helps!",False,False
