We used to have lots of fights about my eating habits but after talking it over so many times he kinda just let's my thing as long as things don't get out of hand.  We're a bit older than a good number of you guys on this sub (and he also deals with my constant depressive episodes and anxiety attacks) so.. Yeah.  My only advice would be to talk it out with him if you're comfortable. For us, the fights really died down once I started explaining clearly (and calmly) why I don't want to eat or why I'm only eating certain things. We've been together for like 3 years tho and things didn't really start getting better until 2-ish years in.  If you're not comfortable and he's not very well versed in nutrition, you could do high volume/low cal. I used to OMAD like 3 lb of lettuce and low cal dressing all the time and he never was concerned.",False,False

He understands and supports me. He looks for healthy alternatives and will even hunt down my very specific brands.
