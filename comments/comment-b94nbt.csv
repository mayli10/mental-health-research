The problem is just when I go out and see other people and for some reason my brain thinks I am always 10x fatter than most people around me and then I feel unhappy.  I think if I lived in like a vacuum on my own I would feel ok but it's comparing myself to other people that gets me down and I always visualise myself as being way bigger than other people. :/",False,False

When I see a skinny girl in public I often ask my SO, “am I as thin as her?” or, “are my legs as skinny as hers?” and he always looks at me like I’m crazy and says, “you’re way thinner than she is.” Last week week he said out of the blue, “you know, whenever you ask me to compare you to girls on the street, you’re always *way* smaller than them. By a lot.” But I still feel like a chub monster compared to most of them lol. ",False,False
