You deserve to focus on the people you love and the things you like doing, so although it doesn't feel like it you have nothing to feel bad about. The memory is definitely worth more than one day of just thinking about food and calories!  You won't have gained weight from it but you're instead experiencing the joys of the body's weird fluctuations, water weight and all the good stuff (sigh), but there's definitely no way you've gained any weight from this!  You made a good step choosing to fight against negative thoughts and enjoy yourself, I hope you had a really good time &lt;3",False,False

Your weight is like blood pressure, it fluctuates naturally. When you have an ED, you feel the need to weigh yourself every day compulsively. This leads to you freaking out and punishing yourself any time the number on the scale (naturally) increases. Time of day is crucial, as is whether or not you went to the bathroom beforehand. All of this is normal, and that weight is temporary. Second of all, be proud of yourself! You spent a whole day rewarding yourself as you celebrated with a loved one! That's a huge accomplishment! Instead of punishing yourself today, be proud that you did this for yourself (and for him, I'm sure). You had a great time and you didn't let your ED steal your joy on your anniversary, so why let it steal that from you now?",False,False
