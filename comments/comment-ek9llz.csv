Some days I don't really leave my bed so I don't take meds etc. Some days I'll miss a dose because I didn't fall asleep until 6am because of insomnia and slept the day a way. It's my fault I don't go out and get them too really. I'm staying quite far away from my dr's at the moment and my prescriptions are electronic to them so I can't easily get to them. I haven't told anyone that I've ran out yet and I'm struggling and I can't go out to get them myself because of the withdrawals making driving dangerous.,False,False

My dreams and reality are melding together so much I can't tell which is which anymore. A lot of my emotions, thoughts, and feelings are carrying on from those dreams and I'm getting paranoid and angry at people irl now. I keep reliving the scenarios from my nightmares during the day too.  Pretty sure my SSRI is also increasing my suicidal ideation and I've never felt so motivated to follow through. Everything is going to shit. Stuff I can't post about on here.  Sorry for posting here I guess it has nothing to do with my ED but I feel like this is the only community who actually read what shit I put out.  On topic though my vitals are fucking awful, bloods awful, trouble taking my meds on time. I haven't kept any food down for ages because bulimia. Any time I feel full I have to purge. There aren't any safe foods where I am, not even any bread or meat. So I just order takeaway and binge purge when I get hungry.  I haven't taken my meds for days and I don't have any way to get them myself. I'm in a lot of pain right now I guess.",False,False

I'm down roughly half of the 15 but my weight for this week has stagnated between the same 3 numbers and I want to yeet. I feel disgusted with myself some but can only vent about it so much offline. I really hope I didn't gain all the weight the scale thinks I have.  I took some rest days from stepping with Wii Fit to make sure my feet wouldn't be sore by the time I'm back on campus but even on my usual ""healthy"" low restriction it feels like a lot of food because I've cut lower this week then I should have most days since I wanted to make sure I had enough safe foods for the next days until someone could go get more groceries.  How can people continue to bake cakes after the holidays and go back to usual eating after indulging so much over the holidays?
