I think doing the opposite (where I eat more in the morning and cut it down in the PM) has not been working with me and my running routine.   Iâ€™ll check out Powerade zero! It probably has all the electrolytes I need to recover better.  Good luck with the PB. I canâ€™t control myself anymore I just lick and spit. I actually bought PB2 recently and it tastes exactly the same!,False,True

I always run in the mornings, eat a little bit for lunch and dinner was always my biggest meal to try and fuel me up for the next morning. I know timing of the meals probably doesn't matter much but that was my system and it worked in my head haha. I'd normally eat a bag of tuna with some spinach in the afternoon (or a protein/Clif bar) and then some combo of fish/chicken/chickpeas/black beans with veggies/cauliflower rice/spinach for dinner.  Post running binges are so real-- just moved back into my parents' house and the peanut butter jar stares at me because i think it knows i banned it from my dorm ðŸ˜¥",False,False

Thereâ€™s a family wedding in July so fucking everyone is dropping those pounds.   Ooh! You give me hope :) thatâ€™s so awesome that you were able to run a HM.

I'm sorry it's so overwhelming!   Also I trained for and ran a half marathon in April while restricting!

Well what I would suggest, to not break the bond with your sister and to use this on your advantage is to share this with her. Go to the gym together (but maybe exercise separately) so it motivates both of you. Idk if cooking together is something comfortable for you, but I use to do that with my friend (both exercise and eat). Maybe this is too uthopic, but maybe trying to take positive advantage of this is a way to deal with it.",False,False

I don't want to encourage you losing too much OP, but this might be a good opportunity to have a gym buddy and to excuse some disordered behaviours by ""helping your sister out"" with her weight loss.
