I did a big shopping trip there once and the sizes are all over the place. As in I picked up 2 pants that were the same size and cut from the same pile and they fit differently. Like if you held them up together one was longer and had a slightly narrower waist.  Then I could be a 2 in one cut and a 6 in another.   Long story short I still have a lot of old navy gift cards. ,False,False
