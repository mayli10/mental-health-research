I miss the smell of my mom’s pumpkin bread filling every room of the house, or of eating endless bowls of Cheerios without guilt long past the point of satiation. I miss cookies and peanut butter and mac and cheese, and all of the tasty holiday treats we shared when I was young. But eating these foods today won’t give me the same satisfaction. I’d either have a few bites and be so overwhelmed with guilt I’d hate it, or b/p and hate myself instead. I miss the innocence surrounding my favorite childhood foods, but more than that... I miss knowing I can’t ever have it back. :\",False,False
