If it’s run by compassionate understanding people it does wonders. Maybe try and find out from people who’ve been through the specific program and see what they say,False,False

The dietitian we had was a load of crap. We used this weird fringe basically calorie counting method to track what we were eating. All the food was greasy or fatty and discusting. Most of the group therapy was bullshit. The RN who ran the program was a total bitch who didn’t give a shit about how anyone was actually doing. There were several staff members who were fantastic and caring but it wasnt enough. I ended up getting discharged after a week because I gained like 2 lbs on a matinince diet so obviously I don’t have a real ED. They’re one of the reasons I refuse to admit I have an actual ED and not just some disordered habits,False,False

I’m coming in as EDNOS/OSFED (more restrictive bulimic really but normal BMI).

IMO (and an increasing body of research supports this) it's the level of care most likely to bring about lasting recovery since you have the opportunity to integrate the changes you're making in treatment into your daily life, especially as you get closer to step down and attend fewer days/hours each week.  I did IOP because I was in the middle of a horrific bulimic period and it really did make a huge difference for me and I am now a ""recovered"" bulimic who's months behaviour free and back to being a restrictive anorexic. Progress, not perfection, right?  Previously I'd just gone from IP-&gt;PHP-&gt;outpatient without doing IOP so I could return to work more quickly, and IOP was really, really helpful at getting me to normalise my eating and not get so trapped in B/P cycles.  Schedule wise, you'll probably show up in the afternoon, get weighed/vitals checked one day a week, have a group or two, then eat dinner and go home. Depending on the size and structure of the program, you may or may not be combined with people who are in PHP.   Most people in IOP will be weight restored, and there'll be a higher proportion of bulimic and BED sufferers than you'd encounter in res. Ages will vary; you tend to have more college aged kids during the summer months and near quarter/semester ends, but usually it's mid-20s through 50s weighted with a leftward skew to the age distribution.",False,False

Admittedly it may just be the specific place I went to but it was such a horrid experience that it has turned me off of therapy since.     I was referred to it upon leaving an inpatient facility where I ended up after a suicide attempt. I was supposed to go 9-3? or 4? Monday through Friday for 3 weeks. I got in my first day and sat down with my 1 on 1 therapist who seemed like an ok lady at the time, and then I was put in with the group. And that's where it all plummeted down hill. In my group there was a wide variety of people, which is fine, but they had people like me and this woman who had just gotten out after 2 months because of a psychotic break with people like this woman who was feeling like she had no purpose because she had retired. I'm not trying to discount anyone elses feelings or struggles but talking about past abuse and assault in the same room and context as a woman saying she didn't have any mail and that saddened made me close up like a clam.     All we ever did is those stupid worksheets about like how to cope! and how to meditate! and mindfulness! and I was like I spend 50 percent of the day doing worksheets like a child and another 40% listening to other people basically bitch about their day to day and I felt like I was regressing so I just stopped going. Bad Idea. My personal therapist at this place called my parents and literally told them everything I had shared and how she feared I was a suicide risk. I was not a suicide risk, I was bored. A Sure Fire Way to turn me into a suicide risk is to tell my conservative parents that I had been raped and sexually assaulted. Seriously my worst panic Attack Ever.  Anyway I was forced to finish out the last two weeks so I sat there and shared nothing and said nothing (except to the really cute boy) and it was a total and absolute waste of time. But thats just my experience. Inpatient however was fantastic and it was the time I felt most at peace and sort of clearheaded since I was like 10.",False,False

Dietitians and therapists were present and they’d talk to you if they saw you struggling. Talk of calories/numbers was strictly forbidden.

It was 3 days a week for 3 hours each session. We mostly just fucked around and wasted time. You only met with your therapist once per week and the rest of the time was group. I was 17 at the time so I was one of the oldest ones there. Group was dominated by a 13 year old who thought she knew everything. There was hella censorship. You couldn’t say restricting, calories, fat, etc. You could only say “I had an urge to use a problem behavior...” I didn’t find it helpful at all. ",False,False
