I hate that I am insecure about it. I feel like I should be too mature to care— and recognize what’s *inside* my head is more important than what’s on it. But being ugly and hating your body is a double-whammy of OOF that just hits you every time you come across a reflective surface.   I have tried makeup, and am horrible at it. I do the bare minimum to look like a human but cannot contour for the life of me. My clothes style is very androgynous, partially because I just love men’s clothes and shirts in particular. I accidentally wore a nearly-identical shirt to my boyfriend today (and god BLESS his genuinely good heart for loving my ugly face).   *I wish I cared less about this nonsense*",False,False
