It’s usually just... whatever I’m watching at the time haha. These are some of them I’ve been enjoying lately though:  Gossip Girl The Society On My Block The Vampire Diaries Disenchantment A Series of Unfortunate Events  I’ve got a super fuckin long list of things waiting to watch but those are the most recent ones!

At the moment I’m feeling quite depressed and anything too happy will just make me feel worse, so I’m watching A Series of Unfortunate Events. Also rewatched a bit of Bojack.
