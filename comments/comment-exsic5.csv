I really feel for u here bc I have the same kinda thought process relatively often and the only reason I haven't followed through is bc I also have ridiculous trust issues (ironically especially towards older men). I can say with time it does quiet down though, partly thanks to seeing the situation from the other person's point of view. I've also had some friendships with older guys where it felt to me that both of us were aware on some level of what I was after but also how bad that would be and these were strangely healing experiences (though I guess wanting to be hurt and being treated kindly and compassionately instead will do that for anyone). I've really been very lucky in this respect. I personally don't do so well with therapy (lots of homophobia here) but if you could go I'd really recommend giving it a shot.   Sorry for sorta spilling my guts here but I really do feel for u and wish u all the best bc I know, at least partly, where you're coming from and the hurt you're feeling. Hang in there and take care of yourself as well as you can ðŸ’ž",False,False

So thank you",False,True

Like really really really don't do it. This is not a good idea. It's inadvisable. It would be good to do the opposite of this. You get me",False,False
