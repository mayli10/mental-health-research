I just remember how shocked she was to find out she‚Äôs 30 lb lighter than I am (and she‚Äôs an inch taller). I eat so much healthier than she does... she goes harder at the gym though. But she eats boxed mashed potatoes, tons of chocolates and deserts, two full dinners each night plus a midnight snack, boxed Mac and cheese, bacon, sandwich meats, really sugary breakfast smoothies. I‚Äôm a bitch for this, I know it, but I look at how she eats and think of how I ate at her age. She is going to blow the fuck up in 7 years. She‚Äôs tall, blonde, a twin, rich, parents pay her credit card, expects the world to hand things to her. She also JUDGES OTHER PEOPLES STRUGGLES SO MUCH. Like she‚Äôs got an exotic pilot bf and never had to online date - she‚Äôs super judgy about Tinder dates. While she‚Äôs also nice, I can‚Äôt wait for her to struggle with weight one day. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm a bitch for thinking this but I feel like a struggle would serve her right and I really fucking hope it‚Äôs her weight.   Please downvote me while I go out myself in timeout.",False,False
