I feel like people downplay how fucking dangerous EC stacking is. I started stacking in December of 2017 at a pretty low point (and pretty low weight) and experienced my first-ever heart palpitations after a two-day water fast, EC stacking, and zero attempt to manage my electrolytes. Iâ€™m in the middle of a re-relapse (restricting after a couple months of steady partial recovery) and itâ€™s like I no longer have any idea how to handle my ED behaviors without stacking. Itâ€™s been a real-ass struggle. My mom has heart problems and had a stroke at age 45 definitely in part from decades years of active bulimia and abuse of all the scary-ass diet pills available in the 70s and 80s, so I was scared to try stacking but eventually my ED brain won and here I am. ðŸ™ƒ  Like, I donâ€™t know what it is about them, but they were harder to quit and literally felt harder on my body (the gross dizzy speedy feeling, nausea, shakes, heart palpitations) than cocaine or adderall ever were. Everyoneâ€™s different, obvs, but that shit fucked me up good and it is scary.
