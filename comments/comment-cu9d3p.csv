Most good quality stuff is 100% cotton, meaning no stretch. It’s not your fault, it just fits on bodies differently because it’s so thick and stiff.  My best fitting pair of jeans has 2 inches more on the waist than other trousers I wear, it bothered me so much I ripped the back sizing tag off.",False,False
