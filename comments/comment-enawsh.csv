Either I'm eating ""super healthy"" for a few months or relapse into BED where I only eat garbage. Its exhausting. I want it to end but I cant find a normal medium. Either its all fast food chips and chocolate or I'm on whatever diet I consider ""pure"" at the time. When I'm in the oretherixa phase I feel better but that's only because when I'm in my BED phase I eat so poorly. I dont know why I cycle between the two but I hate it. Right now I have so many ""no rules"". No sugar, no sugar substitutes including honey, no gluten, no corn (except organic), no legumes, no soy, no dairy, only a palm full of rice a week max, no more than a thumb of oil but best avoided, no double processed foods.",False,False

At first I thought it would help me be more health conscious rather than restrictive but now it's the extremes of both. All I wanted was a toned ass &gt;:(,False,False

I go through cycles of orthorexic obsession, which are made worse by my hypochondria. Remember when Gary Taubes told us that sugar was literal death, or whatever? I used to lie awake crying at night, because even though I'd immediately cut out all sugar and fruit, there was no way for me to undo the years of damage I'd done by eating apples and cherries and chocolate. I was convinced I'd destroyed my body. I probably already had diabetes at minimum. I was falling apart from the inside. I was going to die of 10 different sugar-related diseases. Fun times.    Another memorably bad time was when I first went WFPB. I still eat mostly WFPB, but am not strict about it anymore because it was so triggering. It encouraged me to think that my ED was basically right this whole time. Like, oil wasn't just high-calorie, it was POISON. Fat wasn't just the enemy, it was NOT TO BE TOUCHED. Like, for anyone with orthorexic tendencies, please think carefully before going full WFPB. Like I said, I do still follow WFPB for the most part, because it is a great way to eat! But I cannot let myself have iron-clad rules about it. Once a diet gets into ""never eat oils or u will DEAD"" territory...yeah, that's probably bad news for anyone with an ED.",False,False

There was another post earlier asking about the foods that you don't eat but miss, and after filling a page with a list of everything that I've stopped eating, I realised that my diet is actually very restrictive. I'm down to oatmeal or wheat cereal with soy for breakfast, a protein shake, something veggie or bean-based for lunch, and protein and veg for dinner. And vitamins. I've struggled with not cutting out fruit, but have found that having a piece occasionally stops me from sugar binges.   And workouts twice daily, even when I'm injured. And I battle with not looking thin enough because I work out expressly to build muscle. It's all shit.",False,False

Especially because most healthy food is low in calories, so your body needs so much more food. It's something I kinda just fell into- now all I eat is fruits, vegetables, and grains, and leave little room for anything salty or what I label as being bad for me. I can't enjoy a donut because I'll be thinking about how I could be eating something much healthier for half the amount of calories. I love eating 'healthy', but it's caused me to develop so many fear foods. Can't eat sugar, oils, noodles, any type of flour, or any type of ""snack"" or ""junk food"".",False,False

I lost a bunch of weight (too quickly) doing IF. Then I fell into the low carb nonsense, then keto, then wfpb because I plateaued and it allowed me to drop more weight. All the while subscribing to every nutritional YT video/podcast/blog I could find that fit my narrative. Eventually I became afraid to eat anything that wasn't wfpb. Oh then I was so obsessed I bought how not to die and followed it religiously. I literally thought I would die if I didn't eat flaxseed and oatmeal everyday. And I could only eat every 4-5 hours or else my blood sugar would be out of whack. Eventually it lead to anxiety and panic and I'd spend hours researching symptoms thinking I had all kinds of issues. Was cold all the time (mostly hands and feet). I was able to get away from that thinking though. I eat when hungry, stop when I feel full. I don't eat much processed food but if I want candy one day I'll have some. I love sweets so I know I need to be mindful there. If I want a beer I have one. Basically I eat anything that comes from the ground, off a tree, or had parents :) and don't feel bad about it anymore. It sucked.",False,False
