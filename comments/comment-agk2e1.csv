I don't know if the flaws are real, if I really am this huge, or if it's just the dysmorphia. And I can't trust the people close to me to tell me the truth either because my little lizard brain is telling me they just want to sabotage my weight loss because they're jealous or something ðŸ˜­ but I know my friends aren't vindictive at all and they would never do that. It's so hard. One part of my brain is telling me one thing, another part another then my dysmorphia is screaming over both. With cymbals. ",False,False

You never think you have it. You're not crazy- of course what you see is the truth, I'm not delusional, am I? Of course not, of course this is real. I don't have body dysmorphia.",False,False
