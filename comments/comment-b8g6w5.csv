It seems like their relationships with food are pretty messed up as well. If money is an issue maybe look for a roommate or just a room to rent? ,False,False

It just sucks, because financially; I’m not ready yet. I thought about when I was a lil girl growing up, and there have always been comments here and there that would just spark a lot of insecurity in me. Didn’t even need to be food related, ya know? My parents aren’t bad people or anything, but they do have a toxic side to them, and I think I get it now. Thanks for your comment. ♥️",False,True

How were they before you had anorexia, if you can remember?   It seems odd to me that they comment on you eating too MUCH. i feel like most families of people with eating disorders would comment on them eating too little, or do they do both?  Being in that environment must be so freaking hard. If you asked them to stop, do you think they would? Honestly best thing would be for you to move out.",False,False
