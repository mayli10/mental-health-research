Even when I try and eat over 800 cals a day my body doesn't allow it because of my nausea and digestive problems. I also have a phobia of puke so my anxiety is through the roof 24/7 hoping I'm not gonna get sick. So basically it's a constant struggle of not eating ""too much"" because my body can't digest a normal amount of food and eating enough so the acid in my stomach won't cause me to up chuck anyway. I basically live on 150 cal protein bars, cottage cheese, and watermelon. The worst thing in the world to me is hyperventilating while puking because you're having an anxiety attack from being sick.",False,False

Right now it's under control, but it went undiagnosed for my teens and early 20s. Pretty sure that's at least 50% of the reason that I developed an ED- I have a TON of systemic symptoms like headaches, dizziness and anxiety when I eat gluten. Before I was diagnosed, I just associated those symptoms with eating in general... if I didn't eat, I felt 1000% better. Eventually did get diagnosed and got things together on a gluten free diet, but damn that subconscious association is hard to shake. Plus, I CAN'T eat anything  in 90% of casual social situations since Celiac-safe gluten free options are still fairly rare. Ridiculously minute amounts of gluten make me very sick. It's a pretty ready reason for avoiding food.",False,False

That whole ""no food = no symptoms"" thing is what started my ED. I've given up on recovery as a concept because the Crohn's makes it impossible. When the very act of eating makes you sick, how are you ever supposed to have a ""normal"" relationship with food?  The irony is that my ED causes all kinds of digestive symptoms.
