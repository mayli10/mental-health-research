Imagine you were allergic to strawberries. That's a restriction but you wouldn't ""quit"" it because you'd get hives (or whatever). If you're not willing to eat cheese out of fear of calories or whatever, that's a problematic restriction. If you're not willing to eat cheese because the cows that made it were mistreated, that's different. Does that make sense?",False,False

I lost a *lot* of weight over a period of about 7 months, then started struggling with binge/restrict cycles and gained a little back over time. Among other things, I ended up with a B12 deficiency and wasn't getting anywhere near enough protein. It took me until this past summer to be okay with making the conscious, intentional decision to prioritize my health. I've since added eggs and seafood back in (never liked meat or chicken anyway, and I'm lactose intolerant, so this is pretty much as unrestricted as I can get).  I'm still struggling, but not as much. I'm starting to notice a difference in my energy levels and my hunger cues, which motivates me to keep choosing recovery. Personally, I would not have been able to continue trying to be vegan while simultaneously trying to deal with my eating disorder.  My original motivation for going vegan was to minimize harm to sentient beings. Well, guess what? I am a sentient being, too. And right now, minimizing harm to myself means prioritizing my health and doing whatever I need to do to recover. For me, at least for now, that is not compatible with being vegan.",False,False

Anything organic. You have to just ask yourself if you're being vegan to spite yourself or if you're really someone who cares about animals' welfare. If you still buy leather stuff and eat processed food with minor amounts of non-vegan ingredients then you're probably the former. Veganism just isn't sustainable anymore though and personally I don't think it is healthy or better for the environment than a regular diet. That's just me. I've been vegan for 6 years. Not anymore tho.,False,False

I felt bad that I couldn’t be a poster girl for the vegan message because deep down I knew that it was an excuse to control what I ate (despite my best intentions). At the beginning, and for a long time, I thought that it was helping my cause and “cured” my ed. However, now since I’ve stopped, I’m at the point where I’m not really sure where I’m at with eating food because it’s been such a long time since I could walk into a supermarket and essentially have all of the food as an ‘available’ option for me (if that makes sense).  I’m not sure if I’m really answering/properly adding to your discussion here, but I am literally in the middle of this dilemma rn haha.",False,False
