Why get a free law degree if you already know that working in law makes you miserable? I know I should give a more neutral answer like 'do what feels right' but honestly if I were you I would just do what makes me happy.,False,False

I have never regretted it for one second, and now I have a similarly high-paying job, I work from home, I am very fond of my boss and he adores me and showers me with bonuses and praise.  Bad jobs are bad.  You only have one life.",False,False

You aren’t abandoning a childhood dream, you’re growing. You’re growing past what your tiny child mind could even comprehend. If you were talking to your 7 year old self, do you think they would tell you to do the thing that you hate or love? You had no idea what being a lawyer and law school would actually entail as a kid. You’re using all of the experiences and opportunities you’ve had to make a better life for yourself, and that is ADMIRABLE. If you think permission from some rando will help you give yourself permission, then by all means, I give you 1000000% permission to do right by yourself. I give you permission to make choices that will make you happy long term. I couldn’t give less of a fuck about what past you thought would happen with her life; she didn’t have all the info you do now. And you know what? You can still always go back to law school if you change your mind. These decisions always feel so concrete, but in reality, you may change your mind again 5 years down the road, and that’s okay! Because you’ll still be growing! Change can be scary, but its inevitable. And if the changes that you want to see in your life are possible but scary, then say fuck you to the fear, and make it happen! Like I said, you can always change your mind.",False,False

If I could guarantee that writing would make enough money that I could support myself and my future family, I would sit at home on a sunny porch and write all day. I can write anything- I don’t have crazy aspirations of being the next NYT best seller, I’m perfectly content writing blogs and articles, product descriptions, anything like that.   But I’m struggling with permanently killing a dream I had since I was a child. I feel like...I went through the motions of applying. That I fulfilled obligations to myself and to others. That I’m meeting others expectations. I’m such a people pleaser that doing something on my own and maybe failing is just so scary...but you’re so right. Happiness is achievable. I know I don’t want to be at the mercy of my boss or this firm any more, that’s a place to start. I’ve given it so much thought too, it’s not impulsive. Maybe I’m just searching for someone else’s permission or approval to make this change?   You are an incredible person for taking time out of your day to respond to a stranger and I really appreciate your kindness. Thank you so much. I just don’t want to be hurting any more.",False,True

Listen to me, you deserve happiness. You deserve a job in which you feel fulfilled. Making big life changes is scary, but its worth it. If there were zero repercussions and everything would work out no matter what, which job would you choose?",False,False
