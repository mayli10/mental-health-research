The a√ßa√≠ and pitaya bowls weren‚Äôt much better, most people wouldn‚Äôt order a bowl with just berries, most would get peanut butter/Nutella (we were told to go heavy on these ingredients) and other high calorie toppings, that would push a small dessert to upwards of 500-700+ calories.  The frozen yogurt depending on the type/toppings/size would usually be the lower calorie option. But most people got 400-1000 calories worth of it.

They're very much one of those places where it's served how it's written on the menu period, no substitutions, all authentic Neapolitan ingredients, etc. One woman came in DEMANDING an espresso with heavy cream for her keto diet. They definitely do not in any way serve keto friendly food, and they don't even have cream on hand anyway. She made such a stink that the restaurant owner went and borrowed cream from a nearby bar and made her cappucino just so she would go away.
