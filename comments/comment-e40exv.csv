I mean I have wide hips and had a gap even when I was 145lbs and I have some waist definition but it’s not ENOUGH, I’m so jealous of people with reaaaallly dramatic figures, I’ve been trying to work an extra 1-2 inches off my waist and I can’t and it’s really hurting me",False,True

Girls with wide hips tend to have thigh gaps easily. For example, my roommate is 5’7 and 115 lb. She truly has a beautiful body but does not have a thigh gap because of her hip structure. I am 5’6 and 128 lbs but I have a thigh gap because I have wider hips. Weight isn’t everything!   Bottom line, unfortunately you can lose all the weight you want and exercise yourself into oblivion and still not end up with a body that looks like someone else with your same height &amp; weight, or even lower weight.",False,False
