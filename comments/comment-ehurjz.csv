Your body begins to burn fat and, simplified, turn it into a fuel called “ketones.” This is so you don’t starve to death and why people can sometimes go a month without food.   Symptoms: insomnia, sweating, frequent urination, sweet or metallic taste in mouth, mental clarity and energy, increased energy, reduced appetite.   It also dehydrates you so drink plenty of water and add some salt for electrolytes.",False,False
