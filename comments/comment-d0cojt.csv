They seriously damaged my trust in them. There is no doctor-patient relationship, and I don't think there can be. With any doctor. They fucked up how I view doctors, collectively. And if I told them that, they'd probably just be like ""lol register with a different GP surgery if you hate us that much"". Cunts. It's not my specific GP practice as such I have a problem with, but all doctors. I don't even know who ""my"" GP is. Years of avoiding doctors has led to the development of a fear of doctors. So not only do I distrust and dislike them immensely, I genuinely fear them as well. You're at their mercy. They can make you do stuff against your will if they wanted, but the reverse isn't true. You can ask for help and be dismissed, but they can force ""help"" upon you. I hate the power imbalance. They expect you to do what they say, but the reverse isn't true. I never was unreasonable in my requests. Doesn't matter what you, as a patient, want. Doesn't matter if you're assertive. They care more about saving money (in the UK, anyway). Or maybe it's just me they have a problem with. Maybe it's because I'm autistic. Maybe they dislike me for some other reason. I don't think I've gave them reason to, but it's been a recurrent theme throughout my life: conflict, loneliness, ostracisation. Doctors = Dismissal. Doctors = Power-Imbalance. These things are intolerable to me. Honestly, I'm like Stalin with doctors, and I hate Stalin. We're both very paranoid people, though. Well, was. Stalin is dead, like I am inside.",False,False
