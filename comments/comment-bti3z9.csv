Literally laid in bed all day, didn't even have the energy to pick up my phone.  But yeah, I guess I just wanted to say you're not alone and I really hope you have a better day.",False,False

Nothing I say would make you feel better in an instant, but I sincerely hope that you'll start feeling better with time.  Only have one advice for you, which is to not drink any alcohol, because it would make everything worse. Stay safe, we're here for you!",False,False

Try one little thing each day maybe when it’s quiet (during 9-5 hours) to outside someplace quiet and get some fresh air, if you can be around trees it can really help. Draw something, or learn how to knit/play an instrument/yoga (you can find tutorials for almost anything on YouTube) Be kind to yourself just one time, make a healthy meal and encourage yourself with each bite, you deserve to be healthy, imagine you are nursing someone you love or a beloved pet back to good health.  One little thing won’t do miracles but cumulatively if you can do one of them 3x each week you will gradually start to notice a difference. If there’s someone irl you can talk to about this stuff that will help a lot too. I hope you will feel better soon.",False,False
