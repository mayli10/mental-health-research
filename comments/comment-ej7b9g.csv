I treated myself to a Micky D‚Äôs large diet soda and walked around the department store.  At this point I was on the hunt for a particular lipstick at the time. Something that no one had apparently. So I decided to go to the Chanel station to see what they had.   The Chanel rep was an older flamboyant man. Tall with a slightly lazy eye. He pointed out several shades which yes, they were nice, but not what I was looking for. I said simply that I was just picky, and wasn‚Äôt going to pay for a $40 dollar cr√®me if it wasn‚Äôt the right shade. I didn‚Äôt mean it in a rude way, but I guess he interpreted it as such. Never forget what he said.   ¬´¬†Maybe if you didn‚Äôt spend your money on McDonalds soda you could afford it¬†¬ª  *you lazy eyed MOTHER FUCKER*",False,False

And she was so snotty about it! Like, there was no hint of being playful or helpful at all, just straight up hateful and like pointing at my boobs accusatorially lmao. She was a younger woman too, it was so bizarre. I wear small band sizes so my boobs AREN'T big but what the fuck?

I know my legs probably look shorter rn because the crotch is sagging... because they're too big... because I'm here to buy replacements... but when I tell you ""No, actually I need tall length,"" that's NOT your cue to go ""REALLY!? Are you SURE?? I'm *pretty sure* you need short-leg jeans...!"" and to just keep repeating your SHOCK and INSISTENCE that my tall ass needs short-leg jeans.  Like. Not that it's bad to wear short-leg jeans or anything like that but it was just really bizarre having a shop assistant (who was a good head or two shorter than me) tell me what my body looked like as if I had never gone shopping for jeans before, and the way she said it was really... strange, almost like she was projecting? Also I'm proud of being taller (even tho I'm really not THAT tall) and so it was kind of... weird? Having someone INSIST that I have short stubby legs, because someone who's 5'11"" wearing short-length jeans would have disproportionately short legs ://  Ended up not getting anything because their regular/tall length jeans were too short (: AND SHE STILL ACTED SHOCKED WHEN I TOLD HER THAT LMAO  Sorry I know this isn't the same thing as having people comment on your weight (which also happens to me a lot lmao!) but it still stuck out to me as shop assistants weirdly digging their own grave... like... you work in SALES.
