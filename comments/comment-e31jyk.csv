So my grandfather had a surgery to remove his intestines bc he had a very progressed cancer in them.  The poor man is suffering, can only go to the bathroom through a bag, and can't eat any of the food he likes. Right now he is really depressed, not to mention he probably doesn't have that long left.   He came over today, looking boney and skinny due to all this. My fucked up little self had a ""wow he looks so good all thin"" moment.  I swear I could start crying just thinking about it, I'm so awful.   Seriously am crying just typing it out. I feel so disgusted with myself for having that thought.",False,False
