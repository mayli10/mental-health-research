She’s an absolutely beautiful actress and activist. She calls out when people photoshop her pictures and shows her stretch marks on her insta pics. She really normalizes things for me. I hope things get better for you soon, you deserve to like yourself and eat in a way that makes you feel your best. And maybe therapy could help? There’s a lot of tools to help with that all or nothing thinking.",False,False

I think doing those things actually would scratch the itch lol, so I'd like to give them a try.  The stretch mark issue, while rationally I know people have them, I also think most people hate them on themselves so I sort of view them as universally bad.  I think in super black and white, and it's so hard for me to change my thinking patterns once they're embedded, so I'm not sure if I'll ever get over it. I guess time will tell.",False,True

It's great that you're able to isolate what it is that you like specifically and find a way to satisfy it. How easy do you find it to stick to? Is it something you had to practice at?",False,True

Stretch marks are nothing shameful. Even tall skinny people sometimes get them from growth spurts! I can definitely understand on a a personal level being self conscious of them though. If they’re newer, body oils and dry brushing may help.  Next time you feel like indulging in your fetish, maybe you can try drinking fizzy drinks or chugging low cal sports drinks to temporarily bloat your tummy? I don’t have this fetish, but maybe that’ll scratch the itch a bit.  Beauty is so subjective and there are so many ways to be sexy. For what it’s worth, I bet you’re bangin’ at whatever size.",False,False
