She was joking around, saying ""Ugh you know what maybe I should! Just to mess with them""  Like hello?? Do you know how painful and degrading bulimia is??? Speaking from experience lol  The worst part about it was that the girl RIGHT NEXT TO HER had been hospitalized for an ED *less than a year prior*.",False,False

We mentioned Eugenia Cooney and how she was literally dying with her situation back then, and she(overweight) says something in the lines of ""I wish i was anorexic. imagine looking like her though. Goals. "" and i was so mad and triggered at the same time, but all i said was ""She looks sick. She's dying. That's not goals."" and like this wasn't enough at this point in convo it got worse when her brother, who was doing something and overheard us told her ""She may be dying but you NEED anorexia"" and she was like yeah lol and i was like holy shit what the fuck is going on. There can be a lot of backstory and context to this but nothing can actually change what was said.",False,False
