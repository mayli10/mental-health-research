His other behavior asside, you shouldn't be assaulted by anyone for any reason at any time.   Calling the police is not the only course of action available to you. Furthermore, while the police may be able to keep you safe in a short term emergency, they aren't going to give you a safer place to live and help you build yourself up.   Look for a local women's shelter/domestic abuse shelter. Most have incredible people working for them who can help you. Even if you identify as male a women's shelter can help you find resources.   Young people especially often don't have a way out of abusive homes because they haven't been functional enough to build social support networks, hold jobs, finish school etc. Often the abuse (or the abuser directly) prevents those things from happening. You are not alone in this.   I don't pretend to you what you are going through, but I lived in a really disfunctional and emotionally abusive home growing up. I made it out. You will to.",False,False
