But I get that it doesn't seem trustworthy if you use those numbers and it works differently than anticipated. Only thing I read about that was that most TDEE calcs are very simple: One book I read mentioned that they would take your activity levels throughout the day, split the days accordingly to when they were however active and then calculated the TDEE. Like if you sleep 8 hours, then a third of your day is like your normal BMR, then you are sedentary for x hours of your day (because office job / school / studying), add \[bmr \* activity level modifier \* (x hours / 24)\] etc until you have done this for all 24 hours of the day. That number should be more accurate...?",False,False
