That sounds really gross and painful, wine vomit is the woooooorst. Take it easy on your body for a few days, drink some probiotics like kombucha or kefir to get your gut biome back to regular (expelling your gut biome due to constantly vomitting makes it even harder to stomach new foods normally), have you ever tried The Ginger People's Ginger Soothers? They're like little sports drinks with honey and lemon and ginger and they make me feel sooooo good after I've thrown up. Trader Joes also has an echinecia lemon honey juice that you can heat up that does the same thing.  I wish you the best luck and I'm proud of you for wanting to fight this. Take care of your body so your mind can be strong enough to do the work it needs to &lt;3",False,False
