We've been classmates for a year and this is our second year. It's just been in my thoughts that they probably didn't mean to say nasty shit. Still, it has its effects. Anyway, they're males and I'm merely a female, so I guess it's just normal for guys to comment on appearances like my other male classmate telling me to lose weight because I have a little chub and that guy at the market pointing at me calling his friend to hurry up and look at me because I have the same ""fatness"" as him. idfk. It would be nice if they could judge silently like the rest of the women smh",False,True

I'm confused now.",False,True
