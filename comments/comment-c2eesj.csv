Hope this is alright? If you do, take care of your teeth. Don't brush them right after throwing up, leave it at least half an hour (just rinse with water/alcohol free mouthwash or with water and baking soda), visit your dentist regularly, tell your dentist you purge if you feel comfortable doing that (they can prescribe higher fluoride toothpaste, tell you how to limit damage, keep an eye out for certain things, etc).  But in general DON'T FUCKING START, it sucks a LOT, you may find yourself doing things you'd flinch at normally, getting chunks of vomit stuck in your airway is AWFUL, chest pains are horrendous, it's rare for me to even feel properly empty anymore anyways, it smells, it hurts, it makes a mess, it hurts your mouth, your stomach, your digestion, your hands, your chest, your lips, your throat will be FUCKED, and this isn't even the half of it. I hate purging and I hate that my obsessive ED brain couldn't just switch it off - even though I'm not purging much currently it's always gonna be ""there"" in my brain as an option, and I almost certainly will do it again because I'm no quitter ha ha ha fml. I wish to god I never started. It never even feels like enough.",False,False

I started a little over one month ago after one year of binge, fast, restrict, c/s,I did them all, but purging was for me like hitting a new low. It's very addictive. I'm 2 weeks purge free, and I want to keep it that way. I don't want to deal with that too. Now everytime I eat there's a voice in my head that's like ""you can always purge!! Get it out"" every.damn.time.",False,False
