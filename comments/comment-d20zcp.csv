I hate eating before I go somewhere... I try to eat almost nothing before going out... and I want to wear a tight top, but can't because i can't fast for long and at some point I have to eat, and to not look pregnant, I have to wear loose stuff. It's annoying as fuck. I just want to be able to enjoy food and my outfit and my day or evening, without stressing about what I eat before or after and what I have to wear to not look pregnant...",False,False

It got really bad last year to the point where I wasnâ€™t drinking water cause it made me feel full and I hated it. Obviously I knew from a logical standpoint that water has no calories and is vital for being alive but it was so hard to make myself do it. I ended up in the ER and I have to use that as motivation to keep myself hydrated so it doesnâ€™t happen again. This illness drives me crazy.,False,False

I've been through recovery a few times and overcome a lot of bad habits, but I can NEVER eat breakfast and can only eat lunch if I'm home early and won't be heading out for the rest of the day. Thank God for intermittent fasting because it gives me a socially acceptable cover story for my ludicrous behavior.",False,False

Having food in my stomach makes me feel lazy and unmotivated. I can't go to most social events unless I've been fasting before it...,False,False

Not eating just makes me feel like my belly is flatter/thinner in general. Plus I never really feel like eating ""breakfast"" anyway and not eating in the morning gives me so much more energy (mood is better too). I like to put off eating for the day as long as I can.",False,False
