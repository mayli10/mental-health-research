Please try to keep yourself distracted otherwise, purging is not at all worth it, I promise. The pain, the bloat, the puffy cheeks and stained teeth are not worth it. Eating more than you planned won't kill you, not tracking them won't kill you, I promise - but no one can promise the same for purging. You got this, yeah? Water or tea and distraction ❤️",False,False
