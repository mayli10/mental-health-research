I see this skinny person who is much smaller than me. Opportunity arises where I can see what size jeans she wears (ahem.. at the gym) and when I see she is my size I’m thinking it’s vanity sizing, different company, wrong size tag. Anything because she can’t be that fucking big.  She’s also like 6 inches shorter than me and people that are shorter always look smaller to me",False,False
