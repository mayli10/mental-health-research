Most people with scoliosis (according to my incredible PT, I'm not a doctor) develop it very gradually over time, so they often don't notice that their vertebrae have moved. I didn't even know that I had scoliosis until 11th grade when I needed an X ray for something else (I forget what) and my wonky spine showed up on the screen. If your insurance doesn't cover imagining tests very well, there's also a different test that your doctor can do during a physical, which involves the patient  bending down so the doctor can take this short  wooden stick and run it along the patient's spine to check for any signs of asymmetry (I may be remembering the exact details wrong on that test since my pcp performed it on me when I was in elementary school and hadn't developed scoliosis yet)",False,False
