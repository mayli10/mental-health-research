The pain is never worth it, and I tell myself that while going through the worst of it, but somehow I do this 1-4 times a month. I don’t understand why I self sabotage myself in this way but somehow it’s beyond me! ",False,True

I binged hardcore on gluten foods before so and now that I have ""permission"" to eat gluten for the test I feel so outta control.  The pain from eating gluten foods is never worth it afterwards, but the immediate satisfaction of eating half a cake is truly an addictive drug.  No idea how I'll change my habits if I am diagnosed as celiac, all I can say is hang in there. It's double rough, and the ""free purging"" has never felt worth it to me. And yet...",False,False

I became really used to that sensation of emptiness, and sometimes, when my gut was still hypersensitive, I would do things like eating large FODMAP-heavy foods or even using mild laxatives to maintain that rapid transit and the feeling of lightness in my body. It's a little bit different because it's not as though I was ingesting allergens that would perpetuate the actual disease process on a cellular level, but it did still aggravate my GI tract and inhibit my healing.  Anyway, I can relate to this urge/behavior of yours, but it's really fucked up and actually quite dangerous. By purging this way, you're not just inviting all the usual dangers that come with vomiting (such as electrolyte imbalances, dehydration, arrhythmias, etc.), but you're also triggering systemic inflammatory processes from your immune system reacting to the gluten. Eating disorders in and of themselves are bad enough, but essentially poisoning yourself in order to purge is a whole other level. I would really, really encourage you to talk to your doctor about this if you find you can't stop taking advantage of this method. ",False,False
