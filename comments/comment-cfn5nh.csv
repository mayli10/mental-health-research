This makes sense, I did lax two days in a row because the first round didn’t work. I’m using them way more infrequently and this is just further nudging to not fuck with them at all!",False,True

I’ll shit out food I ate in a past life and a couple organs to boot, but then I’ll retain so much water for the next few days I could probs be reclassified as one of the Great Lakes.  So please don’t be worried, your downward woosh is coming. I hear the bloat/water retention gets worse with more frequent lax abuse (it’s from inflamed bowels I think? Don’t trust me though I think I pooped out my last functioning brain matter last lax), so if that sounds like you try and limit yourself or just remember that so you don’t get too upset if it happens again.",False,False
