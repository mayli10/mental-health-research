And it probably is electrolyte related. I ate keto and low restricted for a year straight, and also did it non-keto. It’s not healthy regardless of how you do it, and there are always risks with any low restriction. Poor circulation, blue nails, slowed digestion, low protein, hair falling out, etc. That’s why, if you can’t eat more, it’s good to at least try and keep electrolytes in mind. I hope you’re doing better these days.",False,False

Low electrolytes occur through all restriction diets, whether it be fasting, high carb, or ketogenic. This is why it is so so important to research and actively replenish your electrolytes, and eat foods that have high levels of magnesium, potassium, and so forth. Spinach is a good one.   &gt;&gt; A classic ketogenic diet had three major components which were thought to contribute to the anti-seizure effect. One, it was calorie restricted. Just calorie restricting epileptic monkeys (no matter what the macronutrient ratios) reduces seizure frequency (and increases longevity). Secondly, it was acidic, and the extra protons themselves could block proton-sensitive ion channels, or the ketone bodies or fats themselves could affect the neuron membranes, making them harder to excite. (For the biochem geeks out there, ketones or fats seem to affect ATP sensitive K+ ion channels, making hyperpolarization easier to maintain). Thirdly, it lowered glucose levels. And lower glucose is associated with a higher seizure threshold (that's good, one doesn't want to easily have a seizure!) and less neuronal excitability.   Ketones reduce glutamate conversion to aspartate in the brain, in favor of GABA. GABA is inhibitory, while aspartate is excitatory and can become a neurotoxin that causes seizures. This is why the ketogenic diet is actually used to treat seizures in some individuals.

Mine are cliff protien bars,  cheese,  tuna,  and other meats. And granola for carbs. I don't ignore my need for carbs. But I try to make better options.  --- low cal drinks: black coffee or with almond milk,  tea no sugar, sparkling water or plain water. If you want to drink,  do tequila shots or white claw brand.   --- sin foods, the stuff that you know you will overeat or bloat from. For me, that's pizza. Pasta. Lamb. Etc.. I eat this VERY rarely now.  If I must eat pasta, I ask for chickpea pasta bc it's higher protein.   Other tips:  Work out in the morning. You have more energy then and it can sometimes suppress appetite.   Try caffeine pills. Much cheaper than coffee and it works.",False,False

I have a desk job that allows me to eat whatever whenever, and that became a problem real quick, I started meal prepping this huge spinach, lettuce, tomato and cucumber salad on top of my regular food.  I eat my meal and a portion of the salad and save it for later, then when I'm snacky again, I take the salad out and eat some more. I keep telling myself that I'm not allowed to eat another thing until I finish the big boring salad. Most days I don't finish it, but when I do, I'm too full to eat anything else.
