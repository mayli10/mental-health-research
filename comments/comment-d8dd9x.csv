I‚Äôm just so glad I went. Thank you for your kind words, ED‚Äôs are extremely isolating and I have very limited support, so your words mean a lot to me. Whoever you are, I‚Äôm proud of you too. You‚Äôre a good person, keep spreading your love and positivity, the world needs more of it, especially in the ED community. Thank you for the response and the love &lt;3",False,True

I‚Äôm just so glad I went - I‚Äôd been holding off treatment for so long as I didn‚Äôt feel ‚Äúsick‚Äù enough (skinny enough) but had had enough. Once I got there, everyone else there was skin and bones which I‚Äôll admit, I broke down at. Feeling like I didn‚Äôt belong or deserve the help like they did. But once I got taken in and talked to, they treated me with such kindness and understanding. And they took it seriously, responding in a way that made me think they really did understand just how bad it is, despite my healthy weight. I guess my cut up bruised knuckles and teeth helped with that. Just glad I went. I did not expect it to go the way it did at all.",False,True

So again, thank you. You helped more than you know and you were absolutely right. I feel at peace knowing I‚Äôm one step closer to being recovered.",False,True

It doesnt make you invalid. If they act like you arent ""sick enough"" at the clinic then it's a sign they arent a good clinic. Any good ED doctor/ clinic knows that people can suffer extremely at any weight. Good luck, it's very brave of you to seek out recovery. In case nobody has told you, I'm proud of you",False,False

Your teeth, for instance - probably not so healthy looking. If you have an assessment at an ED clinic I am sure they are used to normal-weight people with EDs. I can't help any more than that but please let us know how it goes for you.",False,False

I've been in several treatment programs and while there were always people that were very underweight and people that were very overweight, the majority of people were at a normal weight.  I think it is a common myth that we tell ourselves  - that we don't need help if we are not emaciated. But most people there are just really focused on themselves and trying to reclaim their lives, so a lot of focus isn't on weight except for what you put on yourself in your own mind.",False,False
