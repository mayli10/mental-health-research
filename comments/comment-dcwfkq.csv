Like, it was on the interstate and I just ??? listed over into his lane and hit his car???? And it startled me back into paying attention and I got scared and slammed on my brakes to catch an off ramp and just kinda parked at a Walmart and cried.  So uhhhhhh don't fast too long, kids, you'll dent a Kia and have a panic attack outside of a Home &amp; Garden section",False,False
