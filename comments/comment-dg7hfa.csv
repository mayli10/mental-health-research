I find it's helpful if I physically remove myself from the food environment, even if that manifests as walking around for a while, you can't continue your binge. And it's really not even starting over, it's continuing on a path. You don't have to start from a blank slate each day. You made it somewhere today by recognizing you need to stop your binge, and so tomorrow you'll be able to start a bit further on your path.",False,False
