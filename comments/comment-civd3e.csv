Usually I get 1-2 pieces rather than like 20+ like it seems the people in thrifting vlogs get. I usually just look for certain things and completely cut out others - look for big shirts, sweaters, maybe some jean jackets, etc, but pretty much any pants or bottoms? big no. sizes vary WAY too much for that.    I like oversized shirts so I look for big vintage graphic tees, but anything that looks too strictly sized I don‚Äôt even bother.    Also: try looking at Plato‚Äôs Closet if there‚Äôs one near you. They buy the clothes they have in the store so most of the time it‚Äôs a bit better quality than purely donation based stores.",False,False

Thrifting in particular (as opposed to shopping in ""curated"" vintage stores) is difficult and time-intensive, and has only gotten worse now that most of the inventory is fast fashion that's hardly worth even buying new. People finding multiple items in one Goodwill on one day that are all nice and all happen to fit? Sure, Jan.   But it does sound like secondhand in general is triggering for you, so maybe it's best to stay away. Trend-wise, I think this will die down once people figure out that a lot of thrifting has sadly evolved into ripoff central (in part to take advantage of the trendiness!). And we can't all contribute to every effort toward sustainability - I see it as no different than continuing to use plastic straws because you're disabled. &lt;3",False,False

Never in my life have I enjoyed it tbh   Also, all those ~cool girls~ who preach sustainability and swear by thrifting ? Liars.  I know one of those girls first hand and she claimed she got this gorgeous dress from a charity shop. It was her older sisters that she got tailored in. I know this because we used to dress up in her clothes when we were kids.  I‚Äôm saying this because it‚Äôs so frustrating seeing all these people wearing these seemingly innocuous clothes but looking AMAZING In them.
