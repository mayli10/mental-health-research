Is there a counselor that would be convenient/affordable for you two to go to? are you comfortable with bringing this up with him?     It is so hard to stand up for yourself, i know, but i think everyday life would be much more enjoyable for both of you if you sorted this out. perhaps your husband is dealing with his own food/control issues and taking it out on you. this is unfair and talking about it with a professional can't hurt. Stay strong and remember that you need food, you are worth eating for, and your health is your number one priority!",False,False

Definitely. Like the shirt thing. Maybe for him, shoulders are what matters when buying shirts. Nobody is perfect.   But it is not well-meaning to call someone a skinny dairy cow. That is objectively hurtful. And the fact that he didn't even apologize when you said that comment upset you. You don't get to negotiate someone's feelings when they're upset.   None of these are tossable offenses, like I said, nobody is perfect. But I really hope you find a way to communicate with him when he says hurtful or rude things to you. Because you deserve to have a partner who is always kind to you.",False,False

I guess I feel less like I'm complaining about a non-issue now. Today, after I posted this, he congratulated me on my weight gain (which I had told him not to do) and I felt awful, because I don't have a scale with me and can't check how much I've gained.  Because of this, I decided to skip eating out (we had already visited restaurants twice a day this week because he wanted to) and made a salad at out airbnb. He started sulking, claimed that he had to sacrifice a lot of his eating plans because of me and I should return the favor, and went out alone.  But I accompanied him to kebab places 3 times and a pizza place 1 time in 4 days. The rest was seafood + this one salad. Apparently it wasn't enough, because he wanted to have kebab/pizza for every meal every day during the vacation. He never told me he didn't enjoy the seafood.  Why should he get to choose everything?? And why does he ask me what I want to do, even pressuring me to be the one making the decisions, and then sulk when I have a different opinion than him?? I think he wants me to guess what he wants without him having to tell me what it is. Sigh.",False,True

Has he ever been to a support group for partners/family of people with eds or done much of his own research? All of that seems really hurtful and designed to trigger you.,False,False

I'm so sorry, that must be so hard to have to hear things like that all the time while your ED voice is already telling you similar things.     Is there any way you could go to couples counseling? He seriously needs to stop because this seems like a very dangerous and controlling relationship he has with your body and your food intake.",False,False
