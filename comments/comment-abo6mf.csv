This is one reason why I love kpop, because they post their heights and weights on the internet which is strange for most other countries.  At the same time, I'm not sure if I can trust the information posted online, because for all we know, they could be way underweight but they're posting inflated numbers so that fans don't freak out. Hyuna, for example, is 5'5"" but was 80-something pounds at one point.",False,False
