That brought the reality down! Yeah, I needed to eat more but also that I don't really need a lot to maintain a healthy weight. Having the right balance is HARD!  Going over 1000 was scary, so I thought ""dieters eat 1200"" and started with 1100 as a goal. It helped me slowly work up to maintenance. Eating more also seemed to let me see my body more realistically. I celebrated fitting into my ""fat pants"" and don't hate my body now! (though some days I just accept and don't necessarily love it)  My boyfriend started out as an online friend, that I never thought I would meet IRL, so I was very honest. I probably wouldn't have told him so much if I knew we'd end up together, but 6 years later I'm happy. I gained 60 lbs and this boy didn't care! He treated me the same and was still attracted to me. (You all deserve this too!) My ex treated me like shit for gaining 20 lbs. It wasn't me that was the problem, it was him.  (Sorry, drinking, hope I made sense &lt;3)",False,False
