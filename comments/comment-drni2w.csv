You can see their beauty in a way they can’t because you have a vantage point. When we view ourselves we have the misfortune of doing so from inside our own brains. You have to listen to your thoughts all day, you see and feel and experience your body constantly, you know every single thing about yourself in every possible way. We see the ugly in ourselves because we’ve almost become desensitized to the good. It’s easier to see cracks in a painting when you’re 1cm away from it y’know ?   Right now I’m trying to learn to view myself as if I was a 3rd party and it’s HARD",False,False
