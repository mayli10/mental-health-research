Both were morbidly obese when I was growing up &amp; had bariatric surgery when I was in high school / starting college. My mom has narcissistic tendencies as well (I'm a product of an abusive household, she's a product of an abusive household, her horrible parents were products of an abusive household... the cycle continues), and after lashing out at us or doing something particularly, uh, abusive, she would feed us, or take us out for fast food, or whatever. We always had junk in the house, she never cooked healthy meals (vegetables??? what???) &amp; we're from the southern US so everything was always fried and loaded with butter. Mom &amp; stepdad never policed what we ate so it was just a total free-for-all of junk food paired with learned comfort eating &amp; binge eating. I have never had a model for a healthy relationship with food.  I've been battling BED my whole life &amp; probably always will be. I was very overweight growing up &amp; when my mom started losing weight after her surgery &amp; started asking to borrow my clothes I started restricting until I was very, very underweight. BED relapsed when I moved across the country a few years ago &amp; my weight has been skyrocketing since. My sister also ended up having bariatric surgery. One of my brothers lost a bunch of weight by getting into working out, which is something I know he genuinely / healthily enjoys but we lived together (as adults) for awhile &amp; I suspect he has bulimic tendencies. My little brother seems to cycle through bingeing &amp; restricting like I do - we've both been all over the map with our weight since moving out of our parents' house. I don't know how to stop any of these behaviors but you gotta love when the whole family is disordered.",False,False

My grandma definitely has one, though.  I've seen her go through phases of normal eating and then back to crazy restriction diets or mono diets of all sorts for my entire life.

She has been on a diet ever seen i can remember, all different ones. Last year she lost 30 pounds and since then has been pretty much on and off on a diet. Messed up body image(wouldn't say dysmorphia though) restricts but often ends up in a cycle we all know here too well. She craves food, then eats larger amount of it because of starvation mode and goes back etc. But i wouldn't say she binges, and by no means purges. Panics over her weight all the time, and i have to be there and calm her down about it. I also calm her down about calories in foods(even though she count calories)  which is incredibly triggering for my anorexic ass but that's a different story. All of this being a result of my grandmother raising her with HER OWN questionable eating habits(that she has til this day). My mother never had a naturally skinny build and my grandmother really values external beauty over anything so, you get it. So my mother was constantly pressured into weight loss.

But behaviorwise, she used to eat a few bites of something for breakfast, a few bites of something for lunch, drink a few beers, and then eat a small plate of dinner. Her weight was always pretty stable though, so I guess she averaged it out over the week by eating less on some days and more on others. Plus beer calories, I guess. Sometimes at the end of the week she'd take me with her for a fast food binge.   She loved to brag (mostly to me, I guess? I don't know if she ever talked this way with anyone else) about how little she'd eaten that day, and she was visibly and verbally jealous any time I lost weight. She looooved to cook, as most of us do. She also loved to exercise, but I actually think she had a good kind of ""joyful movement"" thing going on there where she mostly just did things she liked like swimming and gardening.
