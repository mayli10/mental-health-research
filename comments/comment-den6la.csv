And I wish I could say the same thing to myself. It’s so much easier to say to someone else than it is to yourself. You have support with this subreddit and you can reach out to me if you need to. I know how it feels to hold onto something-like the dress-even though it reminds you of something painful. I have a sweatshirt in my closet that I wore when I was first sent to residential treatment. I can’t wear it or I will cry. It brings back terrible memories but I can’t get rid of it either. It’s like a piece of me in a way that I can’t explain. Maybe the dress is like that for you. It’s okay to mourn the loss of a marriage and a life that could have been. But don’t ruminate on how things could have turned out. Even my worst experiences lead to something positive later-meeting someone I never would have met. I hope this makes sense. It’s kinda late here. I am here for you,False,False

Or throw it in a trash bag and put it in a dumpster.  Or donate it, if you think knowing someone else can have a fresh start in the dress will help you heal.  It might take a few tries, but you will get rid of it if that's what you want. It's weird how inanimate objects can affect us so much and how hard it can be to get rid of them.    I won't be too specific, but I had an object with history for me, both comforting and awful, that I had been threatening to get rid of for a long time.  I can't tell you how many times I picked it up and put it in the trash, only to remove it immediately.  Or would grab a pair of scissors and almost start destroying it. Or would be walking to the trash to get rid of it, and instead decided to put it in a trash bag and hide in it my closet....for future trashing??  IDK, it was bonkers.  This object caused me so much pain and yet I still had a sentimental attachment to it and I was so afraid of what it would MEAN and how it would affect me to have it out of my life.  And then a few weeks ago, I just fucking did it.  I honestly have not thought about it one fucking time until now, reading this post, and I am so relieved that I did it.  No regret or sadness over it at all.  Why would I want to keep bringing up bad feelings when I looked at it when I could just be brave for one day and get rid of it?    Also, (sorry I keep talking about me but I can relate to you so much here) I also ended a marriage recently and little things (objects and memories) still hurt me and cause me guilt and feelings of failure, but those little pangs of hurt get better with time.  I cannot imagine having my wedding dress out in the open, for me to see everyday.  What you are doing is essentially self-harming, but I'm sure you know that.  Eliminating the opportunity for that particular behavior will be a really good step for you.  It seems so scary to let go of attachments - relationships, wedding dresses, bangs - but if you recognize that it's causing you pain and your real desire is to get rid of it, you will feel so much lighter afterwards.  I don't know anything about your relationship but I can tell you that it seems like this thing is keeping you from healing, biiiig time.  Throw it away.",False,False

You deserve to be loved, especially by yourself. Sometimes things just don't work out the way we planned and it's almost never one person's fault in particular. I wish I could make you feel better indefinitely, but only you have the power and capability to do that. I know you're strong enough to do so. Please, seek help. You deserve your health and a great quality of life. There are no bad days or a bad life, just bad moments. And you're worth more than them.",False,False
