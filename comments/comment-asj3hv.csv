A couple of my own mishaps:  I made my SO a breakfast sandwich the other day. He went to make another for lunch and all of the English muffins were covered in mold. I never noticed. He didnâ€™t care but omg I felt so bad.   One time he accidentally made my coffee with super expired almond milk. I was so sick. And my work bathrooms have basically zero privacy. It was a fun day.  ,False,False
