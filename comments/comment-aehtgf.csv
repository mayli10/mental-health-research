Maybe it makes me feel like I‚Äôve already gone too far so I may as well keep going? Also getting second servings or anytime I make multiple trips for food. Something about preparing food, sitting down to eat, and then getting more and sitting back down multiple times sort of flips a switch that makes me just want to keep grabbing more and more in a way that it doesn‚Äôt if I just took one bigger portion and stopped.  And of course restricting or going too many hours without eating almost guarantees a binge these days so it‚Äôs maintenance for me for awhile. üò•",False,False

If a plan starts to go wrong (a bus is late, a store doesn‚Äôt have the thing I needed to buy that day, a hiking trail is closed, the weather isn‚Äôt cooperating, etc ad nauseam) I will start to panic and my first, primal urge is to binge.   The two main things I do to prevent a binge is I either open the app where I plan out my life and continue planning (calms the anxiety and distracts me) or I go online and buy clothes, make up, specialised food items, etc (distracts me and calms the anxiety). I can do either of these things for hours at a time.   One thing I will mention that I think could help just about everybody with binging is that, because of my planning, all my binges are planned in advance. I always know when the next one is and exactly what I‚Äôm gonna be eating so I never EVER feel the urge to give in to cravings.
