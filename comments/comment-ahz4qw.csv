I had a bad day, got home, and ended up crying on and off until I ate something. It sent me into a binge cycle that I still can't get a grip on. :(",False,False

In April 2018 I tried to kill myself. Some days now I wish I had succeeded but most days I'm thankful for the people who helped me. My life is a million times better now and I'm around better people. If you hang in there, you can make things better, I promise. It takes hard work but I learned that even tho I am still depressed all the time I've seen that there's beauty to life",False,False

Sometimes, we just have to accept that our bodies and brains wont be rational. It wants something and depriving of it may only make your mood worse. I know how hard it is to feel okay with a binge, but I try to mentally frame it as what my brain and body wanted and that eventually it wont want it all the time. Idk what else to say except that what you eat and weigh isnt your defining factor",False,False
