Everyone in this thread is going apeshit over something that doesn't sound like he intended to be hateful. I call my friends crackheads all the time when they do dumb crap or act spastically. I know OP is hurt by it, but talking it out with him or coming clean about the ED is the way to go, not assuming the worst without discussing with him first.",False,False

That was a shitty thing to say, whether he knew your feelings about weight or not. Him calling you a 'crack whore' is pretty disrespectful, even if he was 'joking'. There are some things you just don't do, and calling your girlfriend a 'crack whore' because of how she looks is extremely rude.",False,False
