I'm in the same boat; here's what's currently working for me:   \- No heat in, like, three months - so, no blow-drying, curling, or straightening. I also rinse my hair in the coolest water I can stand.   \- Taking a regular old multi-vitamin every day to combat my nutrient depletion. Biotin works for a lot of people, too. But a generic $8 bottle of daily vitamins is the best place to start!   \- A deep-conditioning protein treatment once a month, ish. The one I happen to use is the Shea Moisture hydrate + repair in the blue tub.",False,False
