I went through the same thing where he couldn't take care of himself without me and I had to make the decision to focus on myself. We're still friends and we're both doing so much better apart,False,False

He sounds like he's reviewing an anime action figure, not getting into a relationship.  Is he older than 18? If not, he's a dumbass. If so, he's also a dumbass. And if you asked him to review your body in any way, stop setting this crap up because your brain's going to twist any answer he throws out.",False,False

Men are not automatically stupid. He‚Äôs smart. He knows me. He knows me ED. He knows my dysmorphia. He used it as as a tool.  This was meant to get something off of my chest that was said to me by someone that I love and trust with my ED.   Please skip if you don‚Äôt have anything supportive to say. I don‚Äôt need devils advocate. I play that enough.,False,True

I honestly feel like he projects onto me. He‚Äôs got shit going on in his life, so he brings up MY ED. If that makes sense. He‚Äôs been severely depressed and I feel like he‚Äôs more likely to point out my body issues (that I‚Äôm seeing a therapist for), than he is about his own issues of self esteem, etc. I‚Äôm tired.",False,True

He would say the same thing, ""I miss Thick Shinywetmet, I liked that better than you tiny and ""hot"" now."" SO BINGE OR RESTRICT WHICH ED DO YOU WANT TO DATE?! I'm so sorry your partner said something like that, and I really really hope you two are able to sit down and have a long discussion on what's no ok to say ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False

ED‚Äôs are extremely complicated, multi-faceted mental illnesses that affect everyone differently, and I‚Äôd be surprised to meet one person that can say exactly something non-triggering and supportive that hasn‚Äôt either had an ED, been very close to someone struggling with one, or is a mental health professional trained in the illness. My boyfriend has a 127 iq and when I first met him he said some triggering shit I swear, but not out of malice.  I‚Äôd give him the benefit of the doubt, and maybe not put too much emphasis on other people to be supportive or say the right things.",False,False

The way he said it was pretty shitty. Saying something about someone‚Äôs body, directly, when you know they‚Äôve lost weight because of an eating disorder and dysmorphia.. is a no brainer. Advocating for a healthier version of someone would be saying something like, ‚ÄúI miss how we used to be able to go out and eat together, when it wouldn‚Äôt stress you out...‚Äù or ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre beautiful to me no matter what, I support you having a healthier relationship with your body and food.‚Äù Not I miss when your body looked a way it doesn‚Äôt look anymore.
