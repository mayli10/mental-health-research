The surgeon did not see the schematics of my anatomy until last night and did not have time to inform the G.I. department that he would be unable and unwilling to perform the surgery on me.   It does suck because I had to take time for this, I had to fast including no water, and I had to spend $75 in Uber costs. I have a fear that the medical supply company that is supposed to be providing me with the IV drip and the pump etc. is going to charge me because they showed up but I didnâ€™t have the surgery.  So yeah it does suck and Iâ€™m actually really disappointed because I actually called the hospital this morning before I left to make sure everything was OK because Iâ€™ve had surgeries canceled on me the day of, before. I just wish they couldâ€™ve told me then.",False,True
