I ended up marrying him and living happily ever after. Okay well I'm still disordered and have PTSD which comes with anxiety/depression. But he's the best part of life. I love him more and more every day and he loves me for me. No matter what size. He's seen me at my biggest and at my smallest. He is sweet and supportive and amazing. I still wonder every day why the heck he chose me. But he says that he wonders every day why I chose him. He thinks he's the lucky one.   So when I'm feeling especially insecure, I practice gratitude. I think about how amazing he is and how wonderful he has made life for me. Then I do something nice for him to show how much I love and appreciate him. He always gets so excited and squeezes me really tight and tells me how amazing he thinks I am. I focus on that, and all the bad feelings melt away for awhile.",False,False

Been commenting too but on my regular account and noticed yesterday someone I know is stalking my reddit lol. I want to tell you that you are warming my heart. I just left a 8yr relationship that turned quite abusive in the past few years. Reading you experiencing so much joy ánd anxiousness for the right reasons (love, and not anger) is really touching to me.     I want to tell you that it is perfectly OK to feel insecure. I remember in another relationship I often felt insecure about appearances. I even felt insecure about how my family in law saw my body. But looking back now I was a beautiful young girl back then. In the eyes of everyone but myself I probably still am not the monster I see in the mirror.    Love and love interests make everybody insecure. Even the normal people. I am not sure if this helps, just wanted to tell you that you are not alone, your thoughts aren't crazy, I guess they are you personalized version of a common insecurity. Often when I realize that it helps me deal with thoughts or emotions.     Also if I am scared somebody befriended (or dates) me to make me a laughing stock I know where those thoughts come from and most of the time they do not even relate to anything that friend does or is planning to do to me, but is something I am doing to myself in my head. I find it helps me to be aware of that behavior of self criticism, but I do not know if that applies to you. Wanted to share anyways and I hope you have many more great days with this guy, he really sounds lovely.    &amp;nbsp;  You deserve someone special even if you think you don't.      I really want to tell you that.",False,False

Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise- especially yourself.   Good luck, take care of yourself and we’ll be around waiting for another (hopefully positive) update!",False,False
