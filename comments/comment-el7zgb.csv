I was ignoring the news. I was in denial about my life situation.   Then, the fucking Iran bombing happened, and I had 10 panic attacks in one day about 100 different things. I also snapped out of denial about my life situation. I accepted I won't get the job I was counting on for health insurance, so like, WILL I have my essential medications this fall? I don't know! Maybe not! And not only did I screw up the job, I burnt bridges in the process of failing. Worst of all? Self-sabotage is the reason I screwed it all up. I could have had the job. I KNOW I could have. They wanted to employ me.  But I fucked myself over instead. It's what I always do. The world isn't screwing me over, I am screwing myself over, and I officially hate myself. I just literally hate myself, and I'm scared about my future and I'm scared for the whole world. I feel sick to my stomach 24/7, and couldn't even eat if I tried.

I'm powering through, I'm GOING to be healthy, but I got home and had lifted, done cardio, had a lot of calories to hit TDEE and my brain still finds reasons why I shouldn't eat more. There's always a complication. That's too much at once, too much this at once, not the right time, you need to do x before eating y, oh but you had x so you can't have y as well, that's excessive, but you can't have z either because you had z earlier. Also, you're taking too long to eat and are wasting time. No, that's too much at once, split it into two. Oh, now we have room? Go back for the second half. Wait, no, that's too much x- also, you should have just eaten it all at once if you were going back. You're wasting time...  Ugh also anyone have a thin mom who wants you to weigh more than her? Tw weight and BMI, my mom weighs like 55kg normally (121-125 lbs) at 5'8"" but gives me shit when I start dipping below 137/63kg... Fuck off??? Don't ""you're too thin"" at me you fucking crab.  Unfortunately I also don't get my period below 130! Cursed!!! Im tired of skin infections every month, of weird skin tone, of worrying about my bones but DAMN why can't my FUCKJNG period come at 125!! Can't a bitch just be at a healthy low weight??? Fuckkk!!
