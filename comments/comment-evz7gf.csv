Instead of being a certain weight try to lift more, run faster or jump higher. Obviously this can lead to obsessing over exercise but weightlifting has really helped me feel better about the weight I needed to gain to claw my way out of bradycardia. It showed me I wasn’t getting fatter, I was getting stronger.",False,True

It’s not much, but I really do care about all these strangers. Anything to reduce harm.   Diary: I reached my goal weight and felt amazing but also a prolonged sense of dread when I realized I can only get smaller from here. I don’t know how to stop at this point.",False,False

Solid day at school,  got 5x5 squat for 315 in PE. Need to register to get the credits at PSU. Enough republicans finally flipped so we can get Bolton to testify, hooray. Loved every minute of work today, playing cards with the kids is so fun, need to get a childcare job for the summer. Going to by a lot of diet root beer tomorrow, taking no chances but no issues with food today.  No screens past 10;00 tonight need to get good sleep. Thinking of buying more shares of Beyond Meat. See quite the future for that company.   Helped out a newcomer in weightlifting get his squat form right and introduced him to the 5x5 program was my good deed.",False,True
