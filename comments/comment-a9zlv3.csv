When I felt bad about it I put it into perspective that a Snickers has around 250 cals and they don't even have any nutritional value and make you feel hungry sooner after eating them.  &amp;#x200B;  I can remember eating a chocolate bar and a bag of crisps (chips) as a fucking snack and I don't know how I did it.  When you try to think as a normal eater I suppose that isn't much for a treat in a day.  Like, normal eaters have lunch and then a Mars bar with a coffee or tea.  &amp;#x200B;  150 really isn't anything but hey, eating disorders.  I want to get to eat one of those protein bars over 200 cals but right now it seems impossible.  &amp;#x200B;",False,False
