Too many things need to be done and it won't wait until I get my life together, probably eanding up overweight or obese again. Antidepressants can only take me so far and if I gain weight, even if I ONLY end up on 75 kilos, I'll drop down as much as never before. I can't be depressed as fuck now. I have to deal with last year of school, prepare for Maturity examination, get my act together at choosing University and just overall function. Despite my brain being a bitch",False,True

If two pdocs are telling you to try hospitalization, then it probably is that bad. It has nothing to do with whether you're underweight or not - it's about a behavior you haven't been able to stop on your own. If you're purging regularly and think you might even possibly respond to treatment, I think you should go for it. Frankly, bulimia is very hard on the body. If you have the chance to try and stop it now before it gets worse, take it! In the long run, one lost summer doesn't add up to much, but bulimia can steal years of your life if left unchecked.  Good luck with whatever you decide &lt;3",False,False
