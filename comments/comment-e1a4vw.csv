Scary things are scary - and even if they do make you feel poopy that doesn't make it any less the right thing to do and so worth it, and I'm sorry you may have been made to feel otherwise even accidentally ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False

It‚Äôs coming from a perspective of not understanding how they function. Honestly I‚Äôve been on both sides.

Boyfriends tend to be kind of... dense, when it comes to eating disorders if they haven't dealt with it before, and I guess what he said is how a non-disordered person thinks. Its good that he corrected himself, its a learning experience.  And great job on working scary things into your food, I hope it goes well in the future! üíï",False,False
