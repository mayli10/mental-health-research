I was getting moody, avoiding talk of food, and more self concious of my body. I feel like its always a personal choice on whether you tell people, but it has helped that he turned out to be supportive and understanding and I would hope that would be the case for your boyfriend too. Hope everything works out â™¡",False,False

We're long distance so I'm trying to recover before I see him again, but I think he's going to notice something's up when I get back. He loves to cook and is from the south and keeps talking about all the buttery, high calorie things he wants to make me and I can just see myself breaking down. I don't think it'll be super unexpected though, because I've mentioned my insecurities about being fat, plus mid-recovery have said something like ""for a while there I had really disordered eating"" without, you know, flipping the words to ""eating disorder"" and making it real. Maybe try sort of ""hinting"" like that to make actually telling him less intimidating?",False,False
