Purging just isn’t in my ED-repertoire. Don’t think I’d ever.   Thank you. You keep pushing to stay safe as well! Eat those challenging foods, but also eat foods that you know won’t hurt your stomach too much!",False,False

Makes me dizzy after I eat it, from what I’m assuming is from the sugar.   And it’s the only food that makes me want to purge.  (I’ve never purged before, but I tried when I ate a little too much ice cream once. No gag reflex, though.)",False,False

I had to drop a class bc on the first day of classes I was so nervous and ate candy beforehand and had the loudest, longest, most grossest sounds coming from my stomach. It wasn’t even that I had to use the restroom, my body just did not agree and was throwing acid at the candy or something. So anyways I stood up in the middle of lecture while the professor looked on upset and those around me thought I was pooping my pants.",False,False
