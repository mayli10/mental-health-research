You have to unlearn a lot of social conditioning to go back to how you were at 5 years old, like not thinking ""I want dessert but shouldn't have it""... But it can be done. And often the people most motivated to do it are the people in ED recovery.",False,False

I used to meet the criteria for borderline personality disorder because of my symptoms (self-harm, suicidal ideation, etc.) but my current therapist and psychiatrist have said they do not believe I'm borderline. It's ALL about your symptoms, how you fight them, and the effort you exert fighting them. That's the thing about ALL mental illnesses. They are just collections of symptoms. And those symptoms you can work against to make a normal life.",False,False

Like, are we ever going to go back to how we were at 5 years old when we totally didn't care or think about food or our bodies? No, but I can also say that adults who still are like that are a very, very, very small minority.   Because of the fucked society we live in pretty much every woman (men can too, it just seems to be less common) has thoughts like ""I want dessert but shouldn't have it"", ""I wish I was thinner, and I get jealous of others who are"", ""I should go on a diet"", ""I ate too much and feel so uncomfortable and guilty"". Having to deal with thoughts like that does not mean you are still disordered, that's pretty normal.   Since I've first developed issues around food I've had long periods of time when I consider myself to be as normal as any person who never had a serious disorder. I didn't feel guilty when treating myself with something unhealthy once in a while, I was maintaining my weight, I wasn't counting calories, and I certainly did not have to put a ton of effort into ""battling"" my thoughts. It was genuinely not a pert of my life during those periods. It's completely possible to become normal and happy again, and I feel sorry for people who think that it's not because that basically just means that they haven't gotten there themselves yet.   There is no magical recovery where you never think about your weight or food again, because that doesn't even exist in completely healthy individuals who have never had a serious problem. But does there exist the total possibility of a happy life where you are fueling yourself adequately, are able to eat fun things and socialize without stress, and listen to and respect your hunger cues? Yes, and if you don't believe there is then that just means unfortunately you aren't there yet.  &amp;#x200B;  Also, it's kind of all semantics. I personally believe almost everyone has the propensity to develop an eating disorder and it's just bad luck for those of us who have had a lot of factors working against us. A lot of it is engrained patterns that we've assigned identity and purpose to. Life and our thoughts are fluid and even though we tend to gravitate towards our old patterns, neuroplasticity is a real thing and we can override our old thoughts and behaviors to create healthy new ones. It's not like being paralyzed where for the rest of your life you have to deal with not being able to walk. It's more like a scar that given time and the right care, will heal and one day you won't even be able to see it anymore. This is also why I'm very against the current model we have adopted for mental illness. There have been numerous cases of people even with severe schizophrenia who have been literally cured with intensive, personal therapy. We just need help to re-establish normal and healthy thoughts and patterns, and over time it genuinely does become your new normal.",False,False

I remember in my teens my parents were reeeeeally baffled by mental illness in general and eating disorders in particular. Once in passing my mom mentioned she’d been doing some research online and other parents had described it to her like you just did here and it made her understand things a lot better.   I was so incredibly touched that she’d cared so much as to even look it up online, much less reach out to other moms, and it was the first time I felt like she really understood anything about me at all. It was only a start obviously, but the fact that she realised it wasn’t something you could ever just “get over” was such a relief and made it feel like she was willing to take some of the burden.",False,False

I personally know some people from treatment who have gone on to make full recoveries. What most people mean when they say this is that even when the thoughts and behaviors are fully gone, you'll still be more at risk of developing them again than someone who'd never had an ED. It *does not* mean recovery is pointless. It only means it's more important than ever.",False,False

You *can* recover and live a normal life, but you'll be in remission from your eating disorder. Mental illnesses often can't be cured, but they can reach a state that's almost the same as being cured. Being in remission means things are so normal for you that you effectively appear to be cured.",False,False

I get so discouraged and even when I see people saying they are fully recovered, sometimes my ed tells me they’re lying, I may as well not even try.   But I have hope!! I recently read *Goodbye Ed, Hello Me* by Jenni Schaefer (a follow up to her book *Life Without Ed*) where she talks about what it’s like to be fully recovered and what the process was like to get there.
