What do you think you are attracting or hope to attract. Why do you want to attract it. I want to be attractive because when I receive attention it feels like love.

For many (most?) people with eating disorders, fear of becoming fat, wanting to lose weight IS a major component. Many people say their ED was sparked by bullying for being overweight, or even a comment or a joke from a loved one. If body positivity were a norm in society, perhaps weight-based bullying and negative comments/jokes would not occur. I imagine fewer people would develop EDs. Are there underlying issues? Of course. There’s trauma, need for control, perfectionism, environment, self-esteem, genetics, etc. Many things go into the development of an eating disorder. The lack of body positivity and disdain of fatness is still an element for many, though. Even people who develop an ED after losing weight unintentionally (like a physical illness) often strive to keep it off partially because they get comments (“wow you look great!”) that they may not hear if all body sizes were accepted. Even people with BED who don’t restrict or purge but are overweight. How many of them started binging due to being bullied about their weight and the continued to using binging as a coping mechanism for other issues/emotions? How might their lives be different if body positivity existed and they weren’t bullied to begin with?  Look at the Fiji study. Researchers studied people on the island of Fiji, where body positivity was very high, large bodies were celebrated and seen as beautiful. There were nearly no eating disorders. Then Western television was introduced, with its demeaning fat jokes, skinny celebrities etc. Researchers came back a few years later and found that an alarming percentage of girls on the island were restricting or purging food. If body positivity can’t prevent EDs, why were ED symptoms so low before western TV? How would their results be different if western tv was body positive?  I believe body positivity can help prevent EDs. Is that the only component we need to prevent them? No. Will it prevent all EDs? No. Will EDs still occur? Or course, but fewer.",False,False
