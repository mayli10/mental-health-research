It consumed me and I became so jealous anytime I saw thinner women catching his eye. Not the person I wanted to be.   We eventually split and Iâ€™m so glad for it. Took awhile to heal. ,False,False

At the time we started dating I was very thin and I was for years. At 5â€™7 and 130, he told me I was too heavy for him.  Years later, we moved near his mom and she was the same. It made me freak the fuck out and binge purge for several years. He brought up me getting lipo and wouldnâ€™t be affectionate towards me - I was 145 lbs and he made me weigh myself in front of him. It killed my confidence...I told him past boyfriends liked me a little heavier and he told me yeah right/Iâ€™m not universally attractive.  My self worth went out the window and to this day, I find my biggest value is weight. Even at 120 lbs, he criticized me. I was all fucking bones.   Now I donâ€™t want to tell you what to do bc obviously I didnâ€™t listen to what others thought and learned this on my own. He never changed and had zero fucks to why he felt this way. He apologized and â€˜felt badâ€™ to make me cry more than once. If thatâ€™s what he likes, thatâ€™s what he likes. ",False,False

If he wants to date a girl who is naturally underweight, that's on him. He needs to be aware of the risk of her gaining weight later on though because staying that thin without an ED throughout your old age is almost impossible. But you need to look out for yourself too, and if you want to recover, this isn't the way.",False,False

Be wary of when he doesn't feel pressured to woo you with such an *amazing* amount of sensitivity and human decency.",False,False

Always be wary of someone who goes ""haha I'm like this, I know it's wrong"" breezily about flaws in their character. Like...okay, so why are you telling me that and not fixing it, then?",False,False

Right now in this moment you have insight into the fact that his thoughts and comments are unhealthy, and that is so so great and I applaud you for that.  But this could go either one of two ways- either he drags you down (into a spiral of being triggered) or you pull him up (into an understanding of the unhealthiness of commenting on underweight features of your body etc).   But I think it is more than enough work for you to work on yourself right now you know. And to keep pushing forward with a more and more healthy mind and body. I think that unless he is the most mature most kind most insightful person in the world (which im not sure this guy is) a new relationship is maybe not the best idea until you are more far removed from those bad things yourself.   In the meantime surround yourself with all the support you can from friends and family and professionals ðŸ’›ðŸ’›ðŸ’›  I wish you all the best and again applaud you for having insight into this situation ðŸŒ¼ keep going ðŸŒ¼ðŸŒ¼",False,False

I would be very wary of someone that gave that much thought to my weight and I knew had a clear preference. Because that would stick in my head and fuck me up. ,False,False

Obviously I donâ€™t actually know him so I canâ€™t make an actual judgement Iâ€™d just be weary ,False,False
