A lot of times when I spiral into a binge I reassure myself that I can do this because I'll just purge afterwards. Not allowing it at all leaves no option for a binge, and hopefully that can calm this behavior. Thank you for the suggestion! I'll be trying this out.",False,True

Just completely not allowed. Really tough at first but I did it for my teeth, and so i could not have chipmunk cheeks. If I donâ€™t really have the option to purge, I donâ€™t wanna binge. No guarantees itâ€™ll work for you but it def helped me",False,False
