For that exact reason. I spent money on a really beautiful tattoo.  I've found that I avoid the area and most of the time it makes me change my mind completely.

I adore how it looks and my tattoos and piercings are kinda the only things i like about my body.

The older tattoos I have, when I'm in a spiral, I want to absolutely frickin destory. The newer tattoo on my thigh I'm more protective over bc its bigger and more details.

I also grew up with a very muscular upper body (former gymnast) that never seems to shrink no matter how much weight I lose.   One thing I’m trying to do is actively work on my arm muscles so at least, if they have to be big, they are toned and look nice.

Even if I hated a body part with a tattoo the tattoo is always something I'm gonna love and an improvement in my books. Lots of people get tattoos to cover up scars too, so while that doesn't apply to me I imagine it helps a lot! Keep in mind the scars are still visible but the tat is obviously more visible than they are and again something positve to add to your physical form :D",False,False
