It was a majorly popular attraction. Probably more popular than the alive life-size cows.   (Butter I think is less dense than humans, so a human would occupy a smaller volume than a quantity of butter with equal mass. Plus, the human brain is not so great at visually understanding quantities much larger than 7. We are easily confuzzled.)   But I totally do similar thought things looking at the grocery store ground beef display...and also at the pet store I compare my weight loss to bags of cat litter. Brains. Lol.",False,False
