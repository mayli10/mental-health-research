Anxiety (both GAD and panic disorder) and depression (originally diagnosed as MDD, updated to bipolar depression in my late teens, but I also have SAD and live in Michigan which isn’t a good combination) were next, and those started around the same time as the anorexia, 12-13. I see a lot of OCD and anxiety playing out in the ED, as it’s very much a control thing for me. Unacknowledged gender dysphoria was also a major factor, but I didn’t realize that until just a few years ago.   I also have ADHD which was untreated until a couple years ago as well, but I’m not sure that influenced my eating disorder very much other than making it easier for me to lose weight because I’m quite hyperactive and can’t really sit still and not do anything. Hypomania/occasional true mania also plays a part in that. This is balanced out quite well with several years of chronic pain and fatigue/hypersomnia.   I also have BPD, most likely as a result of unavoidable issues with abandonment that came from being adopted at birth. Even though I know my birth family and have a mostly good relationship with all my family members, I did have a relatively unusual childhood and my mental health issues (I also fit the “criteria” for ASD, although that’s just not a diagnosis I want to associate myself with) as well as being a “gifted child” that ended up as an underachieving adult made it difficult for me to form typical relationships with others. Also, a lot of mental health issues run in my family, as well as eating disorders, so I was genetically at a higher risk of developing a lot of this.   Right now I’m doing okay at “coping” with the anorexia, but a lot of it is simply the fact that I don’t want to die, and I got a hell of a lot closer to that point than I’d like to admit with this last relapse. It’s been over a decade since I developed my eating disorder, and I’m not sure I’ll get another chance at recovery if I relapse again. My BPD has been causing a lot of issues lately, though, because I’m spending a lot of time acting like a crazy person, then freaking out at people because I just want to be treated normally. Unfortunately, people don’t always want to treat you like a normal person when they see you getting really deep into an eating disorder, and I think I value my relationships with the people I love more than I value the eating disorder at the moment, which is I guess progress  /rant (I’m sorry that was a whole lot of rambling, I’ve been having a weird couple of months)",False,False

PTSD and other stuff came after that. In the past I have definitely used the ED to avoid focusing on other things. My relapse last year was triggered by the onset of a chronic illness (later diagnosed as IBS). Restricting made my symptoms less severe, but at some point it stopped being about that.
