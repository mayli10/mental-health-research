Every time you think, ""I want to \[binge/restrict\]"", realize that it's a ""want"" and instead say to yourself: ""What I have now is enough. I have enough food. My body is enough. I am enough."" (or any other variation of this that works for you).  It may sound weird but honestly when I started telling myself that I've eaten enough food, or that I am enough, I am suddenly okay with what I have and who I am, and for that moment I don't want anything.  I'm still working on this because it takes a while for the correct neurons to be created, but the longer &amp; more frequently I do this, the better I get at it.",False,False
