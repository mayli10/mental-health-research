Sometimes people just like food and don't mind being chubby. They often liive long happy lives and don't agonize about food every day. That's a hell of a lot better than an ED. I'd say only morbid obesity is comparable in health. ,False,False

Generally, if people really *paid attention* to their physical and emotional feelings, they would be less likely to overeat, less stressed, more balanced. The problem is that IE / HAES does not want to make this an overt selling point, for fear of reinforcing the diet mentality that contributes to some of these problems in the first place.  I see people on fatlogic say things like, ""my intuition would tell me to eat 3 large pizzas in one sitting!"" but that is not really true, barring a rare condition like Prader-Willi syndrome...that's not really what your body wants to do. No one's body feels good at an excessive weight, no one feels good sitting on the couch all day eating chocolate. Our bodies were meant to move and eat vegetables and not engage in psychological self-torture over five extra pounds. The trouble is that actually being mindful and taking care of your body is more complicated than acting on impulse and just immediately gratifying whatever whim overtakes your appetites, which I think is where a lot of people on both sides get it wrong.  I think there's a distinction between HAES and FA, but I guess to me it's laughable to think someone could be psychologically harmed by any of those messages. I don't feel triggered or threatened by that stuff. I feel a lot worse browsing fitspo / thinspo / or reading things that fuel my food anxiety. Yes, I have an ED, but I think that shit is way more oppressive in our culture (and has been, historically) than body positivity.  &amp;#x200B;",False,False

How you look, or how healthy you are, does not determine your inherent value as a human being. It's easy to judge people who wear their issues externally, but you don't always know their stories, their private battles, what trauma they've experienced, etc. Not only that, but none of us are perfect. There are much worse things a person can be than fat.  HAES is actually supposed to mean striving for healthy behaviors without fixating solely on weight as an indicator of success. By this logic, a thin person shouldn't figure, ""well, I'm thin, guess I can keep up my lifestyle of cigarettes, junk food, and zero exercise since I don't need to worry about my weight."" And a fat person shouldn't fixate on the short-term scale fluctuations, either (""I lost a pound! I'm going to treat myself with cake!"" or ""I gained a pound, it's hopeless, might as well binge"").   The fatlogic crowd has a very negative agenda, and I feel they approach their arguments from a place of great hostility. It's clear that they cannot objectively entertain ideas that run contrary to their predetermined beliefs, or they don't feel safe enough to do so — I sense a lot of fear and projection on that end. They want to view everything through a very specific lens, so that they can interpret it all in the worse possible light.  The FA stuff sometimes makes me roll my eyes, but frankly I feel like it's pretty benign. There are a great number of girls and women, of all weights and not necessarily eating disordered, who suffer deeply from body image issues, lack of self-esteem, etc. I guess my stance is, HAES stuff doesn't trigger or affect me badly so what do I care?  The thing that gets to me about fatlogic is that often sounds a hell of a lot like ""ED-logic,"" and they don't even realize the toxicity of what they're saying or implying.",False,False

People on the fatlogic side need to realize that there are other factors that influence a person's relationship with food, and their overall ability to lose weight, but those on the fat acceptance need to get into their brains that at a certain point, it is a matter of health, and they need to stop being in denial about it.",False,True
