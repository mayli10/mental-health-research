Bone broth might also be an option, but honestly I have no idea what the nutrients in broth are like. It would be a very quick fix about the salt though! (which seems to be what helps symptoms most, unless you are particularly low on other electrolytes)",False,False

They were brutal, and I was begging for relief 26 hours in :/ Ive also been practicing IF on my “non-fast” days so maybe I haven’t been getting the nutrients I should? I just wondered how exactly to go about it beyond salt. Thanks for the advice, really appreciate it.",False,False

ELECTROLYTES! you need salt! If you have a headache from salt deprivation it should take very little to make you feel better so don't be afraid of it.  Electrolytes also include magnesium and potassium. If you've been starving for a long time you should also seriously consider taking these as supplements.  But honestly, just salt alone is likely to help. You could have a sugar free electrolyte drink or a cup of broth if those things feel safe to you. Or you could go the crazy route like me and straight up just put a little salt on your tongue. It really helps with the ketosis headaches.  Full disclosure though, eating food is the thing that will help the most.",False,False
