I got chubby at age 8 and remained that way throughout my teenage years. All of my friends were thin and athletic and I was big and awkward and they made fun of me a lot. Then I developed serious acne and things got even worse. I felt so worthless and unhappy with myself. I was obsessed with looking at photos of models.

When you‚Äôre neck deep in an ED and unable to achieve your goal weight (which many people will never be able to do without causing serious damage, or worse) it can feel like you‚Äôre failing at everything - because a lot of the time, it can feel like being thin IS everything: the gateway to happiness, intimacy, success, love.   We aren‚Äôt all delusional: looks DO make a difference. It shouldn‚Äôt be like that, but it is. It‚Äôs undeniable - as proved by so many personal stories and experiences in the comment section - but so is the fact that nobody who will ever really love you will only love you for your body weight or bone structure. Beauty is a social fast pass valid only for the young and uncommitted, the value of your humanity is unconditional and permanent.   Even at my lowest the thing that kept me from feeling like a useless, helpless, unlovable blob was knowing that one day it won‚Äôt matter. I‚Äôm going to get old, my metabolism is going to shut down, my skin is going to sag, and I‚Äôll probably end up with permanent fat deposits from childbearing, age or one of the many chronic conditions that come with late adulthood. So it everyone else. It‚Äôs terrifying to think about. It makes me sick thinking about sometimes.   But then I remember my mom struggling to lose weight as a woman in her early fifties and how I loved her just as much 10 lbs heavier. I remember my sixty y/o therapist who is neither the thinnest nor the daintiest of women but who is a paramedic firefighter, little league coach, beloved wife, sister and mother, and how I catch myself thinking all the time: ‚ÄúI wish I could be like her.‚Äù I remember my uncle who struggles to avoid obesity due to an addiction to diet soda, and how no matter how many liters he brings to family trips I still find myself seeking out his incredible sense of humor and unconditional warmth.   It doesn‚Äôt matter if you have a bad relationship with your family, if you can‚Äôt recognize the non-aesthetic good qualities about yourself yet, or if you haven‚Äôt had the opportunity to have people in your life that you truly love and who love you back, the point is this:   Looks may make a huge difference when it comes to superficial affection from strangers, first impressions and opportunities, but every day that passes and every new experience you have brings your inherent worth as a human being closer to the surface. If everyone truly was worth only the measure of their attractiveness then even the prettiest college student might as well toss their life away at the first sign of wrinkles, because their only means of worth will inevitably expire. What‚Äôs better: men holding doors open for you, inclusion and attention from strangers, or family tending to your every need as an old man/woman and the immeasurable love between friends who grow old together? Better yet, when it boils down to just beauty and humanity, which one truly carries more worth in the grand scheme of things?   I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre going through such a hard time, but please know that no matter how often your ED mind and the world tells you that you aren‚Äôt ‚Äúpretty‚Äù or ‚Äúthin‚Äù  enough the intrinsic value that every human being has will end up being your most precious trait. Physical attractiveness is just a temporary societal perk built upon the foundation of everything that makes you who you are; everything that makes your life irreplaceable.

Having an ED means constantly critiquing yourself, anxiety, shame, self-loathing, etc. I have no doubt that being out of whatever their ‚Äúideal weight range‚Äù is manifests itself as really antisocial, detached and pessimistic behavior for people with EDs. I know it did for me. Regardless of how one looks, people will react to how you carry yourself. If you‚Äôre feeling miserable and withdrawing people aren‚Äôt likely to seek you out, which, ontop of all the usual paranoia of being ‚Äútoo big/ugly‚Äù and unliked, really reinforces the belief that nobody wants to be around us when we‚Äôre ‚Äúfat‚Äù.

My first ever memory is another kid making fun of me for being fat when I was 3 or 4. I was always a chubby kid, and I continued to gain weight as I got older, despite being very athletic. The bullying and ridicule only got worse in middle and high school, and by the time I entered college I was regularly having panic attacks in public places. I've also struggled with disordered eating in some form since elementary school, but the restricting didn't get severe until I went away for school. I lost over half of my body weight (XXX lbs) in a couple of years because I basically stopped eating entirely and purged anything I did eat.   When I was very ill (and thin for the first time in my life), people finally treated me like a human being. I noticed little changes to people's behavior--men holding doors open, store clerks asking me if I needed anything, people taking the seats next to me in crowded rooms--demonstrating that people didn't respect me unless I was thin. To this day, it's really painful when people compliment me on my appearance. If a friend points out that someone is flirting with me or hitting on me, I always get paranoid that they're all mocking me. My ED absolutely latches onto these painful memories because, in my mind, they're reality-based forms of evidence that I AM worthless without my illness.

So, I first developed a problem with binging when I was like 8 years old which obviously lead me to gaining a ton of weight.   Then, once I was going into middle school, I wanted to be skinny again, so I started purging.   Then I started restricting on top of purging.

I went through a phase of hanging out with ‚Äúweird kids‚Äù who I had nothing in common with because I didn‚Äôt feel like anyone else would give me a chance.  I had a shit high school experience for the same reasons too, not necessarily bullied but self-isolated and always the underdog in a group. I felt like I was the odd one out, the least liked, because I was super quiet and low energy and couldn‚Äôt keep up with people.    About recovery: Imho, ED might as well be a hard drug. Whenever I read about the struggle of sobriety after experiencing that initial peak high, I think about the first time I put 2 and 2 together and realized people were treating me like a human because I was skinny.

I feel like when I was little little I was a cute kid then I just got awkward. I had this skin disorder that started in 2nd grade, they were like these tiny bumps on my face and hands?? No one really bothered me about them, then they got a little worse and 4th and 5th grade my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù just constantly ragged on me for them. They would always say I had such bad acne, then just other things too. I grew up in a rich state, but never was as wealthy and didn‚Äôt have as nice of things so that was always an issue too.  Middle school started, I pretty much dropped those ‚Äúfriends‚Äù who killed on me, started hanging w weirder people, got ACTUAL acne, and became more of a social recluse and awkward. I was never bullied in the traditional sense but was always the weak one in a friend group. ED developed around 12/13, I did it to ‚Äúkeep me thin‚Äù (was always low low avg) I blew up sophomore year from mainly binging and not being able to purge, worse acne lol. Got bullied and made fun of by lots of guys actually.  Junior year my ED ‚Äútruly developed‚Äù IMO, lost a ton of weight, rode more horses, skin cleared up etc etc. I would say my ‚Äúglow up‚Äù happened late teens early 20‚Äôs. I am consistently told how pretty I am and how skinny I am- I‚Äôm not just saying this to float my own boat. But I never believe it, and I think it‚Äôs because of what I came from. I do think everyone goes through an awkward teenage phase, some worse than others. But my mind just goes, oh my ED made me look and feel better therefore without it I will be ignored and or killed on again. Need to maintain an ‚Äúideal and slim‚Äù figure also while maintaining my overall appearance. Anyway I‚Äôm 26 now and don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever recover.
