But sometimes hearing the factual truth and reminding oneself of it can be helpful (for some people). Dunno why youâ€™re replying as if Iâ€™ve never had an ed.,False,False

If itâ€™s far and not bloat then.... itâ€™s fat and not bloat. I know itâ€™s not that simple or easy, but fat doesnâ€™t have any moral component to it. Society and people who have been conditioned by society may say otherwise, but that shit isnâ€™t worth your health and happiness.",False,False
