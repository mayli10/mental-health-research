That's what I was trying to talk myself out of doing with this post because I 100% would do that but I'm supposed to be recovering so I did my best with some high-volume fruits and veggies to hopefully nip the possibility of another binge in the bud.",False,True

The hard sodas were nicked off my roommate who hosted the party - I don't keep alcohol in the house for myself because I can't be trusted and it never fails to make me feel like garbage afterwards. It also makes me snacky. I think the problem last night was less about the sodas and more about the ridiculous amount of junk food that Tipsy Finnley decided to eat with them.  I'm curious why drinking makes you feel better? I just felt sluggish and goblin-like all morning until I managed to shower and eat a banana.,False,True

The brandy does have calories, but even if you go 50/50 soda and brandy it's still less calories than most light drinks. It tastes kinda like what I imagine a diet cherry coke would taste like, but I've never had a diet cherry coke. I started drinking it because I think it tastes good, but when I realized how few calories are in it I considered that a bonus. It might help for next time you drink to prevent you from feeling like you had way too much sugar.",False,False
