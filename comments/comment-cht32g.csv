Right after I spoke to her I spoke to another close friend who immediately shut down the negativity and told me that it's okay to get help and talk about it but it's not okay to keep doing it. Friend 2 has been checking in on me since and has been nothing but supportive since we spoke, even to the extent that she offered to stay w me for the weekend to make sure I'd have someone if I needed them and offered to make some healthy meals so I don't feel so weighed down and guilty.   But the issue is that the things friend 1 said are echoing in my brain anytime I even think about anything that contains a calorie.",False,True

No one on God's earth is stupid enough to think that telling someone with an eating disorder that they needed to lose weight anyway is a good idea, so if they say that, it's coming from a place of intentional cruelty. This is not a safe person to be confiding in and in your post you mention that other things have happened that have caused you to question the friendship. For the sake of your mind and body, let this be the straw that breaks the camel's back. This person's malicious attitude towards you is frankly unsettling. I promise you that you deserve (and can/will find) friends who treat you with love and respect, in whom you can confide, and who will support your recovery.",False,False
