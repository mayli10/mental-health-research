Occasionally I manage to convince myself I actually need to also gain more muscle to look better as well as lose fat. And then I start obsessing over lift progress and protein intake. But at least it actually involves eating.   But then I'm always like ""whoa, too much"" and start restricting too low to lift any more.      It's a real shitty merrygoround. Neither lift goals or weight goals ever feel like more than one days worth of progress.",False,False

All the times people have said you won't be happy when you reach your UGW, you'll want to lower it, I always thought ""that won't be me, I'll be satisfied when I get there"". Now I'm 10lbs away from that and I'm realising those people were right. It somewhat terrifies me that I'll want to lose more, because then the thing I controlled, is controlling me. And I'll try and regain that control by going lower.",False,False

I kept trying to lose more and more and my friends were like, “You need to stop. It doesn’t look good anymore.” And I think they were right. I didn’t look good. But I still wanted to see the number keep dropping. That’s when I realized I had a problem.",False,False
