There is a mattress I've heard about where the springs are made of memory foam though and it's supposed to be a very good mattress.,False,False

I got a pillow top mattress while it was on sale when I was moving into to my own place for the first time and I think it was like $350 for a queen.

I'm not even very underweight though and probably bigger than an average girl at my BMI.",False,False
