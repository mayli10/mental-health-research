I won't buy bigger packages of anything but coffee as I'm afraid I'll lose control. At least with canned stuff it takes for effort to open it. Kinda the same with the ground beef and the eggs. I have to cook all that stuff. It's not as simple as just eating a box of cookies so it takes control to prepare them.   Yeah in the morning I feel good and rested. That's kinda why I feel I shouldn't eat after dinner as I feel fine in the morning, like the hunger is just in my head and not real.  I average 7 hours of sleep a night since it takes me about 30 min to get to sleep.   As for beaking up dinner, I could but I can deal with the hunger. I'm used to it. My main thing is it necessary to eat more after dinner? Like my goal is have sustained high energy throughout the day. I drink as much coffee as is effective for the day, any more and it just makes me sick and I don't feel the benefits. I don't want to eat just to end the hunger. The food needs to serve it's purpose as fuel but I'm not getting it.",False,True

I'm only 5' 8"" so that's why it stood out to me, lol.  I am the exact same way with carbs. Vegetables seem safe and non-binge foods though and will help with your health overall. Sometimes single serving packaging helps me.  Do you wake up feeling rested? Or is it hard to get out of bed? Personally, I try to get 10 hours of sleep, but feel I need 11. This obviously isn't typical, but I have to work really hard at it. I used to be a 4 cup of day coffee drinker, but I've cut it down to one that I must finish by noon.   &gt; I thought about getting lunch at work or a snack but that just feels like me just wanting to eat and being weak….and thats some ED thoughts right there...wow.   Yep -- you're right about those being ED thoughts. Keep identifying them and arguing with them.  &gt; Eating after dinner just feels like a binge and just eating for fun, which isn't ok with me.   Why is that? If you're hungry, it's not bingeing, but listening to your body. Have you thought of breaking up your normal dinner into two parts? Half at 6 and half at 8.",False,False

For the calorie amount, I didn't choose the number that's just the amount I found I ate. I didn't know the number before I made this post, I just added up what I ate. The quantity seemed right, like it was enough food but also not too much.  After breakfast at 5:30 am I usually just feel satisfied / just slightly hungry. My energy normally tanks around 9:15 am and then I have my coffee at 10:30 am and I feel great till around 1 pm then I have my last coffee for the day at 2 pm. After that i’m usually ok till dinner at 6 pm but then around 8 pm I start to get really hungry. This is the only time i feel real hunger all day but I don’t eat and then I go to bed at 9:30 pm. Eating after dinner just feels like a binge and just eating for fun, which isn't ok with me.  For the macro / keto thing. I try not to add carbs because I feel I lose control when I eat them. I added the beans to give me some but bread, rice, sweets,and fruit are bingeable for me so I avoid them.   I do feel like I just live from each cup of coffee to the other but eating carbs just makes me more hungry and tired. With my current food I don't feel hunger all day but my energy is shit so I guess I’ll have to work on that.   After making this post I did double the eggs and butter for my breakfast today and felt more full but not uncomfortable. Energy wise it did nothing. I thought about getting lunch at work or a snack but that just feels like me just wanting to eat and being weak….and thats some ED thoughts right there...wow.",False,True
