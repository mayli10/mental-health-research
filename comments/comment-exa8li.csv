I've started to lift weights two months ago. Arms, legs, back. I do core/abdominal exercises maybe once every two weeks but I plan to work them out too in the near future.  Well, even without the core/abdominal exercises my stomach looks different than before. It's still not perfect but I see changes. I also heard a lot of people saying that you don't really need to workout your stomach that hard. If you workout your whole body it will also have an effect on your stomach. Idk if it's true as I just started two months ago.   I also tried out Arnold Schwarzeneggers Workout and he apparently does/did only crunches as his abdominal exercise every day and look at his stomach.  And keep the calorie deficit at a minimum. Lose weight slowly. I think you will get better results that way.  I can't say a lot about food because I just eat what I want (as long as my ed is okay with the food). Creating the perfect meal plan is fucking hard but I have to do it someday.  You can pm if you have questions. Maybe I can help with some.",False,False

I think needing to let muscles rest only applies for legs ??",False,False
