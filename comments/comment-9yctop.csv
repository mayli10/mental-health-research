If you can manage a week of keeping that down and adding small easier to digest carbs (not sugar / fruit but berries if you must)  and avoiding wheat / food with wheat you may see results. (gluten, in wheat - is an inflammatory regardless if you're sensitive of Celiac)   So I go for corn thins - like a rice cake but corn. Popcorn could be good too. Broth and vege stock soups. If you feel like something sweet plain Greek yoghurt and some berries. Perhaps dark chocolate as its go less additives / sugar (which can be harsh on the stomach as well as not helping the binging cravings.)    Eggs / little bits of protein (pastrami is amazing. Processed but very light)  might be safe bets once you feel a bit settled. If you don't mind carbs then lentils can be dense but very good nutritionally.   After a while id suggest adding some fish for healthy omegas as that is what will truly heal you in the long run, however in the early stages you want to keep things light and easier to absorb / digest. Coconut oil too has great nutrition value.   Fibre is important for the microb diversity however can be harder on the system. So work up to that too but soft steamed asapargus as well as spinach are go too.   So for the first weekish I'd recommend  -bone broth  -corn thin / popcorn - strawberries / raspberries / blueberries - light soups from vege / chicken stocks - Greek yoghurt  - maybeee goat cheese but care for the fat - this is a more dense / complex food.  - lettuce, tomato and cucumbers possibly.   And just avoid too high fat foods,  too fibre dense foods, possibly meat / eggs (see how you feel) , and definitely aim to stay clear of processed foods just for now. This could help the binge urged too. I know diet sodas and energy drinks and coffee may be a staple but possibly keep those out for a little.  Tea may be easier on the stomach and I'd suggest keeping too many dairy products (mainly milk - sugar bombs if drunk in excess)  out but a little in your tea may help you keep it down easier (if you choose tea)    So yeah idk your sensitivities, safe foods, fear foods, or needs however if anything I would recommend the broth as its highly healing, as it's gelatin.  Stay safe and you can give me a pm if you need some support. I try to look into nutrition and had similar b/p gut issues myself + understand the cravings and just I know it's hard babe, but we're here xxx ðŸ’–",False,False
