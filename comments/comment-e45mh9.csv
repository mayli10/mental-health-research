She has referred me on or supported me in getting specialised help for that (depending on the situation and my requests, either therapy, psychiatry, or inpatient).   She’s never forced me to do anything as an adult as she can’t. When I was a teenager she could. That’s the thing, if you’re an adult then you can’t be forced to do anything. They can encourage you and support you and try to guide you, but not make you.   Outside of ED things, I recommend seeing your GP for the other medical reasons you’ve listed.",False,False
