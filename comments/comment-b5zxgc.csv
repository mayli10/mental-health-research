Maybe you could try that w the rest of your weed? Or just have it right before youâ€™re about to sleep like youâ€™re in bed in the jammies and all so you can knock out. Just would hate to see that extra weed go to waste :/,False,False

I put off vaping last night because I feel I need to punish myself from eating fast food. So instead of vaping and feeling great, I was lying in bed crying. ðŸ™ƒ  One of the only little things that (sometimes) helps me is I pre-portion out containers of safe amounts of foods like dry Cheerios and Cocoa Puffs, cucumber slices, baby carrots, etc. and I keep them in plain sight in the fridge / on the counter.  Oh and for cottonmouth, water and a little bit of Gatorade.",False,False
