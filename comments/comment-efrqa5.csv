I have no clue if my therapist had one - but based on what I know about her I assume not? I do know my dietitian had one and only just got to a place where she felt recovered right before I began seeing her (she coincidentally worked out at the same gym I did for a few months before I began there.)  Also check out @shirarose on insta - she’s a therapist with an ED and talks pretty openly since her most recent transition back to treatment.,False,False
