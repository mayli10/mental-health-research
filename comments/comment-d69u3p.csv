I went to all my classes, liquid fasted all day, ended up getting a 90% on a big exam I took, and then went to the gym for \~100 minutes (70 minutes high resistance elliptical and 30 minutes treadmill) and burned 955 calories. all I could think of was how shitty I am, I even waited to log my binge until I was in the middle of my workout to trigger more self hate. I realize it wasn't the best way to cope with eating significantly more than I usually do, but I'm relieved because I fought the urge to cope with my mood swings with b/p (how I would have reacted in the past) and when I weighed myself this morning I was the exact same weight I was on Tuesday (my LW) and I had a healthy dinner last night too to keep my meds down.   &amp;#x200B;  just wanted to share that little accomplishment! I've been making my meal plan for the day and eating 3 meals a day on school days - it's been hard but it's keeping me from b/p and medium restriction as opposed to low has made a huge difference on my energy levels. ;\~; gonna try to keep up the streak and not purge this weekend!",False,False
