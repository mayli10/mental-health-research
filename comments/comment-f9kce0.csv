My weight has not shifted in 3 fucking weeks and I’ve been restricting. Not even close to my BMR. And if I go over my low limit, I purge or exercise. I’ve never not lost weight for 3 weeks like this and I’m freaking the fuck out. It can’t be water weight after this long :( I don’t understand",False,False

Along with that, food in your stomach, the status of your menstruation (if you do that), and constipation play into adding to that number. Heck, even exercise causes muscle inflammation which adds weight! So please try to be kinder to yourself here!",False,False
