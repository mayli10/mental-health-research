I have one day of eating a lot and it doesn't affect my weight at all.    We can relate, but I hope that me telling you that it's okay to enjoy yourself for this one day helps a little bit.  You'll feel guilty afterwards maybe, but also liberated in some way.  Eat and savor the taste.  Really, enjoy it.  It's ONE MEAL and you won't lose control/gain weight/any other ugly negative thought you're having.  Have a good time   X",False,False
