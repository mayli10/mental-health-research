My friend would go through literal liters of Diet Coke per day (currently she drinks the equivalent in coffee so I doubt it’s the caffeine).   Marijuana isn’t physically addictive, but there is a associated withdrawal  people experience, and from what we know, we chalk it up to the anxiety relief people find in marijuana/a lack there of. I think diet products with aspartame are the same - especially with people whom have sensitive stomachs and react to such (which is the camp my friend is in).  ",False,False

I swear, her blood was just 99% Diet Coke. The thing is, she went through a psychological withdrawal. The crankiness, tiredness, brain fog, anxiety, etc. ",False,False

When I was in the process of losing 115lbs (post pregnancy and the healthiest relationship I've even had with weight loss and food), they helped me cut out calories and have healthy weight loss.  When I hit my goal weight and spiraled back into my ED hard, they gave me the only joy I had when approaching food because they satisfied my sweet tooth during the starvation abyss.  And during my binge phase, it kept weight gain controlled. I didn't balloon up to nearly 300 lbs like in the past. I can't imagine what I would look like now if I had binged and recovered with real sugar.  I'd probably have cavities galore and be morbidly obese and a bit of diabetes as well.   They are a godsend in my view.",False,False
