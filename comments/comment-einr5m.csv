I completely understand how exhausting, intimidating and nerve wracking being part of certain activist/social justice/left circles can be. I believe many good points are often made and good things could have come out of it but personally existing within those spaces is demanding, toxic even. I myself had to quit being ‘activist’ and initially cut myself off from my peers. I paid my stress, let me have a quiet life now.",False,False

Yeah don’t blame you bc it’s part of her personality and I don’t think she’ll ever actually listen to you and have that genuine friendship bond where you can have a back and forth and open up to her.,False,False

Having the online community to vent to has been such a relief for me. It helps with the shame and fear, not feeling alone and the dark humor really helps lol",False,True

She’s like this about so many things: queer identity, politics, relationships. She claims she is open to discourse but then shuts you down or says stuff like this in her social media and I’m just like.... I can’t anymore",False,True

Why is she making it about her; why can’t she just be an actual friend and just listen and try to understand you.,False,False

My body dysmorphia is not thinking about you or looking to hurt anyone else’s body image. Suffering in silence should not be the answer,False,False
