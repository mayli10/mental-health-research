It’s something that’s happening now, and you need to find your way through it, understand it, work with it and live with it.   I know it feels a bit intense to hear “eating disorder” but you took some of its power away hearing it outside your head from another person. Most people are judgemental about ED’s but those who understand are not ignorant to it. The Doc will take it seriously and he will work with you not against you.   I am glad to hear your supervisor did something so nice and was wise enough to build a relationship and trust. That’s a positive sign your supervisor is trusting you. Giving you the support and space, you need. Letting you get your head around, how you feel about food, you &amp; your weight.   If the assistant manager has been on holidays for two weeks don’t let him or his return, make you feel uncomfortable. You don’t have to share any personal information. You’re doing your job. You’re communicating with your supervisor. Keep it nice and professional and civil. Before each response take a breath counting 1,2,3,4. Slowly breath and respond with short answers. You know, “I am fine.”  “Yeah,” “No” etc.   Just going to ask ”how are you.” If it’s none of my business tell me where to go.   Otherwise how are You. Have you been restricting, focusing on numbers, weight or weighting yourself a lot, how are you feeling, sleeping enough. How are you in general.   Happy Birthday. I am Sean by the way.",False,False

But I did manage to tell my doctor, literally handed him a piece of paper stating I think I have an ED, right at the end of the appointment. He asked me why I thought that, but in a way I knew he was trying to better understand how I came to that conclusion. Completely fucking threw me though, hearing the words ""eating disorder"" outside of my own mind.  He wasn't judgemental at all or doubtful of my concerns, which was a relief. He actually ended up bringing our next appointment forward in light of this new information, so I know he's taking it seriously.  My supervisor has been really supportive, and did initially buy me food as a birthday gift, but thought better of it so got something else. I didn't expect her to actually think how it might make me feel, so it was nice to know she does properly listen to me.  The asst. manager has been off the past two weeks so I haven't had to deal with him. I may end up running into him tomorrow though because our shifts cross. I'll update him, but I'm gonna try and not give more detail than is necessary.",False,True

He definitely scared me, that's for sure, but I know he was trying to scare me into getting help. I don't want to reward his behaviour by doing what he aimed for, and I feel as though I need to spite him, making reaching out to my doctor even harder than it already is.  I do volunteer more information than is necessary, which I think I'm going to have to reevaluate. I just have it so ingrained in me that if I'm not completely honest, I can't be helped, not that I have been anyway.  It is hard to not restrict, and I try to drink my calories and get important vitamins and minerals that way, but I've been slacking in committing to that.  I do think I am going to tell my doctor though, I've been debating it for several months now, but I don't know if I'll do it when I see him in just over a week. I might ask if I our next appointment can be longer and sooner rather than later, so I don't have too much time to change my mind.",False,True

And perhaps talk to your doctor to check on your health, if you think is good enough to lift any worries from your work superiors. If they are worried is because they care, so if they have proof you are not in danger they can let it go.",False,False

Apparently my doctor needs to sign me off before OH can get involved, but he recognises that being off work is not beneficial to me, so I'm stuck in a weird limbo.",False,True

He is trying to future proof himself rather than have your health and safety as his main concern. The language he is using “organ failure” is very unprofessional.   I don’t think your manager will say anything to your parents. It sounds like he is trying to exploit the situation and use scare tactics to control the situation and motivate you.   If you are moving around heavy cages, you need to be careful. Maybe ease up on the restricting. I know it’s hard. I have been there. Your job sounds very physical and demanding. You need KCALs.    Don’t let him stop you from finding help though.   Please do talk to your doctor. You doctor can provide the help you need in the long term. Health professional’s by law must keep all your information confidential.  We all want to see you get healthy but just be careful with the employment situation. You don’t have to volunteer too much information. This is your job, if you’re not well. That’s all you have to say you don’t have to explain yourself further.   The only person you need to explain your health to is your doctor and heath professional who will help you manage your life and life choices and try and make you as happy and contented in your life.   Like I said in my other post. Email communication and document all the dates and details of verbal communications no matter how casual.   Everything will be OK. Keep posting and if you need to direct message me.",False,False

If I knew he would act as he has, I wouldn't have bought it to his attention in the first place.  I'm trying not to stress, but I started freaking out and now it's difficult to stop.

There is privacy and confidentiality, yes but there is also a legal obligation for someone to alert the authorities if someone's life is in danger.

But my performance at work hasn't suffered at all, and so it's only impacting me, though I guess I could be a danger to myself, what with the increased dizziness and the fact I'm moving around heavy cages being a terrible combination.  It made me feel completely out of control, which whenever that occurs, my instinct is to engage in my ED. The way he's gone about the situation, makes me even more hesitant to reach out for help, out of fear I won't be taken seriously or understood properly.  I've mentioned to my doctor about not eating, though I never went into extensive detail, it was more a passing comment. I have considered actually bringing it up again but making it known how serious the issue is, I just struggle with allowing myself to be that vulnerable.

Sometimes it's easier to write things down. Then you can also get someone else to read over it to make sure the tone is right.  It sucks but the harsh reality is a boss is not a friend. Confiding so much in them can sometimes have bad outcomes. I'm unfortunately still yet to learn this myself.   Disgusting unprofessional on their part, it amazes me that someone can be a manger and think they have the authority to do this.

If he did he would leave himself open to legal action and probable termination by your employer.   I had the same issue with my employer at the height of my anorexia. The situation sounds like an instance of bullying. I would talk to you supervisor or the HR department.       This person is your manager. He has a duty of care to provide a safe workplace for you and your employees. Once you are not a danger to yourself or other employees there shouldn’t be a problem. If there is a problem it would be an issue. Where all parties involved sit down and discuss the matter properly with the proper structures. It shouldn’t be so adversarial or in the form of an ultimatum.  Do you want to post a bit more about the tension or apprehension you feel. You did post above “Instead of wanting to get better, I just wanted to spiral more.”  If I can offer any advice I will but have you spoken to a health professional. I comprehend not wanting to get your parents involved. I was the same. A health professional will provide confidentiality.  If you need to chat I am here and the rest of the group.
