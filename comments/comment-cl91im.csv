If you don’t have enough stored energy, then your body is going to start failing (which is what’s happening to OP).   Op, could you try adding some supplements if you aren’t ready to eat at caloric maintenance? Fish oil, b complex, vit d and c, and iron could probably help you feel better.",False,False

Plain 0% fat yogurt is also rather low calorie (around 90cal for 3/4cup) and pairing it with fruit is good as well if you hate the sour taste of it!   it truly is hard to quit restricting during exam season, but if you eat healthily, you can avoid binges which will be more harmful overall   best of luck to you on your exams op! think of food as fuel and hang in there. im rooting for you :)",False,False
