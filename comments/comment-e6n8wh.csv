That was probably really helpful and enlightening for them, and honestly if they’re that simple minded about eating disorders they probably don’t understand mental health very well. People are very dense about others having eating disorders. It could be that someone in your family or a friend does so u know a lot about it. I have dropped so many hints that i have an ed and that I’m sober and people STILL don’t get it. They’re shocked when I tell them. I’m like bro I’ve said like ten little things and it never added up? Same with ed stuff. I’ve told coworkers I haven’t eaten in four days cuz I’m fasting, and they don’t think I have an ed. So, he probably still doesn’t get it. Especially if he thinks they’re easy to get over.",False,False

And yeah I agree that most of the time a situation like this happens in my life it’s due to some inappropriate comment/question or some kind of obvious blind spot when it comes to the subject of mental health or EDs, ADHD, etc.",False,True

I didn't mean to suggest that he's a bad person or purposefully ignorant. Sorry if it at all came across that way!!   I've just found, in my experience, that when I've offloaded a lot of ED info on people with insensitive questions, it tends to go in my favour in the long run (though usually a little awkward right afterwards). I think people just become a lot more open-minded when they can see how much their knowledge on a particular area might be lacking; there's that jarring ""yikes I really don't know what I'm talking about here"" sensation that humbles all of us",False,False

I was being lighthearted and joking on this post mostly just to vent because sometimes I can’t help myself when people say ignorant things it’s like my conscious mind blacks out and I just start in. And considering I’ve dealt with a litany of mental health issues and have tried to educate myself as much as possible to aid in my own well-being it can be jarring sometimes when the people around you are clearly so uninformed.   I don’t think he is an ignorant person in general just that he probably has no experience or knowledge about it. I think what I was originally trying to do was to make him aware that sometimes saying  obvious [read:insensitive] solutions to mental health issues can be really harmful because you aren’t experienced in the matter and don’t know the background of the people around you.,False,True

Poor media representation leads people into the ""person with anorexia = vain/petty"" mindset and they think they can solve it with a ""just eAt!!1!"", so it might do your co-worker the world of good to remind them that EDs are mental disorders, not just physical conditions, and that brain chemistry plays a huge role",False,False
