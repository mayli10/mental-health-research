Before the drugs I would restrict reasonably and/or exercise a lot during more stable states and mania. Except when I had mania with psychotic features because of anti depressants...I sort of just stopped eating. I tend to have more mixed states/agitated depression than straight up depression. During those times I tend to overeat and b/p but also feel really emotional and dysphoric about food. I haven’t had I really bad depressed state since I started lamictal, but when I had them I didn’t eat because I felt sick all the time. But it wasn’t the same dysphoria I have about my body most of the time, just like wishing I didn’t have a body.   I have been stable but also steadily gaining weight and started binging since I began lamictal. I would say it mostly cured my ED though. I think I’m having a mixed state “lite” and am restricting but really agitated and emotional about it. I don’t feel in control of it the way I do when I’m manic or stable without meds.   Not sure if this helps at all, but treating my bipolar helped a lot with my ED even though I’m not entirely better.",False,False

I don’t have ED anxiety or thoughts when manic but the mania definitely makes me lose my appetite and forget to eat. When I actually take my anti-psychotics and mood stabilizers the ED isn’t as bad...like the thoughts/anxiety are there but I binge eat. Obviously this is why I don’t take them...,False,False
