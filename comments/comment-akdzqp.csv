When I last had a seizure (medication induced), I don't remember anything except coming back to consciousness. I have no recollection of the actual seizure. but blood pressure incidents/fainting do have that usually distinct phase of vision darkening, nausea, weakness, dizziness. And since this happens because the blood ""falls"" out of your brain (lmao) it would explain the fuzzy thinking afterward.",False,False

With aura for me it’s hard to explain, it feels like really bad dissociation plus I feel nauseous and sometimes I don’t know if it’s just anxiety but sometimes I can tell I’m going to have one. Other times I just wake up on the ground, usually with a headache and very tired. If people were around they obviously fill me in, if I was alone I might not even realize I had one until later (like if I was already on my bed or couch) and just go to sleep. Some people bite their tongue or cheek, I always bite my bottom lip. What happened to you honestly sounds like what happened when I overdosed on my medication? Please go to an urgent care or ER ",False,False
