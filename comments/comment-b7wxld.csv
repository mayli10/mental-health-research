It was honestly helpful just to hear that somebody can relate to this whole mess, even though it's awful that you've got to deal with all this shittiness bc it is Not Fun lol.  My insurance is pretty garbage so after like the first batch of standard tests (structural problems, thyroid, cbc, so on etc and the other thing) my doc said something pretty similar to yours - basically ""manage ur anxiety and stop doing Dumb Shit. Also I know you said you don't have any caffeine or stimulants, but you still should def cut back on them both"" and then sent me home with a recommendation to get sum therapy. Which, yeah, that's fair.  Seriously though, after a while it really is like that 'guess i'll die' meme. Esp with the chest pains (omg they suck. sorry that you get them too). But here's to trying to deal with our shit without dealing with our shit‚Ñ¢. I hope everything works out for you and you can be able to run again without your stress relief being part of the reason you're stressed.   Thank you again, I really appreciate you taking the time to reply to me üíú ",False,False

I wasn't underweight, but also drink a bunch of coffee, workout on low low cals, and b/p.  After I spent a month not exercising and gaining weight, it rose to low normal.  If you can find a good doctor who knows about eating disorders they will probably be very understanding and hopefully not pushy.  I would expect them to try and tell you to stop exercising and eat more (obviously) but if you aren't seeing someone already they will probably recommend treatment/outside help.  Since you're not a minor, I don't believe they can force you into anything, but be prepared to hear advice that you don't want to.  If you're upfront, they may be able to give some suggestions that you can better work with, but if you don't say anything they may just assume whatever they assume and you won't get the best advice for you.  Good luck!!",False,False

It‚Äôs so frustrating how our bodies get out of whack and health professionals are just like ‚Äúlol idk call 911 if it gets worse tho‚Äù which is super frustrating!   My doctors basically think it‚Äôs a combo of the muscles of my heart deteriorating since my body is starting to eat my muscles bc it‚Äôs basically worked it‚Äôs way through my fat stores, my really bad anxiety, and the strain I‚Äôve put on my body from running and not eating and not sleeping and laxative abuse, and just basically all things ED-related.   They don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll improve until I recover AND learn to manage my anxiety (so basically never and I‚Äôm gonna die lmao).   I get chest pains a lot which really freak me out bc I‚Äôm constantly like omg is this the moment which ofc doesn‚Äôt help my anxiety, and the way I relieve stress is through exercise which again does not help my heart lol.   But in order to figure out why it‚Äôs happening you‚Äôll first have to figure out when it started so you can look at what behaviors were happening at that time and are still happening now. Are you eating too few calories, exercising too much, do you binge or purge or use laxatives, do you get enough fats and carbs and proteins, enough micronutrients, enough of ALL the vitamins, is your thyroid normal (T3, T4, free T3, AND free T4), and do you have anxiety are all questions which can help you narrow it down!   Before my ED started getting bad again my blood pressure and HR were textbook perfect and it sounds like yours used to be too! So the culprit may lie in the way you eat and/or the stress eating and being perfect causes you.   Sorry I can‚Äôt be of more help though ); ",False,False

I have tachycardia as well (RHR is usually between 90-130 laying down, up from ~60) except with low blood pressure. Doc says there's nothing to be done for it, since I can't have beta blockers, and wouldn't really explain what exactly caused it. My blood tests are always fine and my electrolytes have never been wacky when they've checked. Ekg and echo were normal too so they were just like 'idk deal with it bro'.  Bradycardia is usually caused by muscle degradation and/or the body trying to conserve energy since yknow it isn't getting v much (or so my half-assed Khan Academy education has taught me). So what could make the opposite happen, besides anemia or electrolytes? Or at least, what was the case with you? Paging Dr. Google hasn't helped me much besides making me panic-confess my dumbassery to anyone who'll listen lol.",False,False

It goes up a bit after binge days; it climbed back up to 62 when I was binging over the winter holidays. my heart feels very sensitive to my food intake now. yesterday I had too much sugar and felt like my heart was gonna jump out of my chest. somedays I wake up after low-restricting and feel like I can‚Äôt breathe, which is not something that I used to experience. I‚Äôve had a fitbit for 4 years now and my heart rate used to be like 60-68 BPM range before I started restricting.  my heart feels so shit lol I‚Äôm gonna try to take up walking again to see if I can save my cardiovascular system ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø ",False,False

I'm a very average weight and I've struggled with binge-restrict cycles for some time, but I never expected it to effect my heart in any way.  I did see that athletes have lower resting HR, but I'm not terribly athletic.   I do think if your heart rate is regularly elevated however, it could mimic this athleticism in its effect on your resting heart rate. This is only a theory of mine. I have a lot of anxiety and drink loads of coffee as well, and I notice my heart beating quite fast most of the time at work when I'm busy. So perhaps it's also an affect of regular stress, or that caffeine and stress can add to it?",False,False
