Whats helped me out with recovery is trying to think of food in terms of nutrients instead of calories. Focusing on the numbers is just such a downward spiral and is hard to break out of.",False,False

I know you know this, your ED brain just keeps telling you it's a lot of food. Tell your ED to shut the fuck up because that's a SNACK. A teensy little ""meal"" that will never, ever make you gain weight. Cashews are really healthy, so I'm glad you ate them. You gave your body good nutrients, I'm sure it was very thankful to have those cahsews. ""I love you"" says your stomach.",False,False
