All I intended to do was buy some apples, spinach, and cantaloupe but I ended up grabbing the whole produce section. I'm not going to eat it all at once, obviously, but I really do have a food-shopping problem because I stop at Whole Foods or New Seasons like, multiple times a week... AND I DO EAT IT ALL! How I eat so much fucking food baffles me.  I downloaded Mint to help me budget, but I'm afraid to look at it to discover how much I'm actually spending on a monthly basis. It's like being afraid to look at the scale. Just willful denial.",False,False
