I actually just got a swimsuit on Amazon so I could swim. I used to swim a lot (I swam club at my university), but I got tired of how inconvenient it is compared to running. I've been meaning to get back in the pool, guess this is my time!",False,True

Maybe try swimming, basically no impact and a great workout.   I can run again, I was cleared to go in late March - out of commission for a good 12 weeks. So glad to be back.",False,False

It sucked but honestly I found it easier to restrict after a bit because I was no longer starving due to excessive exercise. I totally feel you though, compulsive exercise is a staple in my ED.",False,False
