Really fuck your heart up  2. Cause you to gain all the weight you might have lost on them back because of the EXTREME post stimulant hunger   Do not recommend.,False,False

Never again.  This is a stupid idea, OP.  If you want to lose 10lbs, go to a diet subreddit and ask them.  No one here is going to give you weight loss tips.",False,False

We’re talking about people who literally require cranes to get them out of their bed.  Calculate your TDEE and eat 250-500 calories less than that. There is absolutely no reason to be purposefully damaging your health to lose the weight equivalent of a small Shih Zhu.,False,False
