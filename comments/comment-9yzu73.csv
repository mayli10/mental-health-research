Like how did they have that much power? Why am I just discovering this now? It doesn't mean you're fragile. It might mean that your brain filed it away at the time, to come up later when you could deal with it at a better time. It doesn't mean anything is wrong with you. Trauma sucks, sexual trauma is an incredibly awful unique burden that takes a lot to work through. Stay safe.",False,False

My trauma was sexual too, but different in that it was a violent rape by a stranger (not that rape isn't violent anyway).  I was mid teen and I didn't confront that this was THE major factor in my mental health problems for a couple of decades.  One of the symptoms if PTSD is avoidance of talking/thinking about the trauma and that's what I did.  It took ages to be able to actually (OK TMI) allow penetration by my partner.  Not mentally, because I wanted it, but physically because it brought the assault back to me.  I was over cautious with men and I've only ever had consensual sex with TWO in my life (and I'm old).  So I get the lack of trust thing.  Therapy's good and you'll learn to trust someone who deserves trust.  No way are you to blame for what happened.  No way are you ""damaged goods"", ""tainted"", ""only worthy of abuse"" etc (these are things I felt).  You deserve to be respected and you've been strong enough to open up about it so that makes you pretty remarkable.  We don't have the legalised marijuana thing here in the UK, but mental issues are taken into account really heavily over here.  I hope that's the same where you are.  Good luck and things get better in time. x",False,False

The thing I personally found helpful was positive affirmations (cheesy I know) saying things like   ‘I forgive myself, it wasn’t my fault’  I’m safe, I’m loved, I’m happy’   Really helped me. Sending you love, I promise you won’t always feel so bad xx",False,False

Unfortunately, the truth is that there is no ""normal"". Not in this sense. We all cope in different ways. People who can deal with life perfectly are extremely rare, if not imaginary. We stumble, we fall down, we try to get back up again. How that looks for me is different to how it looks for you. That's why there are so many different approaches to therapy and why people have to doctor shop, try multiple methods and medications... Nothing in this world is one size fits all.   However you cope that allows you to keep moving forward is your normal.   The only bad way I can see is to knowingly and actively be harming yourself and/or others. So, just don't do that. And even if you do harm yourself in some way, it doesn't make you less than or wrong necessarily. It means you're overwhelmed and need help, asap. It's not bad to need help. We are humans and humans need other humans sometimes to get us through the worst parts of life. That's how we've made it this far.   Try to let go of any shame. It's not shameful to not have perfect mental health. It's not shameful to need help. The shame rests on the ones who hurt you. The shame is theirs and theirs alone.     ",False,False

You're still moving forward. You're stronger than you give yourself credit for.  You have a therapist. You're dealing with your shit. That's not weak at all.  People are affected by so many things. Everything that happens to us changes us in both small and large ways. It's how humans work.  I hope your lawyer handles your case well and that you can make peace with yourself.  Stay safe. ,False,False
