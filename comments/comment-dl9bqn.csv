I was a complete loner at my lowest with little to no love/social life and now I'm at a healthy weight (was recovered but relapsed a while back) with amazing friends, fwb and other potential romantic partners.

I had such shit self esteem I wouldn't let people be nice to me because I assumed they were pretending. But I do get unsolicited comments about my nice figure and how great shape I'm in. Yeah I can't run more than one full minute without curling over in pain and I can't do more than five minutes of yoga but totally, I'm ""thin"" so I'm in great fucking shape because that's what it's all about right. So nobody gives a shit that I have to starve to look this way in other words. Makes me wish I were back to my LW in high school when people were actually concerned. I'll never get there again but if I did it would be just to piss people off.",False,False

I was shocked at how differently I was treated when I was rapidly losing weight... It wasn’t a new realization for me of course, but it had never been so extremely apparent?   People are actually straight up nicer when you’re not objectively fat.   People are fucking shallow, or society is or whatever. It’s true. It’s honestly really disturbing, and it makes recovery so much harder.  :/",False,False
