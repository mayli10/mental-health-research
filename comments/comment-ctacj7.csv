Those work great for preventing and what not.  But I also use other things for whitening and breath.   I donâ€™t purge but Iâ€™m pretty obsessive with my teeth. Iâ€™m also a smoker that restricts heavily so I do everything in my power to prevent their demise.",False,False

So I would suggest switching to a non-whitening kind asap.,False,False

It is just high in fluoride. I have also heard that children's mouthwash is higher in fluoride than adult so I switched to that. Also it is watermelon flavored and I love it. ðŸ˜¬  I also do the baking soda swish after I purge. I also don't know if it does anything. But it makes me feel like I have done something at least.   I had 1000$ in dental work done this year on top of what my insurance covered. So it was probably at least 2000$ (my insurance kinda sucks as has a cap)   I think just brushing morning and night, flossing, mouthwash and if you don't make sure you brush your tongue. Maybe a calcium supplement if you are not already.   Good luck.",False,False
