The sad shitty answer is that failure isn't linear, the point of damage is invisible, and you not only won't know immediately when you hit it, but there's no way to predict it.  I'm sorry you're struggling like this. Wish I could reach through the internet and just...make it easier.",False,False

I have a normal weekend off this week which is rare for me because I am in the service and restraunt industry and feel like I need to weight until the weekend to break the fast cause my partner will want to eat and I hate eating with them but I dont have a choice. If I dont eat all day and I see them I just look really disordered and they know about my ED.,False,True

I'm not talking about starvation mode or any of that bullshit but 90% of the time it's just going to lead to further binging.   I completely understand your justification of it. I used to do the same thing as a form of self harm.   I'm not a doc or an expert at all but from my personal experience my recommendation would be to ease off the fasting and try eating under your burned calories for a period after a binge. Focusing on filling foods and OMADd works for me.   ,False,False
