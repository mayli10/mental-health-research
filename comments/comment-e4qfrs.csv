When I sleep after binging I tend to wake up and the bloat is gone and I'll (tw?) drop the water weight much quicker and be more likely to successfully not binge again the next day out of tiredeness than if I stay up when it can stick around for days. I guess it's personal preference, but the difference in calories burned is probably pretty much negligible - I'd recommend sleep if you can :)",False,False

Being asleep doesn't really affect how many calories youre burning. If youre sat down either way youre not really going to burn much, if any, more if youre awake. No point in putting your body through extra strain for little to no gains yaknow.",False,False
