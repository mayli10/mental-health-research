I fucking hate that shit. No matter what you're shaped like, youd get people commenting on your body. No body is a wrong body. It's just your body. Its hard to not take their words to heart but please try to. It's just their own insecurities being projected onto you.",False,False

I know it seems really empty to hear ""it gets better "" when your current situation sucks, but it really does get better.   Even in the worst case if they don't grow much (which is super unlikely) it gets a lot easier to accept with time. You learn how to dress to your frame, you can embrace the uniqueness, and emphasize parts you love.  Trust me when I say I sympathize with you so strongly. I pretty much have never developed breasts (like I'm board flat, not even half an a cup) and it was really hard to contend with when I was in high school. Everyone told me I'd get used to it, but at the time I was devastated and felt so un womanly. Nowadays its totally fine, but it's a really hard mental hurdle to get through - especially with EVERYTHING else you have to contend with as a teenager.   You've got this, love.It's hard, but it really does get easier. I promise.",False,False

You totally do. Assuming you're AFAB, you've got a lot of puberty shenanigans potentially ahead. When I was your age, I went from being very broad in the shoulders and ribcage with narrow hips to really prominent hips (in terms of the actual BONES and musculature, not just fat distribution - although that too). My shoulders and ribs never narrowed, but comparatively they seem an average proportion with the rest of me now.",False,False
