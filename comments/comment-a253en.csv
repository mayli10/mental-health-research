In high school, I took all Honors and AP courses and had a high enough GPA and SAT score that I could have gone to just about any university in the world. But it took me six years to graduate with a bachelor’s degree, and I failed/dropped a LOT of classes along the way. Mental health issues will fuck you up no matter how smart you are or how hard you try, and the stress of going to university definitely doesn’t help matters.   Take advantage of any mental health resources your (future) university offers, talk to the disabilities office to see if they can help to accommodate you, don’t take a full course load if you don’t have to, and take online classes whenever you can. Also, consider talking to your professors if you’re having a hard time. I was (semi) honest with a handful of mine about what was going on with me, and they were all surprisingly helpful and willing to work with me to make things bearable. Whatever you do, don’t keep it all bottled up while going full speed. It’s not worth it.  Education is important, but so is your mental and physical health. Take care of yourself and good luck!

And a 96% average is crazy - that's an insane standard to have to live up to, and it must be a lot of pressure!!   But if you're serious about your grades and going to uni, something to think about is how much more demanding the workload will be once you actually get to uni (which you can mitigate somewhat by taking fewer courses per semester, mixing up easy and hard courses, etc, but still). If you can, now is a good time to figure out what works for you in terms of mixing up your eating habits to maximize your performance (as much as you can) - upping electrolytes or certain macros, increasing your calorie allowances, calorie cycling depending on your deadlines, doing OMAD, etc.  I am so so sorry to dump this all on you, and I don't want you to stress you out even more, but my first few years of uni (Canada as well) were absolute hell and I had to work extra hard in later years to make up for my shitty grades. I also had really demanding parents, and wasted a bunch of my efforts doing the things they wanted me to, which wasn't worth it.
