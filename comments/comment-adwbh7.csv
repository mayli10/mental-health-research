I know unattractive people find love all the time but I feel like I must be the lowest of the low considering my experiences. I would just kill for one instance of not being completely dismissed, ignored, or treated poorly. Men will always approach my friends but not me. My worst fear is that I'm still that awkward tween every one told to go commit suicide and I worry that not matter how friendly, intelligent, or outgoing I am that theres just some ""it"" factor i dont have and cant grasp. The only thing I know to change is my appearance. Like maybe if I was thin and pretty enough someone would ignore my weirdness or unknown to me flaws.   I'm too old to use my age as a reason why I havent found someone and I guess being fat is easier to use as a reason than I'm just unlovable. ",False,False
