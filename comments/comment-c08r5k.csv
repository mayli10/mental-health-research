I hate having to decide on the spot. New shirt? Take a picture and come back later. New cute af home item? Take a picture and figure out where I'll put it and then buy it. Hair salon rec? Picture, read reviews, then buy.  Otherwise, I impulse purchase *all the things*.",False,False

I have one go to item and one back up item.   But that's a great idea. It's like looking up a menu before going to a restaurant. Thank God for the internet because without that I'd avoid going out even more,False,False
