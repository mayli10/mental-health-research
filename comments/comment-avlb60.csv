This is just my perspective, so take it with a grain of salt  Recovery takes a lot of time, money, and especially effort. Especially if you're still ""in the closet"" so to speak, and your friends and family don't know about your fucked up thinking/ eating/ exercise patterns for the most part. It's hard to put life on pause and just disappear from work and social events because you've been in inpatient all weekend or a 3 hour long counseling session that day and you're too exhausted to talk to / hang out with anyone.   I live in the US, and my insurance doesn't cover ED treatment unless I'm severely underweight, so I'm not sick enough to get financial help for recovery either.   The time that I could afford inpatient, I went and immediately got sicker afterwards. I was the oldest one there, and with so many tiny, tiny girls around, I ate normally to get out as fast as I could then came home and restricted even harder.  Then of course you have the voice in your head shrieking at you any time you try to eat nuts, fruit, rice, other fear foods, and about the stigma you'll face if you get caught eating too much/ not eating at all.   Put that all together, and recovery seems at worst unattainable, and at best something you just dont want to bother with.   TLDR: Recovery is scary but also is mostly just too big of a pain in the ass to deal with most of the time, and there's no guarantee that it will work.",False,False

It's something I've struggled to understand with these situations. The difficulty in initially getting help, I understand. But after that first step? What makes it difficult to go back? - ps I understand this is hard so no need to reply",False,True

My SO of 4 years is awesome, but I feel like I have to choose between his/my happiness and my ED, even though it's really not a choice. My ED wins out every time.   I've lost the ability to freely choose what I want in life, even though those choices may be fantastic, because of my ED.  I'm sorry you're going through this.
