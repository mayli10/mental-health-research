Just make sure you get an adequate amount, but NOT TOO MUCH of them. Potassium deficiency is pretty common for people with EDs... I think lite salt has sodium and potassium, while there are separate magnesium supplements, all of which you can just add to water and drink for a little boost.   Also you mention you take multivitamins, and drink water, which is good, lol. I’m not sure what position you’re in but I find that taking a separate iron pill, with just chelated iron in it makes a whole world of difference for me. If you find nothing else works I would definitely give that a shot.",False,False
