It’s so messed up. People just don’t take you seriously! Now when I pass out from restriction or if I have severe chest pains or have seizure like episodes, I just suck it up because my labs and tests are always normal (I’ve had a lot of tests for other issues that no one can help me with).  It’s like I’m out to get sicker to be taken seriously, but at the same time I feel like my body is just done and now I don’t give a fuck. It’s a messed up paradox that doesn’t even make sense.  Sending lots of support to you.",False,True

And you bet they’ll be calling the treatment center every day you’re admitted asking when you’re going to be discharged.",False,False

I am currently on a three month wait list just for a day hospital (all i wanted is group therapy tbh) because i’m barely overweight (thanks to binge eating masked as recovery) and labs in the normal range. i was so upset afterwards that i went out and bought a scale and now i’m slowly relapsing and i’ve stopped caring 🤷‍♀️,False,False

I can't help with the system but at least try to remember that no one thinks you're a fraud--if I came to you with the exact same post saying I felt like a not-sick-enough faker you'd tell me that I'm real and valid, because I'm experiencing the disorder and that's the only qualifier. Same deal here.",False,False
