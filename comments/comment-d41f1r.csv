I've found a groove that fits around my job and lifestyle where I can stay at a certain comfortable weight/meal plan, but still stay ~uNhEaLtHy~ weight-wise. Also!! Non-ED related, but: I got a huge compliment from my boss at the end of the day yesterday so am unnecessarily proud of myself ATM, hah.  It feels weird to not be actively losing (my UGW is still ~9lbs away &amp; im currently at my OLD ugw), but comforting to know i can stay here and everything won't collapse haha.  XOXO best wishes to you all, seriously!!!",False,False
