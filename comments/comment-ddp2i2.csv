They will put you on a synthetic version of the thyroid hormone and closely monitor your levels for a while after the surgery to make sure it's exactly right.    Here's the thing about those posts - you are searching for them, so of course you will find them.  Plus, no one is going to make a thread called ""I had my thyroid removed and nothing at all happened to my weight - discuss!"", even though that is the experience most people have.    Read this study (at least read the conclusion): https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/22066475/. It, among others, found that there is no correlation between a thyroidectomy and weight gain.  People just want to blame one magically obviously problem for their weight gain, so they look at major medical intervention in their life and conclude that is the reason.  The only reason you would gain weight is if your blood level of the synthetic hormones is too low, which it won't be because they will be monitoring it (plus they usually get the dosage close to perfect right away).  It sounds like you aren't too worried about the situation in general, which is good because a thyroidectomy is a really common procedure and thyroid cancer is one of the most treatable cancers.  Just take care of yourself and focus on getting better and healing.  Eat enough and drink enough water to get yourself through surgery and healing - it's so much more important at this time than anything else.   And don't forget to put sunscreen on your scar!",False,False
