Let me tell you that *everyone* on the red carpet wears it, even drop dead gorgeous, thin models. It smooths things out and makes everyone look their best.  I find it tough today because of a point already brought up- it will dig in no matter what. BUT- it digs into literally everyone. I believe karly kloss posted a photo of her getting ready for an award ceremony not too long ago and it showed her in shape wear. So he’ll yeah if wearing them make you feel good! That’s what they’re intended to do.",False,False

I noticed after my evening meal with a smallish glass of cava and shit-ton of salty olives everything looked okayish on the front view - waist was still there - but there was this so called Prego™️ thing going on. Like usually there is after a meal some bloating, but shaping wear definitely makes it more preggoish.  Also it sort of pushes some fat on my itsbybitsy boobs in a way I have to get used to. So definitely not for everyone",False,True

I have a pair of target-brand spanx and the one time I wore it I became uncomfortably full off of 1 drink and like 4 canapés/hors d'oeuvres. No bad, but everyone else was getting hammered and I was kind of miserable from feeling full haha. I'd like something that completely snatches my waist and lifts my sad butt a little.",False,False
