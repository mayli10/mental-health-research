I just got my first ‚Äúreal‚Äù stretch marks in the last 6 months or so. I went from like 115 to 135 in about a year. Boobs went from A cups to D cups so there are stretch marks on the inner breasts (like where the cleavage is). I didn‚Äôt notice them at first and thought it was marks from how I was sleeping lol but then I found out they were stretch marks. These ones really fucked with my head. They‚Äôre red and ugly and I hate them.  Also got a few on my butt cheeks and on the front of my thighs. I always hear about inner thighs and o have nothing there, just right there on the front of my legs. It‚Äôs so depressing. They‚Äôre purple. :( I hate them so much and will probably never wear a swimsuit again.",False,False
