Theyll just call the weight on whatever they feel is even kinda right. When i was hospitalized for a surgery and had to go to a lot of specialists and pt i was being weighed like 1-3 times a day and i can confirm theyre all old scales and the nurses could care less if its really accurate or not.,False,False

I have a 25 lb dumbbell I use to check my scales.  Anyway, the doctor's office scales are usually 5-8 lbs heavier when I weigh *later that day*.  Your clothes add a few lbs plus the weight of any liquid or food you consume.  It's normal.  ðŸ™ƒ",False,False

Something I have noticed at doctor's offices is that they don't usually care to get a totally accurate weight on those scales. And a lot of them seem to be kinda broken. Home scales are less accurate, but also nurses sometimes just record your weight a little high or a little low because they don't want to spend ages fiddling with the scale to get it just right. That being said, it isn't unreasonable to think that you might have gained 10 lbs in about two and a half months. if you eat an excess of 500 calories over your TDEE every day for a week you can expect to gain one pound. If you do that for 10 weeks you can expect 10 lbs. If you didn't eat that much every single day though then you probably didn't gain 10 lbs.",False,False
