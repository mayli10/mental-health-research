Holy hell, I had a whole pizza yesterday + ice cream. I actually planned on getting  just the pizza since my dad and my sister went out with me for dinner and I just couldn't bitch around... but then my sister wanted an ice cream afterwards and I had to get one too and this made me feel awful. I know exactly what you're feeling. Maybe you  feel better knowing it was still less than what I got :(",False,False

You only fail when you practice the same thing over and over and over again yet expect a different result. One slip up does not define you. 10 slip ups do not define you. Please be kind to yourself and to your body. donâ€™t punish yourself it will only make it worse for you. Just try to think about why you wanted as much as you wanted when you ate it and then maybe in the future you can place yourself in different situations where yes you can still have access to those items but letâ€™s say, you have raw carrot sticks to make up for the difference. Your body needs nourishment but you do not deserve to feel bad when your body ask out seeking it.",False,False
