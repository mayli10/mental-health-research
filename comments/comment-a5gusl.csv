Then I’d top the noodles with a small portion of either shredded chicken or some of that “beef shaved steak” from walmart. Whatever meat I’d use, I’d use the same seasoning as the noodles. It was easy and not bland at all, but loads of sodium. I’d probably use maybe 1/4 to 1/2 a packet for a serving. ",False,False
