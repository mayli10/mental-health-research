I definitely think ED might be related to my gender presentation.  The less ED-Minded I feel, the more comfortable I feel in my femaleness, and the more happy I am to look feminine.  I'm a lesbian, but I don't think my sexuality has much, if anything, to do with my choice of gender presentation.",False,False

Big mood! Definitely reject the idea of being a dude so that’s off the table, and I don’t feel bad at all about being seen female soo...",False,True

I had curves when all my other classmates were flat and I hated it, so I just attributed how badly I didn’t want to be seen as a woman to that.  In the last year I’ve made a lot more non-cis friends (I’m bi, never had many gay/not-cis friends because I barely had any friends at all tbh) and when one of them was describing what it felt like to be NB, it really resonated with me. I never really felt “allowed” to question my gender, because I knew I wasn’t a man and I figured I didn’t violently hate being a woman enough. Long story short I started experimenting with they/them, a more androgynous name and style, and bought a binder.   Idk if my ED has taken me to new levels of fucked up, but it feels correct. Kind of makes me sad to think about how my ED might’ve never developed if I hadn’t been born into this “womanly” body, and how it might’ve started off dysphoria that I waved off as wanting to be skinny. It’s definitely a full-blown ED now, though. F.",False,False

I'm straight but I've always been wanting to look flat and androgynous. I think it's because I was always that chubby little baby, that taller bigger girl in 4th grade who got boobs before everyone else. My classmates told me to start wearing a bra! I was ashamed being the odd one out among kids who looked like, well, kids. I never had the chance to come into my sexuality.",False,False
