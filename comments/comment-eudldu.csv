I also understand how it can feel to be recovered/ing and to feel like you never really had it at all. Since I don’t talk about binging often at meetings and have more good weeks than not I don’t always feel like I belong. *But* I remember that’s the whole goal and that once I was talking about how I binged for two weeks straight. Progress doesn’t undermine any struggles you feel now.   Thanks again for the encouragement, you’ve given me a lot to chew on (haha).",False,True

I think it’s difficult, because weight loss is just one recovery goal of mine. I rarely bring it up out of respect for other group members. But when I *do* bring it up, it’s always treated as a negative. I think my group leader is keen on the idea of me staying where I am, which just doesn’t vibe with me for a number of reasons (including high blood pressure and other health issues that run in the family).   Unfortunately this is the only group offered and the only leader. I think if things continue I’ll pull her aside about it, however because it’s not the most common topic of conversation it can wait a little.",False,True

I feel the same in a lot of ways, especially your body not feeling like your own and still liking a lot of things about yourself.   Also, you kinda snapped me out of a funk this morning, so thanks.",False,False

I don’t dislike myself, in fact I’m very much a fan of most aspects of myself. I can see the good things, if that makes sense, although there are some areas that vex me a little. That’s why I’m still in therapy probably.   I also know that watching my body morph so quickly caused me to have some much more negative feelings. I just didn’t feel like it’s mine, ya feel? I’m not 100% back to my normal, but can confidently say that the progress I’ve made has helped me embrace my body as mine and I take much more pride in not abusing it so much as I used to. I feel like I went from a routine of self-harm to one of self care speaking broadly.",False,True

I only just recently got back to a healthy weight, and I’m still pretty close to the borderline. Really makes it feel like I never had BED, though I do fit the criteria.   I think the message should be “you can and should love yourself no matter what” instead of “you shouldn’t be losing weight.”   Pursuing health can be a form of self love if done with a healthy mindset.",False,False

I was also confused by this in treatment but now I’m coming around to it. The reason they say weight loss *in itself* should not be the goal is because beyond life-threatening extremes, weight change (loss or gain) isn’t the goal - health is. Weight change can come as part of achieving health but they’re not synonymous (as we all know). After addressing dangerous behaviors and thought patterns (which it sounds like you’ve done - that’s amazing!) the focus is on being in tune with your body and, as others said, addressing the underlying causes of the ED. This is the hardest part of recovery.   However - it seems inappropriate that your group leader is recommending weight gain on its own. They shouldn’t be talking about that unless they’re the physician or RD, or it’s a life/death situation. Your own journey in recovery is different from everyone else’s and the fact that it leads to weight loss is not a bad thing! If it comes as part of honoring your body - that’s wonderful, that’s the goal. If it doesn’t, then you just gotta shift focus. It sounds like you have a pretty solid handle on all this though. It might be interesting to see if a group that leans toward BED would be more helpful, or if you can go to the same group at a time w a different leader. Sorry if I rambled, all in all you’re doing great and I’m sorry treatment/staff can be super unhelpful!!!!",False,False

So, my doctor said (paraphrased a bit), “Now you seem pretty stable. If you wanna work on making healthy habits to promote weight loss then that’s a good next step, just don’t push it and keep up with counseling”. The group leader knows this, but says weight loss is a bad goal to have period.   And for whatever it’s worth, my binging behavior has been helped a ton by my weight stabilizing a bit, because there was a bad negative feedback loop from gaining so much so quickly. She knows this too, but doesn’t want to (won’t?) acknowledge it.   I dunno. I’m just tired of talking about how now that the binging has improved so much I’m working on getting back to a healthy weight and having her tell me that’s a bad thing, because weight loss with an ED is always going to be disordered.",False,True

For BED, that means that weight loss itself generally isn't the primary goal and often isn't even really part of the treatment plan until AFTER the factors causing the binging are addressed. Which makes sense, because if you lose a bunch of weight before you address the eating disorder itself, you're just going to gain it right back OR end up with even more pathological issues (such as swinging too far toward restriction).",False,False
