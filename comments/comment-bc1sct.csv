I actually get a bit low-key pissed off if my wife tries to cook and mutter something passive-aggressively about ""oh i guess i'm not eating tonight"" (i'm getting better at not doing that shit though).  The best (worst?) part is that if i am restricting, i use TONS of calories and actual sugar, carbs, etc. so there's no chance i'll go near it.",False,False
