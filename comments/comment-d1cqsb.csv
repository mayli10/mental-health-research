I was pretty underweight at one point, and I hover at the ‚Äúbarely underweight/low end of the normal range‚Äù now. I just keep dealing with the urge to want to look really underweight again, and if I see someone who was a lot thinner than I ever was it makes me feel like I wasn‚Äôt sick enough to recover. It‚Äôs similar to how I see myself as disgusting, but I don‚Äôt view people who are bigger than me or the same as me in the same negative light as I see myself regardless of their size. I truly think people of all sizes are beautiful except in my own case if that makes any sense. I hope that explained more of my internal feelings, but thank you so much for the support it means a lot. ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,True

I was diagnosed with osteoporosis at age 17, but as of this January my bone density had improved 10% and I have normal bone density / osteopoenia. So, when I see really underweight girls, I think ahead to the future and remind myself that I value not having a really crooked spine in my future. And I also remind myself that those girls are probably miserable because I remember being that small and also being miserable.",False,False
