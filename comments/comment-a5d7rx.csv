An avocado roll, sushi salad, and some miso soup seems normal enough, and if they say anything you can say youâ€™re trying to stay away from fish/meat for whatever reason, whether IBS, recovering from/scared of food poisoning, etc. I have IBS and will eliminate food groups for certain periods and no one ever bats an eye!

I've checked their menu again and they do have a lot of salad and vegan options so I'll try to mostly stick to those. I find sushi rolls very dangerous anyhow because you never know just how sugary they make the rice... ,False,True
