B/p never did that for me, binging was just a cycle of self loathing and pity.  The feeling you get when you step on that scale and the number is *way* lower than you predicted, when people start complimenting your body, when you can start confidently wearing the clothes you used to fantasize about—no food in the world taste better than that feeling.   The longer I do it, the more tricks I learn along the way that make it so much easier for me. ",False,False

I wonder about why triggers can suddenly change or spur new reactions like that. When I think back on any prolonged behaviors of mine, they always kick off with a sudden switch and then... that's that. Seemingly nothing else to it. Also your new habit seems more logical than stressing about the number everyday, I hope it sticks well! ",False,False

And my appetite feels dampened.  I do have a new habit as far as reference numbers:  I'm still weighing myself daily or more often, but I'm only ""counting"" my Wednesday morning weight as ""real"".  That way, when I'm tracking my weight, it goes Wednesday-to-Wednesday, and is basically guaranteed to always be less if I'm sticking to my calories.",False,True

I'm bizarrely consistent with my restriction this time around. What kinds of things normally trigger b/p for you? For me, I think restricting is so easy (for now...) because I've forced myself to try lots of healthy foods that normally wouldn't appeal to me. I ended up liking a lot of them and really abruptly changed my taste palate and diet. Now I feel like the minute I try to eat some less healthy/unsafe foods, I will go back to compulsive eating. I also started using only one number as a reference (waist measurment) rather than several (weight, bmi, etc.). Are any of your habits new this time around? ",False,False
