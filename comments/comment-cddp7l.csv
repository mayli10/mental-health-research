I got 4 different boxes yesterday (plain light, multigrain, sourdough, &amp; light rye) and I'm excited.

I'm sorry that your friend acted that way...it was irresponsible and definitely not ok. I don't blame you for feeling afraid of being honest, but their reaction is not your fault. They could have handled it in a more mature way.   After everything with the first friend, I had the mentality of, ""Well, looks like I'm never opening up to anyone ever again."" But it's better now that I have someone I can trust. I have even started mentioning smaller bits of what I am going through to other friends when they Express concern.

Still got me afraid to open up to anyone, because I'm both still hurt by that and still afraid that that was my fault... I hope this friendship is one like your second mentioned...

We ended up both denying that we were sharing too much and it all blew up when she decided the best course of action was to ignore me when it finally became too much for her. There was a whole lot of other stuff going on there concerning her desperate need for attention and validation from anyone, even literal strangers. I also realized that my ED created an involuntary competition in our friendship. It definitely taught me a valuable lesson about boundaries...both in respecting others and creating my own.  That being said, I don't want to sound too negative because reaching out can be extremely beneficial when you have a good relationship with the other person. All the drama with the first friend brought me closer to another friend after I opened up to her. Turns out she has been dealing with an ED for years too. We created boundaries and have a much healthier friendship because of it. But we still share the tough stuff and support each other through it all.   I guess my point is that you reaching out doesn't mean it's just your ED wanting to be validated or that you are seeking attention. Sometimes we just need another person who ""gets"" us and the right person can be a great support. I am always here if anyone want to talk too.
