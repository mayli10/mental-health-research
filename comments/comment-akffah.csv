I’ve recently been attempting to recover and I am doing a lot better than I was, because it was severe at one point. I’m having a really hard time getting recovered and staying that way. Changing a mindset and this whole thing is so incredibly difficult. Reading this makes me really hopeful and want to recover even more. I’ve been feeling a lot better and definitely happier than I have been in a long time, so that gives me some motivation. I just have to keep going and hopefully get to the point of recovering. I actually just got on sertraline too for my severe anxiety (and depression), and I’m honestly hoping that it will make things easier too.",False,False
