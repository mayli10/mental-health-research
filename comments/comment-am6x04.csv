I used them regularly for about a year, and at the high point I was taking around six senna tablets a day. So when I cut back I slowly started replacing two at a time with docusate sodium, then I started decreasing the amount. I think I went down to 2 docusate and 2 senna, then 4 docusate, then three, then two, and now just the tea. I'm going to try replacing that every other night with green tea soon, and then hopefully fully make the switch off.  One thing to remember is green tea is you friend, and always stay hydrated. I also always have something big to wear around in case I feel bloated, because that's mentally really hard for me.  I know it's rough, but I'd just take it in as many baby steps as possible. You got this!",False,False

I know I sometimes use it if I don't want to deal with the stress of eating and what it will feel like in my body, so I can just sip the drink throughout the day and know I'm getting something healthy. It also helped when I was going through the big push to get off laxatives (never again lol) ",False,False
