I was struggling to find the words to describe it... probably Do to the fuzziness and apathy  üòÖ  It‚Äôs totally a cyclical thing for me. It went from SH to over exercising in high school. Then over exercising to drinking for me in college. This is the second time I have ‚Äúquit‚Äù drinking (the first time was imposed on me by a past significant other, this time is mostly my own decision) and I immediately went into binge eating the first time. Now I‚Äôm going from ~1000 a day to 400-600 a day. I‚Äôm hoping my next stop is like... maybe obsessive knitting.   Thanks :) I‚Äôm guessing I won‚Äôt be sober forever, but I‚Äôd like to get to a place with my general anxiety and Social anxiety that I can have a glass of wine or a beer with friends and not feel the need to drink myself into numbness.",False,True

A big part of drinking for me was about shutting down the never-ending tape of loathing and doubt playing in my head. I wanted to detach from reality, detach from feelings. Intense restriction has a similar effect on my experience of consciousness. That addictive fuzziness and apathy. (Though it comes with some significant negative side effects, as did the drinking eventually.)    I think this is a big part of why ‚Äòcross addiction‚Äô is such a common trap in early recovery. No alcohol? Sub pills. Quit the pills? Return to SH. Round and round and round I go. And wherever I stop, there I am.   And hey, congrats on stopping drinking! When I was drinking I had zero chance of getting somewhere better - staying sober at least gives me a fighting chance. Best wishes as you move forward.",False,False
