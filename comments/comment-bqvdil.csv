But I still deal with the fear of gaining and continue to eat disordered in a way that I could very easily be dragged back into ED. Hating fat people or the idea of being fat is not the answer. You need to get over that to recover. I'm still stuck there because of shit like this. It's not healthy to constantly be monitoring and making assumptions about other peoples lifestyles.,False,False

But do you think telling a group of people with ED that being fat is awful is going to encourage anyone to get better? I agree that being overweight is unhealthy, but honestly hating the idea of ever getting any bigger is even more unhealthy.

I'm talking about a BMI over 25. There's even a little wiggle room, but if you become very overweight or obese something is still wrong.  People should be prevented from getting that fat. And if they truly recover, which is a GOOD THING, their body will be fine. It's scarier to show people ""recovered people"" who are fat and still unhealthy.",False,True

You seem to have massive issues with overweight people, and that would probably be your first step in figuring out. People in recovery don't aim to gain weight, and it often is what keeps people from wanting to get better. But the thing is that you will only get better if you accept yourself and your body and stop fearing fat as being the worst possible thing you can be.  This post is just very...triggering? Non-supportive? I don't know how to phrase it but I think you are actively encouraging people not to recover which is kinda gross.",False,False
