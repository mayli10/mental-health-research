It can also be a sign that other processes are starting to diminish in order to preserve energy and other vital functions. So losing your period is shitty either way, and not something anyone should be aiming for.   You don't need to lose your period for your ED to be valid. I'm not underweight by any means, and I know from how my disorder was affecting me and my relationships and my personal life and my health that it is definitely real.   Please take care of yourself &lt;3",False,False

Also, the hormone cycling is really important for preserving bone density. You're at a much higher risk of osteoporosis without it. Even as someone who really wants to be dangerously thin, I'm really fucking terrified of losing my period. I don't see it as a sign of victory. I take it as a sign that I'm actually damaging my body.",False,False
