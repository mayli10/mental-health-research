In reality, both my parents have disordered eating habits and have an extremely toxic relationship with food.   I've curved conversations around eating disorders in front of my dad, and he brings up a female singer from the 70-80's who suffered from an eating disorder. ""I don't ever want you having an eating disorder. She died of a heart attack from throwing up so much,"" is basically how he put it. like lol ok yeah sure dad i just will tell myself I won't have one *pooof* what's an ed?",False,False

But that mightve been bc I dropped a LOT of bombs at that moment.  1. My sexuality 2. Birth control implant at 19 in a very Conservative catholic country 3. ED  I'm diagnosed with depression and anxiety along with it. Maybe she didn't catch it but she says I dont eat when people say how I lost weight after being the fatso.  She literally says ""It's because she doesn't eat."" not cool mum, but I'm glad she doesn't force me to eat and just let me do my own thing.",False,False

I was having massive anxiety attacks thinking about telling them and then one night I just decided to get it over with. I go to university on the opposite coast so I facetimed them when I knew they'd be relaxing after work together. I framed it by saying I've been struggling a lot with anxiety this and it manifested in me getting really obsessive about losing weight and now I couldn't stop. I was already seeing a therapist so after chatting w my parents, we scheduled a time for them to have a conference call with me and my therapist which I think helped a lot to calm them down. They were scared but reasonable. It helped a lot I think that I stayed very calm talking to them. I was SO nervous about telling them so I understand how you feel, feel free to PM me if you want to talk more.",False,False
