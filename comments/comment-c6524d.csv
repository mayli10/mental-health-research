We have had really good conversations about this in my dietetic internship. We tend to define it in a way that translates to looking past weight as the only predictor for health. For example, there are plenty of people in the overweight BMI category with perfectly healthy blood work and physical exams, but doctors will still recommend weight loss when it might be unnecessary. I think that there are plenty of medically accurate ways to refer to HAES, and nobody in the movement is explicitly promoting morbid obesity or unhealthy lifestyle practices. If they are, I believe they are mistaken.",False,False

Yes if youre weightlifting, you can absolutely be in the overweight or obese category and very healthy (see the rock and every other big beefy wrestler) which is why dexa scans are more useful as a measure of health, because they take body fat % into account. all this to say, i like the idea of HAES being ""you can make healthy choices at any size"", which is what your comment seems to be saying.
