I'm vice president of a club for my major and a tutor.  I do a lot of talking and such everyday to so many people but I also feel like i don't have anyone irl to really talk.   I have been there, funny enough at the same time. Right when I started college.   I have a few suggestions that might help you:   1) if you have access to a university counselor or mental health expert, I would really suggest putting all of your feelings out there. This is risky on whether or not what you say is confidential to them. If possible, look up your university's rules regarding this.  Just to make sure that they cannot remove you from school, contact your parents, hospital, etc.   2) I used to feel this way and wondered why no one ever noticed or cared. The reality is that people don't notice others much or they feel it's not their place. Even some friends and family will do this.  What helped me was to know I wasn't alone. Even if you don't see it, there are so many people at your school going through exact same thing, and I mean EXACT.   3)  About missing classes, I would talk to your professor if you can. Some professors are mean about it and others aren't, but most important is you attempt to reach out to them and explain your situation.   Sometimes life is just really rough, more and more people are understanding the implications that mental health struggle has on people. There was a time I skipped an entire week and I came clean to the professor about struggling with an ED, and he completely understood.   4) something learned the hard way and something NO ONE wants to hear. Sometimes, you have to be the one to help yourself. It sucks. I was on the same situation where I looked to everyone else for a solution when the problem was inside me. It took me a long time of self reflection, dealing with emotional turmoil from my past, etc.   I hope everything is well and my DMs are always open, if you (or anyone who reads this) ever need to talk :)",False,False

Really making the most of higher EDucation lol. One thing thatâ€™s helped me is going to my schools therapy (itâ€™s free) and forcing myself to go to class so I can at least pretend to be normal. College is hard but if you wanna make friends you gotta meet people and classes are one of the best ways because you already have something in common. I know it seems impossible but you have to start somewhere, I believe in you ðŸ’™",False,False
