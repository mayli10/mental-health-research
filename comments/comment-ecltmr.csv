Men on Reddit think that woman live to look perfect for them. So men on Reddit hate woman who are fat because it isn't what they think is a perfect look. So they think they can bully people. It is a huge trigger for me. Especially subs like fatlogic or fatpeoplehate when they used to be on the front page all the time.,False,False

If this is seriously the kind of mentality you have, I’m guessing that you also assume all other anorexics on the planet start at a fucking underweight BMI before being diagnosed.",False,False

But it doesn't mean they're not suffering any less.  You can still get diagnosed with anorexia without being UW as well. It'd just be diagnosed as Atypical Anorexia rather than straight up Anorexia Nervosa.,False,False

I don't agree with a lot of the fat acceptance movement (haes is bs, for instance) but people's health is literally none of your business. Fat people are shamed relentlessly, often since childhood, and they're probably fat because of an eating disorder/unhealthy relationship with food. i don't see y'all making fun od thin people with eds for being unhealthy so why is it ok with fat people",False,False

As someone who is still overweight with anorexia, it kills me seeing how much vitriol some people here have for us...
