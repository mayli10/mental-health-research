It's literally the same 5-7lbs that keep moving around (except I've recently gained 10 on a med change but it's coming off). I feel like I shouldn't still be like tis as a grown ass woman with kids. Especially while trying to recover. Don't lose more substantial weight but don't gain any either. It's fucking hard. ,False,False

I'm stuck at a different point, but I can't believe that the bright, happy, smart girl I used to be is now a grown woman who literally bases &amp; values her life around gaining and losing the same seven pounds.   Take care of yourself out there in Big Sad Land, &amp; here's hoping we both find some Happy here soon. üíú",False,False
