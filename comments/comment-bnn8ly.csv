If you really go through with it, I’d recommend cleansing whatever you use to cut yourself with a bit of alcohol or even a more powerful desinfectant like boric acid.",False,False

From a logical non-ED perspective, terrible idea. The amount of blood you’d be losing wouldn’t be enough to create any noticeable change in your metabolism, but you’d also not be able to accurately track how much blood you were losing/could afford to lose and your body would be under significant stress by losing blood so frequently. Not to mention you could get an infection or go too far and cause yourself serious harm by passing out or something.  I donate blood as frequently as my country allows (every 3 months) and 500mL of blood is said to burn around 650 calories over the time it takes to replace it (2 days for plasma, up to 8 weeks for red blood cells), which is a very small amount in the grand scheme of things.   It’s definitely not a large enough amount to risk your health over like that. Please take care of yourself.",False,False
