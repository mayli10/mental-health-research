If at all possible, I’d let her know you appreciate her compliments, but it is difficult to receive body comments right now. It can be hard to have that conversation depending on the relationship you two have. But personally, I have had some good results from asking people to refrain from complimenting my appearance.   Otherwise, if it isn’t possible to talk with her about the comments, I am sorry! I completely can relate to feeling uncomfortable with body compliments. When it is unavoidable , I try to think of the intention behind the words and the fact that people mean what they say even if my disordered brain wants to twist their words into something to use against me.",False,False

My response is nearly always a simple “Thank you” now.  Thinking of compliments as gifts from people helped me slowly change my mindset. Regardless of whether I agree with or accept the compliment, making a statement of neutral(ish) gratitude has aided me in letting the kind words at least remain out in the world rather than getting automatically deflected.  And occasionally, I even manage to let them sink in just a bit! Appearance oriented comments are always tricky with an ED for sure. I wish you success in holding onto the positive words other people say about you :)",False,False
