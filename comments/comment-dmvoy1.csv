The question I’ve had to sit with is, “do I want to change this?” I’m finding it a surprisingly hard question to answer because often it’s more like I feel I *should* want to get healthier...but part of me (sometimes a big part) doesn’t really want to let go of my ways of thinking and acting. Like, I recognize how destructive and ineffective some of my ways of living are, but part of me is also proud of it? It’s uncomfortable to look at that, and harder still to look at it constructively instead spiraling into judgement and shame, but I think it’s the way forward for me.",False,False
