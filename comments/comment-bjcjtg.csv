Got sat a ten top an hour before we closed (I‚Äôm a waitress) and I was stuck there two hours after I was initially allowed to leave. Also spilled wine accidentally on a customer and her husband left me just enough to cover the single monster zero I picked up on my way home for dinner instead of having a full meal finally because I feel too shitty to let myself eat  Lol guess I‚Äôm extending my fast an extra day ü§ô,False,False

Felt ‚Äúsafe‚Äù to eat cause I spent the day with a friend,  and indulged in the things I‚Äôve been craving. Now I just feel even worse than before, so there‚Äôs no winning :(",False,False
