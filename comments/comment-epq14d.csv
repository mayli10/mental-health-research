Iâ€™ve been on it at a range of doses (up to 90mg). Supposedly the lower does were supposed to help most with depression and higher doses were supposed to help with my obsessive/intrusive thoughts. My body wasnâ€™t happy about alcohol while on it, but I was a burgeoning alcoholic so I didnâ€™t really take heed. Eventually (after going off it to try a different med and then back on) I realized it was significantly worsening my self-harm urges so Iâ€™m not gonna take it again.
