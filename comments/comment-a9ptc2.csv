Job - not the most professional move, but your health comes first. If you work at a call center, a restaurant, or something that it's not a big of a deal as if you're in something with more of a career track (like if you're interning in a law firm, or are a teacher, or something). Not a good idea to ask that place of work for a reference, most likely.",False,False

She asked if I had any questions, explained a little bit about herself, and then asked me what I was looking for in a therapist and what I was wanting to work on. Whatever you want to ask depends on what you want to know! I’m actually a grad student studying counseling psych so I asked some more technical questions, but something that might be helpful is asking like how they view the client-therapist relationship, what they think is the most important part of the therapy session, and maybe what their theoretical orientation is and what that means. Don’t be discouraged if they’re not the one for you, finding a good fit can be difficult!",False,False

It’s nerve wracking :( but I know this will help me in the long run ",False,True

I just started seeing a therapist and the phone consultation had me so anxious but she was great and I’ve been to see her twice now! Remember, therapists are just people too!  I quit my job over text a few months ago because I couldn’t stand serving anymore. I had already said I didn’t want to take anymore scheduled shifts in person and then got scheduled for one and I just texted my GM and said I wasn’t coming in. I felt bad but he wasn’t mad and was cool about it. Do what’s best for you, if you don’t need them as a reference for a future job then fuck it!",False,False
