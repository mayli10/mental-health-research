Nothing else seems to help my disordered thoughts. Like yeah it's an apetite stimulant but that's just a useful side effect. I find that cannabis helps clear the obsessions and anxiett from my mind and that helps with recovery more than anything. This year i used it atleast three times a day every day while i was at university and i was doing better with my recovery than i have ever done in my life. Been off it for three months now ans i'm right back at my old shit and my lw. Not gonna lie i enjoy being this size so much that my ed is pressuring me to just stay sober.,False,False

Last night she made fajitas for the family and I had one, and this morning she made a breakfast casserole and had a slice. Then we went to this pizza place for lunch and i had a big slice (probs 2 slices in one slice). Then we went to dairy queen and i got the smallest burger and a small blizzard. Ate the burger and halfway through the blizzard got the worst stomach pain, bloated the fuck up in the span of 5 minutes abd also suddenly had to take a liquid shit (first time in several days). That made me feel a little better.  Physically, it's as if I overate, even though today would've been a normal day in the past. I'm not upset though because I know I haven't gone over my TDE, and I restrict in the first place so I can enjoy social events involving food guilt-free. But damn. Going back to eating after restricting so hard makes me not want to eat at all. I've actually lost the desire to eat entirely, but all day I've been expected to eat since I'm with family. Eating also makes me feel sick/uncomfortable when I restrict, and when I do eat, it's usually unhealthy bc social events.  I've been having these constant background chest pains (not my heart though) but it went away after I ate the DQ burger.  I also have a rash underneath my boobs since yesterday and idk what from. A little on one side boob too. My sister says it might be shingles and I'm weirded out as fuck by that. I'm 17 so I don't think it could be shingles. It's starting to itch a lil now when it hasn't before. I'm not a person who gets eczema or anything like that and i never get rashes or mysterious sores so this is really weird to me. Highkey worried but also feel like the dog from the ""this is fine"" meme minus the existential dread. Oh also I'm not anxious at all which my sister suggested might be the cause of the rash/shingles. I feelno stress or anxiety. Whatever happens happens yanno",False,False

I felt so much relief and a bit stunned as she's the only person who's given me a pass instead of trying to indulge.   Idk if she secretly knows but hasn't mentioned it because I haven't.
