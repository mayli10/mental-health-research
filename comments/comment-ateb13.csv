Actually in the early days of the sub, I got in contact with another mod who had been warned by admin, asking their advice on how to approach admin and make sure I don’t rub them the wrong way. I then pre-emptively messaged that admin, pleading our case for this sub and asking them to give us tips/warn us before the ban hammer. This was before admin contacted us about the pointers. I like to think that that may have put us in the good (or at least better) books.  :) ",False,True
