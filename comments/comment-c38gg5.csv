I would make it clear to your friend why these comments aren't helpful and in many ways down right mean. If she does not want to help you in your recovery or at least be mindful of what you're going through, I'd limit time spent with her though I know it might be hard. I have found it really important to be around people who understand (I've found my friends who have actually faced their ED can only truly, truly understand) or are at least willing to listen and learn. Be kind to yourself :)",False,False

Of course, all kinds of people and especially young women have body image issues- but that does not excuse blatant insensitivity towards people, especially friends. Just try to be a bit objective here. This sub is for people with eating disorders, people who don't just hate themselves for their body, but actualyl go to the lengths of starving/purging/binging in order to satisfy and fuel that self hatred. In correlation, this sub also is filled with the kindest, most sensitive and empathic people ever.  People who are that insensitive towards you can't be excused just because they might also struggle. In fact, it'd mean that they deal with their own issues by putting you down. If they were kind people, they would treat you with the same consideration you're treating them with. Their kind of comments would even make a person without an ED feel bad about themselves.  Take this from somebody who had a ton of shitty friends because I didn't know anything else- please ask them to be more sensitive, you don't owe them an explanation why. You don't deserve to pull the weight of their issues on top of yours. Ask them why they get so agitated when you mention weight, you don't have to open up to them as to why you bring it up. If they are genuine and apologize, good. Maybe they'll realize what they're doing and be more considerate. If they refuse to see their errors, then ditch them.  We are so quick (rightfully so!) to tell people on here to rethink their relationships with SO's if they are rude about our weight or disorders, but we let friends get away with it way too easily if they behave the same way. We are a reflection of who we surround ourselves with, and a lot of us are way too lenient with that. Take it from me, I'm getting rid of all the bad people in my life and my suffocating anxiety that I've had for a decade has decreased as if I had started a magic medication.  You're not a special gen z snowflake, you just wanna have some good friends. That's the minimum any person could ask for. I'm sending hugs. &lt;3",False,False
