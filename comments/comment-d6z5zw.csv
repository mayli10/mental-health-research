The worst part is that when I'm at his house and his room mates are there, I will always seem weird but healthy AF by waiting for my ""OMAD"" to make a cute salad... I can tell his room mates think I'm healthy when I do this, but than I'll start going back and forth to the kitchen a few hours later trying to binge and his roomie will always walk in right when I'm going ham on chips and peanut butter. It makes me feel like such a fat ass, than I go try and throw it up in their shared bathroom with paper thin walls.  &amp;#x200B;  Aren't ED's fun?!",False,False

I've just started trying to recover and just told my fiance like two days ago. Now, I've somehow gone from only eating when he's home so he doesn't know I have an ED, to now only eating when he's home _because_ he knows I have an ED, because I'm afraid he'll try to accuse me of lying about what I ate while he's not home (he wouldn't do that??) but ALSO being afraid to eat because then it won't seem like I have a valid ED?????  Fuck me..",False,False
