I buy this 14.75-oz can of salmon from Trader Joe's for $3.49 that has 12 g protein, 5 g of fat, and 90 calories in each serving (7 servings) and even though I LOVE salmon in any form, it doesn't feel good eating the whole 630-cal can. Generally I eat half at a time, and save the rest for the next day to save money (and because 42 g of protein + what I get from other stuff meets my daily requirements - not trying to bulk or anything).  Milk (whole or at least 2%) also works - about 2 cups in and I feel slightly sick. I never used to like milk as a kid and I'm still not hung up on the taste so I do mix in chocolate syrup for chocolate milk, heh  You may find nuts to be small for the caloric value, but the fat content will stay with you - even I can feel the ""pressure"" after eating 20 or so, but it's best paired with vegetables like broccoli if you crave volume at the moment - it increases fat-soluble vitamin absorption and delays rate of absorption so you stay full for longer (without the nuts, that super voluminous and filling entire crown of broccoli makes me want to eat again after 1-2 hours). If I think I'm at risk of binge on even unsalted nuts, I just buy a small amount from the bulk bins and Sprouts - usually unsalted almonds are at the same price as TJ's, $4.99/lb over here (though I still have a large stash from when it was $3.99/lb a few months ago)",False,False
