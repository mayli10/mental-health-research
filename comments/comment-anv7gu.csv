I feel so stupid and immature, for letting a relationship lead to starvation. I feel weak and childish and irresponsible for not doing anything to prevent this. And your message makes me feel just a little less alone. Again, thank you.",False,True

I packed my shit and was out in under 3 days but ya it was awful.  I had slipped back into hardcore restricting a few months before this happened because I felt that we were growing more distant and thought that the weight gain was the reason for this. So It was a huge blow mentally and emotionally to know that no matter what I wasn’t good enough. I kept it up for like 6 months after we broke up to kind of prove that I was attractive enough to get any guy I wanted and fuck him cause he’s missing out. But that slowly turned back into binging constantly and I gained 20lbs back.  Now I’m in a fantastic relationship with my best friend.  But it definitely has its own challenges... he’s about 20lbs lighter than me and he’s trying desperately to gain weight while I (now triggered as fuck) am back to restricting and have a compulsive need to be lighter than he is currently even if he gains some weight.
