Yeah I still feel physically sick and it’s making me scared to eat again. I just like sticking to my routine and my “safe” foods. It’s definitely going to help remind me why eating like that isn’t something I should be doing ,False,True

Everyone makes mistakes. All you can focus on is the future and try to be better. Use this experience as motivation next time you are thinking of breaking a fast or doing the same things you did last night. ,False,False
