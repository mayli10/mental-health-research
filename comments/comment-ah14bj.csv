And you're taller so you wouldn't look fat at all.  I'm so sorry your mum said that. Sometimes my mum calls my sister fat because she doesn't like certain styles of clothes and she's trying to stop her from wearing them by making her think they make her look fat...not great behaviour and super awful. Mums can be pretty terrible about weight and then force us too eat.,False,False
