The worst for me is when I am buying all sorts of binge food and the person behind me is super thin and fit and buying all fruits, and veggies.   Makes me just feel like saying ""oh sorry I'm so huge and in your way, pardon my fatness.""",False,False

Occasionally, Iâ€™ll have to buy something else (either for my teenage daughters or a binge food for myself) and I feel SO incredibly uncomfortable. Like everyone is staring at my jellybeans and thinking one of two things   1) that fat bitch does not need jellybeans or 2) that skinny girl wonâ€™t stay skinny long if she eats those jellybeans.   A real example of the huge difference in how my brain works. Ugh. ",False,False

Especially because I feel like I look fuckin huge and that people are judging me for buying any junk food.  It's 100x worse when I am buying absurd amounts of binge food, though. Like okay, employee I've walked past about 5 times now, stare at the garbage in my cart with a weird look on your face, I'm gonna go lay down and die in aisle 12 now.",False,False

I went out to eat with a few friends the other night. Theyâ€™re all under 5ft 5 and weigh no more than 120lbs. Theyâ€™re so tiny. I didnâ€™t eat for 3 days so I could eat wings that night and I was so excited to let myself enjoy them!! When we ordered I went first and they got 6 wings each...... I got 15!! I wanted to die. I also will not go to a checkout line with unhealthy food, Iâ€™m fat and I feel like everyone thinks Iâ€™m just being complacent in my fatness by buying the garbage food. Only self checkout for me. Yâ€™all make me feel saneðŸ™ƒðŸ™ƒðŸ™ƒ",False,False

But I see it as a good thing - if Iâ€™m too scared to buy junk food... then itâ€™s not lying around waiting for me to eat it. Iâ€™ve had no junk food at all this month because of my fear of embarrassment. Thanks, anxiety! :)",False,False

I know retail is a soul crushing enough job and these cashiers could care less but... I overthink everything. ,False,False
