My yoghurt was gone a few days ago and I didn't know. When I was prepping my food and realized it wasn't there I had a meltdown. My parents usually don't touch my food but Dad didn't know that the 0.1% yoghurt was mine..well, now he does. Or them eating in front of me is barely tolerable. I know it's hard to talk about it but I think you really should tell him. ",False,False

He knows about my ED a little bit, but I never go into details. He does freak out when he hears my stomach growl at times.",False,False

I do that with my bf and so far works most of the time. Problem is when he brings candy and that is tempting to me and ugh...  He seems that he likes to cook, maybe suggest something you feel comfortable with, to start slow?   My bf eats like a panda (vegan and cute), his weight in food, orders pizza, take outs, burgers almost every single day. it really triggers me, a lot, eats a whole 6 pack of oreos and bag of chips in a sitting. Yet he has a 0 fat, defined abs and his hipbones are more pronounce than mine. So I understand you. It really triggers me and I have being open about this and it hurts me a lot. ",False,False

Being triggered just by seeing other people eating sounds really rough, I hope you can sort it out between you x",False,False
