Cliff bars are 240 calories. You've been fasting. I'll guess you burn at least 1200 calories a day cuz that's the case for super short super inactive people, if you're not super short/inactive it's more. A pound is 3,000 calories.            That cliff bar will not make you gain weight. Not even close. It will not make you maintain your current weight. You will STILL lose weight. You ate at a deficit of at LEAST 960 calories which means if you ate that every day you'd lose at LEAST a pound every 3.1 days.",False,False

It was really only small, but I haven't had chocolate in so long.  It was a beautiful day and I really wanted one.  I dipped it in my coffee.  I ate it because I wanted it and I'd only had one cherry tomato in 20 hours.  I didn't even feel faint, just tired.  I ate it for pleasure.  I'm not supposed to.  I ate sugar.  I ate something unsafe.  I spent ages and ages justifying it.  I DIDN'T HAVE TO.  IT WAS A SMALL CHOCOLATE WHICH I HAVEN'T EATEN FOR YEARS.    We lose grasp on what food does, or more quantity of food and calorie values.  That hedgehog isn't going to make any difference to my weight.  I even went home and ate my regular calorie intake I maintain with.  To gain weight you have to CONSISTENTLY eat more.  To us, a LOT more than we do and EVERY DAY.  Don't beat yourself up.  I know it might be okay for me to be a bit level headed about it because I've got my maintenance down to pat, but you're going to eat ""SO much"", but really after restriction it only SEEMS so much.  In reality, you NEED to eat something because your body's making you almost black out without!  I know I'm being all fowiejraoijraoejr (making little sense probably), but a Cliff bar is totally fine.  I eat THREE a day with my maintenance plan.  I restrict and it aint no good.  You're not ""fat"".  Be nice to yourself because life's shit with you so don't be shit with you too.  I probably won't have another chocolate hedgehog for a while because they don't sell them around here, but if they did I'd even have one a week.  A treat really doesn't affect your weight.  Honest.",False,False

I've got hypoglycemia, extremely active job rn (like trudging through wetlands and sand dunes) and I felt my blood sugar really dropping. Like seeing everything kind of brown and getting dizzy. So i ate my Clif bar. The moment i felt my blood sugar stabilizing i got so pissed at myself. I'll be ruminating on that clif bar all goddamn day",False,False
