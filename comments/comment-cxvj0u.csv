I get that people obsess over the scale number but like... that seems way less damaging than people falling into a pit of despair because there are all these other things that arenâ€™t directly connected to what number you weigh. Kind of like the ignorance and simplicity I used to have when imagining/trying to lose weight, before I found out and started obsessing over loose skin!",False,False

I literally HATE ""the number on the scale doesn't matter.""  I hate the million asterisks I hear about on a daily basis about ""overfat"" and fitness and macros and wELLneSs and everything fucking else  I need to be able to look at the scale in the morning and just have that be OKAY. I need to be able to look at that without coming up with a million caveats that erase its value to me. Fuck I'm just so tired, man. So tired",False,False

THIS  I never thought I'll obssess about my thigh giggle when walking, about my underarm fat while clapping, about my chin when laying down, about my damn ankles.... I didn't know thigh gaps, hip dips and the like until I drowned in this body obssession black Sea and honestly, I just wish I could forget all of it...",False,False
