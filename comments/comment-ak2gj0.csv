I ordered non-dairy banana ice cream a couple weeks ago, and I said my order 5 times, ""Banana ice cream, with chunks of papaya, strawberries, pineapples, banana slices.  No honey, puffed quinoa, or coconut.""  I emphasized the parts I wanted left out, in fact, that's the only part I actually said 5 times, the other one, I said just 3 times.  And sure enough, they bring me my order, except they forgot to leave out the shaved coconut.  And I'm not into coconut the food (the scent is okay), and I just realized it when I got home, and I tried to eat around it, and not cry about the extra calories (because I should shut my privileged ass up if I'm privileged enough to order ice cream on therapy days).  Luckily, my mom was nice, and scooped out most of the coconut.  Next time, I'm gonna look at my order right away. ",False,False

I ate the ready to go Quaker porridge for a while, but on my calorie check of the foods in the kitchen (don't ask, lol) I found out that my mam had bought the 33% bigger packs(315 Kcals I think?).

Like I don't dare let my porridge out of my sight because it would be so easy for them to add milk, honey, c a l o r i e s without me knowing. Cups of tea are no longer cups of tea, they're disgusting mugs of deceit willing to shelter filthy sugar in them, because people would absolutely secretly put it in there and I don't *know* that I'd know.
