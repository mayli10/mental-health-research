But I'm also the queen of math and cooking so I can make like 700 a day yummy and filling and I feel like a pig eating that much.,False,False

I know it's not a lot but my head just doesn't let me see it that way. I also hate eating around people and my friend. I can't turn stuff to look at nutrition cause I forget that eating more than 200/100 calories for a meal is expected. I fully go to the low calorie section and see like 500 calories and get so confused. Or it annoys me cause in my head it should be that small number. Whenever I look at my eating habits vs what's expected it makes me realise I really do have an eating disorder.,False,False

I genuinely forget that 1000 is barely anything. Even as I type this in like no its really not 1000 calories is a crazy amount in my head.,False,False
