I just donâ€™t get it. Same angle, just further away! It is a cheap Walmart mirror though, so it could be warped.   And then on different days I look completely different somehow, so thereâ€™s just no winning.",False,False

I spend like 20 minutes every morning after I get dressed body checking in each mirror in the house, from every angle, and there is 0 semblance of consistency whatsoever. I trust no mirror. Even in public I do this thing where I hold up something I can see from a 3rd person perspective (like my phone) to the mirror and see if it is slimming for that thing. Then I know the mirror is a fraud ðŸ˜ªðŸ˜ª people probably think Iâ€™m crazy like why is this bitch holding her phone up to her thigh and staring at them in the mirror aisle of Target lmao but they just donâ€™t understand smh  Seriously though itâ€™s gotten so bad that Iâ€™ve resorted to taking videos of myself, bc then I can test out different focal lengths/points of view and assess the damage from all angles. Itâ€™s fucking ridiculous and exhausting and I hate myself !!!",False,False

In the first my butt and thighs looked huuuuge, in the second I suddenly looked OK. Well, the lighting was very different. I've currently read of concaved mirrors which make you look slimmer so I checked the mirror but stupid me could not figure it out haha",False,False

It's like it just always looks the same, until one day all of a sudden I'll realize I'm huge.  Like it all sneaks up on me?",False,False
