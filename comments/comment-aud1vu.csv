He either did not have a good grip or he doesn’t have great upper body strength. This is nothing to worry about.,False,False

Some guys aren't great lifters. i dated 3 guys at my heaviest of 135lb and they all liked to pick me up, carry me on their shoulders and whatnot. I'm at my lowest of 118 and my current boyfriend can barely handle me laying on him.",False,False

It was more about how awkard his grasp on me was rather than my weight tbh. I've been carried easy peasy at 120lbs tho. ,False,False

And that says more about his lack of strength than your weight.   My boyfriend could easily scoop me up when I was like 170, and he’s not a body builder or anything. Meanwhile, his older brother can’t even lift their little sister who’s like 80lbs. The fact that my boyfriend could pick me up easily at 170 didn’t mean I wasn’t big (at 5’3” I WAS) and his brother being unable to pick their sister up doesn’t make her fat (she’s skeletal).",False,False

He probably is embarrassed that he struggled to lift such a small weight  My SO picked me up and fell backwards onto the bed when I was 118 and he is embarrassed about it to this day &amp; that was almost 5 years ago. ,False,False
