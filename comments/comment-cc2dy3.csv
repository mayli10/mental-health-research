I ate almost normal, didn't think too much about calories and gained 22lbs, but I wasn't happy with my body. So I started to ""eat healthier"" (which is kind of difficult when you can't eat fruit or vegetables because of intolerances), so started to try some vegetables and some fruits and was cooking everything freshly and started Yoga and some other workouts... Last year, after losing like 18lbs, I started swimming on a regular basis and eat lots of salad and everything.. and then I started eating less again, but I rewarded myself with some junk food until I only eat junk food and nothing else... GREAT!!  This week I filled the fridge with tons of fruit and vegetables and I am going to eat ALL OF IT!!! And no pizza!!",False,False

I'll be loosing weight and feel like i could do anything and i am motivated to exercise, to clean, to take care of myself (do facemasks,  dye my hair,  file my nails ect.). I feel like when i eat and gain weight i'm not worthy of taking care of myself and when i don't eat much i feel the healthiest.    This sounds so awful if you don't consider the sickness behind it.",False,False
