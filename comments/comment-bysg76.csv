It was triggered by running cross-country, so it was paired with running every day. I never wanted to lose weight, I just- I don't even know. But I got really anxious when I deviated from what I ate every day.  This led to losing a pretty significant amount of weight over about 6 months, having lost my period like a month in. When my parents realized this (they are a little more conscious because I suffered from AN 7-ish years ago) they forced me to eat more, and I started engaging in more disordered behaviors (not eating at school, replacing food I had to eat with lower-calorie things that looked similar, even purging). It's actually crazy to think how fucked up I was. I lost more weight and I HATED how skinny I was, especially (TW) the divot I had in my chest. But, for a while, I just couldn't eat more than the amount that I thought was ""right"". I also was unable to eat foods I deemed ""unhealthy"", which is still a problem.  And even when I started eating more, for a while I was purging things that were ""unhealthy"" (AKA anything my parents cooked in more than the tiniest droplet of oil, I really never had to eat sugar) and eating more ""safe foods"" so I wouldn't be losing weight. Luckily I now view fat as necessary, and am not terrified of it (sugar, on the other hand...).",False,False

My goal has been slipping further down, though - I started off wanting to get to 80kg, then I saw someone my height at 70kg and thought they looked perfect and now that's my goal, but I started thinking about how cute it would be if I lost exactly half of my SW so my new goal is 65. All of those put me in the ""healthy"" BMI category. Average/good BMIs are the body types I always admired and what I wanted to achieve.  I think what you're going through is normal, but it's also a red flag for both of us, I think. A lot of people start off with a GW that's in the healthy range but it gets pushed further and further back, either because they like how other people look at lower BMIs, or they reach their GW and still don't like how they look so they keep trying to lose more and more weight to finally feel good. Unfortunately for both of those it can trigger a sensation of never being thin enough - your GW will just keep dropping and dropping. This is how a lot of people get to the point of looking dangerously underweight - they might not have started off wanting to look that way, but the time it takes to lose the weight can seriously warp your perspective. Not just in a body dysmorphic ""the body i see in the mirror looks bigger than it actually is"" kind of way, but in a ""my concept of what a normal body/BMI looks like and therefore what kind of body I want to have is skewed by my own biases and the thinspo I surround myself with"". Thinner and thinner people are working their way into my inspo folders and idk how to feel about it.  I also feel like at its base, orthorexia is about wanting to have a ""normal"" or ""healthy"" BMI and it's still very much disordered eating/an eating disorder. Even if you hover around a ""healthy"" BMI and never get to the point of being underweight, the obsession some people have about the food they allow themselves to eat, their macros, etc. is what impacts their life. I don't think it matters what your GW is or what kind of body you're hoping to get or whether you're losing, maintaining, or gaining - hell, I think you could have an ED even if your GW was in the overweight categories - I think what matters is the compulsion you feel to monitor your eating and the WAY you get to that weight category.  I want the best for you and I don't want your disorder to get any worse so I hope you can find support (here or elsewhere) that helps you avoid the creeping ""lower GW"" effect!",False,False

This way, I figured, I'd have a ""buffer zone"" and it wouldn't be as easy to become overweight (I have never been overweight in my life and at the time I fell into AN, my BMI was at a healthy 22). Eventually, I did get to the lower threshold of normal weight. But that wasn't enough for my eating disorder; it insisted I need to keep losing weight, that I needed to be underweight in order to have a proper buffer zone. I don't know how many times I told myself ""Okay, I'm going to stop restricting when I get to ___ lbs"" but my AN kept changing the finish line. Your eating disorder will ALWAYS change the finish line. Right now you may not want to be underweight but if your eating disorder habits continue to develop, the body dysmorphia will get worse and you may find that wanting to be a normal weight is no longer the case. I sincerely apologize if this is coming off as preachy or condescending, I just want you to know that your eating disorder will always find a way to trick you and lie to you.

So I wanna apologize for not answering your question about how common your situation is. I don't know how common it is but I really think that it can't be too rare. First of all some comments here have already related to your post. Also the wider scenario into which your situation falls (ie, retaining some behaviors of an eating disorder but not completely fitting the whole bill) is common enough that the OSFED diagnosis exists.  It's possible to have an eating disorder *as long as you have some sort of mental health issue relating to eating*.
