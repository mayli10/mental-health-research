And yeah the doctor thing messes with me too. Like he'd look at me and think I'm not skinny enough to be treated?! Idk because it's probably not true but still stops me! Can a girl get a charity tummy tuck around here?? lol",False,False

Like I know you said you probably have around 5 extra pounds, so I am just curious to know how much of mine could be skin. I don‚Äôt think mine would be that much but I guess you never know. I am scared to take this issue seriously because of the skin. Just makes it feel less likely I‚Äôll be taken seriously for some reason if a doctor were to see me naked.",False,True

It‚Äôs like health wise I‚Äôm underweight but I don‚Äôt have the size zero body to show for it bc my skin doesn‚Äôt fit. I‚Äôm terrified to get help for this reason. ,False,False

It‚Äôs like, how much harder do I have to work to look the part of what I‚Äôm doing to myself than other people? (I know that‚Äôs what happens because I was bigger to begin with, but it stills gets SO old.)   That‚Äôs partly why I asked this question to begin with. It feels like this part of my life will never end as it is, much less with all the extra effort put in because of the skin. ",False,True

Cause... I got like at least 5 lbs.. which means with it gone I'm underweight.. which means weight loss is harder :( Am i making sense?,False,False

This response was definitely depressing and not because of the content of the video. There is definitely still fat underneath my loose skin and I have read up on that before. But literally the LAST thing I guess I want to hear is how I still have all this body fat to lose when I‚Äôm already underweight. But I did ask the question so thank you for the info! I‚Äôve also lost about 20 pounds more than the guy in the video at this point so I‚Äôm not sure how/if that would factor into anything. I just wish I knew how much more, you know? Like what is the end here? I‚Äôm just rambling, sorry.",False,True
