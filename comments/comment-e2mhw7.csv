Once I decided to make the leap, it felt like a big weight was lifted. It's not butterflies and unicorns every day :) but least for me, not having to hide and carry it all on my own, exactly what the other comment said, was a big relief. You've got this!!",False,False

I developed my ED at age 12 (I'm 34 now). If I could go back and change ONE thing in my life, I would given anything never to have developed an ED, or receive help and serious intervention early on before this monster got its hooks in my soul. The sooner someone receives treatment, the better their chances for a full recovery.  3 years go, I finally had the courage to embrace recovery to save my life, and not to appease my parents, etc. It breaks my heart to look back on all the beautiful things I missed out on. Even when I was physically present, I wasn't truly there.     I hope you find someone you can talk to, and slay this dragon before it gets any bigger. I actually wrote a letter to my mom telling her what was going on a number of years ago when I was too afraid to even say the word ""eating disorder"".   Bottom line: it's your life to live, and you are deserving of freedom and happiness..",False,False

Go up to her after class and ask if you can talk to her about something you’ve been struggling with. You could say you’ve been dealing with an eating disorder for a while and you don’t want to go to your parents. There’s nothing to be embarrassed about, you’re literally asking for help right now and that shows a lot of balls. I can’t even imagine the amount of people that can’t even admit that they have a problem in the first place. You’re strong but you feel weak cause you’re constantly fighting with yourself, please let someone else know so they can take some of the weight off your shoulders.",False,False
