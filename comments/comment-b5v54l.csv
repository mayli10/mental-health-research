Remember if you drank 2 cups of water (like 1 water bottle) you will weigh 1 more pound.   To offer a humorous perspective - weight is never stable- since it is based on gravitational force- you weigh less the closer you are to the equator (okay by like nothing but hey) and you weigh even LESS on the moon. Maybe Iâ€™ll move to the moon. ðŸ˜‚,False,False
