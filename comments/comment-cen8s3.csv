My school knows that I have problem with food/mental health, but the councellors tell my mother/report absolutely everything. I have been in trouble with that before. Also where I am (France) they don't exactly have a lot of experience with fat people let alone people who purge, i am one of maybe two fat people at my big school, I have seen a few doctor's, but they haven't really understood. I'm hoping to try to get help as soon as I move out, I just hate that I have this problem in the first place.",False,True

That's completely deplorable behaviour on the part of the adults in your life and I can't believe so many people have let you down. Do you have any support resources at your school? At mine there's confidential counselling: not sure if it's worldwide though.,False,False
