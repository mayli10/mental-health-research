It's full of photoshopped images of beautiful girls and can give you unrealistic expectations for your own body. Still, if you think it will help you, it's your choice. I've always avoided it bc knowing me I'd start basing my self worth on how many likes I'd get. ",False,False

I used to never let myself be photographed because it always triggered a relapse in restriction/purging (and sometimes still does), but it was really helpful to ease myself into it - parts of my body I was happy with, flattering angles etc. Really helped acclimate me to the idea of being photographed and normalised the sight of myself on a screen, so now group photos and candid photos are a bit less daunting",False,False

No need to wait, you can post things now! Even if itâ€™s just of your hair, or hands, or a cute pair of shoes. It doesnâ€™t have to be a full body pic, maybe it could be an exercise to take pics of parts of yourself that you like, and try not to repeat things?
