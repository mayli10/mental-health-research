So I only want to eat  when all the work is done, or after I finished 10 chapters while studying or anything like that. I set goals and reward myself with food. Otherwise I can't enjoy it.    But often I am too lazy or slow and I am SOOO hungry/hangry when I finish my tasks and it's already so late that I just want to eat and not wait and cook.   These are the moments when I stand in the kitchen and start desperately crying (with my mom or boyfriend thinking I am a total freak) while thinking about what to cook, which has the lowest amount of calories, but tastes good, makes me full and  doesn't need long to cook - which is basically nothing - so I cry even harder.",False,False

But my ed brain has trained me to be like this lol. Also counting each calorie of every ingredient takes me like 30 min because I have to look up ‚Äúhow many calories in one mushroom‚Äù, then decide how much of each thing I wanna use, then enter it all into MFP. So prep takes 45 min üôÉ.",False,False

I take forever to cook so it gets later in the night then I can just try to go to bed after I eat then hopefully no binging. And I have to have my food be really hot temperature wise so I microwave it half way through eating it and it takes even longer to finish.,False,False
