So here I am eat below 500, if I eat over that then I must drink laxative tea. When I exercise i have no energy and want to die.

I think it’d be magical to actually feel skinny and dare I say confident? Like what is that like? I’ve never even worn a bikini publicly because I cannot bare the thought of that much exposures. But I completely understand what you mean. I hate me less now too since I’ve lost 35lbs but do I love me? No. Will I ever? I hope. Even if I do end up liking myself I’ll have to maintain which still means not eating. ,False,True

Literally don’t ever remember a time when I didn’t feel fat. Like I hated my thighs and stomach in preschool. I won’t pretend I’ve ever loved my body post ED, but if I’m actively losing weight I don’t hate it nearly as much. Does that even make sense? Like I get the skewed perception that comes with an ED, and as much as I still am unsatisfied by my body, I like it so much more than when I was a normal weight. I love the idea of recovery, but I don’t think any amount of therapy and food could get rid of a body hatred I’ve had since I was barely more than a toddler. Unless recovery comes with a new brain too I’m absolutely not interested. ",False,False

Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck no. It was terrible. And it triggered a relapse and now here I am arguing with my brain about what weight we can actually safely stay at and never go back into that fat weight ever again. Because when I recovered I PROMISED the damn demon I would never gain above Xx weight. And then I did. I'm technically back in ""safe weight"" but now with the fear of WHAT IF THIS ISN'T ENOUGH.

My body looked good. Then at 17 I was stress eating to get my grades up to get into a good university. I think the stress eating stemmed from restricting and losing so much weight the year before though. I sort of forgot how to eat in a sense. Then my first year of university I was totally yo yo dieting. It was awful. Then my second year I was restricting which led to binge and purging. The cycle is so hard to break.

It’s crazy to me to even think about. Sometimes I think about my life before the disordered brain took over and just wish I could go back to that...

I just don’t understand why I started restricting at 16 when I had such a lovely body. I know intellectually it was my way of lashing out due to a shitty home life and my mother’s alcoholism but ughh fuck me! Fuck me for fucking everything up for myself.
