Knowing it's there and I can eat it guilt free (since the calories are all accounted for) helps prevent me from eating before then. Like tonight I'm probably gonna get plastered, but I have a MASSIVE pot of vegetable soup and some random low-cal prepackaged snacks all set out for myself. Also, I normally just accept I'll eat near my TDEE on days I drink, and usually try to offset that by doing extra exercise earlier in the day. I totally feel where you're coming from though! One of many reasons I wish I wasn't an alcoholic lol.",False,False

It will keep you from bingeing on food and alcohol. Get a script for wellbutrin for depression and you have one excellent weight loss combo.,False,False

Lmao, I binge when I come home but by that time it's already past midnight and I fucked up the whole day so might as well binge that day too.",False,False
