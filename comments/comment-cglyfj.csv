It had easily been months. Tripped me out for a few min when I realized I never noticed but by now I'm totally used to not having it and honestly kinda paranoid to get it back XD",False,False

When I was first diagnosed with AN at age 16, I had never had my period before, probably because I was technically underweight before I even started restricting, and at my lowest I was like 14 BMI. Went on the pill at age 17 to finally get my period, then decided to go off the pill when I was 21 cuz I was getting a lot of headaches and acne. My BMI was around 17 then and I didn’t get my period for about 2 years after going off BC. My BMI was roughly the same when I got it back. Then I relapsed for a few months in 2017, got down to a BMI of like 16 (so not that much weight loss) and lost my period for about 6 months. My BMI is between 17 and 17.5 now and I get my period again, but it’s pretty light and only lasts a couple days.   I’ve always been kinda triggered that I get my period at a technically underweight BMI (especially cuz it doesn’t feel underweight to me since I weighed LESS before my ED) but I know it varies for everyone when they lose their period.",False,False

I am on the pill though. But ever since I started low restricting my menstruation is all kinds of fucked up. I take the pill to make my period dissappear because I experience extreme pain. This normally works. But with low restriction I started to bleed through the pill. Though no actual pain. I bled for 2 months. Then I actually stopped the pill for a week to get a real period but it was very light. After the bleeding also stopped.    Now, a month later I have some spotting(while taking the pill) so I assumed my hormones are still acting up.    I wonder if these thing s could be signs my non pill period is messed up. I always read stories from women and girls whom aren't on the pill, but what have people whom had been taking BC noticed?  Cause I've been taking them since forever. How would I know if my period is dissappearing. Can it dissappear completely with the pill?",False,False

Before I really got disordered, ironically enough. It was shortly thereafter that I spiraled really bad- and then even when I got a bit better, it took me a while to find my maintenance, so I was still accidentally losing for like 7 months after I stopped trying to. And then I relapsed again for about four.  I'm now back at the weight I lost it (19 BMI), and at \~20% body fat (you're not supposed to lose it from body fat alone until you're sub 15%), and I'm getting cramps and bloating again, and my dr. says that my hormones are ""normal"", so I imagine it is on its way back. I'm still bulking most of the time, too.",False,False

Like being underweight will definitely do the trick, but over exercise and overall not eating enough can trigger it as well.   Sad thing is doctors don’t usually do anything except ask if you wanna go on birth control, my doctor didn’t see an issue bc I was healthy weight.

If the pattern is true how it’s gone in the past, I won’t see it again next month if I continue restricting/losing.
