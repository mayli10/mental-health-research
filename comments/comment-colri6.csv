I think it increases the heart rate which causes your body to burn more energy (*a rather negligible amount really, pretty sure it's mostly carb energy, caffeine is not a weight loss supplement*) which is what leads to the burst of energy. If you have no energy and you drink caffeine it won't help. Eating and consuming caffeine together may be more effective. I'm no expert though.",False,False

At my size (*barely underweight, taller than you*) I can only drink 300mg. Use [this calculator](https://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-safe-limits) to figure out your recommended upper limit.
