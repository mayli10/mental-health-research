Even laxative TEA can mess up your insides like crazy. I used to drink a cup of smooth move tea before bed when I was in 10th grade, and when I woke up, it hurt so bad and I would shit so much before school and be crampy the rest of the day. The flat stomach wasn't even worth it!!!!!",False,False

I understand the allure of using them every day, but try to have one normal unassisted poop between uses just to keep your colon functional! harm reduction yay!",False,False

Possibly 1.5 too many.   Unconventional advice, perhaps, but when I pledged to stop abusing laxatives, I switched from oral ones to suppository ones, as I did still have legitimate need for laxatives. Why? Because it's less tempting to abuse them. Stick it up there, wait 5 minutes, be uncomfortable for about 10, and then it's done. No getting impatient/frustrated and taking more throughout the day.
