Or, something else?   For psych meds, there’s so many meds out there for such a messy venn diagram of symptoms and people respond in such varied ways that it’s pretty impossible to say what’s gonna be best for someone. (The guess-and-check process can be so frustrating but it seems that’s all the docs can ultimately offer.) The doctor people usually have some info on the statistics of the side effect profiles and that can help inform choices.   Turns out therapy is helping me the most, but I may just be in the category of people who don’t respond well to psych meds. Fwiw only the atypical antipsychotics increased my appetite. I always put in a plug for tracking mood and symptoms while meds are tried/adjusted. It’s helped me spot when a med is helping or doing nothing or making things worse. Best of luck! I hope the EDU has been a healing place and that the step-down to PHP will be a positive experience &lt;3",False,False
