Over-extending yourself will only cause further problems in the long run.  • Avoid falling into the role of ‘fixer’ and ‘savior’. No matter how much you love someone, it cannot save them.  • Offering objectivity, compassion and acceptance is valuable beyond measure.  • Know that even if your actions and love may seem to have little impact– they are making a difference. (Trust me.)  • Have realistic expectations. The recovery process is not a straight line nor is it one that happens quickly.   It bears repeating: your love, acceptance and patience are more effective than you will ever realize.  1. Inform yourself as much as possible about the illness being faced. Get the truth not the myths. Local mental health associations are terrific resources to help you understand the illness and the route recovery often takes. It’s also an ideal place to find others going through or who have gone through similar experiences.   An excellent reading resource is “I Am Not Sick. I Don’t Need Help!” by Dr. Xavier Amador. His book gives practical suggestions about how to help someone with mental illness who doesn’t believe they’re sick. Understanding lack of insight (or more accurately: ‘anosognosia’) as a symptom of psychiatric disease and appreciating the process from denial to acceptance and then wellness is essential.   2. Start dialogues, not debates. If your family member doesn’t agree she or he has an illness, talk about it; find out why. Listen without trying to change them or their mind. Forget the power struggle. Focus on building trust and rapport.   3. However, in cases where a loved one is in acute psychiatric distress (experiencing psychosis or feeling suicidal for instance), getting him or her into the hospital is the wisest and best choice. I speak from experience, involuntary commitment saved my life. For more on this subject, read the post ‘Should Restraints in Psychiatric Care Be Illegal'?   4. Instead of guessing what helps: ask. Even if your family member has difficulty telling you what would be helpful, asking how you could support, demonstrates you don’t think you know best (even if you believe you do). It gives room for empowerment and self-awareness to take root. See if the requests are doable. Be honest with what you can take on. Once the discussion begins, keep it going. People’s needs shift with the path of the illness.   5. Seek counseling for yourself. The burden of dealing with a chronic and severe illness within a family is an enormous stress and the feelings that arise, conflicting. When my mother was ill with the swings of severe depression, mania, and anxiety, I was worried as well as angry. I needed someone outside the family to freely discuss my frustrations and hurt without the fear of upsetting her. A qualified therapist offers clarity, objectivity, solutions not previously seen and a place to safely deal with the emotions rising from such difficult circumstances. The healthier you are, the better equipped you become to handle demanding situations.  ( https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/crazy-life/201209/how-help-loved-one-mental-illness )",False,False

Sometimes a person really just needs some time to get used to the idea of recovery, but sometimes people also need an intervention because they're going to kill themselves or make themselves really sick from their eating habits. I think it's best to ask her some questions about it to really try to figure out what'a going on in her head and to work from there. You may just need to keep reminding her that she's beautiful, but it could also be something else. The root case may not be insecurity, so that might not work at all. For some people it's a lack of control in their life. They can't control anything else, but they think they can at least control their weight. Then of course things get out of hand and they can't actually control their weight and that just makes everything worse. It can be so many things that are causing her to struggle with this. It's really hard to give advice for a third party to help a sufferer of an eating disorder.",False,False

If she's eating a normal amount of food but feeling guilty for it this is the eating disorder trying to get at her so its helpful to just reiterate that the amount she ate was normal. If shes undereating perhaps even try encpurage her to eat more although this can cause anxiety. I think encouraging her to eat when you think she might feel hungry is helpful, for example if you eat something she might feel more encouraged to do the same. Of course I don't know her situation exactly but these sorts of things I have found help calm the anxiety that comes with eating when you have an ED.",False,False

And if she doesn’t know at the moment, just letting her know that you’re open and willing to do so is big too imo. It also would be beneficial to know where she is in her disorder. Some folks want to recover but need accountability while others may be still in their disorder and just need reassurance that their ED thoughts aren’t a true reflection of reality. Or in between really. EDs are messy like that but just be patient with her! That’s key !",False,False

For me, I always feel like if I get to a normal weight my friends will think I am too fat and ugly and will no longer talk to me. Also, if you eat with her that helps for me, I always eat with my mom or brother and never alone, but everyone’s disorder is different just ask her about it. Some people like eating alone idk.
