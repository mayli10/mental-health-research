I hate that it's done this to us. I don't even know you but I felt your words strongly. I hope you can find your way out again, isn't a cycle better than a straight line down? At least there's hope that you'll wake up a little better than you did yesterday, that maybe you'll think to yourself, ""I'm worth it, I want to live a life that inspires me"" and try your fucking hardest to get there. Even if you cycle back into restricting, there's always that day around the corner. Those moment feel like life, like real life, not this weird reality we've made for ourselves. Good luck.",False,False

I’m doing better than earlier but still a little down. I’m going to reach to one of my friends so they know at least. I’m really trying to stay strong but gosh I’m so exhausted.,False,True
