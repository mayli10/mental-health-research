The treatment was successful and he's been in remission ever since, 10 years now. I'm hoping your dad kicks cancer's ass.   But yes, ED is a great coping mechanism for me too. I think it depends on what the *trigger* is, if it's something that makes me not want to think/feel at all, drugs are usually the go-to for me, but if it's something that I want to take my mind off of and focus on something else, diving head first into my eating disorder is the choice.",False,False

(I‚Äôm absolutely going to out my alt if anyone in my family is on here, but screw it, this is really apt:) my grandmother used to say ‚Äúdo the best you will‚Äù. Not the best you can, just the best you will. And this was coming from a very straight laced, perfectionist, but she understood that you can only do what you can do and no more. Trying to do the best possible at everything all the time will just burn you out. And while I really don‚Äôt want to be a horrible voice echoing with your worst instincts against yourself, I can‚Äôt say I would do anything differently in your place.   Breaking things can be super cathartic- when it‚Äôs too much to really grapple with issues and thoughts, just a physical reaction can let some of that loose, as you know!   Go easy on yourself, and just do the best you will üíï",False,False

I really relate to you saying that it ""wears on you so very deeply and often without our conscious knowledge."" I'm quite emotional normally but lately I think I just shoved all the feelings down and then I get these outbursts of sobbing and breaking stuff (inconvenient since I'm in college lol). I can't quite keep the leash on the ED AND be there for my dad right now so I think just letting myself have some ED behaviors will help me deal mentally for now. Hopefully not forever but I guess this is just my tHiNg",False,True

There‚Äôs a reason we keep coming back to the safety of starvation over and over in life when times are hard. It is the numbing blanket that we wrap ourselves in so we do not have to feel.   Protect yourself, do what you need to do, but try to be kind to yourself as well. I don‚Äôt know what your relationship with your dad is like, but I‚Äôm sure he is scared too. If you can take care of yourself and protect yourself and still manage to be there for him emotionally without burning out, well I wish that for you.   Times like these wear on you so very deeply and often without our conscious knowledge. Check in with yourself and recognize when you need support from others too.   I know this isn‚Äôt sarcastic or funny, and I‚Äôm sorry to reply with such seriousness, I just really feel for you and I hope your dad has a good outcome.",False,False
