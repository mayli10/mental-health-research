But if I don't have the stress of school, I totally feel this. Like I can sit for hours and hours trying to figure out how to make something for absurdly low calories and then feel guilty about it and eventually I'll give up trying to play calorie tetris in my head and just say fuck it, guess I won't eat.",False,False

I remember at peak restriction I would have no problem eating 300-500 calories a day, and sometimes even be too lazy to eat anything at all. Once you bully yourself into counting every single calorie it becomes easier just to not eat at all honestly",False,False
