My mom works with one and also applies sunscreen multiple times a day, wears funky looking protective garments, points a gun at the sun and threatens it, and has extra protective coverings on her car windows to block uva and uvb. Almost all of them are like this.  Not all cancers are preventable, but adopting some of those habits can help when you're 50+ and notice ""spots"" popping up.",False,False

Because a lot of young and impressionable people want to be like you and if they think your disordered behaviors are normal, that’s gonna fuck them up",False,False

She has shown very ocd patterns. Applying sunscreen numerous amounts a day,covering herself from the sun in with those garments, like she has this fear of the sun. Some people have pointed out the childish like behavior she has.   I think more people are getting concerned that she’s now recommending what to eat in her recent what I eat in a day videos. I think she should be confronted.",False,True

YouTube has been ripping into her lately (unnatural vegan was the first one I saw, then assorted fitness youtubers, and most recently Abbey Sharp.)  That being said,, I hope she can seek help and improve her health quietly and without judgement online. She's clearly very intelligent and mindful of supplementation also.",False,False
