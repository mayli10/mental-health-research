I've had acid reflux for about 12 years and it's pretty bad but my teeth are still not destroyed. I wear my retainer over them so they don't get as much acid when I get acid reflux.  They're fucked tho lol. I don't think they're gonna be okay in a few years if the acidity issues don't go away.",False,False
