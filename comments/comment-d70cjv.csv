I used to feel really guilty about throwing away food but since I started doing it it's been getting easier and easier and comes almost naturally at this point. R.I.P to all those untouched high-cal dinners and even fruits I've taken a bite of in my trash can üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,False,False

At least you replaced them with something healthy! You should be proud of yourself. I know how you feel though, I always throw away junk food (and end up getting it out the trash late at night) so I've resorted to smashing them and pouring condiments on them so they taste gross (usually chocolate, lol).   It's cool dude, we all do weird crap when restricting/trying to avoid a binge. Just eat them when your brain lets you feel good about it so you don't end up hating what they represent xP",False,False
