Diagnoses are just labels suck on to help categorise the disease, but there are so many combinations and 'quirks' people have in their disorder that it's impossible to find nice neat labels for each any every one. Just because you haven't been diagnosed or feel like you're 'not bad enough' to fit a diagnosis doesn't mean you can't get help or say you have an eating disorder. Is food causing you stress? Do you have an unhealthy relationship with food, not eating when you're hungry, trying to get rid of food you've eaten, that kind of thing? Based on your post, I would answer yes. That's an eating disorder.  That being said... I am certain you can recover from this again. You seem to express how much you hate yourself and your body, those aren't healthy feelings, but they can push you to get help. Either way, I wish you the best. If you want to recover, I'm certain you can! You asked for advice on what to do, so I might suggest you start by opening up to people you know care about you? If you feel there is no one you can tell, you can always start by booking an appointment at a psychologist. You don't need to tell anyone, but it will be a massive step towards recovery.",False,False
