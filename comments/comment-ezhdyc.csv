Your boyfriend is with you for a reason- I know itâ€™s hard to see the positive qualities about ourselves. He could be attracted to your wit, your intelligence, your kindness, your beauty- all things that donâ€™t depend on whether youâ€™re antisocial at times! Iâ€™m sure that you have so many positive qualities, and taking time to spend alone isnâ€™t a negative quality in my opinion, itâ€™s just a personal preference.   I really relate to the casual eating jealousy- my classmates always eat during our lectures and I just watch with envy. Yesterday I took 3 peanut butter mnms from one of them and spent 30 minutes in a panic, no idea what class material I missed, meanwhile she ate the rest of the pack like it was nothing. I wish I could be that uncaring around food ðŸ˜ž",False,False
