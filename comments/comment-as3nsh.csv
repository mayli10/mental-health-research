I’ve been so stressed out recently, which has been making other mental health issues flare. The last thing I want is for this shit to come back and add to it. Just getting it out helps.   None of my friends get the whole ed thing so I rarely have someone I can just talk to about it. They’re quick to judge no matter what I say. Like “no you’re x, y, and z is [insert jealous adjective here]. anyway you’ve got no room to complain.” The minimization drives me up a wall. Tbh the only person that gets it is a friend with severe chrons and IBS.  Like... I have have fucking body insecurities that are just as valid regardless of how I look. ",False,True

It seems like you're surrounded by very competent and receptive experts and you're doing really well overall. I don't think you have to worry too much about relapsing unless you find you need to keep weighing yourself more now, in which case you can do as you have been and raise your concerns with your psych and doctor. Sorry, I'm just so amazed at how successful you seem to have been and how healthy your life sounds now! I don't know what could have caused the drop in weight, but it sounds like you said, maybe a combination of stress and medication. It seems like you have all the tools and help available to you to make up for it though, so I think you'll be okay if you keep handling it as you have been.   Can I congratulate you, is that okay? I'm so proud and happy for you! Maybe that's weird from a complete stranger. I hope the discomfort lessens or you find a way to counteract it somehow, maybe talking to your support team will help. You seem to be in a really good place though, and rough patches of course happen especially when outside stressors come into play. I don't know if this was the answer you were looking for, but I hope it helped somehow!",False,False

Eat when I’m hungry, balanced meals (got a sick organic farm hook up), snacks, walk my dog, hikes a few times a month. I think it’s likely related to stress as I’m officially unemployed now. I know I range between where I am to where I thought I was, but what’s getting me is how I’m seeing myself. I don’t see what the scale said and it’s making me uncomfortable.   Maybe it’s because where I am was a step to my final goal weight track I’d set for myself in high school (I’m 30 now).   A few years ago I found out I had a gluten allergy (not celiac but allergy) and it felt like I lost control of my body. It caused me to drop pounds very quickly while I was doing everything I could to revamp my diet. It wasn’t something I was doing to myself, more of a period of change, and my doctor said it was normal.   Further, I’ve been on atypical antipsychotics since May and those have been something to work around too. I haven’t experienced a gain from them, but I lose my appetite with them but my anxiety is gone (for the most part).  My psych said this is a reaction too so I’ve had to plan more snacks and all that. I’ve stayed relatively the same since May though.  Except when I had a weird reaction to a medication change and could only eat apples and protein bars for a week- (maybe a trigger warning for the rest of this statement) everything else felt like slime going down my throat. She saw me that week and changed my dosage immediately.   I’ve been sober from drugs and alcohol for six and a half years and from ed for five years.   My thoughts have been the same with my diet- what do I have access to in a given week? I work in the local food movement in my city and have access to amazing local and organic fruits and veggies my farmer friends grow so my diet consists of that and whatever snacks I have. It’s seasonal, local, and delicious. Occasionally pizza because it’s good and occasionally chocolate. Also because it’s good. But it’s balanced and I talk to my psych about it with med changes and stuff like that. I have one med that has a specific minimum calorie value I am to take it with otherwise it doesn’t absorb. The number bothered me that I had to consider calories in a meal, but she knows and I keep her updated.   Oof that was long. ",False,True

Stepping on the scale one time doesn't necessarily mean you've relapsed, but if it's part of a larger pattern of a return to your behaviors (or starting new ones), then it could be. How are you feeling?",False,False
