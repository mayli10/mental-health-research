I’m only happy when I’m ‘healthy’ it makes me feel so confident when I see the scale numbers drop. I’m in therapy but my parents don’t know about my eating issues, they only care because my sister pointed out how big my jeans are now they never even noticed the first couple times. It makes me happy when I know what I’m eating and how much healthier I’m being than I was before.",False,True

I have no idea who you are but I love you. You gotta learn to not give a fuck about these numbers, about how you look. So much more to life than calculating calories.",False,False
