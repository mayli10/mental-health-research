You WILL have larger and larger binges the more you purge (and the more you are able to get up as you do so). It sounds like your binges are already quite ""severe"" (not trying to be rude just making my own opinionated observation) and if you purge, your body will need more calories to feel the same level of fullness as you did tonight.  So, next time you want to purge, remind yourself, ""if I purge this the next binge will be bigger""  I'm sorry you're struggling so badly",False,False

Surprisingly it just doesn’t phase me because I always tell myself that I’ll “never get that bad”. Which we all know is a bunch of horse shit because this shit is addicting. My teeth are already fucked up from pregnancy vomiting so I know first hand how shitty it is :/ thanks for the words of encouragement,False,True

That poor girl, i didn’t want to end up like that, I believe her family released the photo to show others the potential reality, its VERY sobering.  Try your best not to go down the purge path if you can, as other have said once you start can be very hard to stop, in totally related news I’m going to the dentist today because my teeth are literally snapping in half, so glam! Don’t beat yourself up over having done it but please as someone who has been there done that its honestly not worth the physical mess it makes of Your body even if you don’t realise it at the time yes its fucking up so much inside you and you do Pay for it later",False,False

Once you open that door, it becomes a horrible battle to close it again. I still remember the first time I purged \~8 years ago, and I've been binging and purging ever since. It ruins your life in ways I can't describe. I feel enslaved to my disorder.   Absolutely follow up with getting a therapist when you can, maybe schedule an appointment in advance so that there are no delays. In addition, I recommend looking for an ED dietitian or even an ED IOP group to help you get on your feet. I feel like a dietitian can help you get into a healthier mindset that can allow for moderation of foods that you like. IOP is good for those who have busy lives whether they have full-time careers or children at home.   Let me know if you want to talk at all, you don't need to suffer alone.",False,False
