There‚Äôs definitely factors that play into things we go through that few others would really truly understand. If you need to vent or talk I‚Äôm here!,False,True

Even though I am consciously trying to do better, a lot of my disordered habits and thoughts remain.  It really is a long process, and one I don‚Äôt think will ever be over.  But you are also taking steps in the right direction üíú",False,False

It's difficult, but I'm glad you are at a healthier weight now, and that you're no longer suffering from the most extreme effects of an ED. Your health should always be a priority. Throw out those old pictures if you have to. Don't risk your life.",False,False

I know how that feels when you look at the old clothes, and it hurts, and I still keep mine too. I still struggle with anorexia, I didn‚Äôt want my heart to pop in the hospital or my feet to be amputated so I dropped my old ED and took back up all the habits I had before my diagnosis.  I still need that control and have that want to be small again but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever put myself in that much distress again.",False,True

I am moving and going through all of my old skinny clothes and it was really triggering.  When I was at my thinnest my health was nowhere near as poor as yours.  But I was constantly battling with fatigue, digestive issues, and of course falling apart mentally and emotionally.  I was suicidal and I have no idea how I got anything done at work.  Now I am ‚Äúrecovering‚Äù and honestly kicking ass at my career.  I have so much more energy and have even started having normal shits again.  I am still pretty slim, and more conventionally attractive.  But it hurts so fucking bad that those clothes don‚Äôt fit anymore.  It‚Äôs like a knife in my fat stomach.  I‚Äôm still holding onto them in hopes that one day I will hate myself enough to do it all over again.",False,False

But the pictures are only showing one second of an entire day. Of passing out when I stood up, throwing up water and gatorade until I was empty, having my legs buckle out from under me going up the stairs and so on.
