I want to be thin to be more fuckable. When I drink enough caffeine to kill a small mammal and yeet my food I don't pretend it's about health. If exercise and eating clean only made you healthier on the inside, most people wouldn't bother.",False,False

I mean, I certainly tried my best all the time acting like I was a little sunshine with no worry in the world while being full on depressed.  Having said that, your mother is toxic.",False,False

My mom is definitely not as toxic, but I notice how she seems prouder of me for being skinnier and I hate it. Also, she said yesterday that “You’re much happier now, I really think you were going through a depression thing there.” Gee, thanks for noticing and completely dismissing 3 awful years of my life like they were nothing. The only reason I’m not batshit depressed and suicidal is because of my ED taking up all my thoughts now.",False,False
