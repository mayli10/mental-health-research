Something similar is happening with my 11 y.o. cousin (his mom got very into keto and intermittent fasting and lost a lot of weight this year) who's started worrying about gaining weight and avoiding certain foods, and the few times I've babysat him over the last couple of months I've heard him mention being proud when he 'fasts' or skips meals.  Maybe talk about it with your parents (if they're the supportive type). I ELI5'd TDEE and how weight gain works to my cousin and it looks to have helped, but I would look into getting your brother to a therapist or maybe even a psychologist. It's so important for young children to get the proper nutrition and energy while they're growing, so I think it's better safe than sorry in this case.",False,False

I could down a family sized bag of chips and a carton of chocolate milk in minutes, but then i just stopped. Made myself dinner earlier than my parents so i could claim i was full, take the tiniest portions i could, even eat on the little kids plates so my serving looked bigger.  This very much sounds like the early signs of an eating disorder.",False,False
