Tell her you don’t feel comfortable talking about it that day if you genuinely don’t, but the reason you feel the need to restrict right now is just because you don’t want to express your feelings. Don’t! Easier said than done, always, but this is a person who is here to listen to you talk, about ANYTHING. Doesn’t have to be food, or anything diet wise, bring up family or good friends or even pets.  You always have the upper hand in therapy, you control what you talk about as long as you explain today’s not the day to talk about those topics, they won’t discuss, not in depth anyways.   I’m sure she’ll ask about your eating habits, any good therapist would, just know that she’s trying to watch out for you, not judge you.",False,False
