My whole adult life I was okay stomach wise. I never had stomach issues and even would say I had a pretty strong stomach. bingeing didn’t really give me that many problems.   Then slowly began the diarrhea, pain, aching, and  puking. Diarrhea almost every day. I was too embarrassed to go to a doc who would just tell me to stop eating - as if I didn’t have an ED. So I’m kind of assumed it would pass and it wasn’t thattttt bad... and then it got worse....and one night it was so painful that I couldn’t handle it and made my mom take me to urgent care. They ambulanced me to the hospital right away for emergency surgery. I didn’t even know what a gallbladder was!  Might be worth seeing a stomach doctor. Can’t hurt just to be safe. ",False,False

Did you experience diahrrea as well? ",False,True

Don’t want to scare you but if it starts to get really bad, just stop my an urgent care place. Can’t hurt!",False,False
