I remember desperately wanting to be able to purge for so long and finally working up to it and now it's second nature. but it's not!!! worth!! it!!!  try to address the binging (I know, easier said than done) instead of using this as a fallback for when it does happen - it'll just make you binge more and obviously you know purging doesn't just magically disappear the calories.  look into the consequences of it. I'm being a total hypocrite rn, but trust me it'll catch up to you at some point if you continue.  I wish you luck &amp; safety whether you follow this advice or not (bc of course it's incredibly difficult to do so w an ED).",False,False
