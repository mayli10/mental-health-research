It was just sad to see so many ppl commenting ‚Äúlol no Stephanie Buttermore is just binge eating‚Äù...like, it took me so long to let go of the voices telling me that.

My extreme hunger was so real @ the beginning, 4K calories was no prob bob, and I think that was a stage I NEEDED to go through to get my ‚Äúnormal‚Äù hunger back.  It‚Äôs sad that people think you can go from anorexia to eating normal with no problems. There are consequences to high restriction like that, and extreme hunger is one.

When I was recovering from AN and orthorexia I had extreme hunger that I actually listened to and it did not take me long for the hunger to regulate (similar to the ‚Äúall in‚Äù) but when I got BED it was from going back to restricting and binging instead of just eating normal. Compensating for binging with more restricting is what led to the BED.,False,False
