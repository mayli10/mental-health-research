I’ve upped my cals deliberately to 1500 after a rough few months and losing my period, and struggle almost hourly between my logical grownup voice (that knows that 1500 is a good choice because I workout a lot and was feeling dizzy and sick on less), and my brain feeling like a fat pig and wanting to cut to less, delay or restrict. I’m making myself eat half by 2pm each day, which feels awful, but I know is good for me.   I actually feel better, look better and am losing weight more smoothly on 1500 as I don’t binge like I do when I’m sub-1000, but I feel so illegitimate when I’m not hungry, and feeling full and fat is awful.    And I’m taking so many body shots each morning, so that I can look back in the afternoon/eve when I feel fat and awful, to remind myself it’s the dysmorphia talking and I’ve not put on 50 lbs.",False,False

I start to question if I even really have an eating disorder or if I'm just dieting like a normal person.  It doesn't matter that I've hated my body for 14 years, it doesn't matter that I get anxious and binge-y if I go even five calories over my limit, or that I low restrict for days to save calories for a binge. Nope, I must be just a regular old dieter, people with eds don't eat this much.",False,False

I feel like I need to be losing weight faster than normal dieters. I’ve settled on high restricting on days that I don’t fast lol but I can’t make myself do this every day.   I see what you mean about the all-or-nothing thinking.,False,True

Like, sure, 1k isn't going to make me gain. According to losertown, I'll be okay, but is that really restricting? Am I just a bulimic wannarexic who should stop even trying to restrict? Should I just digest no food and give in completely? These thoughts plague me constantly.",False,False

So, that means I have to be ‘fine’ snd shouldn’t feel like I’m struggling.    Which of course ignores the fact that I’ll go to the gym for a significant workout, meaning my net calories are pretty low. It ignores the fact that the amount of my time and energy and worry going toward calories/weight is not especially healthy. It ignores the fact that if it feels like a struggle, it *is* a struggle. It is real.",False,False

I just started restricting again after a while of eating normally/sometimes overeating and since I'm not used to restricting I'm starting higher and plan to get gradually a bit lower. But I restricted way lower in the past so now I definitely feel like I'm inadequate and I should stop eating too. The only reason I'm still eating higher calories though is because I'm scared that if I stop completely, my metabolism will screw up and then when I do eat I will put the weight back on. If I cut down a bit slower I feel like my body gets used to it and maintains any weight loss easier. Maybe that's totally wrong but that's what my ED brain tells me.",False,False
