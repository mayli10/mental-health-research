You shouldn’t have to deal with this. I don’t want to suggest anything unhelpful, but sometimes exercises and muscle building can radically alter the body to be more androgynous and provide some relief., independently of weight! There’s also shape wear. Again, I just wish people didn’t suck because it’s not on you to change a thing, but you gotta do whatever makes YOU FEEL safer and happier.",False,False

I've been morbidly obese my whole life and even though I could tell I was more of an hourglass than say, an apple or a pear, it didn't matter because I was so fat I didn't HAVE any figure. Even trying to cut out a silhouette I still looked straight up-and-down, from the front and side. Just like a marshmallow.  So now that I'm losing weight I'm realising that I have ENORMOUS fucking hips. I'm going to have a super, super hourglass figure even at my GW and for the first time I'm realising how much I don't... like... that. I'm never going to pass, I'm never going to look good in androgynous or masculine clothing, I'm feeling the bones in my hips for the first time and realising they are never ever going to be narrower than this. It's kind of terrifying. Like I don't want to be fat but I guess I wish I'd appreciated how much more androgynous my bodyshape was when I had a layer of padding around this child-bearing skeleton. Plus fat butches are hot AF so I wish I'd been comfortable exploring that a bit more :/",False,False

I'm a lesbian, not butch but definitely not very feminine, more outdoorsy/tomboyish, and I carry my weight pretty heavily in my butt/thighs/boobs but hate being sexualized (by men). A huge part of the appeal of losing weight for me at this point is trying to get rid of my 'feminine' curves and make it easier to hide my figure with baggy clothes.

I’m not trans but I sometimes wish to be a boy but I’m not sad about being a girl ( I like being a girl) does that makes sense?  Anyways, I have big boobs (DD boobs, size XS shirts) which have been the bane of my existence. If I don’t get my shirts/dresses well fit, I look bigger. If I get shirts/dresses tailored, I look too “glamorous.”  I used to bind my chest in high school but I read that will make your boobs sag. Scared the shit out of me and I promptly stopped.  I still fantasize about having a male body, sometimes having a dick too but mostly just have that male flat square upper body.
