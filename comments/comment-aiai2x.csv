From what I've come to understand it takes much longer for nutrients to be sufficiently absorbed through digestion. Typically the only time you would see something causing such a rapid change in a person's mood is if it were a chemical that is absorbed quickly in the stomach. This is usually only a common trait in medicine and drugs, not so much in ordinary food. I see that another user did bring up that fish contains a chemical called DHA. That seems more likely to be the cause of your improved mood.",False,False

That’s really awesome. :)",False,False
