Stopping purging was so hard for me but after a period of adjustment, it led to reduction (and eventually cessation) of binging. I not only improved my skin, teeth, hair, and overall health and appearance, but I also saved myself a lot of money.   Between the money saved on binge food, dental work (a guaranteed part of any purger's future the longer they purge), and skincare/cosmetics to cover what purging does to your face and hair, it totals to a significant amount.   Real talk: my weight is up from when I was purging, but that's not the whole story. I was bingeing so ravenously after a period of being underweight that even though I was purging, my rate of weight gain was rapid. Now that I'm not binging or purging, my weight is more stable. I believe that long term, stopping purging doesn't contribute to weight gain because it ultimately reduces bingeing.  However you proceed, I wish you the best of luck and health. Trust yourself. You can do this.",False,False

Try to put into perspective how much future good it will do if you manage to stop purging now. Many people who have purged for a while get major dental issues (e.g. abscesses, sores and tooth loss), and that there trachea and oesophagus gets eroded by their stomach acid.  You can do this. Stopping purging doesn't equal weight gain, but it does equal better health prospects. Yes it won't be easy but people have done it in the past, and so can you! You've got this, stay strong! ðŸ’ªðŸ’•",False,False

Think of it as a step towards stopping the problem at its source.   If you stopped purging, your skin and teeth will look and be healthier. Your heart will be healthier. You will have a lower chance of causing yourself permanent damage.",False,False
