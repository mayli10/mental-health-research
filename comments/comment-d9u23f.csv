Takes a long time to sip through it all and keeps you hydrated, so win-win! My method gives you more of a wine flavored seltzer, but you could always use less seltzer to bring forth more of the richness of the wine.  This helps me feel like I'm drinking a lot of wine without actually doing so, but also fills me up to avoid drunchies.   Of course- sometimes you just gotta drink a whole bottle and eat some Oreos and carne asada fries too because, hormones, lol.",False,False
