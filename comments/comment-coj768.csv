In judging myself and others, I guess I think of ""perfect"" as more of a score, rather than a singular 'perfect' body type. You can be perfectly stick thin, or perfectly thicc, or perfectly hourglass, whatever. Think about all the celebrities that the world universally celebrates as attractive -- they don't all look EXACTLY the same. Sure there are patterns -- hip to waist ratio, within the range of 'acceptable' body fat %, overall 'healthy' looking (even if they're actually not). But there is some diversity, especially nowadays. Two different people can both be widely viewed as a 10/10, and look very different from each other.  This sounds like a good thing, but unfortunately even with 'perfection' being a range, it's still unattainable for most people. Most people have at least a few physical traits that hold them back from that, or even from being the most attractive version of themselves.   And despite all the recent hype about ""thicc"" and big butts, I think the real truth is that slightly thin-ish women with a small waist have been considered attractive for at least the past 70-80 years (at least in America) and that still holds true today. That body type in particular just doesn't really go out of style. Sure other ideals come and go, but it does feel like that's the one basic type that will always be considered attractive.",False,False

I‚Äôve always had disproportionally thick hips and thighs for my body and I‚Äôve hated them with a passion since I was young. I grew up with the Kate Moss idealized body and it‚Äôs burned into my brain that that is perfection... so seeing people facetune their hips wider is just mindblowing.",False,False
