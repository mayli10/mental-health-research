You can speak anecdotally about what has worked for you, but be careful with wording that implies you know what is best for folks with ED's- we don't know everyone's specific circumstances and triggers so it may not suit them. I know you've put a disclaimer at the end but giving unsolicited medical/nutrition advice can be very triggering for people.  (having said that I can say that a low carb diet has helped me in the past! Just not sure if this post was the right time or place to share your perspective)",False,False

You posted the exact same copy paste text wall to someone else as well. I didn’t ask for nutrition advice, I’m vegetarian and not interested in keto. I’d rather die than eat a fucking ramekin of straight cream, it’s almost like I have an eating disorder and that’s a wild thing to come in and recommend especially if you’re saying you don’t have an ED yourself??  I don’t think it’s appropriate to tell someone the ‘benefits’ of fasting in an ED sub and then cover your ass by saying ‘oh but totally don’t fast though’ at the end. Like if you had the forethought to think ‘hmm better not recommend that’ why not just not bother writing it? Or would it be too much effort to remove from your spam script?   Ohh silly me I should just eat to satiety, i’m cured, who needs mental health support when keto magic has me covered. ",False,True

I've been going around here probably contrariwise to the rules saying that the golden rule is to eat for nutrient density. Counting macros MAY be useful, but if it causes you to become anxious, don't bother counting. This sort of rule is naturally going to steer you towards things like eggs, meat, fish, cheese, liver, and nonstarchy vegetables. The calories per gram is high but you don't need to eat much to feel full because it's all protein and fat, not carbohydrate (which for some people has an orexigenic (makes you eat more) effect).  If you wind up bingeing, it'd be more of the same, with a bias towards truly indulgent things like clouted cream (place whipping cream (has to be 33%+) in a ramekin, and bake at 195F for more than 3 hours - more than 12 if the ramekin is large. It's a pudding on its own once you're stabilised on a real-food animal based diet, even if not mixed before cooking with sweetener and maple extract as I once did). By the way, you can incorporate that into a meal plan, not just a binge. Don't think for a second that I'm trying to encourage bingeing. I am just giving you a recipe from Britain that really works well with a low carb diet if used contrariwise to its intended purpose.  _CONSIDER CAREFULLY_ (weigh the benefits of accelerating the clearance of visceral fat against the likelihood of developing worse DEB) a two to three day water-and-salt (really, coffee, tea, hot chocolate sweetened with a noncaloric sweetener, anything that isn't sugary is okay) fast after eating a bit of liver and greens, to let the system cycle through a bit. If you're O.W. you shouldn't have a big issue physically with a couple day fast, but before commencing the fast promise yourself you will break it with something nutritious in a small portion (to prevent refeed syndrome) and then the next day eat something nutritious in a normal portion. __Given the history of ED you have, I would not recommend a fast.__ If you think you have it in you to do it without a relapse, it can be a powerful tool for blowing out the cobwebs. However, most of the benefits can be derived simply by ensuring that what you eat is all high in nutrients and unprocessed.  Right now you should want to focus on proper nutrition, so eat to satiety. On this kind of diet, if you are insulin resistant, that will rapidly clear.",False,False
