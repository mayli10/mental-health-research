By definition, being triggered is having a stimulus incite your pathology (ed). No pathology? Then nothing to get triggered.  Even if your restrictive eating goads others into a one-time restriction themselves, they've not been triggered – just perhaps made aware of their likely over-indulgent habits. Your example, healthy or not, may have given them an overdue wakeup-call. High-five yourself…",False,False

The last time I was out with friends I forced my self to eat a giant plate of fries and a veggie burger so everyone would feel comfortable but then I felt so shitty. It fucking sucks but there is not middle ground.,False,True

I try not to bring up my ED or BDD because then if he notices I'm not eating or if I'm genuinely not hungry he becomes concerned and upset. I feel guilty, he says ""I just want to share a meal with you"" and it breaks my heart. We do go out to eat quite frequently because I hate cleaning up messes after cooking and the stove at his house is busted.   He usually ends up eating what I can't finish, then I'm violently hungry later because I couldn't convince myself to eat more of my own food.  But on the flip side if I clear all three of my tacos I get the ""oh you must've been hungry!"" I hate it when people comment on how much I ate.",False,False

She has PCOS and struggles with her weight and it is a big insecurity of hers. Whenever we eat together she either tries to force me to eat more (i.e. buying me a treat or ordering a pudding for me), or she really cuts down on what she eats.  Like one time we went to a restaurant. I am pretty sure she picked the place to force me to eat more. I am vegetarian and all the veggie options were pasta, pizza, or burgers. She insisted I ordered first so I got a tomato pasta with salad not chips. Then she orders a meat STARTER for a main....   I love the girl to death but I nearly snapped watching her pick at those seven grilled prawns while I ate pasta.",False,False

I as a result, things like group trips always come with an undertone of ED competition/behavior awareness. Not sure if there is anything I can do about it, besides be more secretive or be recovered. When I was recovered it was almost worse because I felt like an impostor/all the terrible things. I also get triggered extremely easily, and a lot of times I do it on purpose. Nasty cycle, but I can't say I hate it.",False,False

My boyfriend now counts his calories and kinda suggests that he also get tiny meals now too. My roommate also eats a lot of cookies/etc but has now stopped when I'm near her which I feel weird about too. I have asked them both if I'm causing them to eat less (at least around me) and they said no, but I think they think I'm judging them even though I'm not. 100% feel you on this one.",False,False
