At my school there were teacher's pets, some kind of bias towards a student.  I used to get bit parts that sucked because the good roles went to the ones who were academically gifted.  If you don't do out of school drama activities then you should.  Don't give up on it.  Some day you get good stuff you deserve, it's just waiting that's the hard part.  I know it won't mean much to you, but I admire your dedication and work ethic.  Seriously, if you've got that you shouldn't give up something you love.  Hope the new year throws something amazing your way...life's can do things like that but it's aaalllll sooooo randommmm :/",False,False

I remember adults saying it was sooo good for a high school show... I bet they say that at every high school though lol. I do remember being pretty impressed considered how complex the show is. To be honest I can't really tell you more because I was only in 8th grade and this was 10+ years ago! But I will say I fell in love with the music so much as a result and still listen to it all the time. Hell I've already got Castle in a cloud stuck in my head since reading your post 5 minutes ago lol,False,False
