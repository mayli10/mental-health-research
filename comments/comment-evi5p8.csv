I woke up and talked to my friend in the phone for a while and started writing a song. Oh and ate some vegan chick'n nugs. F. I'm feeling tired and dreading work  That's a tough question, but no. I like being a woman, I like having P in V sex with dudes... the gender dysphoria I'd feel in a guy's body wouldn't be worth it",False,False

Never going to let myself be home alone for the rest of the week. There is a world to save, I can’t let this happen.  Really enjoy being a guy but 5 million means I’d never need to work or really do anything I don’t want to. I’d take the money finish school and take a gap year to get the binge eating figured out.   Sorry about the late post, had a rough day.  Good luck everyone!",False,True
