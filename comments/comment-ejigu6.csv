Eating disorders can affect anyone, don’t think that you don’t belong because you don’t fit a certain “stereotype”.  If you need someone to talk to you can message me",False,False

There will be people that understand your feelings.  My eating disorder wasn't based on body image either. My mom died. I ran away into a relationship that was toxic and left me feeling like nobody cared about me (my biological family certainly didn't), so I turned to controlling my body. It seemed like my only option, the only thing I had that couldn't be taken away from me.  Maybe not a helpful response, but people here do care. You are welcome here.",False,False

Also not everyone purges, some people exercise, restrict etc etc. Again ED comes in many different forms.  Same as sex, men can have ED and their problems are no more or less valid than a woman's struggle.  I suggest you try and get help, a psychologist or talk to your psychiatrist (I assume you have one as you're taking anti-psychotics).",False,False
