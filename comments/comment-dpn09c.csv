I got to a new LW then decided to start eating because idk a treat? &amp; I’m a dumbass? But yeah I didn’t gain any weight at all for a few days &amp; then I started crazy binging like you said probably several thousand calories daily (mostly of creamy PB &amp; homemade bread lmao). Little more than a  week goes by &amp; I shit you not I gained 10 lbs.,False,False
