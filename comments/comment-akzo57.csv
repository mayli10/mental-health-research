Maybe if she has an ED she is curious about people who show ED behaviours too (just like I am). I dont know, let's see how it goes but definitely I try to brush it off as many times as possible! The good thing is that she knows I used to be vegan so I can justify a lot of choices with that, which is an actual explanation and not related to disordered eating. ",False,True

You could just say you're doing that. When she asks about your nutrients you could be like ""gee idk I don't really think about it. You're really into this nutrition stuff!""   I'd also turn a lot of this around on her. ""how do you make sure you get your nutrients in?"" Shit like that.
