It does depend on how much you weight and your height, but it seems kinda impossible to gain 1kg of fat in 1 week while eating around 1000-1500kcal. Water weight, food weight, even if you haven't pooped recently will make it look like you gained. Also, even if that 1kg is actually fat - that doesn't mean that your thigh gap would disappear.",False,False
