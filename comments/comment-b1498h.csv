You can see a clear relationship with my grades and my eating disorder from when it developed around age 9-10. In high school I had no energy to study or concentrate, combined with ADHD and a chaotic home life and it’s surprising I graduated at all.   I feel like I’m doing okay now but I do wonder as well about it all. I had some big goals I didn’t achieve. ",False,False

My relationship with my BF would be more meaningful. Maybe I'd even be married with a kid. I'd be volunteering in the community more. Heck, maybe I'd be teaching at a university or college. Maybe I'd be a homeowner. Or taking international vacations.   &amp;#x200B;  I wouldn't have my cat because I got her from another patient I met in treatment, lol.",False,False

I'd probably be planning my college graduation along with the rest of my friends. Possibly studying abroad (because I wouldn't have failed everything last year thanks to my food obsession). I'd probably be writing my thesis on something totally unrelated to biochem or nutrition (which is what I would do now if I could because lol what else is there in life). I would have some money saved up because I wouldn't have spent it on food related shit. Yeah fitting a smaller size is definitely not worth the trouble but then again it's not really about that, is it",False,False

Yeah, I probably would've been. I lived in the Midwest surrounded by overweight family, and their habits were hard to break away from.  Now I live on the west coast and I hit my lowest adult weight this morning. I'll take it.",False,False
