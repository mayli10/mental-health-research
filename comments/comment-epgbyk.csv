People are like ""I skipped breakfast and I just had coffee!"" and then you find out it was like 400+ calories for their extra-syrup-pump venti mocha with extra whip.

When your on healthy eating plans or mall prepping you macro count really well and its obvious how off many people are in their assumed intake.
