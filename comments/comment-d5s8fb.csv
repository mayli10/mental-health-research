I mainly lurk on here so I don‚Äôt come for the camaraderie. I also don‚Äôt really feel alone. i go on here specifically to get myself through fasts, prevent binging, and stick to my calorie goal.",False,False

One week ago, I was lonely, bored, browsing this subreddit almost 24/7 and my mental health was shit and all thoughts were ED related.  This week, my bff has been staying with me. I've had no time to go on reddit, let alone browse this sub, and we've been doing other stuff, so my thoughts are not so ED related thoughts and I feel so much better!!",False,False

A small part of me was visiting them solely to get triggered (but most of me just desperately needed to feel less alone).   Since those years, my mental and interpersonal boundaries have gotten much more robust. I choose not to be triggered here, and so I am not. What DOES trigger me is feeling alone. Like, my ED has been a secret since its birth. I've never been in recovery.I have literally no normies irl or online that I can talk to about my ED (and even if they knew, I wouldn't want to talk to them, bc I'm sorry but normies just don't get it). So yeah, I need some company. When ProED went down, I relapsed like crazy bc I was so upset, and had nowhere to express my socially unacceptable ED thoughts.  I do think it would be hard not to be triggered by these spaces if you are still a teen, or otherwise pretty emotionally vulnerable. But for many people here, the triggers are the tradeoff for having a sense of place, and I will *never* condemn someone for wanting that. I made that tradeoff for years, and I'd probably still make it if I lost my ability to ignore triggers here.",False,False

It‚Äôs just so easy to spiral while being constantly reminded of the disorder as opposed to times when I‚Äôm not on reddit and spending my time doing literally anything else.   But I totally agree with the validation of this being a sickness. No one else seems to get it- or talk about it in the open.   My heart goes out to you, love.",False,True

I‚Äôm a bit (a lot) competitive, and I essentially see everyone else as someone I have to be better than- I‚Äôve just *got* to lose more weight than them, be lighter, be smaller, be sicker. I‚Äôve got to *win*.   And it keeps me in the mindset. Keeping a constant flow of ‚Äúdisordered‚Äù thoughts keeps my focus on being disordered. Almost like it ends up inspiring me to restrict harder, lose more, push my limits. Gives me new ideas and things to try.   BUT- places like this (*pours one out for ProED*) did force me to recognize that what I‚Äôm doing to myself is *fucking crazy* on so many levels. That goddamn, I‚Äôm *sick*. And to be honest, I‚Äôm pretty confident that facing those things actually helped me take the steps to recover. Otherwise, I would‚Äôve been in denial about the whole thing. Or never gather the strength to do it.   In the end, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs probably mostly not the healthiest place in the world, and as much as I detest it- I can understand why places like ProED and the like got banned. I loved it, it was my home; but goddamn was that home built to either abandon or die in.",False,False

I don‚Äôt really care what others are doing and don‚Äôt feel any competition. Of course I get food ideas and whatnot through these forums, but I usually just do my own thing, and figure stuff out on my own. I also haven‚Äôt picked up disordered eating specifically through these sites. Like I did c/s bc I was all ‚Äúwhy swallow hehe‚Äù and then I found out other people also did it. And I‚Äôve been on these sites for 4-5 years and I‚Äôve never purged and don‚Äôt have a desire to.
