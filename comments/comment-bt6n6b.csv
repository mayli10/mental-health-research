And it has a bug where sims lose weight overnight, the game constantly makes sims superskinny. The game is really a major ED trigger.

It always makes me worry about my own macros and their importance while I am really working on letting that go. Sooo.. Thesimsmobile is a bit eating disordered.",False,False
