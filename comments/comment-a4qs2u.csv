When it's down I always pull it all over to one side of my neck if that makes sense. If I let it fall on each side of my head it just looks pathetic. Lol.

When I was growing up I saw magazines and the VS fashion show and celebs on the red carpet and movies as examples of how to be ""perfect"" or whatever, and it was bad enough to be influenced by ""just"" those things!

And social media just adds to it and is in our face constantly, so eventually it just feels like the new ""normal"" or ""average."" And these influencers are great at making it look so effortless and carefree.   At least it seems like most people realize it's not realistic. I love that subreddit r /instagramreality. It's helped a little. I'm also glad that I'm not a model or an influencer so I don't feel that intense pressure to look totally flawless and post perfect photos all the time on Instagram.

Yea I'm sure that's a relief he doesn't have Instagram! Mine does, but he's a little older than me and definitely knows how doctored up everything is on there. So that's nice.
