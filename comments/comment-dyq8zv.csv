They would always have 3-4 amazing looking desserts in a few locations, and cookies in a few locations. There was no way to get food without having to look at them and it was torture because there would always be at least 1 that I wanted so bad",False,False

For me it amounted to a total waste of money, since I wouldn't allow myself to enter the dining hall at all, and just bought food off campus. At least mine expired after the first year...do they ever let you cancel yours?",False,False

This is required for second years too and i might try to negotiate something with them about not getting the unlimited plan for next year,False,True

Like the unlimited meal plan gives you 4 meal swipes (so its technically not unlimited lol idk why they call it that) and one meal swipe can get you 1 entry into any dining hall, which are all buffet style and you can even bring in a to-go container LMAO, or 1 entree+2 sides+1 drink at any of the grab and go places. I did the grab and go thing just now and got a personal pizza (1 entree) and cookies + bread (1 cookie is one side and 2 slices of bread is one side and i also had a cookie in my backpack from yesterday (ALSO a bagel + cream cheese is also a side and I usually get that but they didnt have any at the time that i went in so i got 2 slices of toast instead)) and i just got an empty coffee cup (counts as 1 drink) to chew and spit in. Also you can use flex points, which we get every semester, to buy stuff like candy or ramen or whatever. I used some to buy the chocolate bar.",False,True
