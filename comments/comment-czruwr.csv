Which is why I said it’s not good if you feel life you’re forcing yourself to drink more. If you’re just drinking plenty of water you’re fine. It’s when your body starts to say no basically, when you start physically forcing yourself to drink more, that its dangerous.",False,False

But it all depends on the person, what you’re eating, activity level, etc.  Basically so long as you don’t feel like you’re *physically* forcing yourself to down more water, you should be good.",False,False
