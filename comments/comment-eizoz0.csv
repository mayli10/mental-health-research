There's a reason food has been given so much importance in our society, and why it's often given as a gift or as a symbol of love. It's because we're genetically hardwired to place importance on food. Food was a scarce resource for early humans, and willingly sharing your resources with another person WAS a big deal. It was a great show of respect and vulnerability.  I think we're still hardwired to place that importance on receiving or gifting food, even if it's not as scarce any more. And when we fall into disordered eating mindset, that gets turned up to 11, because suddenly food DOES feel like a scarce, sacred resource again. We covet it and it's so rare that we get food we feel we are ""allowed"" to eat, for one reason or another, that it's natural to place great significance on the circumstance or person from which we received it.  You're not pathetic or embarrassing at all. You are a human surviving in an anti-human world. You are truly not alone in feeling deprived of social interaction, in a world where social interactions have become so commodified, and you're far from the only person in the world who's turned to transactional interactions like ordering coffee in order to communicate with another person. The way our society is structured right now makes it very difficult to get it from anywhere else if you don't happen to already have existing connections from earlier in your life - and it's so, so easy to fall between the cracks of support networks when you're raised in an abusive household.  You know what, though?  You survived that.  You obviously enjoy and respect food more than the average person would. As someone who enjoys cooking for others, even strangers, you're the exact person I want to eat my food. It's my dream to run a cafe or restaurant some day and I would be honoured to serve someone like you, so I hope going forward in 2020 you can enjoy food that's been lovingly prepared for you knowing that you deserve it.  And I know it's not the same as face-to-face interaction but you can talk to us any time ðŸ’– the EDAnonymous community on Peach is great for pseudo-anonymous social interaction on your own terms.
