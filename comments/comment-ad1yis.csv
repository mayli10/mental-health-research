My best friend doesn‚Äôt comment on my weight whatsoever because she knows about my issues and my family will either tell me that I‚Äôm looking too thin (when I lose) or that I‚Äôm looking much healthier (when I gain).

I wish i could just wake up thin and have everyone think I was always like this. To me it's just another vicious reminder of how attractiveness plays a big role in how others interact with you, and that my friends monitor my appearance and make judgements. The comments feel worse if I have lost weight in an especially unhealthy way. My brain says ""see?? People reward thinness however it's achieved. It's never about #health""   I used to detest it so much it could send me into a binge cycle. I've gotten to the point where I just acknowledge the comment/compliment as blandly as I can and then quickly change the topic.  ",False,False

Of course the part of my brain that wants to be thinner and noticed as such is excited. I   But a big part of me is also pissed off.

But emotionally, it feels like they prefer me to have an eating disorder to fit their asthmatic preferences.  And I honestly I would love to tell them all to go fuck themselves. If you know nothing about my medical history, my health goals, etc you have no right to comment on my body and what you think of it. You don‚Äôt know how I lost the weight or what I‚Äôm going through right now. What if I had cancer or some serious medical problem? What if I‚Äôm undergoing a major life stressor, a death in the family, etc.? Nobody except my freaking mom and husband has ever expressed concern...it‚Äôs always praise.
