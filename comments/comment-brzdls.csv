My mom had a normal lookin face in her late 20s all thru her 30s. Maintained a low healthy weight. Hit her 40s and now??? Cheekbones for days, chiseled af jaw. It definitely looks much better than a thin face that comes from lack of food (my face has been thinning out but I just look like I'm decaying or some shit stg)",False,False

Like everything pops without looking too thin. Itâ€™s one of the only things I like about myself. So itâ€™ll get better eventually.,False,False

If I could gain some weight and be assured it'd go to my face, I'd do it right away.  I'm saying that when before I looked like a hag I had a round face.  It's really THE thing I want to aim for.  I had this guy ask me did I know where he could get some heroin while I was at the seaside.  Confirmed meth face and it's really made me unhappy since.  Unnatural (ie ED) skinny face really isn't good.  My mum's and her side all have these delicate features which I ENVIED, but...even weight loss didn't make my round face look tiny.",False,False
