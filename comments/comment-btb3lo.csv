It was mostly just venting but it’s good to hear it from someone other than myself. I tell myself that same thing every time I have this conversation with myself but still don’t listen which makes it all the more frustrating. I just am so fed up with myself, you know?",False,True

I'm not going to eat anymore later so might aswell keep on going, I NEED to eat these things now otherwise I can't have them again in god knows how long. Have you tried telling yourself, hey it's ok I can have this tomorrow instead! I don't need to eat it all rn, there are many more days to eat these things.  Unsolicited advice, please ignore it if you just wanted to vent.",False,False
