I can’t believe how quick the road is back to these obsessive food thoughts, and the need for control and to be empty. My “rock bottom”, even though objectively isn’t bad at all, was realizing how quickly I’m back here... after being ok for so long.",False,False

The number was not only way off but almost 15 pounds lower than my actual weight. Instead of making me happy, it scared the fuck out of me because I’m trying so so so hard to manage this disorder. :///   Oh and a few weeks ago I went to the doctor and wanted to cry because she didn’t acknowledge my eating disorder and all my labs came back fine. LOL.    Recoverylapsing is such a difficult slope.",False,False
