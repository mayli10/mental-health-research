Not sure if you’re looking for advice or not but if you are,  Maybe you could sit down and have a calm discussion with him. Maybe while cuddling in bed? About how you know he means well but this disorder is a nightmare and when he does xyz things even though you know he means it cute and lovingly that your brain twists it and makes it upsetting. That should be a good starting point to slowly address things and hopefully he’ll be open to helping you by being more mindful of his actions. You could try giving him an alternate form of affection that you would genuinely appreciate.",False,False
