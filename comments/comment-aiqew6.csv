I'm not trying to make too many opinions since it was my first time. She did have a bunch of weird, corny quotes everywhere like ""just be happy"" or ""depression is just anger without motivation."" Which is fine. Just struck me as odd since most offices I've been to are more... idk dull.   I'm not sure if she specializes in eating disorders. On her website it lists that it's one of the things she works with, but I'm not sure if that's the same thing as specializing in it.   You're right. She gave me the diet and exercise recommendation because it'll alleviate some stress, and in turn supposedly help with my ED. ",False,True

I had a counselor give me similar advice and it was so unhelpful. I am working in this field now I can confirm she has no authority to give you dietary advice unless she has specialized training in eating disorders and/or is a dietician. She is literally pulling this out of her ass/giving you her personal opinion which is not the job of a therapist.   Qualifications for counselors/therapists vary widely and so does quality unfortunately. I think it is possible to see a therapist who doesn’t specialize in EDs (I am doing so right now) but they need to be aware of their own limits as a provider and know what they can help you with and not. Someone who doesn’t specialize in EDs can help with the behavioral aspect of the disorder but shouldn’t be telling you what to eat. ,False,False

I would be cautious about a therapist that gives you direct diet and exercise advice/directives. Therapists aren’t dieticians and aren’t trained in these areas so they really shouldn’t be telling you how to eat or exercise ,False,False

It takes a lot of strength to go through with seeking out professional help for this bitch of a disorder. I love doing yoga and Pilates. It’s really nice once you get in the hang of it. I think yoga definitely helped my posture and toned up my arms/chest. It also feels good to do yoga when you’re feeling full. It helps with the digestion (somehow) but it helps center me and sit with the feeling of being full. ,False,False
