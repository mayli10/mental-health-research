I had made it all the way up to the counter and was attempting to pay for whatever I was mailing, but the damn card reader was taking too long. I clung on to the counter and said something like, ""I need to sit down,"" or ""I think I'm going to faint."" Next thing I knew, some strangers were peeling me up off the floor...     It was fucking terrifying. You say it won't make you stop, but do you find the fear of a recurrence giving you pause in anyway? For instance, I'm at a certain point now where I'm afraid to go off hiking on my own, or for a solo drive out to the coast... anywhere I'm alone, in nature, and can't rely on good cell service in case of emergency. I would love to go off adventuring by myself, and I don't have friends accompany me, but I'm just scared of the unpredictability.",False,False

I've passed out once before and it really is terrifying. It must've been especially scary for it to happen in school.   Though this reminds me, a few years ago a girl in my class was presenting and she passed out. I think the school just sent her home and it wasn't too big of a deal. She was pretty thin, but I didn't know if she had an ED for sure.",False,False

My first time passing out was when I was 17, working at a fast food restaurant. I started getting tunnel vision, and before I knew what was happening I had passed out in front of all my coworkers and customers.  Like you, this also wasn't a wake up call for me at the time, and I passed out several more times when I was at my worst before I started to get better for unrelated reasons.  If it's any consolation, from my experience, after passing out the first time I was able to recognize the symptoms of what was happening to me. So for future episodes I was able to get myself to a safe space before anything bad happened. So if this ever happens again, maybe you'll recognize that you need to take action before you get to the point of actually passing out.",False,False

I have come close to fainting plently of times in the middle of class. I remeber my head swinging forward and my teacher asked me to answer a question and my brain just stopped. It was so embarrsingðŸ˜¶,False,False
