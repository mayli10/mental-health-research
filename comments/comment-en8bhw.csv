Like I do not allow myself to fail or I’ll be stressed about it forever. I *need* to be the best at what I do. I *need* to be skinny because I want to be perfect. All because I don’t want people to look at me and see a ugly, fat failure. I wish I was one of those people who genuinely did not give af about other people. I can’t even eat in front of people because everyone always has something to say :( I wish people would just leave others alone.",False,False

I had to tell my work a bit about my ED stuff because at its worst it was affecting my ability to do my work, which was horrible in itself. I have understanding employers so they made adjustments etc, but I now feel like if I eat anything at work or put on any weight they'll think I'm a total fraud so it's a vicious cycle",False,False

It's like even if I eat something small, they are all judging me and thinking about how much of a fat pig I am. I stopped eating at school because of this and now just say I'm fasting..",False,False
