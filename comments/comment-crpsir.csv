The college friend developed alcoholism over the year (really scary finding water bottles with vodka in her van that she drove developmentally disabled adults around in for her job). I announced my intent to move out at the end of the lease a few months beforehand for a job in a different state. Day before I moved out my roomie got aRrested for DUI and lost her license. Her older sister said I was ‚Äúreally fucking them over‚Äù bitch really???,False,False
