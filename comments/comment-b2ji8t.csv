Especially the failing at life part, I can’t focus on how much I’ve fucked up my future if I’m too busy overthinking what I’ll be eating next, or not eating next. I miss having dreams and things to actually look forward to that are not food. ",False,False

How long can I got without food? What foods are best Calorie/satiation ratio? What foods are safe? What foods are scary? When will I eat next? What will I eat next?    As long as I'm preoccupied with these things I don't have time or energy to focus on how much I hate myself/want to die/how much I'm failing at life/anxiety in general.   Of course when I'm restricting I ALSO can't focus on improving any parts of my life. Ugh.  ,False,False
