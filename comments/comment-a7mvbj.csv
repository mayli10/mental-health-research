Other things include the last time I visited and we attended a wedding together, I met his whole family and we had dinner at his parents house, and we talk like EVERY day. But I'm in the friend zone? Lol. I feel like I get the girlfriend treatment and an awful big time commitment from him you feel me. Even from the other side of the country lol  But again, I know I'm friendzoned so it's whatever I guess RIP",False,True

It get's messier if crushes are developing... and/or if people in the friend group are judging each other and ascribing respect/kindness based on looks that a bit of an unhealthy dynamic IMO, so even seeing you say the phrase ""but I know how they look comparatively"" irks me, personally.
