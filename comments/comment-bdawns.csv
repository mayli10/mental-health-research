I never liked salty food  before . After 3  months or so though the seven lbs in water weight fell off and I went back to normal! I honestly feel like losing weight is easier now, but idk that might also be bc I had PMDD, so pre period cravings were super bad on many levels.",False,False

It's not for everyone but I love it! Insertion was mostly painless for me, had a bit of spotting but went to work after. I spotted for the first few months but I've had it almost 2 years now and haven't had a period since. I'm going to get the 5 year one next, assuming my gyno OKs it.  Pros: - I don't need to take a pill or anything - Ideal effectiveness = practical use effectiveness - No periods!!!  Cons: - The doctor left the strings to long and they poked my boyfriend a few times. It was no big, I went back and she cut them shorter. - Spotting for a few months. - Results may vary. For example, some people find insertion more painful, a small percentage of people still ger periods. - in the very rare case you do get pregnant, there is a higher chance of an ectopic pregnancy.",False,False

I’ve used it 6.5 years with 0 issue. 3 patches a month plus a period. You change it once every week for 3 weeks. It’s super easy and works well. (With no history of blood clots in your family.)  I maintained weight and even lost for yearssss. Hit mid 20’s and got fat (also purged less because I’m an idiot). But anyways - yes. The patch is great. Switched from the pills after 3 years and won’t ever look back,False,False
