But when I'm alone... Boy you bet I'm going to weigh out my lettuce to the gram and even weigh my toast because I don't trust the same calories in each slice rule. Lol",False,False

Homecooked meals or meals that aren't labeled stress me the fuck out and I end up tracking a tuna sandwich as 900kcal just to be safe. Since I can't openly weigh everything my parents cook me for dinner, I never know the calories and end up purging out of fear.",False,False

Calculated cookie calories and... well I need to fast for a week now. They were... BAD. Homemade is bad.,False,False

Sadly I’m on fairly low restriction so it’s really hard to find safe foods; rn it’s just pickles and siracha that I feel are safe,False,False

It’s like 200-300 calories depending on how much I have. Perfect thing to eat before one of my dance classes because I have enough carbs to function but work off most of the calories. Favorite safe food lately tbh.,False,False

But Ive recently discovered fasting. So I had 600 by noon yesterday, and just didnt eat until bedtime snack. The key is long periods of no nutrition, not necessarily at a deficit. But ended at like 1000 for the day. My goal today is to go for the full 16 hours without eating any carbs or sugars.",False,False
