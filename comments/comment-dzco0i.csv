And you can donate back every once in a while of the stuff you donâ€™t wear a lot anymore. You can actually find good stuff but you have to go often. They also have a great selection of large oversized sweaters and shirts to hide in all winter if thatâ€™s your thing. But fr ive found brand new name brand stuff for $5 at goodwill.,False,False

It stops me from eating beforehand, because then I'll feel disgusting trying on anything, and also stops me eating afterwards, because I get so excited about wearing a cute new outfit.    Downside is this was definitely a problem for me a few years ago when I went overboard with clothes purchases. No debts or anything, but I felt awful contributing to the problem with 'fast fashion' and having too many clothes. I've got that under control now as I've set hard limits to how many new pieces I can buy, but be warned about that possibility and financial aspects.    Other things I do all involve satisfying vanity in other ways, like giving myself a manicure, skincare pampering, trying new hairstyles. Exercising is another good idea, but I'm hesitant to recommend it because it can be dangerous if you've been fasting for an extended period of time, so perhaps only try something light like yoga. That can help clear your mind too.",False,False

Another thing I do is go clothes shopping- if Iâ€™m trying on outfits Iâ€™m def not gonna wanna be eating but depending on how you feel about your body this might make you feel bad which could lead you to binging later on",False,False
