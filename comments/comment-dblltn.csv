So ofcourse u will binge eat if you eat something. Your body starts screaming ""foOd""  and you loose all control. I had the same thing, the hunger grew worse because of how malnourished i was at that time I broke free of this cycle when i started eating three well proportioned meals. Your body is panicking and it needs time to calm down again Anyways stay save, if my suggestion does not work then please reach out for help",False,False
