My kryptonite is sweets and candy. I know that thereâ€™s no one-size-fits-all, but I found Keto completely removed that impulse to binge. I felt in control for the first time in my life (once I powered through the first week). The ladies at r/xxketo are some of the most supportive and lovely people I have ever seen online.  Many of them sound like they were in a very similar situation as you. Maybe head over, have a look and see if it would suit you? Good luck beautiful x",False,False

You can literally feel your skin ripping, and it's the worst feeling ever.  Just know that stretch marks will eventually fade, so don't look at them as reasons to feel like you're stuck permanently. The ones I have from bingeing are very unnoticeable now unless you're looking for them. Just focus on recovering and getting better ðŸ’•",False,False

It helped me lose almost all of my weight and since it's a high fat and moderate protein diet you'll feel more full. In my lower weight I had to switch back to a higher carb diet since I'm not eating as much but keto definitely killed my hunger and it's still gone despite eating carbs again. I still crave food but only in a mental way.,False,False
