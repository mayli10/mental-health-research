I mean I'll periodically think about how I still managed to get through some of my classes but I had to withdraw from others bc I was too focused on ed related rituals, and my OCD became very intense.  I started tx near the end of the semester anyway lol and remained in it for nearly one year. I didn't exercise at that point because it seemed easier to just restrict to a lower kcal count. I started to get an irregular heartbeat and was having issues with major dizziness.    I vividly remember one occasion where I lost control of my legs in such a way that I couldn't step forward. It was really weird as there seemed to be a disconnect between my nervous system and muscles.   I was scared and I started hoping that I'd just have a heart attack in my car after a class to ensure that there wouldn't be any scene or drama as a result. I never lost my period though. I mean my BMI was ~15.8 so it wasn't super low.  It was still better compared to the major b/p issues I had the following year though.",False,False

I think about how I got down to 47kg when I was 20 and I‚Äôm like damn how I do that?? But then I remember that semester was by far my worst for grades, I only worked casual hours so I had p l e n t y of time to spend over exercising, I skipped a lot of social events so that I could run on the treadmill for longer.   My entire life was pretty much consumed with calculating calories and preparing food and eating food at the right time and reading diet books and exercising.   And some of my lowest points were eating more brownies (that I made) than I planned at my friend‚Äôs birthday and purging them in the bathroom while everyone was in the next room pre drinking. I ate 2 brownies.   It took me nearly 6 months to go from 51kg to 47kg and my GW was 45kg. I‚Äôm 171cm. I guess I was pretty sick then. I have a love/hate relationship with the memories from that time in my life. But now that I‚Äôm 28 nothing is the same. And my GW is NOT 45kg Jesus Christ what was I thinking.
