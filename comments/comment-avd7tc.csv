And thats all totally fine. It was all just a misunderstanding. Anyway, thanks and just wanted to say hope you get the support you need if you dont already have much.",False,True

Maybe it's more comfortable for you to share in that setting ðŸ¤· I guess I misinterpreted your original post and colored it with my experiences. Mostly when I share, I'm looking for support, so when you said nobody responded I assumed that's what you were looking for. But it sounds like sharing was more your goal. I'm sorry if my original post made you feel like I was calling you out or something, that's really not what I meant to do.   Sounds like you made a big step getting help! Congrats I'm really happy for you :)   I think it's probably less that they don't care and more that they don't know how to respond. Hopefully they don't bug you at school about it :c they'd have to be real assholes to say anything though. ",False,False

I didn't mean to be an attention whore like usual, so sorry if it sounded like that",False,True

Idk I don't think that platform fosters a ton of responses. I mean I usually don't respond to people's stories, and that is something really personal so I extra wouldn't respond to someone coming out about their ED unless we were close friends.   Sometimes when I don't get responses, I try to manage my feelings by asking myself""what did I expect/want out of this?"" Like if you wanted support, you can probably get that better by confiding in a close friend vs posting on Snapchat. ",False,False

It can be hard to figure out the ""proper"" response to something like that. I wouldn't worry too much about it unless someone starts treating you badly, which I certainly hope they won't! It's brave of you to be open about it. ",False,False
