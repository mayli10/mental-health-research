It helps iron absorb into your body. Also, teas that contain white, black, or green tea hinder the absorption of iron when drunk in high amounts. A cup or two a day is just fine, but much more than that can pose problems. Herbal tea without white, green, or black is fine tho!",False,False

A USP certified multi-vitamin sounds like a good idea. If you're a female, they make some that are sex-specific because men and women have different nutrient requirements. You should definitely get a blood test if you are able to. Hang in there. &lt;3",False,False

I do that well enough on my own. I’m just really scared of what could happen to me and need advice on how to keep myself as healthy as possible until I can beat this.  Thank you for your advice, I’ll definitely pick up a multivitamin sometime soon.

This ensures they provide exactly what they promise and are of good quality. If you take vitamins A,D,E,or K (or a supplement that contains them), they will not properly digest and absorb without consuming dietary fat. Most importantly, the best form of nutrition will always be from food, but I completely understand and empathize with your struggle to obtain your nutrition that way right now. Perhaps you can request a blood test from a doctor to see if you currently have any deficiencies. A multi-vitamin is typically safe, but clinicians do not recommend taking a specific vitamin or mineral unless you are deficient already.",False,False
