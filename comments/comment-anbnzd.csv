Poor nutrition affects both, and you can address this. I won’t beat you with the recovery stick, but perhaps try to make small changes to your diet, as much as you can manage. Little more protein, healthy fats, plenty water. If you can, try to aim over 1500cal/day (this is not enough for weight gain even if you’re sedentary). If you can’t then as close as you possibly can.   My sleeping has improved since I started eating better, I think I have less anxiety now too. I hope you can see some improvement too.",False,False

My upstairs apartment neighbor wakes me up about three times a night, and I'm usually up for a good hour to two hours every time she does. during these hours I overthink and hyper fixate on thoughts that keep me up and drive me crazy. This, I am super tired because I get up at 4 a.m. to take the check and after only 5 hours of sleep that gets old. But I totally feel you. It sucks. I hope we both can get through it! ",False,False
