That sounds so awful. I have no idea if she had bulimia or not, but I know bulimia is not 'just laziness and taking the easy way out', and that it's rude to be making comments about how you 'ate too much', especially since she knows you have an eating disorder. It's a real disorder and requires help most of the time. Your bulimia is valid. Your pain is real.   &amp;#x200B;   I believe with God anything is possible, but also that many times God allows us to suffer and not cure us. Doesn't mean He doesn't love us.. just that His ways aren't our own and that this is a fallen world.",False,False
