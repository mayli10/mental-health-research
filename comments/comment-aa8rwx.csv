If a friend got mad at me for that I think I'd cry.   Yes you shouldn't waste food, but getting mad won't help anyone, maybe next time she goes to do it suggest putting it in some tupperware for later ",False,False

It makes me upset as well because I just cannot eat that way and am really icky about throwing out food. Ultimately though, I think I can’t blame my hang ups with food and body image on other people. While I wish she wouldn’t waste food, if someone tried to control or change my eating habits I would flip. I feel like for her and maybe also for your friend it’s a mix of 1) not caring about/realizing the waste and 2) also a diet strategy. I know my friend used to have issues with an ED and I reckon it’s a thing that she got used to and reassures her she’s eating little enough. Also she’s just a slow af eater. It’s hard for me everytime I see her but in the end I just have to suck it up and realize that she’s just doing her thing and not trying to hurt me or make me jealous, that’s on me. But yeah, I feel your pain.",False,False
