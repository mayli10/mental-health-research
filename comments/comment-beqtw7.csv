I don't know what you normally restrict to but if you really feel like you can't tell your family, you can always try to get out of the house for meals, say you're going on a walk or to the gym or something? And then eat just one smaller meal with them, maybe made with some of the healthy foods they lovingly bought for you. It seems like they care about you a lot. This could also be a good opportunity to start leaning into recovery--for me, having someone aware of my eating helps hold me more accountable. I know this is hard, but I hope things work out.",False,False
