Not trying to invalidate your feelings! But like the other commenter said, we dont know what those girls do to compensate (if they compensate). Plus, though our eating disorders like to tell us otherwise, a normal healthy eater may have days where they eat a lot, but the next day or days they just dont get as hungry, because their bodies arent going back and forth between restriction and binging, it just intuitively doesnt need as much",False,False

I tell people “haha oh yeah I ate an entire loaf of cinnamon bread last night” when I had like a slice in hopes that people don’t suspect my bullshit,False,False
