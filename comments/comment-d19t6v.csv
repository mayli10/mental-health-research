My only caveat would be that if you are capable of getting pregnant and intend to have a child someday, it's possible your ribs may shift during pregnancy, and end up deforming the tattoo. If this is a concern, I would discuss this with an experienced artist, or consider placing the tattoo somewhere that's both pregnancy-proof and not super affected by weight gain/loss (such as the back, uppermost chest, etc).",False,False
