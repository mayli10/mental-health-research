I think it was a storm of things.   I know I had disordered thoughts because I had a BMI of 20 my freshman year of high school and still felt so fat - I wore sweaters everyday(in Florida) and skipped picture days. I think a lot of it was that I was in dance through middle school and 90% of my class had super petite bodies, including all my friends. I asked my gym teacher about losing weight and she recommended this soup diet.  I also am an only girl with 3 very athletic brothers. My oldest brother was in a fancy sports academy, older brother was a marathoner, my youngest was in every sport. They ate so much food, and I would eat just as much because that was ""normal.""   My mom is a little disordered. Shes petite and always talks about how fat she is, and was always super boy-obsessed. Hated being alone.  I got asked out a couple times and always said no. When I was 20 I met a girl who always talked about the great sex she was having, and as someone who was still grossed out by sex scenes, I started to feel abnormal. Then I met a guy and just felt so fat and felt like I needed to lose weight to be with him and have sex. That's when I started purging.   Even now it is always about sex and finding a guy, being skinny enough for guys - I'm sure a lot of that comes from my mom. I'm not as skinny as porn girls, he probably sees my stomach fat jiggle, he would have loved me if I was skinny.",False,True

I always remember *feeling* fat, even as a little child, but actually *being* fat was so much worse.  My sister was a skinny kid and is now a fat adult, but she’s lovely and food-normal and doesn’t particularly care.  My mom probably had an ED, and has been both fat and skinny throughout my life, but seems only mildly disordered now.  I think that she’s just settled on an acceptably healthy but strict diet that dates her need to control her intake, and my dad is on the same diet, so he complains if she gets too crazy.  He’s been both fat and skinny as well, due to formerly drinking a lot and then getting into a demanding sport in his 40s.  My grandma for sure has or had an ED, definitely severely at some points.  She also seems to have plateaued into a strict-but-healthy-enough diet over the last fifteen or twenty years.  I seem to be the most persistent and severe in my craziness, but it’s no mystery where it came from.  I’m glad my sister seems to be untouched by it, though.  She’s a ray of light and deserves every bit of her health and happiness.",False,False

The highest I got was the high end of the overweight bmi.     It absolutely fuels my ED because I notice how much nicer the world is to me now that I am tiny and conventionally beautiful. I never want to go back to frumpy and invisible. It is like gaining a tiny level of fame. People treat you differently.,False,False

Even before I gained the weight, I was a healthy weight and I felt super fat, still avoided cameras and everything. I felt just as fat then and now as I did when I was overweight.
