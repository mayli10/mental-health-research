A lot of the people on subs like that who insist they aren't disordered, are. A lot of the people who insist they may have disorders, but are still successful and functioning, aren't.  And a lot of people there who insist they are ""acceptably"" thin and have healthy to underweight BMIs... aren't/don't.  Seriously. A HUGE amount (no pun intended) of fatlogic posters are also fat. Maybe not obsese, but not thin like you're imagining. It's the same reason overweight people watch shows like The Biggest Loser or My 600 Pound Life - ""I'm not THIS bad, so I must be okay!"" They try and get ""in"" with skinny people by hating fat people too, by proving they're one of ""the good ones"". If they can replicate the behaviour and attitude of skinny people at fat people, then they must not be that fat, right?  It's denial for a lot of them, all the way down. They externalise their fear and self-hatred onto other semi-anonymous posters so that they can other themselves from them.  You're literally comparing your life to a bunch of people who can say anything they want to about themselves. I can tell you I'm a self-made millionaire with nine horses and a BMI of 16 all while eating 2000kcal a day, but that doesn't make it true.  &gt;... they maintain the morality of thinness without it being disordered.   I like this quote a lot, and I can relate to your thought process, but at their very core, I don't think you could describe people so obsessed with weight and size and appearance they frequent fat hate subs to be ""not disordered"", regardless of what they say. Their actions speak louder than words.",False,False

So no, you don't ""genuinely"" think that. Rigidity is nice but you know what's nicer? Rationality.  I'm not trying to tear you down. Obviously you do that enough to yourself already. (and I have no ill will anyway) but the disordered part of your brain is being stubborn, and it's up to your consciousness as a whole to stop that nonsense. I'm stubborn too.
