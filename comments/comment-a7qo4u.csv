I'm like, ""I don't really binge or purge or restrict under 1,000 calories, I'm pretty normal, I should stop playing victim.""  But I'm avoiding my scale to stay sane, and to avoid a mental breakdown.  So I guess I'm not a fraud?",False,False

What I've learned is that it's more about the thoughts you get than any physical markers. If you feel that eating 1000 calories is ""too much"", that's a disordered thought. If you feel that you can't eat more than 800 calories for fear of gaining weight or because of negative body image, that's a disordered thought. If you feel that you need to purge/use laxatives/use diuretics/excessively exercise after eating to ""make up for it"", that's a disordered thought. Unfortunately for AN they usually diagnosis it based on an underweight BMI first and THEN the continued restricting, whereas for BN they diagnose based on the behavior alone. That doesn't mean you're a ""fraud"", it's a problem with the system. With an overweight anorexic as well as with a severely underweight anorexic, the disordered mindset (which is the actual source of the disorder) is the same.",False,False

But if you freak out from the sight of food, and almost cry when your weight goes up a tiny bit. I think that qualifies enough.   You don't need to prove to anyone that you're struggling, if you're in pain because of it. You're valid. ",False,False

But i breakdown about my appearance/weight when I eat at maintenance lmao. It’s easier to remain disordered than attempt to get better. ",False,False
