A doctor is the best person to help you.   That said, I am going to try.   There is no morality to foods. foods are not good or bad. All food can be good in different contexts. You should not fear food. Food is a means to nourish your body and support its functions. It is okay to eat. It is ok to give your body energy.   There are many ways to eat healthfully to provide your body the adequate nutrition. Obviously, a balanced diet is not all frozen pizza and oreos - but the first step in your recovery is to relearn how to eat, and allow yourself to enjoy food.",False,False

I find your motivation to eat is really good, remember why you're recovering when it gets hard. when eating feels wrong and when you're getting scared. fear is going to be a big part of normalizing your eating habits, I don't think there's much of a way around it, you'll learn to deal with it and the most important part is sticking through that fear and doing what you, in your healthy mind, know is right.   I hope things go well for you, and you keep eating those sweets!",False,False
