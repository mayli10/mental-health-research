It probably is something he‚Äôs genuinely upset by which is why I don‚Äôt tell him to stop talking about it, I‚Äôm just frustrated and couldn‚Äôt really tell him about it so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  But yeah, even when I try to do non food things he wants to go out to eat so I guess I just need to get better at saying no/actually having more non food options  Thanks for responding to my (mostly incoherent) rant :-)",False,True

Friendships go both ways. What you bring to the friendship and what you want from the friendship are just as valid as what he brings and wants.   If you want to meet up in non-food-related contexts, you can request that. If he‚Äôs constantly talking about food/appetite and that‚Äôs triggering for you, you can ask to change subjects or ask to talk about it less. At the same time, just as you want him to be sensitive to your struggles, you can try to empathize with where he‚Äôs at. It‚Äôs very possible it*is* quite frustrating for him to be in a place of feeling he needs to eat but having no interest in food. Where you two are at may not currently align, but you don‚Äôt have to invalidate or minimize each other‚Äôs experiences. (The medals awarded for the Pain Olympics are totally shitty anyhow.)  Feel free to ignore this...I mean, goodness knows ranting can be good for the soul too.",False,False
