It doesn’t mean you’re fat it just means you’re older, wearing the clothes that fit you will make you feel a LOT better I promise you.",False,False

It was inconsiderate of her and you have every right to be hurt but it doesn't mean that you need clothes because you're fat.  You are literally going through puberty right now. Your hips are broadening and your body is stretching. Your mother, who went through the exact same thing, is now looking back with strangely rosey-tinted glasses and speaks about the experience light-heartedly because she is, in part, talking to *herself* from that time. She used language like that because when she sees you outgrowing your clothes, as all teens do, she remembers outgrowing clothes herself, and is caught in a strange twilight position where it seems funny and unreal, like a dream about the past, and so she says things that have unintended consequences.  Also, a 7th grader's hips are going to be the same width as their waist, because they generally haven't hit puberty yet, so it's natural that an old skirt tailored to your hips would now fit your waist better because your pelvis is broadening. Something something birds and bees something. It has nothing to do with your waist/hips being larger than the average person's waist/hips and everything to do with wearing a skirt designed for someone who is the same width all the way down their torso.  I don't know what kind of relationship you have with your mother. If it's generally positive, you sound like a very introspective and mindful person, so you might be able to sit down with her and explain that loaded comments like that make you feel badly during an already very tumultuous period of your life. If you don't think your mother would respond well to that, then just work on your own happiness for your own sake and remember that she was just speaking from her own experience, and that it had little to do with you.",False,False
