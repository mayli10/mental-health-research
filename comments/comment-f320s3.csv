And yes, we do other things together, but I can tell the thing resents the most is the ""reject"", or something??? Idk if that sounds clear??? Haha I'm sorry.  I know he's very worried, that's why he try to do something I guess, but I can't explain how I feel without sounding way too weird lol.  Anyways, thank you so much for everything. I'll try to be fine. I feel a little better thanks to y'all &lt;333",False,True

(When it's possible, obviously) The thing is, he feels quite hurt when I say ""no"", ""just because"".

It really meant a lot. Honestly, I hope so. I know that my family would be there if I say the word, but it's so scary...  I'll try. I promise I will try. Fuck this ed.

Idk that might feel less scary than eating junk and then there’s less of a pressure to “indulge”. Or make movie nights or game nights where you don’t have to make and eat food? I hope you guys can find something that you guys can do together!,False,False

I think you need to tell him what's going on. You guys seem really close, he might be worried at first but I'm sure he'll change things to make you more comfortable. It would be worth asking to hang out places that don't involve food, like maybe suggest to go bowling or something, that way food isn't necessarily the ""plan"" for the day. He definitely cares about you a lot, I'm certain he will respect you for confiding in him.  I really wish you the best.",False,False

It's so easy to see that he loves you so so so so so much and only wants the best for you, and that you deeply love and care about him too... It truly must feel alienating, because even though you love him so so much and want him to be happy, it is as if you're separated by a wall that will never ever be broken. And you really, really want to break this wall, but you can't bring yourself to do this.. You don't want to do this, yet you want, you don't, you want, you.. just don't know anymore.. And you must feel so utterly alone, and guilty because of those opposite, clashing feelings.. But you are not alone, and please remember that no matter what you may go through, your brother will be there, patiently waiting for u to break this invisible wall, and if you ask him for help, he'll be eager to do this.    If you can bring yourself to do this, and I deeply believe that you have this strength within you, talk with him about this. You don't have to go full out, I know this would be scary and daunting, but try sharing just a little bit of yourself with him. A simple ""I'm sorry we're growing apart"", or ""I want to get closer to you again"", those things will be enough. Anything, as long as you're marching towards the right direction, is going to be enough. Maybe try telling him to go out and drink some coffee, or to get a salad, tell him you don't want to eat fast food at that moment with him. Even though it'll feel difficult, be honest with him. He loves you so so so much. He will understand.   You're not just going to wake up one day, out of nowhere, realising that you're fully recovered. It will be a slow, continuous process, and you'll have to do it everyday, and it begins with small steps. Small small steps. No matter how small they're going to be, they're still steps, and each and every one of them will matter. And you're gonna feel so so so so proud of them.   So I truly truly wish for you to recover, to be able to enjoy fast-food with your brother one day. You're not ""nothing without your ed"". Your ED is nothing without you, and that is why it clings to you like a parasite. I hope you'll break free, and live a long and happy life, because if there is somebody who really deserves it, that is you.",False,False
