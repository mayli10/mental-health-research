My crush hasn't seen me at my HW though but I'm still so terrified to see him, like I would literally wear stuff that hides my body so he can't see how I really look like. He hasn't actually _seen_ my body right now and I'm planning on keeping it that way until I reach my GW which is dumb and stupid. I wish he could accept me even when I'm at my HW :(",False,True

It's cool though, it's just so frustrating that the weight fell off him so quickly and he's not even dieting, he's actually upset about it because he wanted to bulk up. So, we're bulking him up now and thinning me out lol",False,False

I hope you get through this well!",False,True

I'm withdrawing a bit because he accidentally lost 25lbs last month and he's so thin now. He eats like a massive amount too. I just feel like a fat pig.",False,False

Your guy will sneak in from the sidelines and you'll have 2,000 comfortable conversations before you realise that actually there's a flame there. When the flame happens, of course you'll feel suddenly self aware and ""too fat"" or ""too ugly"" or ""too"" any thing else but by then it won't matter because you'll know each other.    I mad crush on people all the time who I doubt will ever look at me twice because, damn, I am an ugly piece of shit. But I know my friends don't recoil in disgust when they're with me and I have had relationships in the past where they did the opposite of recoil in disgust so I know I can't be all awful.   You're good. He's not good for you unless he notices you for your worth and treats you with respect. x",False,False
