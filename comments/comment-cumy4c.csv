I haven't done it, so the weight I lose doesn't even look as good. And certainly isn't as healthy or least-unhealthy.  It's like depression -&gt; not having the energy to exercise -&gt; negative body image -&gt; shitty mood and low self-esteem -&gt; back 2 depression, whoa full circle  + the road outside of my old neighborhood was literally dangerous to walk up as a pedestrian. Switchback around a curve with no guardrail. Something terrible could happen there really easily if the wrong car came down.  I want to start strength-training and hope it makes shit better in general. I was in a good routine a few years ago, but things were rough for a while and I haven't been able to get back into fitness.  So...now I lose weight so fucking sluggishly. Sedentary career. People don't usually want to go out walking.  Idk :( I feel this.  I know how to fix it, though, so maybe I'll make some homemade weights tomorrow.",False,False

Been overweight, then obese, then morbidly, my whole life. Only sustained progress I’ve ever been able to make losing weight is in unhealthy ways &gt;.&lt; But now that I found something that’s working, kinda wanna stick with it until I’m at UGW and I can just see this long dark path that I’m willingly staying on that will probably turn horribly wrong after a while",False,False
