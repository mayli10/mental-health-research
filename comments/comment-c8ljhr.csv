No need to even explicitly mention your ED history, just be real - poking fun of someone’s weight is an asshole move. Whether they’re fat, thin, male, female, your family member, a stranger, or a literal fucking Snorlax. You don’t do that.   Also - You’re allowed to choose to stop seeing them if it comes to that. Your health is important. *You* are important. Your *life* is important, more important than offending your rude, judgmental in-laws. Whether it’s for a few weeks or until the heat death of the universe. Will it probably suck to hurt their/your boyfriends feelings if you stop seeing them? Yeah, but it will suck 1000x worse to relapse. If they don’t change their behavior, all you can do is change your exposure to it.",False,False
