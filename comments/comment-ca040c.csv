Almond and soy based yogurt is getting really yummy, and it has less calories overall than dairy based yogurt. I personally love soy based yogurt just because I'm lactose intolerant and also dairy in general scares me (Netflix documentary What The Health is what did it)",False,False

I struggle with orthorexia and I hear a lot about people moving away from dairy so it kind of stresses me out that I eat so much of it, especially when it's not low-cal. It's good to remind myself that just cuz my brain thinks of it as unhealthy doesn't mean it is.   &amp;#x200B;  Muesli is good too if u want to expand a little from straight oatmeal!",False,False

I used to do Greek yogurt with fruit, but I've swapped out the yogurt for oatmeal.   That's not to say that dairy is inherently unhealthy, though. It can be a really good source of nutrients if you're into that. I'm just trying to discourage myself from consuming my dairy in the form of ben and Jerry's, straight from the container frantically on the walk home from the store ðŸ™„",False,True

Like those are what I have for lunch or breakfast every day. I want to move away from it but IDK to what,False,False
