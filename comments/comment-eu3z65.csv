I would look skinnier in my clothes 2. I could get drunk faster on an empty stomach 3. All the money I saved not buying food, I could spend on alcohol! I thought I was a fucking genius! And as a bonus, if I ever got too drunk, I would just make myself throw up so I could drink more, and also not absorb as many calories from the alcohol. I legit didn’t think there was anything wrong with this until I was older and read about drunkorexia. I had EDNOS through junior high and high school, but then discovered that cocaine worked really well to help me lose my appetite. Although not sustainable, so eventually went back to the ED life.   I’m not sure that any of this is helpful for you, and I’m not sure how I would handle it if my kid ever realizes that my eating is fucked, but if you ever get the courage to ask your mom about her eating, I hope that she is receptive and maybe you can support each other.",False,False
