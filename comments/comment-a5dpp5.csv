Since then it's come back but is lighter and less 'stable' than before (I'm regular due to birth control, but sometimes I don't bleed at all). I now occasionally go 2-6 months without a period even though I'm at a healthy weight. I honestly don't know what's going on with by body, but I'm pretty sure I fucked something up.",False,False

This said, myself and my doctor are not sure whether I lost it just due to weight loss, or if emotional trauma was also a factor. Apparently, I'm hormonally normal. ",False,False
