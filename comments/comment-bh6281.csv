I have an old notebook I can definitely use as a journal. I think you‚Äôre right, and that confronting my emotions head on as opposed to using copes could absolutely be the solution here. Thank you so so much for your insightüíï",False,True

Sometimes it isn't the easiest thing to do because you want to AVOID those feelings rather than confront them!   But admitting your feelings can bring massive relief even though it is momentary pain of self confrontation and honesty. I have a journal app on my desktop and my phone, I am addicted to them honestly. You can even use something as simple as Word, a Google doc or even the daily stickied thread on this sub.  If I don't know where to start I say ""I don't know where to start. I don't know how I'm feeling. Im just so overwhelmed by..."" and then it all comes out in a flood and the relief afterwards is immense. My only rule is that I'm honest with myself, sometimes I even stop in the middle of one sentence because another thought interrupts. Anything goes. I pretend even my own self (the controlling, perfectionist self) can't see the thoughts I write down so they don't ""count"" so I don't really have to confront them, just express them.  Sorry this got long! I hope you give it a shot and it helps xo",False,False

I can't stop binging and subsequently binge drinking off that. If anyone here has good tips I'm interested too x,False,False

Suddenly I'm able to make myself perfectly balanced meals and I never binge or purge or have to fast or anything like that.   For the longest time I couldn't figure out what the ""magic"" about going home was, and I experimented with a trillion different lifestyle and diet changes at school until I realized that it's just sleep! I couldn't figure out why I would crave a constant intake of food, sweets especially, until I realized that my body must be clamoring for energy. When I sleep whole 8-10 hour nights (sleeping through the day doesn't count nor do naps, it has to be an early to bed early-ish to rise sort of thing) I'm at my full potential and have a clear head. When you're exhausted your willpower and energy are low, and you're prone to being emotional = perfect recipe for emotional binges.  Could that be the case with you too? :)",False,False
