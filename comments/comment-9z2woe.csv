It felt like we were saying we were friends because we used to be so close, and live together etc. But she's a horrible person (both to me and other people). I always defended her and said she was nice, and I do try to see the good in people, but she's so horrible and looking back, she always has been awful to everyone around her. I just realised that the reason we've been fighting more is because I don't let her emotionally manipulate me now. And because of that, she didn't want to be my friend anymore.   I feel really good now. I feel free. I hope you do too. :)",False,True

I was in a very similar situation. She was very wrapped up in herself. So much so I kinda started neglecting myself..Sometimes there's nothing you can do but walk away. It's unfortunate but my friends and I all feel a bit better now that she is not in our lives as much. I know it hurts but time fixes all. Focus on yourself and those around you who love and care about you. ,False,False

We both got diagnosed with depression at the same time. Got put on anti-depressants at the same time. She stopped eating, I started binging. She wanted to go out and drink all the time and I just wanted to stay in a sleep.   In all the time I didn't message her, she didn't message me either. Codependency isn't healthy. I hope you can move on from your friendship and find people less toxic for you ",False,True

She just changed a lot when I thought she was fine before. Started pushing me and her ex fiancé (my other best friend) away and now saying I've made her feel needy and I'm just ?????    We were really close for a couple of years but she's moved on apparently. My grandad died yesterday morning but she just cares that I'm not going to her birthday party.   Thanks for your support.

There always seems to be a deeper bond,  a love that doesn't depend on lust or attraction. I'm sorry that you're going through this.  ",False,False
