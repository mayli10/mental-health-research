I have a binge eating disorder and am morbidly obese. I feel so invalid as well. Every thinks I can control my eating, but I can't, I try so damn hard.   ""Try calorie counting.""  ""It's all about willpower.""  ""You have no willpower.""  All these things have been said to me, everyone just thinks I'm a greedy pig who's making excuses to eat. But in reality I really don't want to eat anything I consider ""bad"" because I'm scared and ashamed of the weight gain.  5 years ago it was the opposite, I lost lots of weight by restricting.   I honestly feel like crying as well, it's so fucking horrible to be obese and have an eating disorder.   I feel your pain so much!!!",False,False
