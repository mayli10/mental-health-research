Like going. From 70.5 to 69.7 is huge in kg but only 155 to 153 in lbs. something about the first number changing in kgs is so mentally powerful (or destructive if you consider your point of view / direction of the number change).,False,False

Lol I have to insulate myself with some ""reducing"" data point to hyperfocus on at all times, to avoid spiraling whenever there is no movement on the scale in lbs. That spreadsheet is my saving grace standing between me and a complete meltdown every morning when I weigh myself. Not seeing the number of kgs fall into the next number down, so that you can finally round it off and start thinking of yourself as a whole kg lighter?!?! Convert that bitch into lbs. Feeling irrationally horrified by how high the number of lbs your weight its? Convert to kgs and feel magically soothed by the much lower number.",False,False
