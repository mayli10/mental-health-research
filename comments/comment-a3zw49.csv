Is it routine or is it because you have a health problem?  Generally, these tests are for CBC (complete blood count - red blood cells, white blood cells), blood sugar, thyroid issues, vitamin levels, and mineral levels. They might also look at electrolytes while you’re there.  One purge probably won’t change much, but it’s not a bad idea to drink a lot of water between now and then to try to get some electrolytes back. Some suggest adding a bit of salt but I’m not sure the amount. Too much and you’ll throw up again so be careful with that.",False,False

Blood pressure is usually measuring with the strap that goes around your arm so it wouldn’t be affected by food. Honestly I wouldn’t worry so much because there’s nothing you can do to take it back. It’s highly unlikely your electrolytes would be severely depleted from purging one chocolate bar.  Just go get the test tomorrow and when you’re there just be honest and say you accidentally ate a chocolate bar at 9pm and leave it at that. Plenty of adults and people without EDs sometimes forget and eat/drink before a blood test when they’re not supposed to. ,False,False
