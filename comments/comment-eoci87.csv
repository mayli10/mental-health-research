I think it might help to tell your boyfriend or someone close that you can trust abt how you’re feeling and abt everything that you’re dealing w. I get not wanting to hurt or upset any of them so so much, but experience says that they’ll probably be more upset if they weren’t able to help when you needed them to. Random anecdote bc I hope I’m making sense but jic I hope the anecdote helps make things clearer: my cousin has issues + a complicated relationship w my aunt who’s vaguely over-reliant on my mother for emotional support and just for doing a lot of household stuff (installing routers, buying new furniture, buying new appliances, moving etc etc) but I know that my mother would never want to not be able to help even if she gets into fights with my aunt or gets very tired. My ex-girlfriend got very angry at me for never letting her help with anything as well that she chewed me out post panic attack for it (this was pre relationship, we were both younger and I promise you I needed it lol). Letting yourself rely on them is probably one of the best ways to show that you love them, even if hiding things from them stems from that same love. Yee regardless these are my experiences and I’m a baby adult loll so take it w a grain of salt + if you need anyone to talk to if you’re not comfortable with doing w anyone irl I’m happy to talk!",False,False
