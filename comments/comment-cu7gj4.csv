College was one of the worst times of my life. I ended up dropping out after two years (n.b., I don't really endorse this, in most cases I believe it is better to stick it out and graduate, but with the gift of hindsight and counterfactual thinking, I really do think leaving was the better option for me). The more time that's passed since college, the less all that pain matters and hangs on to me. I do complain about my current situation a lot, but when I sit down and look at things objectively, I actually do have a lot of good things and my life is orders of magnitude better than it was when I was college-aged.  See also the statement that high school is the best years of your life (don't see this as much now that college is assumed default these days), or that if you do some activity/enjoy some fashion/like some hobby/etc when you're 30+ then you're pathetic. It's more the person saying it projecting their own neuroses and limiting attitude regarding time than anything resembling an objective statement or anything with any relevancy to your life.  Uh, I just woke up and forgot what else I was going to say, ha. Point is that your best years can be any time where you want them to be, including now, and that life does go on and can get better after college. Don't let people crab bucket you into feeling you're permanently stuck.",False,False
