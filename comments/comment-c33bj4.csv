I can't believe shes 16 years older and was so mean to you!   Ugh, I have a sister thats only 1 year older than me and she has ALWAYS been tiny. Being younger, I was never able to get hand-me-downs from her because I was a bigger size :(   People would always comment about how pretty she was and all, right in front of me. It freaking sucked.   This christmas, I secretly tried on a pair of her pants and they were too big on me (just by a little). I don't know if I have ever felt more victorious.   It still sucks though because she's naturally a smaller frame, so even at the same weight she actually have boobs, but I've lost mine (I went from a D to an A!!)",False,False
