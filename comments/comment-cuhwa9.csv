I would have definitely interpreted those spoken to my face the same way you did, even though like I said, ""7 lbs higher"" to a still low weight or ""already skinny"" are definitely indicators that to people you look like you weigh ""like nothing""",False,False

I’ve come back to read it multiple times. It’s made me feel so much better about the comments people have made over the years, and it’s really helped me see their comments in a more objective way. Thanks, again",False,True

If you wear looser clothes and still look skinny (instead of just ""normal but not huge"") it's guaranteed you look underweight to say the least. ""Too skinny"" is what people think of when the clothes are off, and at a severely underweight BMI, you'd definitely look scarily bony to both the little girl and whoever made that second comment if you were wearing a bikini in front of them. As to the x lbs comment - people are pretty horrendous at guessing weight and if 7 lbs higher still sounds like an extraordinarily low weight to normal people (aka anything below 100 or even 110), then you're definitely marked under the ""very skinny"" list in that person's mind. I've heard of people being guessed at 140 when they were 115 - that's just beyond ridiculous",False,False
