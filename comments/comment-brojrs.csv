I was on it for less than a week and gained 7lbs of FAT. I know, because I was measured by the tanita body comp analyzer at the doctor the day it was prescribed and again a week later after they told me to stop it immediately.",False,False

When I started birth control I told the doctor that I absolutely couldn‚Äôt risk taking one that would cause weight gain because of my anorexia. She was really understanding and wrote me a script for one that has other potential side effects that some people would consider worse (possibility of blood clots) but it‚Äôs worth it to me to have the peace of mind that comes with not having an insatiable appetite or gaining weight.,False,False

I was on mirtazapine (I think it's called Remeron) for a while and had exactly the same problem - my appetite was endless, I ate everything I could get my hands on and it was never enough. When I expressed to my GP that this was Not Good he instantly took me off them, saying that there's no point giving me something to treat my anxiety and depression if taking the med itself makes me anxious and depressed. There are hundreds of different meds out there that work in different ways with different side effects, you just need to find one that works for you and keep trying until you do.",False,False

Even within a category of meds, the side effect profiles can vary widely. It would be good to indicate to your provider that the weight side effect is distressing enough to hamper your med compliance (if you haven‚Äôt already). I‚Äôd really hope your provider would listen to your concerns and adjust meds if at all possible. I had a provider that didn‚Äôt listen to me and I‚Äôm sooo glad I switched to someone who does.  I had trouble with increased appetite from some of the atypical antipsychotics (lookin‚Äô at you zyprexa). Within that category I found abilify and latuda to be the most weight-neutral (though latuda does have to be taken with some food). With antidepressants and mood-stabilizers I‚Äôve found most of them to be weight-neutral, but of course individual experiences vary. Best of luck! The try-a-med-and-see process can be frustrating - I hope you find the med or combo that‚Äôs helpful.",False,False
