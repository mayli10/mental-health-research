Luckily since I worked there we could suggest new ideas for meetings. I remember we had a ""young adults"" group that would meet bi monthly where we just drank coffee and had live music between talking about whatever religious discussions we wanted. It was great for those in the ages of 20s to 30s. If your able to give suggestions to the church I'd recommend this! It was so much fun.",False,False
