I was very obese as a child and my skin will never recover from all the yoyoing I have done since then. Even when I was underweight, my belly hung off me. That little layer of subcutaneous fat sticks to me no matter what I do.   I also can't afford to have it removed and even if I could, with the way my ED behaves, I would probably only ruin my body again.   I'm sorry you're going through this, but thank you for posting and making me feel less alone. People don't understand what it's like when your body looks this way.",False,False
