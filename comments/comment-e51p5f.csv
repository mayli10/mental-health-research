They should be OK to see you on your own if you ask.   At school, is there a particular teacher you trust and could talk to? Do you know if any teachers have done mental health training? (It might be on the school website.)   There are some really good things on the Beat website about how to talk to people, including things you can print or show to your doctor or teachers.   Donâ€™t be scared. This is such a positive thing to do and everyone will be kind. You are taking really good steps to getting better and for good reasons. Your exams are important and your friend is too. She sounds wonderful, as do you.",False,False

You can go to your GP, which may require your parents to be informed, however, under some circumstances you can ask them not to get your parents involved and they'll adhere to that. But it's on a case by case basis with under 18s. Your GP will ask you why you think you have an ED, will take you height and weight, and likely refer you to CAHMS.  I've never dealt with my mental health as a child, so I only know the adult services, but CAHMS will assess you and if I'm correct in thinking, refer you to the relevant route of treatment.",False,False
