This is kind of how it started for me too (thanks @hs gym class  for making us run for 30 min straight in order to pass). Luckily I've never had a fracture but omg I can't even imagine. Please do give yourself some grace if it ever happens again. Also the anxiety thing, yes, 100%, it's like your body is filled with this restless energy and your brain feels like you went too hard on the caffeine and you just have to burn the feeling off. I remember earlier this year I caught a nasty case of the flu and my poor mother had to force me to go the ER and even when I was there I wanted to snap someone's head off because I wouldn't get to run that day. Jesus I even did sit-ups in the waiting room's chair, I must've looked fucking crazy.   And omg I feel the not-losing-weight thing, it's like your appetite increases 100x and I also feel like my body is adapting to the cardio and I'm not burning as many calories?? I don't know but I think strength training helps (like lifting HEAVY. It's like you don't build too much muscle because the cardio prevents that from happening but at the same time I feel like it's enough to offset the BMR decrease from the adaptation to cardio? Idk I just want a fucking DEXA ffs). Basically I kind of want to follow the reverse dieting guidelines (increasing your calories and volume of strength training while slowly decreasing your cardio) but at this point I don't know that I can, it's like a compulsion.  Thank you for all the tips! I do have good running shoes (lmao I've gone through two pairs in the last year, and they're like proper running shoes with the gel bands too) but I'm kind of afraid to go to a doctor to have them assess my gait because I'm pretty sure they would tell me to exercise less. Plus they'd probably say that I have like a 60-year-old's knees or something. I've looked up what proper running form looks like on YouTube but... probably not very reliable. I am glad treadmills are better though (I've always been told otherwise?) as I do most of my running there. Oh and have you tried putting a bag of ice (covered in some kind of cloth) on your knees after running? It sounds like the most basic thing in the world but I've found that, while it doesn't take the soreness away completely, it makes the inflammation go down so that it doesn't get even worse during your next run.",False,False

I went from ""I just wanna be able to run a 5k"" to ""10k"" and then before I knew it I was running 20's on stress fractures and now I have to run at least 40 mins a day or my body literally has what I think are withdrawal symptoms - my anxiety skyrockets, I get so irritable, I literally cry over my body. It's like, wow I can't even stop this but it's not even helping me lose weight, tf body?   &amp;#x200B;  And jesus, a half marathon everyday, that's intense, please take care of yourself! The most important is getting good shoes and running form. Get your gait assessed and have shoes recommended for the way your feet move and everything. Some places do running form assessments, I haven't done one myself but try not to like... land too heavily, let my knees cave in. Also, in order of ground softness: treadmills &gt; asphalt &gt; pavements. Things like strengthening your quads and glutes makes it so that your knees don't absorb all the impact.   That being said, running is still very, very knee intensive. Mine have actually been pretty sore recently, that and my calves which perpetually feel like they're going to be strained ",False,True

According to Fitbit, I've been running a half marathon every day for the past year, with the exception of five days. Exercise addiction is a bitch because as you said, restricting is basically impossible and it takes up so much of your time and jesus I've cancelled so many plans because I wouldn't be able to exercise otherwise. The only thing I can say is please don't increase your exercise any more. I started with a ""reasonable"" amount of time but then you just keep piling on ""five more minutes"" and you can never take that back. Have you by any chance found any way to soften the impact of running on your knees? That's literally my biggest concern rn",False,False
