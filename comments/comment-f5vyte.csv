I have never considered myself to be smart or of average intelligence.  I have always thought quite low about myself in terms of my smarts/looks. I do believe any presenting lack of mental capabilities is from my inadequate nutrition and health occurrences that could be altering parts of my brain that affect things like memory.

The good news is that a) not all decline in cognitive functioning is a result of (or even indicates) a loss of brain matter, and b) partial restoration is [definitely possible](https://emilyprogram.com/blog/how-eating-disorders-affect-the-neurobiology-of-the-brain/). However, [thereâ€™s no real consensus](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/eat.20840) on whether full damage reversal is possible.
