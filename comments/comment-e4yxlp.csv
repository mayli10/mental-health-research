It wasnâ€™t an article; it is a direct link. It is the RWJ Website for Somerset NJ EDU- to make an appointment.  Crazy huh? Thank you all for the discussion. I appreciate all of you so very much!,False,True

We all know that these disorders affect more than just girls/women and this perpetual stigma makes it much harder for boys/men to ask for help. This is bullshit and I am so sorry. You are completely justified. I'm here if you need anything.,False,False

I'm glad you're able to talk to your wife and kids about this and have some support in your attempt to recover / improve.",False,False

I'm a male who has struggled with an ED for 15 years and it's been a protracted process because people don't take it seriously, not even professionals sometimes. Doctors just assume an emaciated man must be a drug-addict. I've been told by a GP that I should just ""get more sleep"". Family members have told me to stop acting like a pussy. The first therapist to recognize the ED was a woman who is a recovered anorexic; ED-brains recognize other ED-brains IMO.     I've been accused of trying to ""invade womens' spaces"" which sucks because I understand why someone might think that but they're wrong nonetheless.     ngl I like that people tend to assume I'm a junkie or something because it means a) I'm not fat and b) they wont try to force me eat",False,False
