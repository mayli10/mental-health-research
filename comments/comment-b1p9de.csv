I threw him my food whenever I could, helping him out a little (and enabling myself to restrict at the same time).  I've lost quite a bit of weight since then and now have a BMI much lower than his but his legs are still skinner than mine are. Males naturally have skinner thighs since their body doesn't store as much fat there in preparation for pregnancy. He is of a healthy BMI now and I'm borderline underweight but that's the one body part which is still bigger on me than on him. It gave me a complex for quite a while but,   Even though it fuelled my anger at my own thighs,  I had to sit myself down and tell myself that it was unreasonable to be mad about something which he cannot control. I guess it pissed me off since I was the one with the eating disorder but if he said that he had the eating disorder instead, it would seem more believable. It hit my 'ED pride'. But just know that those unreasonable thoughts can be dealt with.  Your ED shouldn't end your relationship by making you feel like you're in a competition with your partner. Losing your relationship over your ED isn't worth it and I hope that you grow to accept your partner's figure over time just like I did. It can take a while but it is much better than losing someone who is important to you üòä",False,False
