You shouldn't be scared to go out at night, so I'm going to take this opportunity to give you advice, since it seems like the rest of the thread has the empathy part covered:   1. When you go out late at night, it's always a good idea to obscure your gender. Stuff your hair into a hat or wear a hoodie, if you have any baggy pants or men's basketball shorts these are a great option, and keep the colors dark and wear a reflective vest if you can. This is exceptionally good because it makes you look official and more likely to have a group of people that know where you are--when predators are looking for targets, they look for *easy* targets (i.e. anyone who might be out alone or running away from somewhere). Otherwise, obviously it's safer to be out in high-vis colors to make sure you don't get hit by a car.   2. Assume anyone approaching you for any reason after 8pm is dangerous. Don't talk to them, don't make eye contact, and just keep walking. Have your phone visible if you notice someone following you (they'll get spooked and leave you alone because they'll assume you're calling the police). Also just to reiterate: this goes for anyone, regardless of gender, age, size, or apparent class. A suit doesn't make someone less dangerous, neither do high heels.   3. If you are just out for a walk, have a route in mind. Walking aimlessly makes you look like more of a target (in their mind, you might be lost or just out on your own without a set time to arrive back home so that's an opportunity to talk to you). This is also helpful if you need to get home FAST.   4. Walk with a sense of purpose and urgency. You don't need to run but again, if it seems like you are on your way to a specific location, you will be less of a target because the logical assumption is someone is waiting for you.   5. If you get spooked while you are out and about and decide to call a Lyft or an uber, always check the license plate and ask the driver for their name and who they are waiting for. If they fail any of these questions, do not get in the car. Always check ALL 3 OF THESE (and do not give them the opportunity to answer with a yes or no. So ""are you Jake?"" is the wrong way to ask, literally ask ""what's your name? Who are you waiting for?"" To make sure that they are legit)   6. If at all possible, let someone know that you're going out, around where you'll be, and what time you expect to be back. If anything does happen, you'll be easy to find. Also, if there's anyone you trust enough with this information, give them access to your phone's password. They'll be able to use the ""find my phone"" feature to check your location.   7. People act like weapons make you safer. They do not. The only good weapon is one you know how to use (so if you don't actually know how to win in a knife fight, it's pointless to carry one around and if anything is more likely to be used against you). I used to carry around the antenna to an old car radio (the wire ones that stick out on top of the car) because it's light, telescoping, and it will cut someone up pretty bad if used. The reason this works is because it's pretty self-evident how to use it-- just whack em. A more conventional option depending on what state your in would be mace or pepper spray. If you get some, don't keep it buried in your purse, keep it easily accessible in a pocket.   Those are all my tips for you. Naturally, a self-defense  class would be a great addition to all of these and if that's an option for you, I think anyone can benefit from it so definitely give it a shot. In particular, something like aikido or wing chun would be great because they rely on using the other person's weight and force against them (so this is ideal for a smaller person defending against a bigger person).  Good luck and stay safe out there!",False,False
