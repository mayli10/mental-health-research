I also struggle to eat meat and I can’t eat fish at all. I can’t eat anything that has been left out for over 2 hours and I can’t eat anything that has been left uncovered for any amount of time. I can’t eat anything that I find a hair in and I can’t eat off anything that hasn’t been rinsed or wiped off. I can’t eat anything that has been left in the fridge unused for more than a week. I can’t drink out of the tap and cups are nightmares because those have to be rinsed multiple times until it feels right. Going against any of this makes me feel like I’m going to have a panic attack and throw up. I can’t even swallow something I can’t eat for money. My throat literally closes. I know it’s ridiculous and I won’t be poisoned, but I can’t help it. ",False,False

I struggle more with disgust than I do with the fear of calories that people talk about here.  Tbh the best I've got at this point is trying to eat homogenous foods when you're struggling. Sure, McDonalds is trash, but they funnel millions of dollars into making sure each burger is *identical* processed trash that takes eons to spoil - whereas other companies can get away with a few bugs (or E. Coli) in their wholesome organic lettuce without risking the same level of PR nightmare.  Or like you already did with the waittress - asking someone else to check first. Sometimes sharing food with other people helps when I know I'm being extra about it and just need quiet confirmation that it's perfectly good food.  Cooking at home without fresh produce or dairy saves my sanity sometimes too.  Just be careful to avoid listening to the disgust too much. When meat was gross, vegetables were risky, grains were too substantial, and dairy was the grossest, I didn't even realize that it was just restriction via process of elimination. Sometimes there's nothing to do and no way to make it appealing; just gotta eat what you gotta eat quickly before your brain catches up with you.",False,False

I swore it smelled and tasted weird. My boyfriend thought I was crazy and tried to offer me something else to eat but I told him I'd lost my appetite. I really did, because I really convinced myself the egg was spoiled and it grossed me out so much. Self-deception is some shit ain't it?!",False,False
