It isn't good for you. You should only have a surplus of around 500 calories that way you can put on weight in a healthy and comfortable way. The amount you would need to get so many calories must be enough to stretch your stomach. Honestly, you would be best off just putting your foot down. There's nothing scientific about overeating to that extent. If you focus on your total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) and add a little bit on to that you'll gain weight at a rate your body can actually keep up with.  I think it's also important to focus on what you're eating. You didn't specify, but no matter what combinations of food you eat there's no way you don't go over the upper limit of daily intake for a few nutrients. Things like calcium, folate, and B3 (niacin) have very low upper limits. At around 250% of the daily recommend value (DV) for each of these three nutrients you exceed the upper limits. For the most part if you're just a little bit over the upper limit you might just experience minor symptoms like being flushed in the face (basically being red and very warm), but continuing to exceed those limits to even higher amounts are continually exceeding them day after day could lead to further more serious symptoms. For reference, I made a meal plan for myself which puts me at maintenance calories for a healthy weight for somebody of my size while also accounting for additional calories I would burn through exercise. This plan is 1,650 calories. It was a struggle to find a way to keep my B3 and calcium within an acceptable range. I spent hours tweaking the plan to finally get them below the upper limit without giving up other important nutrients and then even longer to get them down to a range where I felt safe eating what I had in that plan repeatedly. B3 is common in various vegetables and meats. Calcium is common in vegetables and dairy products. Folate can be found in just about anything you eat. All three of them are common in women's multivitamins (which I why I wouldn't recommend multivitamins for anybody eating a healthy diet).   Though those three nutrients are the ones I consider the most difficult to manage, there are also other things you need to look out for. Things like cholesterol are very important. For the average person it is recommended to eat less than 200mg of cholesterol per day with the upper limit being around 300mg. 2 large eggs (large eggs being the most common size I see in grocery stores) contain 373mg of cholesterol. A lot of people consider eggs an every day breakfast food despite this and so they're making an incredibly unhealthy choice while believing it to be healthy. I would also assume that your parents don't want to cook 4500 calories worth of food for you every day, so I'm going to then assume that you're eating a lot of prepackaged foods like canned soups and similar items. Prepackaged foods tend to be very high in sodium and so if you're eating them on a daily basis you're likely going way over the amount you need which leads to a lot of very common health problems that people experience in western countries. In extremely excessive amounts it can even lead to severe dehydration as your kidneys try to process all of the extra salt to get rid of it before it can otherwise harm your body. This happens because your kidneys can only filter out so much at a time and need a lot of water to do so. This means you would continually be emptying your bladder until you eventually just ran too long on water and your body can't function properly anymore. You do still need a minimum amount of sodium though, so it's also important to assess your diet and determine if you need more sodium or less sodium. At 4500 calories I'm going to say you almost definitely need less. Another mineral I would like to bring up is potassium. Though most foods contain little to no potassium, so in all likelihood you're not getting too much, even at 4500 calories you may not be getting enough. Unless your parents have you eating a whole bunch of bananas every day you probably don't have to worry about getting too much. Though if you are getting too much that's a big problem. Potassium is kind of volatile in a sense. It's important for maintaining proper muscle and heart health, but too much can also lead a whole mess of problems. You also want to space your potassium intake throughout the day as foods high in potassium, when eating in unusually large quantities, can burn the inner lining of your stomach. If you take a potassium supplement it's also best to go for powders in order to get a meaningful dose and to make sure the powder is evenly distributed throughout your food to avoid the same problem.  If you would like I would actually recommend showing this post to your parents. It might be informative for them and if they would like to talk to me about creating a better meal I would be willing to help. At the very least if they aren't willing to listen to reason I would at least want them to know that forcing a child to eat such insane amounts of foods is abusive and if they're not willing to see reason I would shame them. But hopefully shame isn't necessary :)",False,False
