You can appeal your insurance company's decision and get approval if you prove the drug's merit and your medical necessity for it specifically. Give them a call and ask them what documentation they require for that.   I got my prior insurance company to approve botox for migraines by doing this. All they ended up needing was proof that I had at least tried other/cheaper alternatives first, which I already had. ",False,False

(I used to do Prior Auths for medications).. you could try and see if the insurance will let your doctor submit a letter of medical necessity. You might have to buy one month out of pocket (they sometimes even reimburse you after the fact).   Second plan would be.. if your doctor will write the script- send it into a Canadian mail order pharmacy. A lot of doctors try to be “against it” solely for ethical reason so I wouldn’t even mention it but ask them for the paper script and find a Canadian one online. They mail it to your house and it’s usually way cheaper out of pocket.   Just some options in the event that it doesn’t get covered but you need it :) ,False,False
