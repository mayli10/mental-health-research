God is it that hard to understand how sometimes you might want to keep your harmful personal opinions to yourself because they might negatively influence people trying to recover from an awful mental disorder? ,False,False

And I'm only gonna recover if I can recover and be skinny! Because I'm not gonna give up my ED to be a pig. Skinny is objectively life changingly better,False,True
