I read somewhere and was told by my boyfriend (who formerly had an ED and still have dysmorphia) that thoughts that are disordered towards food, fitness, health, calories, and weight is what an eating disorder is composed of. It has no physical effects (except for panic attacks and the like) until you act on it. If you have thoughts stated above on your mind all the time like that, I'm about 98% positive you have an eating disorder. It's an unhealthy relationship with food. A lot of people who have an ED typically don't think they have an issue/it's not that serious and, therefore, don't do anything to help it.",False,False

Better to get help now than down the line when it’s harder to recover and more damage to your body has been done.",False,False
