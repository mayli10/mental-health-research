Sorry to mention this late, but I would try and eat a little salt every day anyway (I aim for roughly 180mcg) otherwise you can have severe muscle cramps and issues.

I was having the weirdest and most intense weight changes overnight consuming less than 150 a day and walking off more than twice that. Could not comprehend why I wasnt losing and spiraled that my body was broken beyond being able to eat.   It turned out that even though I was majorly restricting, my salt intake was at the high end of average so I was retaining water which is a real real bitch. I think something like 400mg of addition sodium or salt can cause you to retain 2lbs of water weight though that may have been a nightmare and not an actual article.    I read up on it and your body naturally tries to balance your sodium to your water, so if you eat too much salt it will retain water and inversely the best way to fix it is to drink more water to lower the sodium:water ratio in you and release what you retained. That takes a while, so I usually go for bananas and other potassium rich foods as they help you dispel the excess sodium. Theres also diuretics but with all the shit they've put me through I would never recomend them. Not only will they fuck your liver/kidneys and leave you feeling hungover, but IME they dont take off all the retained water either AND you end up loading it right back because you didnt fix the problem just hid it. They reduce the water in you, sure, but not the sodium so the second you start drinking water again not only will the diuretics be undone but they'll have made it worse because the decrease in water will have raised your sodium:water ratio even further.   Hope any of this helps and that you can (healthily) get back in your bubble.",False,False
