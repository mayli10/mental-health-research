People here who get triggered by fasting imagine people like them, who are either thin or slightly chubby, whereas when you look at the average of statistics posted that's... Not really who the sub is for. *There's a post right now talking about going from 237 to 198, for christ's sake.*  As for being a lifestyle, I'd say OMAD works great for maintenance over a lifetime. Hell, I've done OMAD for years before even thinking about dieting. Anything more than 24 hours, I agree is more of a temporary adjustment to lose weight or quit bad habits.",False,False

I feel like a fuckin weakling but I'm now out of excuses. Count me the fuck in on the water train.  Blue monster 0 is practically water still tho right? Because ~fLaVoR~,False,False

Their body had a good bit of stored energy that it could mobilize. I mean, what they did is impressive, and if their goal was improved health I don’t mean to detract from that - but it also seems like a high-risk course of action, both physically and mentally.  I’ve seen enough posts in this vein on the fasting sub that I’ve mostly stopped visiting. It just fuels my self-loathing and my brain’s distorted belief that I shouldn’t need nutrition.",False,False
