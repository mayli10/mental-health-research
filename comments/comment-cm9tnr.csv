You've been suffering for FIVE years, isn't that enough?! You've become extremely emancipated and have gotten down to the point where even you feel stuck and trapped by where you've gotten in life.   Hospilation or inpatient sucks in the moment, but that suckiness can actually be a good thing. When you don't feel particularly motivated to recover or even just feel so controlled by anorexia that change seems impossible, going into treatment can feel like a reset. When you leave you'll feel so thankful to get out and realize that you're eating disorder resulted in that admission and is NOT your friend. That small bit of newfound freedom from your eating disorder can be a motivation to keep up the progress you made inpatient.   Also, in my experience, your eating disorder voice quiets a bit while you're in the hospital. I think it recognizes that it's been outsmarted and, while it's still there, you'll feel like you can at least fight back. Just be careful, because comparison runs rampant in places like that. If you think someone is smaller than you or has a ""worse"" habit than you, remember that you're all going to the same place, at least as long as CAHMs has a say in it!",False,False
