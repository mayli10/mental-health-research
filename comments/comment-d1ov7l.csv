Although there's no magic cure, what I found to help so far :  * Eating a lot of fat and protein while cutting sugar; this might seem counter-intuitive, being more calorie-dense, but you will feel full for longer.  * Find an occupation that will use a lot of your time when you have nothing to do. I personally binge out of boredom, food is replacing an emotional void I need to fill with something else.   * Think about tomorrow. Think about the fact that, no matter what you do *today*, you will always have access to food whenever you want, at any point in your life; so you don't need to gorge yourself *right now.* You can have fun once in a while, as long as it doesn't happen every day.",False,False
