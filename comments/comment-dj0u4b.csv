If she really wanted to get rid of the food without drawing attention to herself she would have just tossed it out. Sounds like she is really sick, and if I were you would avoid interacting with her as much as possible, and not even acknowledge/react when she starts taking about food and being in the hospital and stuff.",False,False

In the end of the day you dont need that nonsense to push you further into an ED. She might be a nice person in general, but I can see this sort of situation being extremely triggering to be in, especially with what she did (manipulating others into her situation, bragging about it, etc.). Just as you, I understand her thinking and reasoning, but it's not your job to endure this shit. You are clearly a nice person since you stay even though it may hurt you, but please honey dont do it to yourself. It's hard enough having ED, no need for extra help on the side xx",False,False

What she did isn't uncommon but I've rarely heard about people bragging about it or immediately admitting to what their plan was. Huh that's wack and don't feel bad because she would have found another way to get rid of it regardless of if you took food from her of not.,False,False

Like I wrote above, she’s always talking about her medical issues, which as far as I know are mostly caused by her lack of food :( I try not to give her too much attention for it, because I know fawning over her every issue will only give her what she wants and make things worse.",False,True

I understand why she does it, and I know the feeling of going to unskillful behavior to get the attention you need. It’s just I know how hard it can be to be called out on bad behavior, and I don’t want to be the reason she harms herself further. I’m just kinda stuck in a loop of dealing with constant talk about size and stuff.",False,True

It’s so hard to want to recover or even think about eating the slightest amount when someone is right there triggering you and making you feel like crap.,False,True

I can definitely relate though. My best friend also has an ED and we’ll be out together and she‘ll be like “okay so when my dad picks us up, you have to say that we ate pizza for lunch”. Or “this is my first time eating all day! Ooh don’t tell my parents though”. I love her to pieces but I hate that she puts me in the position of either enabling her illness or upsetting her. And it’s just really triggering for me because we all know EDs are competitive and when she doesn’t eat it feels like I can’t either.",False,False

She sounds like she is a manipulative person and EDs will do that (it's an addiction and addicts are often liars). I don't mean to put her down but absolutely this is not on you. She would've found another way to get rid of that food.",False,False

What she did was manipulative. It's gross that she's involving other people in her disorder and, from how it sounds, is basically bragging about her illness. This is not a ""you"" problem, it's a ""her"" problem.",False,False
