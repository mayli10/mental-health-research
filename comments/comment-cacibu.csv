She previously said that sheâ€™d never shown her face because she doesnâ€™t want to be recognized in public (while also saying that it happened before and pushed her to delete her channel) but todayâ€™s video is just casual face reveal. Is she going to stick with this channel still or is she sending it off with a 30 minute marathon video...,False,False

Yet I think her blog is still focused on just being really thin? No idea.  In any case if she's seeking to maintain her current weight she looks pretty normal.
