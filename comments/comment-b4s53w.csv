I don't even wear them around the house as a comfortable lounge pant because they are so tight! I like rip them off as soon as I get in the door so I can breathe lol! I know I don't know you but I think they would fit :),False,False

Ok, they aren't cheap, like $80 BUTTTT they last foreverrrrrr! I wore them everyday after I had my baby for THREE years bc none of my other clothes fit. I'm back to my old weight now and still wear them because 45lb weight gain didn't ruin the stretch bc they were well made. I only own the one pair since I can wash them a million times. If I would've gotten a cheaper pair for $30 or so I would've had to re-buy them a few times making it actually more expensive. I love Sudara too because they are fair trade so no sweatshops :)  &amp;#x200B;  Annnddd I just looked for you and since the company has been out a few years they are cheaper!!! :D Seriously the most amazing quality :)  &amp;#x200B;   [https://www.sudara.org/collections/leggings/products/suna-grey](https://www.sudara.org/collections/leggings/products/suna-grey) ",False,False

TBH I've never tried on Lululemon leggings because I'm afraid I'll fall in love with something I can never afford, but I've looked at the size charts and heard people's opinion of them and assumed they'd be small enough to fit; I have tried Athleta's XXS and they gap in the waist though, so if the sizes are comparable, then Lululemon won't be small enough either :(",False,True
