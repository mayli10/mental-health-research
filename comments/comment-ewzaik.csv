Recently got into a laxitive habit that concerns me, miralax seems difficult to get a hold of in the UK but there's a non stimulating laxitive you can get pretty much anywhere called Fybogel. I've already looked it up and it only has 5 cals per sachet.  DEFINITELY anyone who is currently abusing laxitives should look into non stimulating alternatives available to them!!!!",False,False

That'd be life changing for me",False,False

Lax abuse is no easy thing to quit, and it may take some time to train your bowels to work normally again, but it is so worth it. Good on you for reaching out to your dad in order to prevent further damage, it's a smart thing to do.",False,False
