But if you've been thin all your life, it's possible that people just assume it's in line with what's historically been normal for you, and they may not suspect you are intentionally suppressing your weight.

While there are all different parts of the country and different social status like everywhere it seems that it is one of the top 12 countries receiving aid for malnourishment.

And yeah, I think these types of goals give us something solid to cling to, no matter how meaningless they might actually be or how little they really make any difference in our lives. It's the promise of a quantifiable, visible achievement.  The weirdest thing is that I do have other accomplishments, I think. But they don't make me feel better, either; somehow that feeling of security or success really eludes me. Possibly it's less about external markers of success and more about the lack of fulfilling relationships or sense of purpose in life, I don't know...  I remember reading a diet book once that said said something like, ""happy or sad, rich or poor, it's better being thin!"" I would never in a million years want anyone else to internalize that philosophy, but secretly it does resonate with everything that led me to develop an eating disorder.

A super fit body meant I banged more hot guys. Being thin and hot helped me get more free passes at work, and I could get a lot further in a cute outfit and heels than my brain could ever take me. I noticed people were nicer when I was thinner, when I was more vain, when I cared about all the numbers. Attention at the gym or on social media was heavy and it made me feel good.  Then I got to a place, both personally and professionally, where incompetence could not be masked by all the energy I devoted to my numbers. It didn't matter that I was at competition level body fat or a super low number on the scale. I had to do a job and I had to do it well (both as a parent and as the head of a department). Recovery started when there was no external validation of these numbers; when these numbers stopped being a measurement of my success.   I fought it at the expense of being mean and hungry; by being frustrated by more binges and heavier restriction; I cried at my softening body and the size of my ass. Then I was thrown into a couple big work projects and my daughter's growing activity list and I was distracted from it. Did me a lot of good to be distracted. I realized my daughter didn't care about my BMI and neither did my boss; everyone just liked the fact I was doing a great job and my daughter loves the effort I put into getting her to scout meetings and martial arts training and music classes and everything else.

I ask about the turmoil because that's actually a common and, in fact, essential part of recovery for many people who have experienced trauma and/or suffer from EDs.
