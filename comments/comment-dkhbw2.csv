And I know that isn’t true and we all deserve to eat, but it’s just so much easier when someone else tells you it’s okay to eat.",False,True

Like, I get that I’m just deciding on dinner, but it feels like I have the fate of the world hanging in the balance depending on what I do for dinner.

Or tells you to. Thank fuck my therapist doesn't know this because sometimes she's like 'get yourself some hot soup on the way home or something' and if she knew that I DO when she tells me to, she'd totally abuse that power and make me fat.  She just assumes I don't do it, lol.     I think it's because I grew up in a mega controlling environment tbh, it just feels easier sometimes if you have permission and your brain goes 'they said it's ok, so it must be' But it has to be someone I trust and respect, and it has to be a specific food that they tell me to eat. Not just 'eat something'. if someone was telling me to eat just to be controlling or a dick, I'd ignore them. Like if they knew I had an ED and was trying to force me to eat, it would be a whole different story. But sometimes, someone just saying 'have some soup, it's cold out!' really makes it okay for me to have soup. Sorry if this is incoherent",False,False
