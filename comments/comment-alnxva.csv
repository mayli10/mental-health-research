Im sure the removal was because you mentioned gaining wegith as a result of a trauma, which is indeed psychological and not a fitness question. they couldve read more closely into their post, and you can message them to appeal it if you want, but its a  bit understandable glancing at it that the intro mightve been intimidating to a common question.",False,False

My only thought is because you mentioned being a victim of a crime that they thought that was more what you were asking about?  Idk. Maybe it has to do with the ""crack down"" reddit had where they banned alot of our eating dissorder friendly spaces and they are just overreacting?  What I see posted over and over on fitness subs is the idea that noone at the gym is really looking at your or paying attention to you really. So you should just go and try to lose yourself in your workout (god I want to take my own advice here soo bad)  I know that is hard to grasp when you feel like you stick out like a sore thumb. Is there a friend you could invite with you a few times?   Also as for the eating the way you have been, has that been since your attack? trauma can cause issues with binge eating. I lost my mom a few months ago and the emotional issues I've had have gone well (real kill me) with good ol' binge eating.   Good luck at the gym. I hope you are able to start going and kick some ass!",False,False
