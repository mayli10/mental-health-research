I know the panic of consuming more than you think but even if you dont log, your body still does. I highly doubt you've gained weight from coffee. If you have gained, its probably from food rather than coffee.   Now, if you were drinking frappuccinos and now counting them that could be a problem but please please please dont beat yourself up about this. Those calories from coffee can easily be burned off through exercise and not even working out hard but just by adding a short walk to your life most days.   At my thinnest, I was doing weight watchers and found I didnt have to count the cream in my coffee to lose weight. Hell, I even had a few cheezits here and there without counting them. I maintained 122 doing this (I was also very fit so I had a lower body fat percentage than other times when I weighed 115. I didnt have my % measured but I looked smaller). ",False,False

It seems to depend on the type of coffee you drink and how it's processed. I drink Nescafe and tried to look up how many calories, but they seem to change their minds in a single article.
