The jokes may just be an awkward attempt at acknowledging the new info about you. I'm sorry the way your family has reacted has made you feel unsupported, disrespected and shamed.   You could try to let them know what the comments are doing to you, because they are making you want to engage in harmful behaviours and are making you feel like shit.  You could try talking in I statements:  (including a brief, non-blameful description of the BEHAVIOUR you find unacceptable + a description of Your FEELINGS and a description of the tangible and concrete EFFECT of the behaviour on you.  ex:  'I feel very made fun of and stressed [FEELINGS] when you talk about my eating disorder as wasting food  [BEHAVIOR] because that makes is sound like you think that its ok to mock my strugges [EFFECT].""

Not to defend her, but to provide some perspective - I have a sibling with a lot of mental health issues. This causes everyone in my family  lot of stress. My way of dealing with stress is to crack jokes. I probably have enough material for a stand-up routine about my sibling. It's just how my mind works. However, I save those jokes for when my sibling is NOT around - I know said sibling would not find them funny. Fortunately my other sibling does.  So, her joking is probably her reaction to your ED being stressful for her also, because she cares about you. ",False,False

My family recently found out aswell so i know the stress that comes with it. Rexovering must be a thousand times harder when you hear comments like that. It's really great that you've purged less this week, keep up the good work. Even if you don't get much support at home, we'll always be rooting for you",False,False

It hurts when our own families brush off our mental health issues with ED‚Äôs. They seem to not fully understand the complexity of ED‚Äôs. It‚Äôs such a mind fuck for us. They may never understand it, but just remember there are people out there, like me, that totally get you. There are more of us out there that care for you. Hugs ‚ô•Ô∏è",False,False
