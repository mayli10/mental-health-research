Kinda sucks though because I waited 6 months just to get an appointment and they gave me an intern who basically thinks meditation helps everything lol. ",False,True

It's awful when someone disregards a concern in regards to EDs just because of your weight. I'd suggest trying to switch therapists or just consistently bringing it up until they start taking it seriously. Maybe even pausing and saying ""hey, I don't think you're taking this part seriously but it's really been affecting everything else I do and don't know how to deal with it..."" then expressing your concern again along with behaviours.

I just feel like she may has dismissed it because I'm still technically in the overweight category.",False,True

Do you mean that you are seeing someone for PTSD/anxiety or something related to the former partner but they do not see the possibility that you are suffering from an ED despite you describing binge eating, restriction, and feeling ill due to taking in WAY less calories than your body needs?  due to your past abusive relationship you may be experiencing difficulty specifically identifying each issue you are dealing with. Please continue to share your thoughts/feelings/experiences with others so they can give you feedback. I hope the best for you. ",False,False
