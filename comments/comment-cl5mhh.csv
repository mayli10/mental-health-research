I was in IOP ten ish years ago. I went from being a respectable A student in college to being treated like I was always lying or covering something up. No one believed me about my light drug use and drinking. They all treated me like I was a hardcore addict in denial despite passing all drug tests. They also kept trying to get me to confess some terrible trauma I suffered and basically didnt believe me when I said my parents weren't abusive, I was never beat, never raped. . .  I felt like I was treated like a kindergartner (seriously we made paper hats in art therapy for God knows what reason) who wasnt trying hard enough to improve. Meds were the only thing that helped me. They taught coping skills such as going for a walk or calling a friend and I'm all like how is that supposed to help me not want to die?",False,False
