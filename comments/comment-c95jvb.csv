My SO used to be overweight and honestly, I couldn't believe it. I met him after he had dropped it all and got muscular and lean. He had his old pants to prove it. It made me rethink EVERYTHING. I love his soul. No matter how big or small he is. That is how people should see others. As humans. With souls. That hurt just like thinnies. Stepping in does suck though, I work retail. Never know how to .",False,False

I don't get why our society acts like being fat is the worst thing you can be. It's disheartening. Especially because it makes people think snide comments like that are okay.,False,False

No home training at all  I really hate society. “Love and be yourself” No, not like that  I guess to someone people, they think that insulting a person’s weight by called them pig, elephant legs, etc will motivate them by losing weight.

I recognized them later, after more than 200 pounds loss, of course the same (no longer kids but whatever), kids tried to hit on me and I shut them down hard.
