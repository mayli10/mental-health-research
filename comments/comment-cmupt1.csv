I spent $30 on Sunday and another $70 today. Growing up we didn’t really buy a lot of junk food or prepackaged stuff so maybe it’s fun for me to browse the frozen section and see all the low cal options???   And I also have a friend who we call the “snack queen”. She has a whole back room that all organized with different snacks and her fridge is stocked.   When my ed started my fridge was empty but now it’s not. When I see pictures of shopping carts filled with just Diet drinks and jello mix on this sub I’m so jealous. But then I’m inspired to go out and buy it and then I don’t make it and still buy the usual stuff I get. Endless cycle. I’m really gunna try to not shop for like a solid week and a half and finish what I have.,False,True

I also spend a lot of money on binge food, a very bad habit that I've been trying to stop but I replaced it with spending money on ""good"" food. I'm obsessed with granola bars, they should help me stop a binge when I'm craving something sweet but sometimes they become binge food too. Lastly I also have ""prize food"" like chocolate and stuff that I would never eat in a binge because it's food that I'll allow myself to eat only when I' reach a certain weight. And that's all about the stash I have in my wardrobe.",False,False

I spend so much time and money on groceries that it’s not even funny, in fact just 10 minutes ago I ordered $59 of dry goods on amazon that I don’t need or even really want just because it’ll feel so nice to have it in my house. And I’m grocery shopping tonight as well, too lmao.  I grew up poorish with lots of older siblings, so when I was growing up we weren’t going hungry exactly, but there definitely wasn’t an abundance of food. And on the rare occasion my parents bought some good shit, it was every man for himself. The chips or popsicles or whatever would disappear in a matter of seconds and, as a small weakling, I usually was left in the dust.  So I kind of fetishized being one of those kinds of people who always have food in their house. Good food. And lots of it. Actually, I’m more likely to binge eat when my hoard is running low — I think it activates that “eat fast or you’re not eating at all” part in my brain that’s left over from my childhood. When I have a lot of food to look at I can relax (and restrict) because there’s no pressure to eat it all really fast, I know it’s going to be there tomorrow.",False,False
