That's the last thing it wants to give up.  &amp;#x200B;  I'm recovered, but lately I've been struggling mightily with the temptation to weigh myself, which almost always leads to restriction/dieting. I have to remind myself every day that I stand in front of the cabinet where I keep my scale, that if I pull out that scale and weigh myself, I'm getting out of the driver's seat and letting Ed have a go. Every day I keep eating when I'm hungry and keep that scale in the cabinet, I'm empowering ME, the one who actually has a shot at living my life normally, being physically healthy, having a normal relationship with food (maybe some day). These days I might be a little fluffier than Ed wants me to be, but the thing is, I always was. I'm tired of slaving over being thin. I just want to be me. I want to stop caring about body fat, food, eating, etc. In order to do that, I have to live it. Some days still suck, but there are some days and weeks that go by honestly where life is just absolutely marvelous being recovered.",False,False
