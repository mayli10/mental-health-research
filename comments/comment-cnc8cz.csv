You can refuse them if you choose, but I would highly suggest you at least attempt to listen to their advice for a couple weeks to see how you feel afterwards. If it's not working for you, then please try to be as transparent with them as possible so you can help them help you. Take care friend.",False,False

See a dietician, that would be really helpful. Ultimately, you are in control of what you eat ; a dietician can work with you to examine some of the nutritional problems you're dealing with. They can't force you to do anything. Same goes for the doctor. You are still in control, they're just advisors. Tell them about the fear of losing control over what you eat. They will understand.  It was the best decision I ever made to tell my doctor about my ED... they never forced me to change, but they are helping me change what I do want to change.",False,False

She offered to book me in with a dietician but I refused because I can't stand the thought of someone else being in control of what I eat. I really can't put my mum through anything more emotionally than she's going through either, I feel like such a burden, I'm really lost",False,True
