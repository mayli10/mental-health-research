They were already messed up, so I didn't care.   They told me I'd kill myself. Big deal? I was suicidal anyway.   They told me I'd get ""too skinny."" I didn't believe in the concept and was willing to give it a go. After all, it had to be better than ""too fat.""  I wasn't scared to die. But what nobody told me is that I'D LIVE THROUGH IT and that one day, 15 years later, now age 30, I'd have a completely wrecked metabolism, a totally fucked digestive tract, and - get this - *ultimately wind up approximately the same weight as when I started, and hate myself at every weight, no matter how much I managed to temporarily lose.* That I'd still be purging in vain as a shitty coping mechanism because the endorphins help with my anxiety, even though **nothing** (not even fasting) seems to affect my weight anymore. Nobody told me that I'd still be as obsessed and self-loathing about my body - if not worse, because I've had half my life to stew in it. Nobody told me that there's no fucking end point. That's the nasty trick EDs play on us. There's no ""yay I made my goal weight, now to live a somewhat sane and normal life."" You're either fighting to lose weight, or fighting to keep what you've lost off, and those are the only options. forever. Don't start purging. I have bile reflux (which is worse than acid reflux) that makes me *involuntarily* vomit bile a few days a week, I have gastroparesis (so even when I DO eat, sometimes it just wont digest and I get so sick). And on top of that, there's the first two things to consider (your teeth, your life).",False,False

Because I‚Äôm trying not to restrict as much i‚Äôve been eating more often and I‚Äôve actually been purging more and it‚Äôs getting really bad. It‚Äôs causing crazy gastroperisis and I can barely keep anything down longer than an hour. Lately I‚Äôve even had my meds come back up because the gulp of water with them hurts my stomach.  My best piece of advice is try and eat with people (if that‚Äôs something you‚Äôre ready for) so you aren‚Äôt left alone after meals. Or go out for a walk or something after. Just have something to distract yourself.,False,False

IMMEDIATELY tho i panicked and tried to purge, but someone walked in. SO i went into the break room, which, mind you, is just a small room in the back of a small, quiet office, and purged what i could into the trash can back there. if anyone turned around, they could‚Äôve seen me or easily heard me from any of the desks. but that‚Äôs what you give up to the disorder, your fucking pride, sense of shame, self worth. nothing matters but getting it out and getting it out now. i know it‚Äôs like ‚Äúnah i would never do THAT‚Äù but honestly once it takes over like that, and it will, there‚Äôs no telling what it‚Äôll make you do.  so don‚Äôt do it man. don‚Äôt even try it. i‚Äôm telling you it‚Äôs an addiction and it will take over faster than you can imagine and impact every little corner of your life. i know i‚Äôm in a seriously bad state myself and i really need to recover or get help, cuz this road only ends in one of two ways: death or recovery. and i‚Äôm really not looking to die or suffer like this anymore. please don‚Äôt purge, not now not ever. it‚Äôs not worth it. i can‚Äôt even put into words the sheer misery and pain it causes.",False,False

I think we all have at some point or another.   To me I just need to run through the logic of it, it may seem fucked up but my usual justifications from talking myself down from the ledge (or rather rim) follow these lines:   - your girlfriend already things your ED is 100Z worse than it is. This would push her over the edge  - it's an addictive cycle and you are hella weak 3cats  - realistically it's not more effective than just restricting but it's far harder on the body.  - people will start to notice, start to take me seriously, I'll no longer be able to be honest to those around me that I could before - vomit doesn't bother me but I don't want to smell like it and I will go nose blind - you already do dumb shit to your heart- don't double it up  - your teeth are already fucked Man. - you used to smoke- your throat is still recovering from that probably?",False,False

My doctor threatened to take me off Adderall if I didn't stop purging because Ive had some issues with my heart (which started *before* I started purging so its not like that caused it...and still have those issues a year later lol). But I'm not sure I can hold my job without Adderall, so I just... stopped. I had a few rough patches and did it a few times, and I still 'purge' in other ways (like restricting after a binge) and tbh I am not really attempting to 'recover' yet... but I at least mostly stopped that one? But for a warning story, purging fucks with your heart and your electrolytes, and if you are taking something else that also fucks with that (like Adderall) it can be dangerous.  I don't really have a ton of tips for how I stopped either, I was at a point where I did it nearly daily for a while and then after that appointment, just was like ""Well guess I cant do this anymore"" and turned to more restricting instead. So I guess I just replaced it with a different form? I try to use distractions a lot too... When I have an urge I try to hyper-focus on something until I forget about everything else. I tend to use rhythm games for that since they require a lot of concentration.   My fiance used to purge too (I think she stopped? I hope) so I sometimes talk about it with her when I have the urge to... but I don't do that a lot cause I hate worrying her.",False,False
