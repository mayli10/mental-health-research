I feel like if i wear leggings people can see that I have smaller legs, and I can wear a baggy sweater and it almost makes my legs look smaller in comparison, so i donâ€™t have to worry about my stomach and i can still feel like I donâ€™t look like a giant blob",False,False

Mostly just around the house. And if Iâ€™m having a horrible body image day, Iâ€™ll also opt for something that swallows me up and hides my body.  But when Iâ€™ve been losing and I go out, like to a bar or club or event or something? I loooove showing off in revealing outfits.

A big part of me goes ""you look like a blob but if you wear huge stuff you look even blobbier"" so uh yeah let's avoid feeling worse.

If I feel thinner sometimes Iâ€™ll opt for a high waisted jean and a belt and tuck in a flowy top. That way Iâ€™m showing off my waist but hiding the rest of my body. I also only wear dark bottoms because Iâ€™m much leaner on my top half than lower half ,False,False

I hate wearing oversized or ill fitting clothing because I feel like it makes me look extra gross and really messes with my body dsymorphia. I like to dress cute and buy cute clothing because the only time I can actually admire myself is when Iâ€™m clothed lmaoooo. Plus I feel i can hide my flaws with my clothing lol. ,False,False
