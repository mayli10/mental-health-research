You didn't know, and it's an easy mistake for your friend to make if she's not used to reading ingredients and being super careful about animal products. It's not your fault, and it doesn't make you bad for eating meat accidentally. You're not bad.   Recently I ate a roll without checking and it turned out to have had egg in it, and I felt the same way. But one tiny mistake is nothing, I promise. I know it feels much, much bigger and it's hard to think about right now. Imagine how much meat you *haven't* eaten over your lifetime, and then compare that to the little powder flakes. See what I mean? It's a grain of sand in the universe. You're gonna be okay. You're not bad.   I'm really happy that you're trying so hard to be better, and that you have a friend there to support you along the way. Right now you need to focus on yourself and your recovery, and being forgiving and flexible is gonna need to be a big part of that. Be kind to yourself today, you totally deserve it.",False,False
