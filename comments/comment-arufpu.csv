But i had a one bday cake protein bar that was okay, as well as a premier one. The premier ones are very dense and maybe a little more high cal. Both have that weird crumbly texture kind of so if you dont like that, I'd go for a quest bar. Id like to try other flavors. I think the premier one was p filling. the one bar i ate during  a binge so cant help w that....  But tbh im addicted to clif choco chip + peanut butter. They have choco, nuts and  a pb flavor so like all my cravings and is around 270 cals but they have lower ones! so i bought a box of those. the only thing w clif is some bars taste like cardboard thats why I always get this kind. also all the nuts and oats makes it dense and filling.   All bars are lowkey not cheap though except the premier ones, so I'd try them and decide what price point you want!",False,False

When you say low sugar, how many grams is it? I'm trying to cut down on sugar and if it satisfies my sweet tooth then that would be amazing! (I'm high key convinced that the sugars in my current protein drink (Iconic Protein) got me addicted but like oh well)    Do u eat protein bars at all? I think a protein shake would be more filling bc it has more volume but protein bars (like quest) are circulating around in my mind as well.    Thank u for the review!!! I'll buy it this weekend when I go grocery shopping c:",False,True

It has a weird after taste, but I think I can get used to it. Low sugar but very chocolatey so I think it will curb cravings. Low cal so probs not best meal replacement. I will see if it keeps me full for a while since it is high protein.  the aftertaste is one of those chemical sweet ones to me, but maybe im crazy. My only qualms is it has milk and I'm trying to cut down on dairy but for its price I can ignore. I think I'm going to buy more of these and try the vanilla. Texture is fine to me as well. the taste reminds me of a fake sugar yoohoo flavor   rating: nothing spectacular but its a protein shake so i did not expect much and am fine drinking it again/5 ",False,False

I agree I'm gonna try some premier protein ones tomorrow (since its not even $2 a bottle) and see how I feel about shakes in general.
