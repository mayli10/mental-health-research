I brought it back to the space with lots of friends and folks around and ate it while everyone watched during the lunch break. And talked about how much I love poke (I do), how it was day 4 of eating sushi/poke (also true), how big the bowl was (except that since I refused any sauce it ended up being low cal).  They didn't see all the meals I skipped outside of the 1 meals a day I was having in front of folks. I did this to reassure folks I'm eating but it failed to convince a friend who asked others during a party if I ate more than just bananas that day. Which they did inform my friend that they saw me eat a large meal, but it was still so embarrassing to essentially be caught.",False,False
