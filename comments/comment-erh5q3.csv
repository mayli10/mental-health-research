Dropping weight steadily over the last few years which is nice.,False,False

Was mis-diagnosed with major depression until 2013 years ago. I alays gain weight during my depressive episodes as well! I just spend so much time c/s'ing and laying down. I don't necessarily lose weight when hypomanic either though, because I drink a loooot more alcohol. I only lose weight when I'm stable.",False,False

I gained a ton of weight between 18-19 and I’m 20 now and I’ve lost some weight but I’m still trying to lose more. I definitely eat way more than I should when I’m depressed and I eat healthier foods and restrict my calories if I’m feeling better. I wish I could be hypomanic all the time because all I do is clean and work out and I feel so much more productive.,False,False
