UGH) I will allow myself to eat a GIGANTIC salad with yummy low cal dressing and then a PB2 and jelly sandwich on 40 cal per slice bread, and if I still can't stop I'll eat some Halo top or skinny pop or something like that. Oh and chugging almond milk is a thing l do too. I've found that managing my binges to just be lower calorie stuff has kept my weight from fluctuating so much. Like someone else just said it's a bit of ""harm reduction"" so I don't have to go into as crazy of a restrict cycle after a binge. ",False,False
