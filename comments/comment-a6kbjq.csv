As long as you’re sure you’re not swallowing anything at all you should be good but I’m pretty sure it would be impossible not to absorb at least like 1-2% of the calories. ,False,False

When i bp’d i would almost always burst blood vessels in my face and generally looked so busted, plus it just took so much effort and caused a ton of anxiety. It just sucks that I’ve become so accustomed to c/s now i’ll literally do it in public :///",False,True

I was so sad!",False,False

Some things like chocolate will melt and go down. I've got a swallow reflex while I'm chewing and a little does go in. It depends on what I'm eating, but I'll guess calories accordingly. Rice? Those shitty little grains always make their way down. 10-20. Chocolate? Just don't. At least 20%. Crackers? Ain't shit, maybe 7.    This is just me guessing. I've chewed and spit a TON over the past few months but have still lost weight mostly on track. It's better than eating it all, that's for sure. ",False,False

If its greasy and melts (candy) then u can bet you're going to ingest some of that good stuff, stuff like bread that clings into itself even when chewing probably won't be ingested IF you only chew in the front part of your mouth. It really hasn't been researched at all :^/ i read on a website that the calories from c/s are negotiable, my rule of thumb is to never chew close to the back of your mouth, one thing is for sure though, it's less stressful than bping (I'm not encouraging it!! ever!! don't do any of this but we're all sick here fellas come on)",False,False
