I went from restricting to BED after sexual assault as well. I believe I did so in a way because I wanted comfort, and to feel 'invisible'. I went from being treated nicely to absolutely unacknowledged as I gained and gained, and in my mind this was good because I wanted to be left alone, especially by men (the gender that assaulted me.).   Unfortunately, for me at least, this took about 4 years to fix for me. But I eventually did, when I was ready. I restrict now about half the days of the week, which isn't ideal, but for me it is better than binge eating. I knew I was 'ready' because I couldn't handle looking fat anymore, something sort of clicked in me and I was just like 'fuck this'. It wasn't very climactic or magic, I sort of starting having a few 'good' days, a few 'restrictive' days, and it eventually lead into successful months and being binge free over a year.  I guess  I don't have any amazing, life-changing advice but what helped me is:  1. Writing a list of 100 things I enjoy about being a healthy-underweight weight  2. Getting therapy, and being honest with her about my binging  3. Being honest with myself, and forcing myself to food log even on binge days, having to see that 5,000 calories I ate was the best way to force myself out of denial. It hurt so much, to see the numbers and know that's over a pound gain, but it helped force me into grief and then acceptance that  I have an issue.  4. If you eat out of attention issues or overwhelming stress when trying to stop yourself from the binge, potentially seek psychiatry for something like Vyvanse or an SSRI or Wellbutrin.  5. Think about how you'll be happy once you stop, it is SO HARD to see that in the moment of the frenzy and cravings, but once you've been on a 'good' streak for a week+, you may really start to notice your mood change. I'm pretty sure the universal saying (with some scientific backing) is that it takes about 30 days to break the habit or at least lessen the cravings, and old habits die hard.  6. Try and keep a consistent, routine lifestyle. Sleep at the same time for a decent amount of time, eat meals at similar times (even if they end up in a binge, we're not perfect!) I feel best during routine, I feel like breaking down otherwise.  7. Please be patient with yourself of course. You can't hate yourself into normal habits or restrictive ones. It sounds like what you have been doing is to help you cope with the terrible trauma inflicted upon you, and it is understandable. You deserve compassion, sympathy, and empathy. You are worth that, and you need to know it for yourself. It may be hard to see, especially with everything that has gone on, but at the end of the day I assure you that people see you as so much more than a number, and you are, your interests, old hobbies (which are a great thing to pick back up on), studies, etc still all do matter and make you who you are too, we are disordered but a great thing to do is to try and stay relevant in them and keep up with friends and or family as well. Being social really helped me realize I was worth it and important to many, even just talking to people at school or work, you are worthy of compassion, and care and respect. I hope that if you don't already know that, that you will very soon. That was my biggest issue, that I did not feel worthy of anyone or anything.  8. Realize that binge eating (and ANA, to an extent, too) clouds your judgement, and that in that frenzied moment or intensive craving episode that you've stopped caring about everything but getting that food. This helped me before I went crazy with it because I had to be like 'Holy shit, it's okay me, you need to chill out, you'll get food, your eyes are bigger than your stomach' and helped me focus on what's way more important: myself, others, creating what I like and maintaining my life. I know this is super hard to do especially in the moment, but if you muster the will too, it can help.  9. Be patient with yourself, despite how awful it feels afterward. This goes back to 7, but you really survived something painful, and the healing process can take a little while. If you end up binging one meal on one day, I know it's so easy to sabotage the rest of the day, but avoiding that I feel is really key to helping get out of the mindset.  10. You're welcome here, and that subreddit, and all the support groups for it. Check in when you feel like you've lost control, even if it's often, we're around to talk to you and many of us have been there in some way shape or form. This community is so helpful, and reading it can definitely help to curb these habits I feel, because if you're not in 'binge-mode' and happen to cross by a post, it may make help not to binge later on, which is so useful with these forums.  I really wish you luck, OP. I know it's super hard. Facing up to it the way you are really is the first step into fixing the binging, I believe you'll be able to get control back, sometimes it may seem unattainable and impossible, but it's definitely in your realm of possibility to do so!",False,False
