Since I normally don't do that, I have no symptoms of GERD, and anyways all my actual symptoms started very suddenly last fall. The first GI not only was not convinced by this, he also never explained how GERD could possibly cause my lower GI symptoms despite me asking him multiple times. When I still wasn't getting better he suggested I should wait another month and try another GERD medication, which is when I got a referral to see someone else. And when I told him I vomited blood he told me to keep taking the medication. This was in April and I'm still mad lol.  And I hope your symptoms improve and that you get an answer and a treatment plan soon.",False,False

Just kept bumping up the dose and it was doing absolutely nothing for me while my symptoms just kept getting worse.   I hate that you're struggling with similar issues, but it is nice to know that I am not alone in this. I wish you the best and hope things continue to get better for you.",False,True

Thankfully it's been better since I stopped the GERD medication my first GI put me on (and kept me on for three months at increasingly higher doses despite me saying I had no symptoms of GERD). That doesn't explain why I was nauseous to begin with, but I'm just thankful it has gotten better for the moment.  I'm sorry you've gone through all that and still don't have any answers! It is really disappointing and frustrating not to have something clear you can actually address. I was tested for celiac and had an upper GI series (with small bowel follow through) to check for chron's, ulcers, etc. They didn't find anything (hence my eventual IBS diagnosis) but I also have some symptoms that suggest a GI bleed, which has yet to be found. If my nausea gets worse again they'll do an endoscopy.   I hope you get an answer soon. Dumping syndrome in particular sounds really scary.",False,False

I'm sorry to hear that you're in a similar boat. I've heard IBS can be very hard to deal with, and I hate that it's triggered your eating habits.   I've had 2 GI specialists, they've tested me for pretty much everything under the sun. I've had a scope that showed gastritis from the constant vomiting, they've done tests and scans on my gallbladder and pancreas, and checked for autoimmune disorders. I did have a stomach emptying study that showed I have severe dumping syndrome (my doc has absolutely no clue how I have it, as I've never had a stomach surgery of any kind which is a bit concerning). I do have a colonoscopy coming up that I've been waiting MONTHS for to check for IBS and Crohn's. If that's normal than I'm going to see an RD.   It's been a slow ride trying to get help with it all, and it's been disappointing. I wish you the best with your own health trouble.",False,True

I also found that restricting my diet, in both variety and amount, helped my GI symptoms, which later on gave me an excuse to engage in disordered behaviors under the guise of managing my symptoms. It is really difficult to deal with. My GI symptoms are actually quite a bit better at the moment, but now I'm left with an ED relapse that I have to deal with, and the knowledge that disordered eating can make GI symptoms worse in the long run, which makes this whole thing counterproductive.  Are you seeing a GI specialist? What have they tested for? Also, have you considered seeing an RD? They may be able to help pinpoint what foods are triggering your symptoms (if there are specific triggers) and to help increase variety in your diet gently while you get this figured out.",False,False
