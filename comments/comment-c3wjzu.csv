I was at 600-700 calories a day most days, just because I'd been restricting so long I never wanted to eat more and I had no desire to eat ""healthy"" because I looked decent at 165. I'm thinking lots of water weight but it still sucked. And for the first month I literally only moved to go to the bathroom and that's it because I was walking straight legged and it hurt, so I was really really restricted lol",False,True

Metabolism doesn't slow down that much even after heavy restriction, but I guess it makes sense if it slowed to, say, 14-1500 cals, eating at a 2-300 cal per day surplus since April should only result in \~5-7 actual lbs gained.  &amp;#x200B;  I've never gained abnormal amounts of weight during treatment stints, and that's at less than half your weight...but I have noticed that when I reach very low weights by eating 1000+ cals a day, I don't have crazy 7-10 lb fluctuations after a binge, while if I reach a low quickly through fasting or low restricting, the water weight can come back easily, because the actual fat lost isn't as much. So it's possible that at 165 and ""not eating much"" (how much, btw?) your glycogen levels were heavily depleted, so now that you're eating a normal amount, the few pounds gained plus additional 10 lbs of water weight is what you're seeing, but it's not like you gained 20 lbs of fat eating a normal 1700 cals.",False,False

My TDEE was roughly 1750 (before the wreck and weight gain) but the dietitian did warn me going from not eating much to eating ""normally"" could cause weight gain. I guess that mixed with the decrease in activity has screwed me but I didn't think it would be that bad.",False,True
