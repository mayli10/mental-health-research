Soda is carbonated/flavored water after all. Caffeine is a diuretic though, so you may want to consider adding in some caffeine-free diet coke if you really can't drink anything else, to help avoid dehydration.   &amp;#x200B;  Have you ever tried flavor powders for water? You can usually get them for pretty cheap at places like Aldi or Walmart, and they can make water palatable if you can't stand it plain. Fruit punch and grape flavors are delicious! (-: Crystal Lite, Propel, and Hawaiian Punch are some of my favorites, and you can buy generics and sometimes bulk sizes of most them for even cheaper. I think even Kool-Aid has a sugar free option now, too. ",False,False

When I started drinking that I just didn’t like soda anymore, it got too sweet and feels flat compared to the water.  I get off brand because it’s cheaper, and coconut has the most flavor. It also has sodium (just 5 g, but none of the others have any) which is good if you’re low on electrolytes. ",False,False

It gives it flavour without being overpowering and I get more water. Every time the bottle gets halfway done I fill it with more water and eventually it gets diluted enough that it's like 90%water and my tastebuds are okay with that,False,False

Tea is always good, you can make it as strong or weak as you like it, plus the warmth and caffeine suppresses my appetite a bit.  I get sugar free Powerade and mix it with water, usually 1/4 Powerade and the rest water.  It really helps with the tap water flavor.  Flavored seltzer water like la croix is pretty tasty.  Probably the strangest one is taking a gallon pitcher of water and putting one bag of green tea and a squeeze of lemon.  Take the tea out after a few minutes and you’re left with really refreshing cold water.",False,False

I’m fine, my skin is amazingly clear, my digestion is good, I’m well hydrated, helps with my appetite and if I’m not eating but have a Coke Zero/Pepsi Max in my hand people don’t care or notice.  I do however make sure I get lots of calcium through almond milk (tea), non fat yogurt and supplements because on top on your ED, colas seem to deplete calcium bc of the excess phosphorus. Also be mindful of your dental health.   I can’t drink water regularly enough to stay hydrated, I found out kombucha was high FODMAP and causing my bloating literally just 2 days ago, and too much tea gives me headaches.

I feel terrible when I drink anything unhealthy and for my soda is the top of the unhealthy drinks... you could try adding flavor to your water with some tea bags and Splenda, healthier for you and will help with water retention.
