Also a lot of women don't want to know they have a 32 inch waist with a 45 inch hip. at only a 28 long.... I had a hard time swallowing the fact that at 140 lbs I'm a 40 inch hip. with a 28 inch waist. Those measurements are hard to hear when you've never used them before. But I agree.",False,False

Then I decided it still wasn’t true because they were all stretch jeans. At every store I could not find a pair of jeans that weren’t “stretch” jeans. ",False,False

Usually when I have to go to a store I grab at least three different sizes of the same item then head to the fitting room. Once I figure out what size I am at that store I go back and browse and pick out clothes I like. Then I end up not buying any of it because rarely do I think I look good in something, regardless of my size. ",False,False

But target is a little weird but not as into VS as other places. Go by waist and hip measurements if you want your ""true"" size. Its so weird now how bad its gotten over the past like 10 years.

Every store they are completely different. You might also be experiencing some BD which the whole irrational number sizing thing doesn't help in the slightest.   Buying pants sucks. ,False,False
