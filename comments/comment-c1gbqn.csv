Mine asked me point blank if I’d been throwing up and I told him, he just reminded me that it could really fuck my teeth up long term.  Best way to go is not to purge, but obviously that’s much easier said than done. Don’t brush afterwards, do the gargle already suggested, and try to minimize how much you purge if you can.",False,False

But there are other reasons why people experience enamel loss or decay so they won’t immediately know its bulimia, but they can make an educated assumption. If you feel comfortable, tell them that you’ve been struggling with purging or acid reflux. They can give you more suggestions to help protect your teeth and they won’t be able to tell anyone else what you’re struggling with (confidentiality rules if that’s something you’re worried about)..Take care of yourself &lt;3",False,False

If you do purge, make a mix of one pint of water (16 oz) with 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda.  Gargle (don’t swallow) for 30-60 seconds. This helps prevent infection and helps to neutralize the stomach acid that purging brought up. Brush your teeth twice a day like normal and floss frequently but try the baking soda mix right after your purge and rinse with water or drink a Gatorade/sports drink to help replace electrolytes.",False,False
