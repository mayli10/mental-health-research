I just say I have a ton of allergies/intolerances so I can’t eat out. Works with ppl who don’t know me too well.,False,False

Yeah, force-feeding is a great way to alleviate someone's *anxiety about food*.  Sometimes a compromise that works on my end is ordering Whatever then taking it home in a takeaway box. Then you can eat it on your terms, later.",False,False

Fuck off. He knows I have issues with food, but he thinks it's funny to tell me ""go eat a fucking sandwich."" Like how about you kiss my ass? Are you trying to throw me into heavier restriction? Because that's where that leads. My ED brain will give me a big old ""fuck you and fuck that"" and just refuse to eat at all.",False,False

I know it's something to work on but atleast I dont feel bad about it ( like u said leading to negative consequences anyway) so thank you so much ;\_\_:,False,False

Even if it's socially stigmatizing. My bf lives with 2 room mates and so far anytime I've gone over and started eating- well, I just ended up binging and being even more cringy with my ED patterns. I would legit just start vacuuming through their food AND C/Sing into bags that I had to sneakily get rid of so his room mates wouldn't find them. Now, I just try to say I'm not hungry or I'm gonna eat later. I know if I do it enough, they're going to catch on... But I DON'T CARE. I would rather be that weird girl with a possible eating disorder than that girl who literally scarfs down all the food in the house and than isolates herself because she's depressed and bloated. My bf doesn't understand and makes me feel like it's such a big deal that I don't want to eat in public/around his friends. I get that it can seem weird but I'd rather that than the former. I definitely base my social life off my ED and I try to hang with people when I'm a day into a fast that way I don't feel like I'm starving but I also don't feel so full to the point I can't even think straight.  People with normal relationships with food don't understand the mental Olympics we play just to be able to not focus on when we're gonna eat and how much. Don't hold it against them, though, just politely decline and say you aren't hungry or that you have a strict diet plan. Everyone is entitled to living their life how they want, just remember that, and hopefully the people in your life will catch on and stop hounding you about it.",False,False
