They sell these body scales where both the scale and packaging are absolutely covered in cutesy animals or Marvel characters. Like, excessively. I felt weird about buying a scale too, so I went and spent 20$ on random Marvel home furnishings (along with a scale) and nobody batted an eye. It just seemed like cute themed stuff on sale.  In fact, the packaging is so covered in theming you have you search on the box's fine print to find out that it's a scale.",False,False

Sometimes *wildly* differently.  I'm aware of the discrepancies that can occur from even moving a scale a foot to the left of where you had it before, and I've fallen into that trap of weighing myself in 72 different areas of my house to try and find a median, it's all a recipe for driving yourself crazy by overthinking.  That's what I was trying to get at. Stick to one scale, keep it in the same area, and use it as a measure of your weight fluctuations, rather than a religiously true testament to your exact body weight, y'know? There are too many traps to fall into when it comes to scales.",False,False

I stepped on it while I was &gt;!130!&lt; lbs and weighed... 6 more. I was 6 lbs heavier than I thought. I took my old scale out and weighed at the weight I thought I was before.
