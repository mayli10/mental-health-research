I've been recovered for 4 years which kinda killed the body dysmorphia. I'm just afraid of becoming fat again which is just 5-10lb away from my current weight so I'm trying to control my weight in a very narrow range.   But no I definitely don't look too fat anymore.,False,False

I don't want to be underweight. I want to look soft and feminine and pretty again :/  Yes! This is exactly where I am!! Honestly I hate to say this, it makes me feel so lame and needy, but the decrease in male attention that I receive when I'm this thin is so disheartening. Feeling attractive is terribly important to me and I'm not just not right now. ",False,True

I’m aware that I’m objectively thin (not underweight, but coming close to it) and I can see myself as others would see me, although I often question it. I look decently fit, by today’s standards anyway, and I’m aware of it even though I doubt myself constantly. I even think certain parts of me are almost too thin already, and that I wouldn’t want to lose more in some areas. However, I’m pear shaped, so even being small-ish overall, my thighs and legs look disproportionate and NOT skinny. So I’m constantly trying to reduce them a bit more. I know I’ll never fully be able to change my shape, but I try. And like someone else said, I do also want to give myself that buffer so I could safely gain a little bit? It’s not really logical, and I shouldn’t be so hard on myself, but I keep convincing myself that I’m not acceptable even though I KNOW it isn’t true and my body is fine.   I don’t really ever look in the mirror and see myself as fat .... I just see myself as unacceptable? It’s the small flaws that I can’t stop obsessing over, and it kills me. ",False,False

Sometimes I do worry that my eyes are broken and the scale is lying and what if I actually AM too big and the universe and my treatment team are conspiring against me and trying to trick me into thinking I'm too thin when I'm actually not.

I’m only barely underweight, and know I’m underweight, but my main drive for striving to lose more is the constant fear that I’m suddenly going to fuck it up and gain a bunch.
