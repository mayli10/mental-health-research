If you gain weight back quickly, it will tend to gather around your midsection (and very slowly redistribute over time) but I don't think anything impacts how you LOSE it (aside from just your body fat distribution and how your body chooses to lose it)  Starvation diets will do nothing great for your body composition, honestly, because you can't gain muscle on a deficit. In fact, I think any time you lose a lot of fat you tend to lose some muscle as well. So basically, yeah... for a fit body, you do need to exercise. I think working out on a deficit still helps you retain muscle even if losing some of it is inevitable.",False,False

My mom spent my whole teen years calling me fat and whenever I‚Äôd tell her to stop she‚Äôd say she was doing it out of love and that Canadian/American parents not being brutally honest with their kids is why these countries have problem with obesity. When I was 18 I went on vacation with a group of my family friends and this woman told my mom ‚Äúyour daughter could be pretty if she lost 30 lbs‚Äù. I was like a BMI of 25 or 26 at that point so I was a lil chubby at most but to Russians I might as well have been obese. My mom then told me how she said I needed to lose weight, I said ‚Äúyeah I know I need to lose like 15lbs‚Äù and she was like ‚Äúhaha no 30 at least‚Äù. My mom also spent that whole trip talking about what a nice body one of my family friends had. Girl was maybe a very fit BMI of 19 at most, worked out every day of the trip, and pretty much lived off fruit and salad at our all inclusive resort.   Guess who spent the next three years repeatedly losing 10-20 lbs just to gain half of it back each time and dealing with never ending cycles of binging and restriction. I‚Äôm down almost 30 lbs now and everyone thinks I just outgrew my chubbiness or developed a healthier/more active lifestyle when I went to college because the weight loss was so gradual and I‚Äôm still a healthy weight.

But I think there's a couple factors (obviously not everything) but from my understanding 1. Korean culture is very homogenous, so the pressure to be thin is more pervasive, and beauty standards are more strict (as in, people will agree on beauty ideals more than in other countries with a more diverse population) this may be compounded by the fact that 2. People of an Asian ethnicity are frequently slimmer/have a smaller frame, so being a low BMI is less likely to *seem* unnatural (OBVIOUSLY there is HUGE individual variation here) and 3. Korean culture does not consider personal comments to others (who are already close) to be as rude as in other cultures (further cementing beauty ideals because they're more likely to perpetuated in daily life, perhaps) 4. Korean women seem to be generally afraid of bulking and therefore are not as keen on exercise as a weight loss method because of this  But I think these factors may be a reason the diet culture is so entrenched. I think it's likely that many young people in Korea are aware, to some degree, that starvation diets and other disordered nonsense is unhealthy, but perhaps they belief the social payoff is just worth it.  There's other things I can think of too.. I don't think the fitness craze of the 80s hit Korea nearly as hard (if at all? I know little about Korea in the 80s) so being fit and muscular doesn't seem to have ever been held in such a high regard. So weight loss efforts tends to emphasize just being THINNER, not fitter. And indeed a starvation diet is about the quickest way to get thinner, not fitter.  Obviously this is not the whole picture at all and you have to take what I say with a grain of salt anyway because I'm not Korean and have never been to Korea lol",False,False
