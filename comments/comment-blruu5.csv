I'm just not disciplined like I was a few months ago. This weekend went off the rails because I decided to socialize with some old friends, and I wanted to just let go and eat/drink like a normal person but that's a slippery slope because once my body remembers how good it feels to have excess carbs/energy, the cravings kick in. The 5 lbs didn't spontaneously appear over the weekend but I've been getting sloppy and a couple 3000+ cal days just pushed it over the edge I think.  But I do appreciate the pep talk, thanks. It is always good to remember how crazy fluctuations can be.",False,True

I'm sensitive to a lot of sweeteners so I like to get plain-ass whey isolate and mix it up with oatmeal/cocoa/lil bit of sugar. Protein bars sound easy and tasty though.,False,True
