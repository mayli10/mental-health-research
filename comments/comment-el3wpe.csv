Good luck with everything!  (Below is a medical resource that a lot of hospitals use for information)   UpToDate article: “Pharmacotherapy alone appears to be less efficacious than psychotherapy alone, and combining the two appears to be the best approach. Nevertheless, pharmacotherapy is efficacious for bulimia nervosa and may be included in the initial treatment regimen, along with nutritional rehabilitation and psychotherapy. However, using pharmacotherapy alone is reasonable if specialized nutritional services or psychotherapy are not available. For patients with bulimia nervosa who are treated with pharmacotherapy, we suggest fluoxetine as first-line treatment rather than other medications (Grade 2C). The target dose is 60 mg per day.”",False,False
