She will figure out she's gone wrong, and she'll have a very easy standard of measurement to figure that out- her weight. Put simply, if she's really undertracking that much and overeating, she's either going to maintain or gain. Or maybe she will lose weight, but very slowly. So, when she starts complaining or comes to you to ask for help, tell her ""if you're gaining/maintaining at the calorie deficit you think you're at, then you're probably undertracking your calorie intake"" simple as that. She'll have to figure it out herself, and as such she'll only have herself to be upset with.",False,False
