No matter what people said about how awful it would make my life... I didn‚Äôt care. I was borderline suicidal and wanted a socially acceptable form of self harm in a way, you know?  I am recovered now actually, and if there was one thing that might have stopped me, it would be hearing about how insane, unexpected, and difficult recovery would be (because at the end of the day... I never would have wanted to stay anorexic for decades). So if you ever want to talk about it or just anything ED/self harm related, my inbox is always open.  Just know that you are absolutely not a terrible person for feeling this way or even feeling like you wouldn‚Äôt want to stop yourself from developing full blown anorexia. You can‚Äôt help how you feel, first of all, and second of all, anorexia often stems from a shitload of deeply engrained issues that have been preestablished for years. Before an ED I totally felt ‚Äúfake‚Äù; after an ED I feel like I was a ticking time bomb. You‚Äôre just as sick as us, really. I hope one day you can get the help you need.  And thank you :) it‚Äôs so true that though we struggle, we struggle together. I and the rest of this sub care for you too! Whatever happens, I hope one day you can find respite. You deserve it.",False,False

I'm overweight as well although I'm not really sure how to classify mine. I'm not diagnosed either which probably feeds the ""imposter syndrome"".   I know that people are worried but Idk the way it was a few days ago, whatever they genuinely feel don'y translate properly into text. It was just a lot of words of ""People who don't have ED don't belong here"" (non-verbatim)   There was a post about it and it just stuck with me. They were talking about age limits as well? My memory is a bit hazy now. ",False,True

I was looking it up and it fascinated me in some way because it's such a taboo topic for some reason compared to self harm.   Restricting helped my self confidences and self control actually, I used to be a self harmer. I stopped when I started restricting- something new to control, I suppose.   Yeah, it really suck having a voice tell you youre just a desperate fat kid and even the ""thin ones""  don't think you'll be enough. (It's the way I see it and gives me insecurities but I do know everyone in this sub is struggling and also care for you) ",False,True

Even just disordered thoughts were totally allowed to get off your chest.   I‚Äôm overweight. I have binge eating disorder. Not what one usually expects of eating disorders, but the sub was always welcoming to me.   I‚Äôm sure no one would be mad or upset at you, probably just discourage disordered behavior since it can be a pretty messy trap to fall into.   Anyways, don‚Äôt apologize or feel bad for what you feel or think. Try and be healthy and take care of your mental and physical health.",False,False

Of course if anyone can they should turn back from anorexia at all costs but imo there shouldnt be this attitude that ‚Äúwannaberexics‚Äù dismiss the suffering of ‚Äúreal‚Äù anorexics. Anyone who would want to emancipate themselves for society or whatever reason is struggling and needs help.  That all only applies if you haven‚Äôt engaged in anorexic behaviors yet. If you restrict/have other anorexic symptoms but aren‚Äôt ‚Äúthin enough‚Äù then you‚Äôre still an atypical anorexic no matter what weight you are.  In both situations the ED is trying to give you imposter syndrome so you‚Äôll cling onto it more. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre feeling like this. Thinking that you aren‚Äôt enough in some way always sucks :/,False,False
