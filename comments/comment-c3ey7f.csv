I was super ashamed and embarrassed to tell my therapist too. But I'm so glad I did because now I'm able to get the help I really need most from her.

Just chiming in to comment on your therapy situation.  I felt the same way when I was in therapy. I felt like the kick I got out of outsmarting my therapist was better than the help he could provide me with if I opened up- I wasn't fully ready to work on myself, I just wanted to look and pretend the part. There's nothing wrong with that, though. It just takes time- it's what smart people do when people tell them they're stupid, trust me :D  i'm proud of u!! &lt;3",False,False

I've even thought about sending it to him and asking to have phone sessions a few times after so I don't have to look him in the eye while I have a fresh wave of shame washing over me. I wish I would just get over myself cause my therapist is such a smart and kind person and I love talking to him. It's just that I've been called fat as an insult (like how people use gay as an insult) so much by so many different people that anything that even alludes to it makes me panic.,False,True

I've been through something very similar. I managed to lose it 110 pounds, and then put that same amount on again, in less than a year because of mad, insane, maniacal bingeing. Until I was 155 pounds overweight. \*everyone\* commented on it, and i became so triggered by people's even looking at me and depression/self hatred that I stopped leaving the house, quit my job, everything.  I can only really share what helped me, so here goes. I kept trying. even though each try to stop failed miserably, keep trying. I think what helped me turn a corner, was managing to say, in a terrified, ashamed, hesitant way to my therapist that I maybe sorta struggled a bit with binge eating. and her response was not disgust, revulsion, dismissal or judgement, like I fully expected. Like i knew she wouldn't *say* anything too horrible, but I was expecting her face to change, to show one of those things. But she didn't. She acted as though that was totally understandable, based on the exxperiences I have had. It was a hugely validating experience, and I felt lighter walking out. Like, yes, I actually DO have a problem with binge eating. And there's a REASON for it. it's not my fault, it is an understandable reaction to relentless bullying, a toxic and insensitive family and immense self hatred. And it's the same with you. You don't deserve this, you're punishing yourself for the behaviour of others.   That didn't stop my bingeing like a miracle, but it started a change, and within months I was able to restrict again, slowly, with a few less binges each week. If i wanted to binge, I did, but I would think 'this is a symptom of a larger problem, a symptom of trauma and pain. this is not because I am a bad, or pathetic, useless person.' and the times between binges just naturally lengthened. I was then able to transition into restricting  (not healthily either i admit) but I am losing that weight again, with only a few binges that pause the downward trend of weight, rather than cause it go back up again.   I don't have much else to offer than to say that your binge eating is a symptom, a sign that you are hurting and in pain. Your depression and eating disorder doesn't make you a bad, useless person. Your weight is in no way correlated to your worth. You deserve kindness, and respect, and love, and no one around you gives that to you with their awful comments and careless insults. A little understanding goes a hell of a long way.   Please don't beat yourself up over your bingeing, you really deserve some kindness for a change. It's really hard when the abuse is coming from the inside, too.",False,False

To be honest I don't know if my therapist is the best for me. He's smart and I like talking to him but I feel like I like picking his brain more than I like talking about myself. I'm thinking if he was good for me wouldn't I be able to speak freely? Idk if I'm just fucked up but even thinking about talking about it makes me have panic attacks.

There is nothing to be ashamed of - especially with your therapist. Getting the help you deserve is not in anyway shameful or something to be afraid of. If your therapist is truly good and you trust her (i've seen some people have crazy therapists in this sub damn) you should tell her. I understand that being judged is very scary but.. getting the help you need - especially when you are ready - is so much more crucial. :) i'd say consider talking to your therapist about it. You never know.",False,False
