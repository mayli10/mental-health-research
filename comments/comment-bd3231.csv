Years ago I ate three meals and a snack everyday, 1500 calories and maintained an underweight BMI with just a bit of walking. Even overeating for a day won't do much damage. They also might unintentionally compensate and you just don't see it. But yeah, the average person can eat A LOT and not gain in the long run, and so can a thin person if they're just eating maintenance calories. Bodies don't need an insane amount of energy, but they do need a lot.",False,False

So any weight gain would not be noticeable if you see them daily or even weekly,False,False
