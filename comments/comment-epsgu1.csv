Keep me updated, if you’re alright with that. Good luck! Feel free to message me if you want ☺️",False,True

I told my mom about this because she always had similar problems (two years ago she lost all hearing in the left ear and doctors still can’t explain why that happened) so we’re going to an specialist this week.  Thank you, we may finally find the right diagnose!",False,False
