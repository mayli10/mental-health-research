I was struggling badly when we met and it is really motivating to go over to the flat and really get a gauge of normal eating lol.

My SO is very in tune with my eating. I didn‚Äôt really have to tell him on the first place, because he already had suspicions. It‚Äôs helpful because I don‚Äôt have to fully hide it when I‚Äôm having a hard time. He makes sure I have breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and checks in when it‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve eaten or have something big coming up. Luckily he had some prior knowledge about it. More importantly, him and I are in agreement that if you have a mental issue that‚Äôs getting in the way, you should deal with it as proactively as possible. He has a son and I believe I have the responsibility to be the best influence on him as I can. He really doesn‚Äôt have patience for drama or fights between us, strong misplaced emotions, etc. He‚Äôs just really practical. Hard to explain.",False,False

It hasn‚Äôt changed anything. I‚Äôm working on my recovery but he‚Äôs neither really been a negative or positive influence in it at all.  I know he cares, but he doesn‚Äôt really do much to show it. I‚Äôve told him I need his support, preferably in the form of verbal affirmations and comfort and so forth and he said okay, but he hasn‚Äôt really given that to me. And while I‚Äôm not holding out for him to do this and for him to be my savior in this (which I DON‚ÄôT want) part of me feels like he‚Äôs just kind of waiting for me to magically get better (he‚Äôs got a looong road ahead for that!). He‚Äôs been passive as hell. I suppose there‚Äôs nothing he really can do or knows how to help but I don‚Äôt know, it just feels like he‚Äôs been pretty apathetic about it all. Not to mention I‚Äôm terrified of gaining weight, partially because I‚Äôve internalized all his comments about bigger women and the implications behind them about how the bigger they are, the more unloveable they become. So it‚Äôs kind of like, I can‚Äôt win here. Lol.",False,False

That said, I'm very comfortable talking abt my ED with him &amp; he's been the most understanding and supportive person ever. It took him some time to ""get it,"" but i rarely feel the need to hide my behaviors or thoughts from him b/c he is not judgemental.  I think having a judgmental partner would be much more harmful and stressful, but I got very lucky.  He wants me to get better, but he is not pushy or manipulative or weird about it. He knows my safe foods, and what sends me spiraling and hobestly he's my rock -- if I ever choose to recover for real, it would be impossible alone.",False,False

I felt bad about holding that piece of information from someone who was supposed to know everything about me. My wife tries her best to understand and will listen to me, but won't entertain my attempts to get her to slip up and trigger me.
