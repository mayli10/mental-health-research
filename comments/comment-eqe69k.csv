I tell myself every time, ""Can you go on with life, eating whatever you want without thinking about the calories? Three meals a day. Don't weigh yourself, don't look at your naked body in the mirror. No restricting, fasting, just move on like anyone else"".  Thinking about doing that makes me feel ill and I start to panic a little. And that's how you know you're not faking it.",False,False

I restrict as long as possible and then I get to a point where I break it with a binge (or 2 or 3...) and then I usually feel super guilty about the binge and try to restrict again but it often ends up that after that I just fall back in to a more normal amount of calories and eating pattern. I understand you.,False,False
