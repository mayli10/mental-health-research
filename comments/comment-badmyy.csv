I'm a former crack addict and sugar can gove me cravings just like crack did. If I eat something sugary I want more and more and more. I've had to cut out sugary stuff completely. No candy no ice cream no sugar. The only way for me to stay off of crack is to not do any, and I'm finding it's the best way to keep away from sugar too.",False,False

Bananas were never a fear food for me because I just literally cannot imagine having to choke down some of the shit I eat without the added sweetness. And I've got hella health anxiety so I would've thought that looking at how much sugar I eat (quite a fucking bit lol) compared to what's 'safe' would be a deterrent but apparently *this* is the hill I'm willing to die on. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ ,False,False
