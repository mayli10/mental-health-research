(*Corn isn't even a vegetable.*..) I never noticed any change to my skin tone, but maybe I just didn't eat enough. One of my favourite foods is this carrot cake smoothie I found a recipe for online over a year ago. I like making meal plans that are super optimized so I could eat the same thing every day if I wanted and still be really healthy. I'm kind of bad at it and always end up including one of those smoothies because idk where else to start with getting all of the vitamins and minerals I need. If I actually followed my meal plans like I plan to I would be consuming a whole cup of carrots every day. I wonder if that would be enough to change my skin tone.",False,False
