I don't go to the dentist much but last time I did, it had been like a decade of purging and no dental checkups and they were all good.   (Seriously though, for anyone else reading, don't take this as negating the warnings about purging and your teeth. There's no way to know if bulimia will destroy your teeth or not. I just got lucky ðŸ™ƒ.)",False,False

So I really donâ€™t think I have good or any stomach acid. That probably explains why it takes me so long to digest stuff but idk,False,False

I donâ€™t have strong/any stomach acid I think, because Iâ€™ve never thrown up acid. It usually comes out exactly the same taste as I ate it, no burning or anything. At my lowest I was purging 20+ times a day and still didnâ€™t throw up acid. Itâ€™s hard for me to recover because I donâ€™t throw up acid and I throw up without using my hands, so idk I think I was just born to be bulimic.",False,False

Some episodes of reflux or stomach pain still happen sometimes but usually last a day. I sell it as ""gastrite nervosa"" to the doctor (i don't know the term in english, it's like when you get stomach pain out of stress), it can be treated but if you don't stop purging it will always come back. I've been told at my ED clinic it comes also with restricting, but I never did it so I can't say...",False,False
