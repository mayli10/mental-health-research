Like in those moments where I‚Äôm truly stuffed I see snapshots of who I used to be, get these weird urges to read x or go out of the house tomorrow before the evening and do x...

I used to love reading, writing, playing videogames, sewing, etc. Now when I'm bored I look at grocery store websites, or food-related videos.
