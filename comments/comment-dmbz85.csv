What you did wasn't wrong, but she probably doesn't have a way to look at her situation from your perspective. You're both young, and I think it's harder to see if from someone else's eyes when you're being abused and what options you have.   Maybe apologise for how she might be feeling rather than the actual reporting to CPS? What you did came from a loving place and you don't deserve to punish yourself for that. To me, it shows that you are a loving and compassionate person who just wants to help.   I hope you can rid yourself of some guilt, you don't deserve to be so hard on yourself.",False,False
