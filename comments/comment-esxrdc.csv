Comes out to 115 calories, but tastes like a pumpkin spice latte.   It‚Äôs an obnoxious order though lol, and I only trust one person to make it as a cappuccino instead of an overly foamy latte.",False,False

I only do it when I get it to go because I'm pretty sure I'd get weird looks if I did it in the store lol. It ends up being about 40-50 calories!,False,False
