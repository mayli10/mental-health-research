I still ended up responsible for my family's deductible because I was covered under their insurance, and this last year I was on my own health plan. According to a spreadsheet I have all told I've spent ~$21,000 on deductibles, copays, premiums, and non-covered services (mostly out-of-network therapy and med refills on a weird schedule due to dosages changing quickly). I would be dead without treatment, and relative to my income and future earning potential it's absolutely a solid investment, but it's not like I wouldn't prefer to be happy, healthy, and 20k wealthier eithher",False,False

Treatment fucks up your perspective of what's ""a lot""; I forget the exact number, but something north of 50% of patients in res+ are on their second admission or more, and I met many, many people who had cumulatively spent years of their life in treatment.  As for programming, I've only been to a few of those myself - ERC in Bellevue for Res and PHP, Emily Program Seattle for Res and PHP, Veritas for IP and Res, Monte Nido Boston for PHP, CfD Portland for IOP.   Honestly, CfD was far and away the most helpful in terms of remission of symptoms post-discharge ‚Äì I went from purging multiple times a day to being three months B/P free now. At the same time, due to the circumstances around my time there with massive staff changes (and a godawful RD who is somehow the only employee directly involved in treatment left!?) it was one of the least directly helpful experiences. Meal support got me eating again and change in mindset was enough to do the rest.  At the same time, there have been so many other changes in my life (and so much therapy) that I think to assign responsibility to any one is impossible. I am now technically back to being diagnosable as AN-R, so I'm not recovered in any sense, but getting out of the B/P cycle feels like a massive victory and makes me believe that a fuller recovery might be possible some day.",False,False

Nobody seemed to actually like their job or the patients.I don't know what was up. It would have made more sense had it been an ill-equipped generalized mental health unit.   And wow, thanks again for so much explanation. I've gotten myself *almost* to a healthy weight so I don't expect I'd have to do a lot of weight restoration. I'm mostly looking for help with b/p.

That's generally always shitty :(  I am a big fan of the Emily Program; I know people who've been to the Adolescent location in Ohio and went through res and PHP in Seattle myself and think they did an amazing job with hiring people who cared and wanted to be there.   It wouldn't be my first choice if I had to do 20+lbs of WR just b/c the way meal plans scale there and having no meal choices isn't how I'd want to do it, but other than that food was good, staff were great, programming was decent, etc. ",False,False

Being treated like a naughty puppy by the staff in IP is a lot of why it was so ineffective. They were needlessly infantilizing us and it just reinforced my self-esteem issues and left me with a nasty stubborn streak. That sounds promising. ,False,True

Like I fucking *loathed* Veritas and tell 99% of people to stay the fuck away, but if you had BPD and were bulimic, I think it'd be a great program. Monte Nido and McCallum can be decent for exercise, Castlewood (or Aloria or whatever it's called now) and River Oaks are decent for trauma, CfD is excellent if you have trouble preparing food yourself and want a smaller program, Emily Program does a great job of recognising you're an adult and not taking away privileges unnecessarily, etc‚Ä¶ There are enough options in the US that there's probably something that will be at least decent enough, and then the hard work is up to you ;)",False,False

People leaving treatment and are either unhappy and liable to bitch about it on the internet (MPA, EDC, etc. are pretty filled with these), still in their disorder and trying to avoid thinking about it, or in recovery and focused on their next meal. So much of it comes down to milieu and timing too ‚Äì someone can have a totally shit experience one month, and another person can have the exact same staff, meal plan, programming and a slightly more positive cohort the next and have a great one.  IMO the best reviews come from people you either know and trust the persepctive of (maybe friends from IP?) or those who're in the weird semi-recovery stage where you still want to hang out in ED communities where reviews get posted, but you're not totally opposed to getting better, AND you've bounced in and out of treatment enough to have perspective on what's good, what's bad, and what's necessary.  For example, ERC Denver is hold happy. If you've got SI or are medically compromised enough for them to have a plausible reason to keep you and you try to leave, you're not getting out of there without a court battle that, at least in CO, you'll lose. None of the people who go through that process leave happy‚Ä¶but it's also saved their lives in many cases ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",False,False
