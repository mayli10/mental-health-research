As in, more calories (and protein) than you would need to just maintain your current weight. It’s almost impossible to gain muscle while gaining no fat, but it is possible to look like you’ve gained no/very little fat. You can target your macros to be very protein heavy, and if you want to prevent water weight buildup (which will happen when you weight lift, but it’s NORMAL), you can stick to a low carb/higher fat diet with a high protein goal (1g of protein per pound of body weight daily). You can’t be afraid to gain weight if you want to build muscle and you’re underweight. I highly recommend switching to a tape measurer as progress if water weight and daily fluctuations in weight are gonna bug you a lot. I’ve found the best exercise program for me to gain muscle has me lifting heavy weights 3-4x a week and only doing HIIT or walking for cardio. You’ll want to do heavy main lifts (squats/deadlifts) followed by supplementary exercises focusing on your glutes (glute bridges, kettlebell swings, sumo squats, hip thrusts, single leg deadlifts, etc).   I hired a personal trainer years ago because I was in a bad accident, and I wanted to be able to exercise safely, and it was the best decision of my life. I became a trainer myself, and I feel so much more confident in my knowledge about the body. Having so much information on what my body actually DOES on the inside has really empowered me to appreciate everything my body does for me, ya know?",False,False

You should lift weights to help increase muscle size and a hypertrophy program would help you with that.   If you just want your butt to be less sore, then start using a pillow when you sit. I believe king of the hill had a whole episode about hank’s flat butt needing a pillow hahah",False,False
