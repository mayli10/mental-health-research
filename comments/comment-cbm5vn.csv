You’d be surprised how much you’re walking and burning off every day, and probably even overestimating how much you’re eating.   Try and focus on the experience of trying Greek food as a necessary part of your travelling and exploration of the culture, you won’t be there forever! Enjoy the rest of your trip, you deserve it ❤️",False,False
