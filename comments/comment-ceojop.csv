If it helps at all, your body would naturally up its energy expenditure in response to you eating more; your metabolism and non-exercise activity would increase, and not as much of it would be stored as fat or tissue than you might think. Plus, not purging might help to disrupt the b/p cycle, and make you less likely to binge in future. Perhaps a step to recovery?   You'll be okay. Sending all my love.",False,False

I was around 16, and I had eaten a HUGE thing of mixed, salted nuts. Iâ€™m talking like 3kg. I was in such a binge-daze that I didnâ€™t drink any water while I was eating them.   I couldnâ€™t get them out and I did end up gaining at least a lb (plus water weight). However, thatâ€™s because all those nuts were at least like 5000 calories lol.",False,False
