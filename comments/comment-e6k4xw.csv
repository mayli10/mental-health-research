Assuming you have a TDEE of 1800, eating 600 a day means you’re at a 1200 deficit for 7 days. After one week, you’ll be at a 8400 cal deficit  8400/3500 cal in a pound = 2.4 lb lost in 1 week  Anything higher than that is probably just water weight lost from not eating as much food, so there’s less substance to absorb and retain water.",False,False
