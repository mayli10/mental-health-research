Not sure) but also I’m looking for something with the same nutritional content, not the same taste, or even a good taste, lol. mostly cos I eat chicken breast for the high protein and lack of carbs and relatively low ish calories for how full it makes me, so I just need something to replace it regardless of taste",False,True

Someone said they aren't actually vegan but I haven't checked yet. Morningstar ones are ok but Quorns are better. Calorie wise it's ridiculous tho so I guess it's just a general recommendation lol,False,False

I like to cut them up and mix them into cauliflower rice. Lightlife hotdogs are low cal and have protein. And tofurkey sausages have I think like 20g of protein. ,False,False

A lot of them are based on seitan, which is basically pure wheat protein, and it's really good!  You could also make them yourself.  I've made my own vegan BBQ ribs before and I really enjoyed it, and it didn't really break the calorie bank, either.",False,False
