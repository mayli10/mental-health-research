I do have an autoimmune condition and still struggle with the aftermath of glandular fever/Epstein Barr infection years after contracting it. I didn’t even consider chronic illness as a contributory factor to my feelings about my body so it’s interesting to know that there IS a trend there too.,False,True

I think overall it was about taking control of something in my life. But I am trans which likely contributed to it. I also used to be very fit in high school, but I was a sprinter and I broke my foot in my first week of college. I had a cast on long enough to break my habits and eventually did end up out of shape. I think I was still in pretty good shape when my ED started though. I mean, I didn't have abs anymore, but I was still generally quite active in day-to-day life.",False,False

Everything you say about ignoring your bodies needs rings true for me too. I will go to the toilet when I decide to, not when my body (somehow a separate entity in my brain) does. I will eat and drink when I decide to. That’s the part that got named an eating disorder for me, but there’s so much more to it. I hope we both find solace!",False,True

I (unfortunately) really relate. I struggled with food at an early age, but it changed form after a severe trauma at 16. I am the master of ignoring my body's need, doesn't matter if its sleep, food, drinking, peeing, whatever. I don't do it unless my brain tells me to, I am unable to listen to my body. I am currently severely dehydrated, I think my kidneys hurt(?) and even my dentist commented on it. But I just am not interested in drinking water atm,  I'll just live with the physical pain.   I haven't really found anything that really helps me either. I hope you find something that can help you &lt;3",False,False
