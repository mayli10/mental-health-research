But it's very hard to judge when you're deep in it. Especially if you're not yet at a 'healthy' weight. I hate that term btw but it's true.   Maybe think about why you truly want to do it alone? What's your reasons? When I wanted to do that, I realised afterwards that I went alone because I wasn't ready to be pushed into recovery and I felt uncomfortable with what they wanted me to do, I felt smothered by services and being alone meant I could slow and manipulate the process, but I felt better because I thought I was taking control back, in reality I was only harming myself in the long run because I wasn't ready to really recover and push myself.   I think it's easy to think you can do it on your own or think it'd be easier to set your own goal, but I can't understate how valuable it can be just having a medical team around even in the background to keep you accountable to your behaviours. I've been a 'healthy' weight and in ""recovery"" for a little while now and for the most part I do manage on my own, it's possible, I discharged myself from care a little earlier than recommended and it ended up okay for me. I do still check in with someone here and there, but if it's still severe than I think having help is probably a really good thing, it can be harder work and feel like they are making you do things you don't want to do or aren't necessary for your recovery but ultimately will probably be helpful. Once you're ready to commit to getting a bit better everyday and truly pushing through, you'll know. That's maybe a better time to think about doing it more independently.  If you do decide to try it on your own I truly wish you the best, but I implore you not to rule out help in the future as anyone who has recovered or recovering will tell you there can be set backs and relapses. So it's always good to know you can reach out to someone if you need it.",False,False
