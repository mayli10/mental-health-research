I actually searched because I was about to make a post on it and I found yours. I'm really worried about it too. I did find out from my mom that I have a distant cousin who has had high blood pressure since he was young and he's never been overweight so it might be a genetic thing. I'd really like to avoid meds too but I'm doing everything right already. I eat pretty healthy and my doctor said that drinking would only cause issues like that if you've been a daily drinker for years. The only thing I could improve on is exercise but I'm recovered now and worry that I could get obsessive about it. I've struggled with orthorexia in the past as well and it's been hard not to make drastic changes to my diet.  Hang in there and let me know if you figure anything out! I'm scheduled for the 24 hour BP monitor next week so hopefully that will tell me more. The one thing that my doctor did mention is that some people get anxious at the doctors office and it can make your blood pressure shoot up so doing the 24 hour monitoring at home can give you a more accurate idea of the real numbers.,False,False

I'm really frustrated and scared about the whole thing, because I've been trying for 3 months to get it down, diet and exercise, cutting down caffeine and alcohol, etc. and I'm still screwed. Mine was 160/90 but it goes up and down pretty unpredictably so they're concerned. I desperately don't want to control it with meds but at the end of the day if they tell me that's the only way to protect my heart and kidneys I will. Sigh.  But it really, really helps to hear that from another young, non overweight person. Rationally I know that health problems can strike anyone at any time, but my ED brain keeps trying to convince me that I've done something wrong.",False,True

I'm pretty much recovered.. BMI around 18 or so. But my blood pressure is consistently testing extremely high. I was at the doctor yesterday and was tested multiple times with readings around 165/127. They're putting me on a 24 hour blood pressure monitor next week. I can't figure it out bc like you said high BP is usually due to obesity and clearly neither of us are close to that. I'm sorry I don't have much to offer in terms of a solution, but you're not alone.",False,False

But to be completely honest, if I have to take something for it I'd rather it be a drug that's clinically proven to be effective and safe than an unregulated supplement that may or may not be. And the goal is to avoid taking anything if I can.  I've lost \~15 lbs recently and I have another 5 to my gw but I'm worried that since I'm not overweight to begin with, it might not make too much of a difference. I hope you're right about that part though.",False,True

I'm glad your friend is okay. Thankfully I've never had to take any meds long-term (I was on antidepressants for a few months but that was years ago). They even told me to stop using OTC painkillers until the bp issue was sorted out (not that I was using them often, maybe a few times a month for muscle aches, but apparently even that can be dangerous with high bp)",False,True

She does not have an ED but I am hoping this can give you some insight:   Her doctor found that she had high bp and did some checks - some questions including has she been on birth control and for how long. At the time my friend had been on the pill for over 7 years straight. The doctor mentioned this pill could be the culprit. My friend was put on a heart monitor that she had to wear, and once she got off the BC pill, her bp rate returned to a normal state.   All that to say, we take a lot of pills and medication that can fuck us up down the road. It took 7 years for the pill to have impacts on her bp, but even then it was pretty serious.   Good luck!",False,False
