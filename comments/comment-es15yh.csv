It makes me feel left out you know because this sub is like the only thing I have to see if others are feeling the same thing as me or to get a laugh. I‚Äôve seen other people without profile pics so I‚Äôm not even sure ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,False,False

I know a lot of us have the mentality sometimes that 'oh that would never happen to me'. I'm guilty myself! I'm so glad I could help, I still get the urge sometimes but this whole ordeal has really driven it home. Its not worth the risk.  If you want to talk, you can pm me. I have very few people in my life that I can talk about this with and I'm always happy to lend an ear! Wait, that's an actual rule on this sub?? I haven't honestly read the whole thing but wtfüíî",False,True

Like I‚Äôm sure that this may help people not purge at least one and could help them do it less knowing what could happen. Like this lift really made me not even want to try purging ever again. So thank you. And also I wish you the best and hope your situation can get better. I‚Äôm glad I met someone nice in this sub because i comments on a persons post and someone replied to me Rule 10 and I looked it up and means that people think your ugly if you don‚Äôt have a profile pic and I was kinda sad üòÇ,False,False

I'm honestly so jealous of you, it's horribly addictive and I thought that the hardest part would be breaking the habit. The aftermath (in my case) wasn't worth it. I know this is like a worst case scenario and probably won't happen to many people but just the awareness that stuff like this can happen will hopefully give someone else that nudge towards recovery or harm reduction.",False,True

I am kind of glad that I can‚Äôt purge. Like I literally can‚Äôt no matter how full I am or how hard I try. I know in that moment I hate it but I am thankful for that.,False,False
