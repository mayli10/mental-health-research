My husband moved out in December 2018 (so like 6 months ago) so we “can both work on our own issues and come back stronger”. I believed him at first but now I see it’s bullshit. He basically abandoned me cause he didn’t want to deal with my depression and while I have been trying to get better, seeing a therapist and whatnot, he has distanced himself, despite saying that that wouldn’t happen. Unfortunately this has also caused my relapse since I’m a mess and don’t have many (any?) healthy coping mechanisms.   I’m sorry you’re dealing with this, I know how awful it feels to be pushed aside so they can “work on themselves,” when all it seems like is selfishly leaving you alone so they don’t have to waste their energy on the relationship. Even though they supposedly love, and care about, you. Ugh I know I sound like a bitter bitch right now, but this shit is so hard and feels terrible, especially it leads you to feel like you’ve been more invested in the relationship than them all along.   I hope you guys get through this, but for now stay strong and focus on yourself and getting better, since that’s what he’s doing, and you deserve to be healthy, mentally and physically. I feel like there really isn’t much advice I can offer as I’m going through a similar situation and struggling, hard.    You’re not alone :)",False,False

I literally thought I was reading about my relationship, same time together and everything. Only I’m the one with diagnosed anxiety, it fucking sucks. I want to be with him, and we’re talking and being intimate, but we’re not back together because well...nothings changed. The worst part is every now and then I’ll get a stupid pang of “this wouldn’t happen if I was skinny”.  Sending hugs (with your consent) to you internet friend.",False,False
