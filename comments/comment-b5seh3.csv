It makes me feel a lot better even if I can't eat anything. I recommend it to friends who don't eat carbs/fast too.   It often kills headaches for me too which is a nice bonus.

I know from trying to make nutritious meal plans that it's almost impossible to get enough potassium in a regular diet. In fact, the vast majority of people don't get enough. I made a meal plan recently which is 1650 calories. In that meal plan I used 2.5 bananas (22% daily recommended value of potassium), 2 meal replacement shakes (21%DV potassium), a whole cup of carrots (11%DV potassium), and a bunch of other foods ranging from 2%DV to 7%DV. I was specifically trying to make sure I get enough potassium without missing out on other important nutrients and I couldn't manage without supplements. I was still 15% below the recommended daily intake of potassium. I bought a whole bunch of potassium citrate powder (40%DV per tsp) and I listed half a teaspoon as part of my meal plan. I know that 1650 calories for a meal plan is lower than what an average person eats, but that's really pushing it for me in terms of what I can stomach in a single day. That being said, average people don't eat a lot of high potassium foods. Based on the kinds of meals my family and friends eat I would guess that the average person hardly gets 10%DV of potassium per day.  I kind of bought the potassium citrate powder without thinking much beyond the pure amount of potassium in it, but after I received my order I did some research and it seems that potassium citrate is the easiest form of potassium supplement for your body to absorb. Powders are also recommended over pills because FDA regulations, in an attempt to prevent people from taking too much potassium in a day, limit tabs to only 2%DV each. My understanding is that is to make them safer for people who have medical conditions that require them to have a lower amount of potassium in their diet (typically meaning their body can't absorb it properly) yet still need help getting a little more than what they can from food. I'm not sure how countries besides the US regulate potassium supplements because I couldn't find any information about that in my searches, but with potassium powder you can easily measure out exactly how much you need and take that amount. Powder is also much cheaper than tabs. You can pay the same amount for a bottle of each, but you would need to take 5 doses of the tabs to get the equivalent potassium of one dose of the powder (1/4 tsp).",False,False
