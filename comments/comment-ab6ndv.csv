I completely get why you’re upset and I don’t know if I’m being helpful but trying to be analytical always helps me calm down.  In order to gain 7 kg (as in actual fat gain) you’d have to overeat by almost 54.000 kcal I believe. Now I don’t know what you ate but chances are it didn’t add up to about 16.000 kcal a day. It’s more likely that a lot of that is water weight, stuff you haven’t digested and, eh, stuff you’ve almost digested.  Going through a though time is normal and we’ve all been there. It doesn’t define you as a person and you don’t have to punish yourself for it. Maybe ease back into restricting rather than trying to aim for the other extreme straight away?  Feel free to pm me if you wanna talk!",False,False
