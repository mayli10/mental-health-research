My RHR is usually low 50's during the day and 40's at night. I had one Dr comment on it but I told her I'm an endurance runner and she just said ""oh ok that makes sense otherwise I'd be worried"". I believe mine hovered low 60s previously, but my mileage has increased a lot the last few years (I run marathons and ultras) so it's dropped over time. Just please make sure on the days you run that you do eat more protein and carbs. I usually aim for sweet potatoes, oatmeal, beets, etc. Plenty of nutrients to sustain longer runs and aid recovery.",False,False

I am currently not allowed to exercise/run and it is killing me BUT I also don't want to further damage my heart.  I would be really careful if I were you- you can always get back in shape but breaking down/putting stress on your heart is so dangerous,False,False

Perhaps you can look into your medical records to see if itâ€™s documented somewhere to see whether running/AN has affected your heart rate.   I have normal-lowish blood pressure (101/52) and a BMI of 18.9 and my RHR is naturally pretty low (55-58 bpm). I also ran cross country for a bit, and during that time, my RHR often fell to the 40s and occasionally mid-30s. I was not AN during this period of time. Despite these readings, my physician found everything else about me to be healthy.",False,False

I have an anorexic bodyweight and Iâ€™m very athletic, and my HR is typically 45-55 when Iâ€™m sitting around, lower when sleeping and if I havenâ€™t eaten recently. For me, this is OK because my heart rate has always been &lt;60 at any weight, it hasnâ€™t been decreasing, and I have no issues with murmur/arrhythmia. So itâ€™s not necessarily a problem in and of itself (especially given that youâ€™re a runner), but if youâ€™re having other issues, if it has dropped recently or if it continues dropping then it could be a problem. You should keep monitoring it with your doctor to make sure everythingâ€™s okay.",False,False

I'm not a runner but walked and biked a lot. I didn't think it was much of an issue but my doctor expressed concern. I ate more regularly and it kinda got up to at least 60 bpm. I don't feel super different but I feel light headed a lot less which is good. I also havent fainted recently. I was also diagnosed with AN without being underweight, just really close to it.  My weight hasn't changed much while trying to raise my HR, if that's worrying you, it worried me. I hover around the same weight. Water can raise it sometimes so I suggest making sure u have enough of it!!",False,False

When I run now (am not in shape, so only a few miles at a time) my HR is around 160-170.    When I was at my LW (20.5 BMI) I was more in shape. My runs were not super long distance but definitely 3-6 miles on most days. Anyway, my resting HR was usually around 50, under 50 if I hadn't eaten in a while and above 50 if I had. Sometimes it reached the low 40's, which was probably bad. I once saw it at 39. When running, it was usually 150-160, and 170 if I did sprints.   Last data point, my sister (no ED, does not exercise, normal weight) also has low blood pressure and a resting HR in the low 50s.   I guess what I'm trying to say is, in my experience, low HR can be genetic and completely normal, but also an ED can make your HR even lower in an unhealthy way. So stay safe, but also don't panic -- this might be norm for your body / fitness level",False,False
