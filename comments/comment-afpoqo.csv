Now I can switch up my cardio, yay? ",False,False

On the exercise machines like the treadmill or elliptical you can see how much energy and time you have to spend to burn 400 calories (and even those overestimate the calories burned), and it's a lot more than I ever felt I could possibly doing in a yoga class. I just consider it strength/flexibility training.  Sidenote a long time ago I did an experiment where for two weeks I burned 600 calories every day on the elliptical machine at the gym, then ate 600 calories more than I had been having to lose (1200 at that point, so 1800/day), and my progress immediately reversed from a rate 5lbs down/month to gaining 4 pounds in the two weeks. So I'm scarred for life/biased against counting exercise calories into your daily allowance unless you're a serious athlete or something :P",False,False

I still take my apple watch’s calorie estimates with a grain of salt since they sometimes seem a little optimistic, but I hope it’s accurate to within say 15%.",False,False
