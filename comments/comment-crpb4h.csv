I didnt actually have a bad trip, but the repercussions have been apparent- body dysmorphia affecting me in new places, stronger than before (didnt even think that was possible). I'd be silly to say it wasnt from the acid convincing me of the body dysmorphia delusions",False,False

I was supposed to do a self discovery trip with a friend to start healing how I feel about my body- my body dysmorphia has only gotten worse since then, because I truly believe the delusions my brain shows me so it just reinforced that",False,False

Its “bottom up” therapy that teaches comfort/tolerance in the body before anything else. It’s helped me a lot bc the focus is not on talking, and frankly ANY kind of talking or thought work is unproductive for my brain. You usually hear about it in the context of PTSD, but I don’t have ptsd (although I do have trauma) and it still helps my depression/anxiety/ED. My therapist doesn’t even know about the ED, but it’s really helped in terms of like not wanting to die when I feel full due to improved distress tolerance.  My other suggestion would be a guided psychedelic experience. I’m not gonna recommend “just do drugs!” when I don’t know you, but I know there are underground services for these things. Depending on your area this may be hard to find or not? idk it’s the kind of thing where you may want to start talking to people at like natural medicine stores or alternate spirituality groups....if you just want the drugs and no guide, it’s a lot easier, but again I’m not gonna just be like “drugs!” bc that can easily go wrong. You know your own mind best, of course &lt;3",False,False

It’s not for the faint hearted, but it works. It’s not a magic bullet, it’s not a case of drink it once and instantly cured; but it’s really something. In the past I’ve tried psychotherapy, group therapy, hypnotherapy, CBT amongst others. Nothing helped me like ayahuasca did. Happy for you to DM me if you would like details!",False,False

But in a way, it's kinda like acid. The trip/vision depends on your state of mind. And rn I'd prolly see blobs of fat murdering kittens or some shit.",False,False
