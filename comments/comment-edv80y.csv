I was on lithium and it gave me shaky hands and crazy thirst. Even now I take four psych meds plus a million supplements. It gets to feeling a bit much, but for me, it's worth it to have stability. Good luck. I hope you can get a new provider if you don't feel comfortable with this one.",False,False

I'm just salty cos they have me maxed out on Latuda, a lithium dose so my level is 1.2, and a high dose of lamictal, and 3 other psych drugs on top of the seroquel. And then a bunch of meds to counteract all the physical side effects from they psych ones. Seems excessive to me.",False,False

Seroquel is dose anywhere from 50-800 mg pretty regularly. Lod doses are more sedating and are often prescribed for sleep while higher doses have an mood stabilizer and antipsychotic effect.

I started restricting not long after I was put on lithium, but there were other things going on then as well (I was manic and the lithium wasn't completely helping it; plus my mother had just died). I think the mania really pushed me along in terms of weight loss. Restricting was easy, exercise was easy. My manic brain was also feeding off the compliments/concerns from people around me about my weight.  Then I became depressed and I stopped restricting. I still cared about what I looked like but I couldn't help but binge all the time. Then I started antipsychotics on top of lithium (I was taking 1200mg of seroquel at one stage, thankfully now down to 800mg) which did what they do best and I got to the highest weight I've ever been (still in the normal weight category, but the higher side of it). The scariest thing for me is that I was too out of it to even notice what had happened to me. It's only now, looking back at photos that I realise how bad it had gotten.  Now I think my mood is relatively well managed but I'm restricting again. It's not as easy as it was when I was manic (exercise is such a chore). I really just want to get down to where I need to be and stay there. But I suppose thats what most of us are hoping for.",False,False
