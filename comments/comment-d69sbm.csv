Idk any zero calorie ones, never seen powerade zero in any shops over here. But the tablets are on uk amazon for 7 quid, which is a tad bit pricy but for me they're worth it as I worry less about myself. There's 20 of them and you're meant to take 2 a day so it's like 7 quid every 10 days.",False,False
