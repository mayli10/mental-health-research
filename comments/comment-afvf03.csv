I cant site my source but I think this tends to be true for mild depression only. If you have severe non functioning depression imo you cant just use therapy to feel better. If I did that I'd be dead.   I've been on countless meds and in my case my improvement was definitely not the placebo effect otherwise I would have just gotten better on the 1st one I took. ,False,False

Damn I wish that was true otherwise I'd just go do reki and not have to deal with the expense, seeing a psychiatrist, side effects, and general pain in the ass it is to need meds. ",False,False

So sometimes their effects can be overlooked and also, interruptions can cause longer (like weeks) delays in efficacy of the medicine after you restart taking it. Also they should be tapered because there are withdrawal symptoms including some that can temporarily affect your mental state.  I don't take it anymore though.",False,False

Meds can help. Depending on the person and the symptoms they might even help a lot. But realistically meds are just one piece of the solution.   For me, they maybe improve things 20%, which is enough lightening of symptoms for me to then be able take actions to help myself get to a better place. Meds usually arenâ€™t a magic 100% fix, and for your doctor - particularly if they are a therapist - to focus exclusively on meds is a little odd. I see a psychiatrist for medication management about once a month, but at my weekly therapy appointment we donâ€™t talk about meds at all.",False,False

Iâ€™ve been on fluoxetine twice, paroxetine once and sertraline once (they all have the same mode of action); and ime they have been effective when my condition was severe and not very effective when it wasnâ€™t.  Other people may find that these meds always help. Others may find that they never help. Thereâ€™s no fixed answer unfortunately.  If the reason for your not taking the meds is due to the possible weight gain side effect, then maybe it would help to remind yourself that these meds donâ€™t magically create extra weight. They simply increase appetite in some cases. If you can recognize the difference between true appetite cues and perceived cues, you will not gain too much weight. If you have ever drunk alcohol or smoked weed you will know what i mean. Both these drugs increase appetite but itâ€™s possible to ignore the cues from them to overeat with a little mindfulness.  Needless to say if youâ€™ve been prescribed a drug like fluoxetine itâ€™s for a reason and you should take it as indicated unless you have consulted your physician ðŸ™ƒ",False,False
