This is called [extreme hunger](https://www.recoverywarriors.com/truth-about-extreme-hunger/#) and is part of recovery. I'm in recovery for anorexia and had extreme hunger for... honestly about a month. I'd get hungry every two hours, and engaged that hunger when I felt it. I didn't balloon up at all in weight- I haven't weighed myself, but it's clear I gained just enough weight that my wedding ring stopped slipping off my finger and I'm no longer dizzy all the time. I'm still very skinny!!  Trust your body, it's trying to get you healthy the quickest way it knows how! It's a self-regulating instrument, and will pull back the rampant hunger on its own.",False,False
