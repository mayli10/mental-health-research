Right now I'm 162. I feel like a barge and my weight hasn't budged in months. Used to be 197. I lost but extra weight doesnt look good on me since I'm boy shaped. No curves and no boobs. I dont think I'll ever be thin again and I'll always be gross and undesirable to men. I'm going to die alone and I just have to accept that not everybody gets to have/deserves a happy life. ,False,False
