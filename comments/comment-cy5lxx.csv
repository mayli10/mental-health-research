I felt like I was so fucking piggy even though I was just eating at a rate that matched the 5+ miles I walk a day, but now I'm doing that same amount of exercise and eating like a meal and a half a day because I've made it my goal to lose 2 pounds a week and I never get seconds and I'm so miserably hungry all the time.",False,False
