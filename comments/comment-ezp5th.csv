We have a few somewhere in my house I just need to find them. I’ve never seen a muscle heat pad but I don’t go to the shops often but next time I do I’ll look for some.  I’m sorry you can relate to it, yours is definitely bad enough. I’ll try and remember that mine is bad enough. Now that I’ve had a boiling shower, which felt INCREDIBLE by the way, I’m warmer for a while as my ME/CFS has caused me to go a bit feverish and I’m producing way more heat that I should be, and that’s making it easier to see how bad my ED really is as well,",False,True

Sadly knitting and stuff doesn’t work for me as the only place the cold becomes even slightly bearable is buried under several layers in bed. I try to move but it doesn’t help much.",False,True

It's a life safer!  The muscle heat pad is usually next to stuff in the health aisle at a supermarket, beside muscle pain relief.   And dw, I can relate to feeling like your ED isn't bad enough.  I feel the same! But it is.",False,False

I can totally relate to the double layers thing, I wear these thick fluffy pyjamas and then multiple dressing gowns on top whenever I have to get out bed. It’s not enough though...  During the day when I’m cold I tend to lie in bed with my quilt and all my dressings gowns as blankets. I wish I had a hot water bottle because I can barely sleep due to the cold until I feel I’m about to pass out from sickness.  Yeah, you’re right, but today I’m so incredibly cold I’ll do anything for heat even if it’s hard to get out of. I’ll look into this muscle heat pad thing though as it sounds INCREDIBLE.",False,True

Once I get cold it’s so hard to get warm again!

No matter your weight and time of dealing with it, you are valid.  You have an ED if your eating is disordered and you feel like you have one.  Don't feel like this makes you less 'allowed'. ♥  Second, I wear double layers.  So two shirts etc.  And I get thick socks!  It helps a lot.  During the day I like to get a thick fuzzy blanket out if I want to save energy on the heating.  Or! I get my hot water bottle and rest my feet under it.  I always always go to bed with a hot water bottle or I can't sleep because it hurts.  Hot showers are nice but trying to get out of them suck so I don't advise them often.  However! If you get a muscle heat pack they can stay on you for 10 hours before they wear off.  Stick one on your back and boom, it heats you everywhere.",False,False
