I didn't get sober until after I stopped going to AA because all the meetings in my area were so fucking toxic (one guy in my home group tried to hug me then shamed me for rejecting the hug; another time, someone showed up drunk and started feeling me up and when I yelled at him, other members got mad at ME for not being more understanding ""because he's sick"", even though I started drinking because I was raped???).   Honestly, Vyvanse was helping my binging so much but insurance won't cover it or my psychiatrist appointments anymore, so just to get an appointment to get a prescription is $450, and the prescription itself is over 300. But apparently it's just not severe enough or something. ",False,True
