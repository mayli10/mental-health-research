Your parents are dumb and if you have lost weight to get to the size you are now, they're probably thinking of what you used to look like and not really registering the difference in how your appearance has changed.  I'd be upset about this too, and it would definitely set my BDD off. I'm sorry you're having to deal with this. ❤️",False,False
