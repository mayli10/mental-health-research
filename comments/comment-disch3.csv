But realism is important in recovery, and that *does not preclude optimism*.  In my opinion, going into recovery with a view to never having an eating disordered thought ever again is just setting yourself up for failure.  It is far more valuable to accept that these thoughts *are* going to crop up again from time to time, but that you will be far, far better equipped to challenge and, ultimately, dismiss them.  Thinking about depression as an analogue: someone who has ""recovered"" from debilitating depression is inevitably going to experience negative thoughts at some point in the future. It would be absolutely ridiculous to consider that a ""failed attempt"" at recovery. That this hypothetical person has indeed recovered is evidenced instead by their newly acquired ability to recognise such thoughts for what they are, challenge them, dismiss them, and not allow them to derail their progress and improved mental health.",False,False

I do believe it is possible. I was probably writing so hard in the opposite direction as a reflex to defend the population I felt you were attacking and invalidating.

But I don't want people to feel like failures or like they are ""bad"" when they don't achieve that. That's all I'm trying to say. I'm not trying to bring you down.  It's not about me - you yourself wrote that the thoughts never go away.

I probably am pretty douchy. I also care a lot.  You know what, I want You to 100% recover and be totally rid of all negative thoughts!   Eating disorders are complicated and have various ""causes"" which is why I brought up skizophrenia. My own is tied with OCD. Obsession and compulsion. Someone else's may be linked with body image. Another's may be a trauma response and finding a sense of control. There is no one size fits all.  I want people to believe and strive for that 100% recovery, rare as it may be.

First of all, it's not about ""hope"" in general. It's about hope for full recovery. I **know** that things can and will get better - what I hate to be told is that it's not possible to get more than ""good enough"". That's not even about being hopeful, that's about being honest.  Schizophrenia isn't the same as an ED just because both are mental illnesses. So let's just ignore that bit.   For the rest:  &gt;But the reality in general is you DO need to manage your thoughts.   Yep, **in general** is the key.  &gt;ou don't just check into a hospital, gain weight, and BAM! All better!! That's just not real.   True. Because EDs are not about the weight. But you CAN also delete the thoughts and replace them with healthy ones, given enough hard work. That's the point.",False,True

Your post sounded super hostile when I read it.  Hope is really important, especially when beginning recovery. If You are told you can't get better, why even try. I'm with you on this.  However, part of recovering from a mental illness is accepting that you DO need to manage your thoughts and learning healthy coping strategies to help yourself get through them WHEN they happen.  The same is true with learning to live with anxiety disorders, OCD, Bipolar disorder, depression..  I doubt you would speak the way you did to a paranoid schizophrenic. You wouldn't say if they tried hard enough their paranoia would be gone forever. Part of the therapy for schizophrenia is recognizing your paranoia and learning coping strategies. Learning when you need to go in and get your meds adjusted. And sometimes It doesn't work. That isn't a failure of that individual.  So yeah, I agree with you. Hope is important. A defeatist attitude does no one any favors. But the reality in general is you DO need to manage your thoughts. You do need to WORK on this long term. You don't just check into a hospital, gain weight, and BAM! All better!! That's just not real. Sorry to say because I wish it was.1",False,False

Don't try to backtrack, you are **literally** writing it:  &gt;I think what people mean is the thoughts never 100% go away. The disordered thinking to some degree will always remain. You can recover. You can eat healthy. You can even learn to love yourself and your body. But often when you are least expecting it you will feel guilt or fear over eating something. You will realize you forgot to eat breakfast and your hunger is making you feel euphoric. You will overeat and have a huge urge to purge.  You wrote this yourself.  And there is an incredibly huge difference between saying ""it's rare"" or ""it's very hard"" and ""it doesn't happen"". Huge, huge difference.   &gt;I do take issue with your attitude that if you don't end up 100% ""normal"" that it is because of some type of moral failure or lack of effort.  More like lack of action. There's a subtle difference. And yes, I do claim that if even only one can, anyone can - and fail to see why it shouldn't be true.",False,True
