I consumed weed almost daily for years.  I‚Äôm hella depressed and it put in a different headspace besides my own. I don‚Äôt want to say it numbed things but it certainly took the edge off my intrusive thoughts. My partner told me that she couldn‚Äôt tell when I was or wasn‚Äôt stoned which really spooked me.   I‚Äôve been off it for a few days now. I feel really shitty. It‚Äôs not that I think I‚Äôm going through withdrawals- honestly haven‚Äôt really craved it at all. But it was a coping mechanism I could relay on and now it‚Äôs gone.  I know it‚Äôs probably better for me to learn to walk myself out of a negative head space then to use substances to help but it fucking sucks.,False,False
