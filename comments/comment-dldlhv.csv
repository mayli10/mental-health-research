I had been dealing with a lot of emotions, stress, and I took an hour to write out why I felt the need to do so without trying to come off extremely disorderly since I know she’s already squicky with my use of a food scale. But I feel like the way things have been are definitely pushing me deeper into it even if that’s not their intent  I said I would eat my normal today and get 1200 at least but a little below that for just one more day it seems maybe. She hasn’t talked to me at all today and I’m trying my best to communicate myself and everyone knows I have a hard time doing so. I don’t really feel motivated to eat to it I know I’ll be close and I’ll hope tomorrow is better And that my headache subsides  I thought today was a good day, it came close but I’ll hope for something better tomorrow (school will hopefully be kind on me, send help I’m not good at chemistry and we’re testing oof)",False,False

He asked again and I just said ""I don't know!"" but it's probably because I've barely been eating the last few weeks, but he hasn't said anything about my weight because he knows I fucking hate it/hasn't noticed cuz I'm a tall blimp.  Sometimes I get the urge to say to him that I'm down another pound when it happens but I absolutely cannot. A brick wall goes up. I want to hide this from him as long as possible, even though I trust him entirely and tell him everything else.  I'm afraid he'll try to stop me and I really don't want that getting in the way.
