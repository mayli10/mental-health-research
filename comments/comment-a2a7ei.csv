It's weird to me that he buys different products than the ones he knows you prefer. I mean I know parents and some partners will buy fear-food options to try to encourage someone underweight to take care of their body but your partner doesn't sound very kind or respectful... I know you are complaining so you are framing his behaviour as hurtful.... but please think about how much joy vs stress he brings to your life and if the equation is worth it,False,False
