But he knows I have an eating disorder.  That sounds like a total oxymoron. He couldn't have thought that was a good idea. Even if you didn't struggle with an ed, that is such a shit thing to say to someone. I also have a bf who makes super insensitive comments while I'm in recovery. Just ignore him &amp; focus on your health. Much love &lt;3",False,False

I don’t mean to sound like an ass but he won’t know what to avoid saying if you don’t let him know.
