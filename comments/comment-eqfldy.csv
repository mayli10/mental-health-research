If you eat those throughout the day you’ll feel less hungry and therefore less likely to give into the temptation (not to mention at least you’re eating something rather than all or nothing). If you starve yourself your bodies cravings will likely overpower the willpower.   Also most places will offer some sort of healthier option so at the very least opt for that so you’re not bingeing or feeling too bad about it.  Stay safe ❤️",False,False
