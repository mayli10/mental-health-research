Even at a higher weight, lifting gave immediate physique changes I could start to see - you lean over or do something with your arms and you see a little ripple of muscle where there wasn't one. It may be hidden a little while but you can immediately see the direction it's going.   Trying to lose absolutely sans muscle gain is the demoralizing process - just a slow slog of hoping your body is burning the right stuff. Never seems fast enough and can't control where the changes happen (if only).  I hope that's encouraging lol, I spent a long time not doing weight stuff ""until xyz weight/goal"" and once I started lifting it was just like ü§¶ why haven't i always ?",False,False

But if I stop deadlifting, my total will go down. If I only bench, my total will also go down. And none of the fat I burn comes from my legs. Pretty sure I'll have to use up all the fat from my upper body before anything changes in my quads.",False,False
