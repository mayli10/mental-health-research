I know I could go back to my low weights (I have been weight restored for a couple of years now) but I would have to sacrifice x y and z that I love from my life to do so. It kinda goes like ""sure, you wanna be thin again? Go for it, but you're gonna have to change your job, stop weight lifting and say bye to your butt and all your anxiety about social occasions and holidays will increasex100"" and them I'm like ""nah, il leave it for a bit thanks"" ",False,False
