If you don’t feel healthy or the way you look adjust and change that in a healthy way. Trying to be a specific weight number is silly because if you work out you gain muscle which weighs more than fat. So say you get to be 120 look amazing but want to be 100. You look amazing who cares if you’re over 100. Being at a specific number isn’t special. How you look to yourself and feel are more important. Doing unhealthy things to try and reach an arbitrary number is good.,False,False
