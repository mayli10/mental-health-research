I didnt know weight could vary up to 20 pounds just from hormones! But it explains all the times I've gone up 7-8 lbs overnight after a fast or restriction, etc, and none of the other reasons apply.

You could drink melted butter from sunup to sundown and probably not even reach that. There is virtually no way that that‚Äôs fat.   Non-disordered people who maintain their weight don‚Äôt weigh themselves everyday. If they weigh at all, they focus on their weight trend rather than daily weight and thus don‚Äôt get caught up on it.   Humans eat, on average, four pounds of food per day. If you didn‚Äôt go to the restroom and you ate near maintence, assuming you‚Äôre not a dwarf or bedbound and sleeping 23 hours a day, that‚Äôs about right.   If you‚Äôre not used to eating at maintence, the sodium in your food could have been a shock to your system. Just make sure you stay hydrated and pee whenever you feel the need and it‚Äôll flush out.   If you‚Äôre female, regardless of whether you‚Äôre currently getting a period or not, your weight can vary up to 20lbs per month just from hormonal fluctuations alone.   You‚Äôll weigh .5-3lbs more if you haven‚Äôt showered in a while. Showering helps reduce water weight.   You weigh 1-5lbs more at the end of the day than the second you wake up (whether you‚Äôve eaten or not!) because when we sleep our cells rejuvenate and flush out toxins that can weigh you down. This is actually partially why we sweat so much when we sleep.   If you‚Äôve exercised, you can weigh .5-5lb more because your muscles are holding onto nutrients and water that would otherwise be flushed out in order to heal themselves.   Between all of these factors, your weight gain could be easily explained away. Don‚Äôt worry about it. Here are some tips that could help prevent unnecessary worry in the future:   - Weigh first thing in the morning, but after using the restroom. You *can* shower before you weigh and you‚Äôll weigh less or drink a cup of coffee to encourage an early morning BM, but I personally prefer to wake up, pee, weigh.   - Shower the night before you weigh or, like I said above, you can also shower in the morning before you weigh if that‚Äôs how you prefer to shower.   - Don‚Äôt weigh after a sudden diet change. If you‚Äôve suddenly started eating more or eating less healthy foods, the scales are going to go up even if you‚Äôre eating at a deficit or maintence.   - Try to only weigh if you‚Äôve had a healthy BM within the last 12 hours preferably, 24 hours at most.   - This one may be difficult, but it‚Äôs the best possible way to accurate gauge your true weight loss/maintence trend when combined with the other tips. It‚Äôs also mentally healthy for you. Here it is: weigh at the same single point of your cycle every month. ~~When I wasn‚Äôt obsessing over my weight,~~ I weighed the day after my period stopped every month and only that day. I didn‚Äôt think about weigh so much and my weight *always* did exactly what it was expected to do based on my intake. I‚Äôm not sure if this is possible for you, but you might decide it‚Äôs something worth working towards.",False,False
