It's very intense and frustrating to have to constantly think about these things. I'm in school, I'm never in a good mental state until food comes into play. I feel like I'm too stressed for my age. I just want to have fun but I'm just worried about life all the time. I can't get free.   I definitely will take up on the offer. I really appreciate it. ",False,True

I struggle to feed myself healthily because I feel like I don't deserve good nutrition. I'm huge (180 lbs, and only 5' 1""), and the biggest I've ever been, and I hate myself for it. I work out as much as I can, and my doctor actually told me to do more (yay?).  I try to stay under 1000 calories too and I really understand that feeling that I'm just eating all of the time. I am experiencing post viral syndrome and the only time I feel slightly decent during the day is when I eat.  It's infuriating. You're not alone. PM if you ever want to talk.",False,False
