I actually used to suffer from chronic constipation when I was younger so I totally get that. But it went away and NOW I‚Äôm abusing Lax to ‚Äúpurge‚Äù food out- u know how that goes lol. Ugh that‚Äôs terrible.. thank you so much for sharing!! Wow that‚Äôs so many at once. Oh just for an update 4 in total ended up working for the senna type ones. Finally all left. Was so bloated earlier but everything is out now lol. Hope you‚Äôre better now my friend!,False,True

I‚Äôve seen it a lot in bulimics, myself includes.   At my worst I was taking different types of lax‚Äôs, and well above the max recommended number for each. 12 pills in one go was a good day for me.  As others said, yes the timing can be very unpredictable which interferes with my work/life in general, and what‚Äôs left of my social life lol.  I‚Äôve been weaning myself off pills when I got to the point where nothing would come out for days but I‚Äôd be in **severe** abdo pain. Like I-need-to-call-the-hospital severe. Like toes-curled, cold-sweats, heaving-bile, if-childbirth-is-this-bad-i‚Äôm-not-having-kids bad.  I used non-pill crutches while I was weaning (prunes, coffee, psyllium husk, ton of water) so I wouldn‚Äôt be majorly pooped up and bloated in the mean time.  Pls be careful hun!",False,False

They‚Äôre quite unpredictable in that way. I would say don‚Äôt take anymore until you give it a good 48 hours.  Of course I would advise you to not take them at all, but I know that would be fruitless. I took laxatives regularly for a few months and then when I stopped I didn‚Äôt shit for 21 days. Not exaggerating. PLEASE Don‚Äôt let the problem get worse.",False,False
