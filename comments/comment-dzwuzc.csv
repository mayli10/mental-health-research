Two of my suitemates have ESAs. One has rats, one has guinea pigs. Mine was in the process of being certified it was just moving slowly and I knew I couldn't wait to have an ESA till the paperwork went through. My living situation is fine, my approval was pending, and the only thing that changed was one shitty person in my life who back stabbed me.   For the love of fuck, take a cue and stop trying to prove your superior knowledge. You are not there. You do not know the situation.",False,True

I am in a private suite with multiple rooms, commons, and closets. I was in the process of getting verification for the animal. Clearly you're reading into this is some grim way. I didn't have a back up because I got explicit confirmation from all the other residence that it was fine, what happened was a completely unforeseen circumstance.    However, all of this is fairly irrelevant. I posted this as a vent, looking for emotional support and kindness, not a harsh critique of my choices. It should be obvious that i'm struggling, and that should be a cue to you that your criticism will not help me, my animal, or the situation as a whole.  We're all just doing our best. Sometimes our best isn't perfect. Please keep that in mind and be kinder to the next person.",False,True
