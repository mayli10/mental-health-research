I want people to see me and think 'poor girl needs to eat'. I live in LA so everyone here is a fucking model and tbh, when i starve and workout, i feel so powerful and superior to other hot cchicks. i knw they look better but in some fucked up way, I think every giirl just wants to be super skinny.",False,False

I let it roll off because I may have an ED but I get plenty of affirmation from the bf so I might starve and hide my body but I dont need others approval. though I get called ""Cute. Adorable. So so cute.""  rather than ""hot"" or ""sexy""",False,False

It just reminds me so much of all the situations in school, when you're passing by a group of guys and they're laughing, whispering, commenting, - all in a bad way.   I wonder how the gorgeous girls feel when I (secretly? too obviously?) stare at them, feeling inferior, about to cry and like they're some kind of goddess while I'm just that ugly dwarf. :D Now I feel sorry for them, because I bet I don't really look friendly in that situations.",False,True

They're just...creepy.   It's just, I've been in your place/mindset before, and I really think this is all a product of the ED. It can completely distort how we interpret environmental cues. I would be utterly shocked if you've got random strangers eyeing you with disgust, if you're not either behaving in horrible ways, or walking around with vomit in your hair or visible track marks or the like.",False,False

But it wasn't even a friendly look. It instantly made me feel inferior, as if I had something on my face or just because I am short and below average.

It wasn't friendly. It was a neutral, slightly confused/disgusted mixture. I see this stare a lot.

People generally don't stare at those they find unattractive. (I concede there are some jackasses who stare at obese people in public, because they're jackasses - but that doesn't apply here.) If they were definitely staring, it's almost certainly because they found you attractive!   I know your ED brain is probably coming up with reasons why I'm super wrong about this, but just keep in mind that EDs can really distort our sense of reality, y'know?",False,False

Sometimes we project our “ED brain”-fueled insecurities onto what we expect other people to think of us. Trust me I absolutely do it too and I probably would’ve felt the same in your shoes.
