Too fluffy and unrealistic.   Would maybe watch it again at home. Not much to shout about though. (:   Wrt bf/dating concerns: my boyfriend is tall and really skinny too. However, due to age, metabolism slows. Age does catch up with them, if that helps. But his forearm vascularity does trigger me a lot. I‚Äôve managed to get my arms vascular too but am worried I‚Äôd lose my arm veins if I eat too much :(  Thanks for reading",False,True
