That is very strange of her, yeah. Parents arent very fast to adapt to new sizes thats for sure. She seems kinda rude if Im honest, haha. Youre your own person, you know when somethings uncomfortable",False,False

It’s that I lost 75+ pounds and I was plus size for years and years and now I’m out of that territory and she’s so not used to it. Even when I was at my highest, she would buy shirts 1-2 sizes bigger and if I tried on jeans or a shirt and they were my actual size she would stare at me and be like “Are you sure it’s not too tight on your stomach? That looks kind of tight.” It’s weird. I’ve never known what to make of it. She always mentions how she was a size 0-2 for years until she gained weight with her pregnancies.",False,True

Like it seemingly being far fetched, but only because her size is so far removed from it. And in the 70's and 80's sizes also had higher numbers, so maybe your size didn't even exist when she was a teen, or was the smallest of the small. And then being larger as an adult, she just never came in contact with that size unless on still-growing children?",False,False
