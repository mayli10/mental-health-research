To me the only thing that would cause further appointments was if you WERE showing symptoms of an eating disorder, so it's hard for me to confidently say since I don't know if you have an eating disorder or not. Not all eating disorders are emotionally charged/related to body image. I met someone while in treatment who had ARFID which is an eating disorder, but from getting to know that person better they said that they don't really have body image issues and don't avoid eating on purpose, so a lot of her struggle was just being physically capable of eating regular amounts of food to stay a healthy weight. You haven't mentioned your behavior, and I'm not going to assume anything. My point in mentioning that is eating disorders are different from person to person, so I think even just ruling it out is valuable that way your doctor(s) won't be barking up the wrong tree. I feel like I have experienced that which is way more frustrating and has wasted a lot more of my time than anything else has, but this is just the opinion I have formed from my experience.   And secondly, I saw a dietician as part of my treatment, which I think is a very helpful thing for anyone to do, not just a person with an eating disorder. My eating disorder tells me that I'm not supposed to have many different things for differing reasons, I have an all-or-nothing attitude towards food as well, so it's things like that, that my dietician was trying to help me work through. Since another part of my disorder is bingeing, she tried to help me work on eating things in moderation, and how to be flexible with meals day to day. Or at least, that was what was supposed to happen. Now, I'm saying this as someone with an eating disorder that fluctuates in severity, while I was in treatment eating the foods that I, by my own rule, ""wasn't supposed to"" was irritating and as someone who was borderline overweight before entering treatment, I always was nervous that I was being given too much food because at that time I was not allowed to know the calorie allotments of my meal plan. I won't talk about the specific reasons why things didn't work out during my treatment time unless you ask because they aren't applicable to other people, only me and my situation, but what I want to say is that a dietician works to give you the tools to live healthily in regards to food, but you still have to have the personal responsibility of taking care of yourself and using what they teach you, which is pretty much where I fell down on the job. Changing any behavior is always very difficult no matter if it's an eating disorder or not, so while I don't know you or your behavior even if you don't have an eating disorder, I would recommend a dietician, and just to reiterate, seeing a dietician does not mean you have an eating disorder either, it seems like you do not think you have an eating disorder, but I wouldn't totally discount going to see one if you are underweight because it does mean that you are not getting enough calories and they can help you with those types of issues.",False,False

I knew my relationship with food wasn't normal, but there is always that little bit of denial and complacency. My mental health issues started with depression and social anxiety that I developed an eating disorder to cope with, so at first I was only wanting to get treatment for the depression because I've always felt like that's my main problem, but to avoid boring you with a slightly long story, I ended up going to a psychiatrist specialized in eating disorders and getting eating disorder treatment. I had a few outpatient appointments with that psychiatrist where basically she asked me what my eating patterns are like (what I generally eat, time frames, etc.), what my feelings are about food (does it make you feel like you lose control around it, do you have specific rules when eating, does eating cause guilt or self-loathing type feelings, etc.), I'm sure they also asked about how I feel about myself (body image, self-esteem, etc.). During that time, I was super honest when answering all these, which I think is the most important part of the process, but I'm not really that shy about my disordering eating, I don't mind telling people (as long as they actually asked lol), so if talking about yourself is difficult for you then that might be slightly stressful. It was pretty clear (especially so to a professional) that I had pretty severe (or so I'm told) bulimia (bingeing and purging daily, sometimes multiple times, mixed with binge/fast cycles), so I was recommended a specific treatment plan that I'll spare the details. This only applies if you need treatment, but I then had to do an intake assessment, where I was basically just asked similar questions as I stated above, and I just kind of had to chronicle the timeline of my eating disorder and general state of my mental health since for me it kind of morphed into different phases ( my depression lead to emotional eating which lead to steady weight gain/self-hatred, which lead me to start counting calories/restricting and exercising, which then became fasting with exercise which then became fasting/bingeing with exercise, which then became bingeing and exercise, which then became bingeing, which then became bingeing and purging while fasting in between, which became a huge inconsistent mess of eating too much and not enough and purging sometimes and sometimes not). Everyone was very understanding especially the lady who did my intake assessment, and I had/have an eating disorder so I was diagnosed properly. I don't think they asked anything unnecessarily and since the nature of mental illness is very personal, they do have to ask personal questions. In my opinion, it's not invasive but having to talk about yourself isn't always easy to do. If you don't have an eating disorder then it will just be ruled out as an issue, so I think it would be worth it for you to go. If you actually read all that rambling feel free to ask me anything if you have any questions about what I said or anything else really.",False,False

I did one online so that was easier, but I did one in person and that felt invasive. They did a blind weight for me but I managed to see it so that sucked.
