What’s important is the *mindset*. If I feel out of control, it’s a binge, even if I’ve only eaten a single slice of toast. ",False,False

The definition of binge is 'a period of excessive indulgence'. So for me it may be a packet of cookies or a large block of chocolate eaten in a span of a couple of minutes or a large buffet of food eaten in an hour or so. It can range from a couple of hundred to a couple of thousand calories.",False,False

So, eating out with a friend and having fun but eating to the point of being uncomfortably full would not technically be considered a binge for me. If I'm eating out of control and I go way past my fullness level, or to the point of physical pain, that is a binge. Also, if I'm not enjoying the food I'm consuming yet i still keep eating, that's a binge. ",False,False

I knew there would be varied responses. I personally don't know if I've ever technically binged, but there were times where I felt wrecked with guilt for overeating even though I probably didn't eat over 1500cal, so I'm trying to understand how others who do struggle with it would personally classify their eating as binge eating. I'm seeing that most people go by the technical definition of a binge, but there are a few outliers which is kind of comforting to know.",False,True
