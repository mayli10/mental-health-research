Recently I had been feeling just ravenous, like, when I got full I didn't want to stop eating. No amount of food was satisfying. I have a health condition which I am in the process of getting diagnosed which makes it so that I get sick and experience a significant amount of pain any time I eat. Since I just kept eating I would make myself so sick. I ended up very bloated and my body couldn't process the amount of food I was consuming so I ended up losing weight. It seems that while I do go to the bathroom regularly that my body takes longer to dispose of waste and so it holds on to more and more as I fill myself up and eventually cannot handle everything inside me. A few days of eating less usually makes my bloating go away and then I don't feel quite as bad in general, though I do still experience pain in various spots throughout my GI tract indicating a more significant problem than simply slow digestion.   I am explaining this because I started taking dexedrine (*dextroamphetamine*) for my ADHD the other day and I found that when I started taking it I could eat as much as I usually do, but that when I get full I don't want to eat any more. This has allowed me to greatly reduce my bloating in just a few days despite how massively bloated I was. The reason that I now eat only until satiation is because amphetamines have a strong appetite suppressing effect. I still experience hunger, but I don't have the same unending appetite as before.  I'm not sure what it is that suddenly created this appetite for me, but taking an amphetamine immediately gave me a great deal of control over my life.   If you don't have ADHD you won't be get benefit if being able to focus that I did, but that's not they're used to treat. They can also be used to treat narcolepsy and obesity. Obviously there is a difference between being overweight and being obese, but if you believe that increasing the control you have over your appetite will keep you from restricting too heavily and that it will have an overall benefit to your health then you may be able to convince your doctor to prescribe one to you one. You should of course also consider the effect that it will have on your cognition and on your sleep though. You should also be careful because amphetamines are treated as a controlled substance due to their addictive properties and common use as a street drug. Take them only as directed and tell your doctor if you begin to feel cravings for them.  I take dexedrine because it typically lasts for 6-8 hours and my doctor was concerned that I might begin to eat less than what is normal for me and lose more weight. I find that it improves my focus for around 9 hours, but that my appetite stays suppressed well into the night. I'm quite small however and I'm not very physically active as I don't often have the energy for exercise and so many drugs have a particularly strong effect on me. For a presumably more average person you can expect the same results as are typical for others taking these medications. There are many different amphetamines as well as two different classes of amphetamines, but they generally all work the same. Some people find that one class works better for them than the other, but within each class the drugs mostly just last for different durations or have a different strength with few other differences if any at all. One medication that my doctor and I discussed is Vyvanse which lasts for around 10-12 hours on average. There are others which last all day and others which last for only a short period of time as well.",False,False
