With my ED I’m much smaller. I was already what most people would consider skinny but now I’m even skinnier. Maybe it’s all the pro-ana I’ve been lurking but I don’t find Jameela Jamil incredibly skinny. Skinnier than the general population, sure, but not anything that I would question as unhealthily skinny. Mind you, I’m speaking from my own experience.",False,False

I'm just curious because I don't really personally think anyone is naturally skinny, weight is mostly determined by CICO.   I understand your feelings towards her though, I do feel like it comes across as pandering at times, but I think that's just her slightly camp persona (maybe idk). I think though, that we can't gatekeep who should and shouldn't be spreading body positive messages based on their weight.",False,False
