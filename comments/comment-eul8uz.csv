Of course I dont know your relationship,  but in my experience they dont mean any malice in what they say. He may have even meant to lift you up (he mightve been able to tell you weren't feeling great about yourself, so wanted to compliment you and make you feel sexy) but had zero idea what to say or how to do so. Either way, im glad you were able to call him out and correct him in the moment.",False,False

They don't experience objectification and they're not subjected to the body stereotypes women are. A lot of people even think that UW women are the healthy normal weight.

Some dudes really just don‚Äôt get it. They‚Äôre so lacking in exposure to how awful and serious eating disorders can be that some even seem to weirdly fetishize it. I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you.   I have an ex that I caught watching ‚Äúanorexic porn‚Äù on Valentine‚Äôs Day, even though he hadn‚Äôt been interested in having sex with me for months. It literally felt like I wasn‚Äôt thin enough for him to want to fuck me or something, it was so fucking triggering. It actually ended up being what finally pushed me over the edge and make me leave his ass. I broke up with him not long after and that was probably what opened my eyes to him not being a good guy for me. I‚Äôm so glad I did, otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt have found my husband.   That said, it‚Äôs possible that was just a fluke and your bf is a good guy who just said a dumb as fuck thing. You‚Äôre the only one here who knows your relationship. Good people can say dumb things. Guys especially don‚Äôt always have a lot of experience with being super emotionally supportive. My husband has definitely had foot-in-mouth moments (although nothing that bad).

When men did grow up in a very empathy-building environment, they‚Äôre often a lot more sensitive. I‚Äôve noticed it with my husband; he grew up with 3 very emotional sisters and is quite sensitive and supportive. He‚Äôs still very masculine, but he‚Äôs very secure in his masculinity and doesn‚Äôt have an issue being vulnerable with me or supporting me when I feel vulnerable.   It also helps that we are over the age of 25. Our brains don‚Äôt stop maturing at 18. A lot of the crucial parts of our brain keep maturing, like the parts that regulate impulses. My husband was already very sweet and supportive, but he hadn‚Äôt really learned the language of support yet or how to express it as well. He had foot in mouth tendencies when we first started dating lol, but he always was trying to help and be genuinely supportive, and he eventually learned how to provide support well, how to validate feelings instead of just trying to ‚Äúfix it‚Äù, etc. It‚Äôs something that we gain with practice, boys just don‚Äôt usually get the opportunity to practice it, growing up.",False,False

I don‚Äôt want to pretend all men are like that though, some are really caring and nice like my boyfriend, two of my uncles, and my brother. But then there are people like my dad and one of my uncles who don‚Äôt understand mental issues at all and think you can just choose to get over them easily.  Personally I think their brains are wired differently. All the men I know who really care and somewhat understand mental health issues are autistic too, so maybe a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù man‚Äôs brain isn‚Äôt properly configured for it and the men who understand have differently formed ones like autistic people.",False,False
