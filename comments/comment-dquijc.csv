It's not about being sheltered or having ""first world problems"", I think it's perfectly natural for anyone to be upset at the idea of perfectly good, edible food going to waste when it could be fuelling someone's body. We didn't evolve by wasting resources! (Of course, our brains haven't caught up to the abudance of resources we have now...)  And yes, I agree about splitting food up more easily when I'm at home. I'm trying to practice eating mindfully and stopping when I'm satisfied/full rather than when I've finished whatever I set aside, and it's hard when I have only a little bit left. So with something like pizza crusts at home, for example, I could easily compost them or feed them to my neighbour's chickens without feeling like I was ""wasting"" them, but I couldn't do the same at a pizza bar. Unless I ask for a doggy bag just for crusts which sounds like me üòÖ",False,False

My anxiety around wasting food is generally higher than my anxiety about over-eating so it's really, really hard not to over-eat and then binge as a result of the over-eating. Sometimes it's easier just to not eat anything at all to avoid dealing with leftovers. I went to a dinner a few weeks ago that ended up being a share-plate kind of restaurant, and I shared the table with four other strangers, and I had to eat so much more than I planned because I couldn't stand to think of the perfectly good food left on the plates that none of the others wanted being thrown away. I also looked over at the super-skinny girl at the end of the table who had her plate piled high with pizza crusts and I remember thinking simultaneously ""that's so wasteful, I could never do that"" and ""God I wish I could do that"".  I'm trying to remind myself that if I don't need or want the food, then it's just as ""wasteful"" to go into my body as it would be to go into the trash. Like, that girl had the right idea - they must've put five or six different pizzas in front of us, ain't nobody need to eat all those crusts. üôÑ It's basically a planned ""waste"" on the restaurant's behalf... but I still can't do it.  I'm going to try doing it more often at home though because I can compost the leftovers... It's probably much better for us than just starving lol.",False,False

Perhaps why most of us just fill up on soups.
