I’m so happy you were able to find confidence, I can’t wait to get to those point! A BMI of just underweight is my dream bc I feel like it would be the most sustainable way to appease my ED mind and my healthfocused mind. Congrats girl! Hopefully your home situation get better too, stay strong!",False,False

But considering I’ve been at it for 6+ years and I’ve only GAINED weight (fml) I don’t think that’ll ever happen. My body is teasing me by refusing to dip below 19.3. ~sigh~,False,False

It's a confusing feeling.  I lost a tremendous amount of weight...literally over half my body weight. And I got a disorder in the process. I never hit my goal weight because my goal weight got lower and lower. Whenever I hit it I just want to lose more. I find it impossible to eat at maintenance or even close it. Just the water weight alone makes me feel horrible even though I know it isn't fat.   But like...I am happier now. Obviously. I'm not lying to myself by saying that, I am genuinely happier. I don't think anyone can go from size 24 to size 2 and not feel happy about it. It's just that I can't stop. That's when shit starts to feel awful. Going to bed feeling like a failure for eating 1000 cals in a day or eating past 5pm or what ever.    And then I also have to grapple with the fact that I do have to be vigilant. It could be regained. Even if I were perfectly healthy about food I couldn't just let go and be normal, I will always have to count and track. I just don't know the right amount of vigilant I guess. I can't figure out that happy medium between stuffing my face with pizza and McDonald's all day like a normie or eating shirataki noodles in chicken broth every day like a lunatic.  Typing this makes me feel retarded and I'll probably delete it later I just want to let you know I understand. This is a weird, fucked up, confusing situation to be in.",False,False
