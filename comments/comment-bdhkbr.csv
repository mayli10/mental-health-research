I have nothing against her cooking, I just can't ever stomach that much greasiness on anything, especially if all I can taste is butter/grease/oil. She thought I was trying to be rude by not eating her cooking, but not only did I not know the calories, she knows damm well I could never eat much of her food if she used so much fat. I don't think I can handle savory fats like that, not even when binging.",False,False

Seriously favorites of mine as a kid. I also genuinely like veggies and rice, food without a lot of unnecessary (in my opinion) ingredients and grease/oil. Since I've been cooking for myself, my most enjoyable food is simple and pretty plain, with lots of veggies.   I can still binge on junk, but I do love healthy uncomplicated food.",False,False

I don't know how my tastebuds got *so* acclimated.  What's more? I *only* like unsweetened vanilla almond milk. The sweetened one tastes like sugar water, and not in a good way. I wouldn't be able to choke it down if it was combined with a food. I honestly consider Blue Diamond unsweetened vanilla almond milk the perfect drink.  One time, I saw ""unsweetened almond milk"" as a banned food from an ED treatment center online, and I got sad.",False,False
