I actually showed signs of these years before showing signs of ana. The weird thing is that I couldn't tell you what they are because I only notice them when other people point them out. But apparently I go to great lengths to avoid things that aggravate my sensory sensitivities.,False,False

It's hard explaining it to people because most people don't know what sensory issues are. I have aspergers which cause them for me. Sound is also a big thing for me which makes it hard to be around other people when they're eating because the noise of chewing and stuff which makes me feel guilty. As far as I'm aware there does tend to be a link with autism and eating disorders which makes sense as you can see how things like the sensory issues and other traits like need for routine/sameness and having strong interests could make an eating disorder stronger.",False,False

It's not that it grosses me out, per se, but it can definitely startle me, make me nervous or give me a headache. ",False,False

I get grossed out really easily when it comes to the environment I'm eating in too. I can relate because this came before my ED, but definitely plays into it nowadays as well. If I get grossed out by a plate that seems dirty and lose my appetite, part of me is like yay!",False,False

Forks on plates hhhhhg I want to plug my ears every time I hear it. It’s like nails on a chalkboard  Mini vegetables inside big vegetables is an interesting one! Sprouting things can kind gross me out, like when potatoes start to sprout, but that’s more to do with the fact they get squishy I think.  ",False,True

When there's a mini-vegetable/fruit growing inside a bigger one - idk why but it puts me off so badly I cringe thinking about and I'll take hours to recover ",False,False
