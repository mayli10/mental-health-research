She was 17/18 when she started, and she was a very slim CHILD(sorry, to me anyone under 20-22 is still a child developing, and also I'm only a month older then she is)  She has grown so much as a person. And to grow up in the limelight like that? The way people talked about her body as it changed was/is absolutely disgusting. Women do not look like 18year old girls forever. It's kind of that pervasive sick thinking Hollywood has that all women need to continue to look like adolescence girls. We saw it happen with Brittany and Christina too. They were even younger when they started their careers. The Olsen twins had it bad too and they have been forever changed by it. Now we know about Beyonce's issues too (even though it was presented in a totally ""normal"" light) Beyonce was really young when she got her start too.  I actually think Taylor has come out the otherside stronger, and she seems like a very smart adept woman now. I really liked how she called herself out for putting what's his name on blast when she was 18. She has grown a lot.  I really don't know much about her other then what I see in interviews because I'm not a fan of her music, but I would say I respect her as a person and as an artist.",False,False
