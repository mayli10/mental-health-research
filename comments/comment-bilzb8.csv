There were many other ways to show how difficult the past years had been but to think that we still do fat shaming... Same here, the whole theater laughed. And I live in the UK in a pretty accepting and progressive city...   I mean, when they're referring to the big lebowski it's funny - and that's not because he's ""fat"". We get it, he's let himself go. But making him ridiculous because of the weight gain is pretty harmful.",False,False

But my fucking God, we already see every single fat character ever as nothing but a joke -- do we *really* have to take fit ones and do this *just for cheap laughs*? I don't understand who they thought they were going to please with this...",False,False

I was thinking the same thing -- but I mean, not only was that repulsive, but like... *why*? Had they not included it, who in the honest name of God would have ever thought to themselves ""I liked the movie, but do you know what I think it was missing? Thor being *FAT!*  Constant FAT JOKES at his expense!""? I'll tell you who -- absolutely nobody!     All agreed that Thor's character had greatly improved via Ragnarok, and by Infinity War his characterisation was absolutely perfect imo! And then what do we get? Not only is his development absolutely stagnated -- *oh no --* but he gets to be entirely reduced to a fat joke throughout the entire run of the movie! I mean, Jesus Fucking Christ, great move! Can Thor even get fat? **\*thor fan tantrum intensifies\***",False,False
