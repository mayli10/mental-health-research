Pregnancy sucks and it's the worst experience to go through with an ED. I got so fucking lucky through my first 2 pregnancies, my obligation to the little parasites took over until about the 6 months postpartum point hit (breastfed, had to keep up supply via calories). Once they started getting nutrition from other sources a flip switched and I was back at it.  That didn't go as well last time. My youngest is 8.5 months old and I actively restricted during the last half of my pregnancy. He was my smallest baby by far and now I'm barely maintaining a breastmilk supply.  It's so hard and I absolutely commend you for gaining weight. The struggle is real. You will be out of commission for 6 weeka because of the dinner plate sized wound inside your uterus but I promise you'll shrink back down and your life absolutely will go on.  ",False,False

She's not super into fitness or healthy eating or anything, she gained 40lbs with each pregnancy. The only time I ever remember seeing her soft was right after my baby brother was born.",False,False

But think of it this way, it's not really you gaining the weight, it's your child that is, and that's a great thing. Most mothers don't 'bounce' back, you will most likely still look heavily pregnant a couple of weeks later. Recovery really depends on how the birth goes. Most people I know have been 'off duty' for up to 6 weeks after birth. Obviously some people are lucky and can be more mobile after a few days, but you can't push yourself because it will just take longer to recover. If you plan on breastfeeding/pumping then you will also need to retain a healthy weight. Typically, the healthier you are the faster you will recover.  There is some control over how much you real weight you gain, it just depends on how well you can control your cravings. What you can't control is the size of your baby and how much amniotic fluid there is. That will determine your stomach size.   Have fun with your pregnancy and try not to worry about the scales. Maybe getting rid of them and try some more positive measuring techniques? Like measuring your stomach each week to see how much the baby is growing (and try to remember that's it's the baby getting bigger, not you).  It will probably be very hard some days to eat, but just remember that you're doing this for your child, not yourself.",False,False
