I’ve come across people like that in the past, but they’ve largely been superficial and/or people I don’t enjoy associating with; the people I’m having this problem with are not that way at all, especially since a few comments isn’t obsessive in my book and they’ve always been the care taking type.",False,True

Like... obviously people with a happy and healthy relationship with food and themselves don't obsess over things like that even if it **IS** someone else.,False,False

I I said it more eloquently than I did above (I am multi tasking like crazy today With a big move soon so I’m jumbled AF). Thanks for the tips though! Definitely a very delicate territory sometimes.",False,True

Which is precisely what happened (screw birth control side effects). It’s such a tight rope, but I do my best to politely shut down. It just tends to really get on my nerves. &gt;.&lt;",False,True

It changes if they know you have an ED. However they still ask “have you eaten yet?” I always give such a curt but elegant response so it dies down on the spot. “Yes” or “No I’m going to eat later.” Simple as that. Clients ask me all the time about my diet etc. “How are you so slim?” I always answer with “I don’t know I guess I have a high metabolism. I hate it though and I’m super self conscious about it.” They never ask again. It’s important to shut it down but in a clear and respectful way. If you get defensive or over explain, you’re giving an invitation for a conversation you don’t want to have.",False,False

A good friend of mine works in a lab where people basically bully her, over her weight. Everybody knows she has anorexia (almost died last year because it got so severe and had to leave the state for acute &amp; resi), but they still comment.   It’s my bosses and friends, so I don’t feel comfortable telling my bosses, especially because they are REALLY good people, so I know it comes from a place of genuine concern, versus being noisy or exploitative. It just irks me that (1) there is this double standard (I’ve been overweight and it was the polar opposite of this), and (2) that we don’t live in a society where people express genuine concern, but instead feel the right to comment on our bodies and/or weight without little if any knowledge?   I’m super glad you have a good place to work, where they respect that- SUPER awesome!",False,True

I have expressed in my workplace how I hate when people comment on my weight and I find it extremely rude. Telling them stories of what people said etc. They took the hint and never mentioned it again.,False,False
