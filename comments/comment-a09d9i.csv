If you‚Äôre ready to try it.. I hate to admit it but it‚Äôs a game changer.   Like I‚Äôm the type of person who literally stands in the fridge whilst binging (for some reason that‚Äôs a safe binge space for me) whilst watching youtube. There‚Äôs a subconscious part of me that feels disgusting and knows I look disgusting if someone suddenly saw me, and I feel that made my relationship with food worse.  But it feels pretty fuckin luxurious to sit down with a plentiful plate of hot lovingly made food. No distractions but to enjoy the simple pleasure of eating and shutting down the dumb binge brain.   And no feeling ashamed if someone saw you eat it!! Because the meal is socially acceptable whereas family sized crisps and 2 cakes aren‚Äôt! That‚Äôs a huge thing for me, I hate eating (even non-binge foods) in front of people.   Holy shit I might actually be ready for recovery ",False,True
