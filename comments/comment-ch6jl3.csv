All he asked of me was to try to eat something if I’m coming over so that I act normal and not like a moody a-hole. Lol that’s good your bf is so understanding with you!,False,True

But after discussing it with him more in terms of my insecurities and how important it is for me to look and feel a certain way, he is much more understanding.  He has never cared about numbers.  He just wants me to be healthy.  But his stance is more empathetic now than it was in the beginning.  He will express concern if he finds out I'm not eating but he won't pressure me.     Granted, I am BMI \~18 now and am losing very slowly and I don't think it's noticeable to him.  Is your boyfriend pressuring or guilting you into eating, or otherwise making you uncomfortable?  Is the main focus on eating now that you two are together?  If that's the case, I think you need to have a conversation about what kind of support you need from him.",False,False
