Also smashing that “see less like this” on the explore page so it doesn’t keep showing me triggering shit from pages I don’t follow. It’s helped a lot.   What I don’t find helpful are “recovered” girls who are still very skinny but post loads about how much food they eat now. Just doesnt ring true and makes me feel worse ",False,False

Its so much nicer",False,False
