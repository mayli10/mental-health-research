It is a broken loop in the brain.     Usually starts out as a harmless diet. Diets tend to call for calorie restriction which usually makes people eat less leaving them hungry at times.  You have to pep talk through or trick your way around this feeling to work toward your ultimate goal of losing weight.     This is how you end up reinforcing the idea that food is bad. Giving in to hunger is weakness. It is what made you fat in the first place. Your brain sees ""eating=bad. Not eating=good""     Now the average person would keep this mentality for the duration of the diet and would be able to understand the suggested dietary guidelines and minimums. Once the diet is over they go on their merry way.    Here's the thing with OCD though. A brain with OCD grabs on to ideas like a deranged toddler and then holds on to them screaming as you try to pry it from their hands. It takes the idea ""eating bad, starving good"" and just fucking runs with it. It becomes very black and white. All eating bad. It is failure. Eating made you fat and now ALL eating will make you fat. Like I said, think simplistic toddler logic.      Now you can't just never eat. You have waged war on both your biology and social norms. So eventually you break down and binge. Your drunk toddler brain screams at you, convinced it is like a switch that will be thrown and you are going to get fat now. You have failed.     But wait. There is a magical undo button. You can undo all of the damage you just did. You can wave a magic wand and undo the binge and shut up the obnoxious voice in your head.    So you purge. And it is silent. And you return to restriction until you fail again. And you continue even though and it makes no sense to even you.",False,False
