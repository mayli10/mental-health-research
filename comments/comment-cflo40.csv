But, try to think of it like this- you’re getting stronger. Overcoming the disorder truly gives you strength, even if body image is challenging.",False,False

It was mostly a panic attack induced vent. I don't want either of us to be killing ourselves but I was resentful and jealous that she got to and I just get to get fatter,False,True

However, I want to focus on the language you used- you said she gets to “actively kill herself” when she smokes a cigarette. Based on your post about how much you love her, you don’t want her to be actively killing herself. Restricting is also a form of actively killing yourself. If you can think about it in the terms of she doesn’t want you to be actively killing your self, that might be helpful. Have you talked to her about it recently?",False,False
