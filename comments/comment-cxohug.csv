I have a very good friend who is extremely obese and we have literally the SAME issues. We just deal with them in opposite ways. She‚Äôs stressed and obsessed with food so she eats. I‚Äôm stressed and obsessed with food so I avoid it. We‚Äôre both terrified of eating and hate our bodies. One day she told me that my ed hurts her so badly because I‚Äôm literally killing myself not to look like her and I felt like such a bastard but she‚Äôs not wrong...,False,False

She works out a ton though so I would say shes on the high end of a ""normal"" body with an OW BMI.  We have SO MUCH in common. It's like everything is the same but the trigger makes me fast and her binge. It's really helped me to understand BED as I research it more and try to help educate her.  It's honestly been so wonderful to talk with her about it. She developed it later in life once I was out of the house, so I dont think she influenced my ED growing up.",False,False
