I still eat and it’s nothing like Aderall, but it’s quite helpful with appetite suppression without any jittery feelings and anxiety. I even stopped drinking coffee when I got back in it (to prevent anxiety) and my energy is consistent through the day on minimal meals.  Absolutely terrified of any SSRI-s though, would only rake them if nothing else works.",False,False

Almost all antidepressants messed my stomach up so badly I couldn’t keep food in me, and was suicidal, so.
