I'd say just really stress that the changes are for health/being better equipped to handle stress vs the weight. No one likes being told that they are wrong, so try to be as nice about it as you can :)",False,False

I'm 26 and I'm only living here because I'm helping sell the house, so it's hard for me to be treated like a kid again. But I can put my food down for health.   Besides, a healthy diet leads to feeling better too. I think we all know that junk food after a bad day only leads to feeling shittier. My issue is that none of the food looks 'bad' since it's a standard western diet. Milk and cereal looks so innocent to most, but it's a sugar bomb when it's frosted flakes and he's having multiple bowls.   I know I'm going to get yelled at and shunned when I speak up, but I know I'm right. ",False,True

His father encourages dangerous behaviors already and he does turn to food for comfort (he'll literally ask for junk food saying he had a bad day and wants to forget it).   I know it's hard with an ED to see what's valid or not, but I feel strongly on this one. When I was his age, my mother bought me a Costco sized cookie box and said nothing when I ate it in one day. But I skipped breakfast once before school and she freaked. I always eat normally in front of him and encourage him the best I can, but I know I won't always be here and want him to learn why overeating isn't going to solve a bad day. ",False,True

At this point, all I can do is cry my eyeballs out for him. If i said anything to his mother I would be shunned for ""judging her way of raising him"" and she wouldn't listen or change a thing anyways. All in all, the poor kid probably wouldn't have turned to food as a coping mechanism if she would've done right by him in the first place.",False,False

Especially if there's outside stress, you can phrase it as something that will help everyone feel better.      It also sounds like your bro needs to get out of the house more, even if it's not for exercise - maybe he'd like to do lessons in something computer-related? Again, it sounds like he has a lot of stress right now and needs something fun to focus on. Plus, he's 13, he's old enough that he can do things by himself.",False,False

I'm concerned he'll use food as a crutch especially since his father tells him to workout and live off protein shakes, but only feeds him pizza and hot dogs (he's only with his dad part time).

It didn't correct itself and I'm pretty sure he has BED from trauma we experienced as kids. It's hard and I'm not sure what to do.

I know puberty can even things out, especially for guys, but I'm more concerned about him learning good habits. I was a chubby kid and thinned out with sports too, but my eating habits were shit. If I hadn't played sports, I would have gained 100+ pounds easily.   We do go for walks, but it's just not enough. Unfortunately there is no other family; it's just the 3 of us. I try and keep him occupied after dinner so that he won't sit in front of the TV and eat bowls of cereal. But I don't want to babysit him from dinner until bedtime every night either.  It's a long road and there are no quick options, but it still frustrating. ",False,True

My brother went through something similar but outgrew it when he hit puberty. Once he got to high school he joined a bunch of sport teams and is now healthier than I’ll ever hope to be and has great friends for support.   You can’t control your mother’s actions or denial but maybe you can promote healthier options for your brother? Ask him if he wants to go for a walk or suggest riding bikes together or something? If he doesn’t want to go outside at all maybe have a movie night with him and find a way to incorporate healthy snacks?  Are there any other family members you can speak to regarding your concerns? Dad, aunt, uncle etc. if you can’t get through to your mom maybe someone else can. ",False,False
