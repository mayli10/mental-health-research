Age doesn't equate to wisdom or worth in any way. I just meant that shit is hard when you're young but your perspective may change you one day in ways you have no clue it ever could, you have to stick it out to find out haha",False,False

I had trouble finding a first job and didn't get one until I was 18. Idk how old you are but if you are in school, even college, you are still young. I'm 26 now and I never believed people when they said it would get better. I wanted to kill myself at many points along the way but trust me, I love my life now and you will love yours too one day. Also, boys come and go and the right one will stick around lol I've been married to an amazing guy for 5 years and Im not what anyone would consider 'attractive.' yea, I still think about food and stuff but it's better now. I wish you the best :)",False,False

It will get better, trust me. You are more than just a number (even though I understand completely why that number feels like it matters so much). But you are a person beyond what your weight is and what your struggles are, a person with interests and worth and light inside of you. Do things you enjoy, try not to worry or hate yourself. Hang in there.",False,False
