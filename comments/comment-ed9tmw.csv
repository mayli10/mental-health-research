You probably still have stuff in you from before the fast started. Also, the water does contribute to your weight. There are endless reasons your weight could fluctuate or stay the same on different days. Such a small difference or lack of a difference shouldn't be taken to heart. If you had fasted for like 4 days and didn't lose anything them it might be a plateau. Still, that could also happen from constipation.",False,False

Drinking lots of liquid is a technique that people with anorexia especially use to deceive medical professionals of their weight in recovery for example. I wouldn't say buying another scale is quite necessary. Try not to panic even if you are plateauing too, things can change with time. I hope this was helpful and that you will get better :)",False,False
