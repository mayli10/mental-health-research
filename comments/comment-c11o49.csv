I don't think she has an ED. She's too calm and laid back for those to be binges, oh and while she casually references her promo codes for shopping sites and 'side hustles'. I just don't buy any of her ed or medicine degree BS.   &amp;#x200B;  I always get Han\_beats\_an recommendations. She obsesses about eating trash and justifies her unhealthy food choices via youtube. I like Rebecca Leung and Nick Dompierre though. Alwayshungry and her boyfriend Nate are a PITA IMO",False,False
