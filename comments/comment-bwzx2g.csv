Try adding this image on to it- working out/lifting crushes all that food into solid, compact, lean, dense muscle mass.  I used to be pretty buff but due to a major lifestyle change I'm finding that restricting is turning me skinny fat. I miss how my denser musculature makes my body look but ineed better workouts for this. It's just too hard to excercise when starving",False,False

You burn more calories by just existing, you naturally have more muscle, you can naturally build more muscle, you can look leaner easier, your clothes don’t have to be skin tight to be attractive, you don’t have to wear shorter shorts to be fashionable or lower cut shirts, you get to eat more because of the above, not to mention the plethora of societal privileges you get. Of course there are societal pressures weighing against men, of course the patriarchy works against men in many unhealthy ways (I.e. showing emotions, gaining custody in divorce etc), of course being a human regardless of the type comes with a vast amount of shitty experiences, but there’s definitely a silver lining.   Tldr: right or wrong, I’d rather have your problems than being the curvy fem that I am.",False,False

The difficulty is food=fat in my mind and no matter how much I tell myself that I need food for muscle I still ""feel fat"" after eating, so fuck me right?",False,False

I’ve dated men who are over and underweight and it didn’t make me like them less or more.",False,False

Idk if this will help in anyway but I know a lot of girls like lanky boys and I also know a lot of girls like boys that are on the bigger side but I know it's not as easy as just telling yourself this and I hope you find a way out of how you feel, hugs.",False,False
