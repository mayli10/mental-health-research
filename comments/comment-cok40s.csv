I think we're talking about slightly different things though. I am in recovery (or at least some version of it and have gained over 35 pounds from my lowest point. Ed habits obviously don't end with weight restoration (what even qualifies as weight restoration? I got my period back and am currently sitting 3-5 pounds below minimum healthy but my gastroenterologist said I'm good to go) and I just feel like I have to look like death to be struggling. I used to like getting skinny compliments too, but getting them from strangers in public- especially children- made me feel insecure about even that. I can appreciate what you're saying though the point of my comment was that I feel wrong for feeling that as I'm trying to recover.",False,True

I'm 5'2/5'3 (can't really tell definitively) and for the last few months my weights been fluctuating between 90 lbs and 97 lbs. I hate it! I love looking at the scale and seeing 90 but somehow when I do, myrain feels like it gets permission to binge and I end up ""gaining"" over night and seeing an additional 5 pounds the next day on the scale. I HATE IT. I also go on websites where you can video chat, and many people were telling me for a bit how emaciated and scary skinny I looked. I loved it. Now, I've been eating a bit more and not just chewing/spitting (I constantly binge chew and spit all day on snacky carbs) and I know I retain a good amount of calories doing this. Last night I ATE hearty foods (a salad, a quinoa bowl and a fajita plate over the course of a few hours) while chew spitting donuts, etc. I've definitely gained some fat and people noticed or just stopped ccommenting on my low body weight. Some people even go ahead and say how ""healthy"" I look and I HATE IT. I feel like I am no longer anorexic and no longer, well, fragile and special.   &amp;#x200B;  I don't even wanna be in recovery, I just want to live in a delusion where I binge maybe ONCE a week, don't feel guilty and then IF in between but when I eat, it can only be like 400 calories and I'm good.  &amp;#x200B;  Oh well, sadly, I'm the most rational after I've eaten and can think clearly. Once I start getting MAJOR hunger, well, all logic goes out the window.   &amp;#x200B;  I hate this.",False,False
