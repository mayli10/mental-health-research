ARFID is obsessively avoiding certain foods based on various factors, which sounds much more like what OP is describing. Maybe your ex was diagnosed with orthorexia and *also* didn't like fruits and vegetables, but that alone would not be grounds for diagnosing orthorexia. I mean, you can look up the definitions yourself. Words have meanings, and the meaning you claim to know is incorrect. That is not an opinion, or nonsense, it is an objective fact and you're making a fool of yourself.",False,False

I still don't eat fruit at all, but I've grown to tolerate veggies. What was crucial to me was:   1) slowly trying new foods along with ones I know I like, so if I don't like, say, carrots, I can still eat the rest of the beef bourguignon. I wouldn't order something I'm unsure of as a whole meal.  2) eating with non-judgmental people or alone when trying new things. Part of my issue was that my family was used to me being picky and would make comments any time I tried something new or unusual, and it made me feel awkward and uncomfortable, like I was setting myself up for failure.  3) trying foods I was unsure of prepared in a new way. Turns out, part of my hatred for veggies was because my mom would just microwave a bag of frozen whatever and serve it plain, which is still revolting. I've learned that I'll eat eggplant if it's prepared like they do it at dim sum, or chickpeas if they're served in an Indian curry. A lot of times, having a food look the way my mom served it is enough to put me off it, but if it doesn't resemble that, it won't trigger those instinctive disgust feelings.  4) reminding myself while trying something new that the worst that can happen is I won't like it, and I can just move on and eat something I know I'll like instead. At times trying a new food felt trying poison or something, and I'd get anxiety like there was some impending doom. Try to downplay the situation to yourself and find a mantra that works.  Good luck, I hope that helps!",False,False

It’s important to eat a variety of foods because all foods contain different nutrients and vitamins. In the meantime, I’d recommend getting a multivitamin in just to supplement your diet atm.   There are also recipes that show you how to really “mask” veggies and can make them a lot more appealing and approachable. It’s easier to eat just one vegetable with a lot of gravy and bread and the like vs a salad for example. Cauliflower rice is another good option to try with cut up meat and sauce. It can serve as a good base. Fruit might also be a good place to start. People in general perfer it due to its natural sweetness. You can make smoothies if you don’t like certain textures, or even better, chop and freeze them for a really refreshing experience. Room temperature apples might feel gross, but a fridge temp Apple might be way better, as it’s nostly just water and sweetness.",False,False
