I think they're just like that to drive the plot forward, but seriously. The characters switch personality so often I almost think they've added new roles",False,False

Ik lots of people struggle to gain weight, and although I can’t personally relate to what that’s like, I’m  sure it’s difficult to deal with. I think I just have too high of standards for that show lol. Hope you are doing well&lt;3",False,True

But also, trying to gain weight on such short notice would be hard. It took me a whole year of stuffing my face to gain just 15 lbs. I have health problems that make eating difficult, but I don't see that as being so different.",False,False
