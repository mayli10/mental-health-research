Yup, you can do it.  If you're suddenly not ""cured"", the days when you manage to keep things down will become more and more.  Don't forget you managed it, especially on really bad days.  That's a really great achievement.",False,True

It's surprising how much extra you have to eat every single day to gain a tiny bit.  Some days I've thought uh-oh I've eaten what normal people would have for Christmas dinner, but when you write it down it's still what someone would eat if they were on a diet.  Be brave, comrade.  We'll win this war - and enjoy really good food.",False,True

I'm also not using a clinic, my boyfriend is really sweet and helping me. He just asked me to not go below 1200 and I've slowly upped that minimum as I've tried to recover.  I hit 1800 for the first time last night without binging so I'm counting it as a win!",False,False

I actually did manage to, I ate the meal slowly, enjoyed it, and didn't binge or purge :)  Now that I know I can do it, I can do it again.",False,False

I get nowhere with clinics and their treatment plans.  I'm so stubborn I can't have anyone tell me what to do.  I'm going alone right now (apart from psych appointments) and I'm finding it less stressful than having to turn up to the clinic and somehow gained what they wanted me to because somehow in a week I've overcome my fear of calories and certain foods.  I'm sticking with recovery though.  It doesn't matter how long it takes so long as I'm not going backwards.  You'll get there.  My pace is slow as a tortoise but gradually eating more is become less stressful to the point where I'd freak out over a cereal bar and now I'll have two and don't even feel bad about it.  You can do it.  We're stronger than we think you know. x,False,True

It's like a habit that you've got to break and it's tough as hell.  I hope you managed to do it, but if not, you can try the next day or the day after.  Keep fighting it and you'll win x  (You're a winner anyway, it's your illness that's a big fucking loser)",False,True
