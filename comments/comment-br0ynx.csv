Don’t tell them you’re worried about what they’re eating (because some people freak out/restrict harder if they know someone is watching) and obviously don’t comment on body because there’s just no way it can go well since ED brain can interpret even the most benign comment as an insult.  The suggestion is to express that you care about them as a person (as an idea,lol) and that you love them. I know you know this but it’s just worth noting for lurkers, but you can’t force anyone to get helped by you. They need to come when they’re ready otherwise it’ll just be a traumatic experience for all. Building a healthy, trusting relationship allows them to come when they have the strength and are able to talk. Sometimes just knowing that others really care can be enough to kick some people out of a spiral but again it’s not a for sure thing.",False,False

I know how important it is to make eating as stress-free as possible. I would NEVER pressure anyone into eating if they weren't ready,False,True

If you ask them if they've eaten dont do it accusatorily and offer them maybe something comfortable for them whatever that may be (like an apple, protein bar) or maybe like some electrolyte drink that isnt like a fear food (a lot of ppl with eds dont like drinking non diet drinks so like maybe something with some calories but not like soda.) DO NOT try to force feed them like pizza it will just scare and isolate them.",False,False
