And it does get better! I know it’s really fucking difficult, but the sooner you can accept that your hunger is a completely natural response to your prior restriction, the closer you will be to freedom from food anxiety. Keep honoring your hunger. Don’t try to starve after a binge. Forgive and move on. You’ll find yourself thinking about food less, and you’ll get better and better at listening to what your body needs to be its best for you. I know you feel uncomfortable with the weight gain, but it’s what you need right now. It’s going to be ok.  I’m so sorry you’re going through this, though. It’s hell and you are a strong, amazing person for soldiering on. Is there any way you can open up to your partner about this? EDs thrive on isolation, truly. It really, really helps to have someone to talk to.",False,False

I'm the exact same height and weight range, though my lowest was only about 105, and I gained 10-15 lbs really quickly this fall. Just finished college and I'm trying to find a well paying office job like that, except part of me wants to give up the search and be a waitress or barista or anything that requires walking. I just want to be away from home and the pantry for as long as possible. And no one at all knows about my disorder either.   Just remember the binging *will* taper off as soon as your body repairs the damage from starvation. I know it doesn't feel like it will ever stop, and until it does it's absolute hell, but eventually you'll find an equilibrium and can lose again a little slower. Taking a break from work might not be possible, but resting as much as you can will help too. ",False,False
