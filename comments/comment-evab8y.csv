Half the subbers are there to see examples of photo manipulating, and half the subbers are there to verbally abuse or mock any women who MIGHT have POSSIBLY taken part in photo editing.  It's fucked up. And if you take up issue with it there, you get a huge response of ""we don't care how they feel, we're here to make fun of them"" essentially.  It's fucking toxic. It has turned into not only dragging the photo manips, but insulting and hating on the natural untouched features of whoever gets posted there.",False,False
