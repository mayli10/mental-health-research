Like no medical doctor in their right mind would look at me and think I'm healthy. I'm sure anyone who looks at me knows I need to lose weight.   What I feel I should be doing but am too lazy to do is exercising 2-3 times a week (like yoga) and 4 times a week hit at least 8,000 steps in addition to counting calories and not going above 1400. I feel like this is medically reasonable but I find it so hard to do it makes me feel like shit.   Once I do start doing healthy things it takes over my life. I cant think about anything else. If I have a good day or not is dictated by the scale which I use multiple times a day. I expressed that to my psychiatrist but he pretty much gave me the go ahead that everything I described is what I should be doing. I feel like being obsessed is the price I have to pay for getting this fat.   I resent the work I have to do to get thin and I don't want to relapse into starving or purging but those are inevitable once I start dieting. I feel like I'm just not strong enough to diet which I know just sounds whiny. I think my psychiatrist felt I was just being whiny bc obviously I'm not healthy and need to lose weight and eat better.   I'm doubting if I even have a real eating disorder or if I'm just making shit up bc I want to keep eating like crap and that dieting is hard for everyone and I'm just lazy. But saying I have an eating disorder is a convenient excuse for not getting my shit together.   Phew. . . I typed more than I planned. ",False,False

I keep trying to remind myself that it's normal to have gained weight on T because, like you said, it's like my body's going through a second puberty (I literally call my transition ""puberty 2"" to my friends haha) but it can be a little hard to accept. Though, I am someone who often needs validation from others, so to hear you say that is a bit comforting.  Like I said before, I'm definitely gonna tell my new PCP about all of this, but I'm gonna try to find a PCP that is reputable for being good with LGBT+ stuff. Hopefully if they're decent with that, they'll also be a fairly understanding person in general and can wrap their head around me having an ED as well. I guess we'll see what happens.  Thank you again!",False,True

BMI is bullshit to the extent that it's about averages and your individual circumstances do matter.   &amp;#x200B;  i hope you get some answers in terms of the sleep study, and good luck with the new PCP!   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;",False,False
