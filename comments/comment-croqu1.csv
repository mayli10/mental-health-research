This attitude will make the mom feel she was right to do so and do it again. I just hope they reply the email letting her know that is unacceptable and not a thank you you are great.,False,False

My mom also read my journal when I was younger and yelled at me and forced me to see a psychologist. I haven’t trusted her since.   I know it hurts. Sending love &lt;3,False,False

And I am sorry that they are trying to invalidate your gender dysphoria on top of being intrusive. Just remember to be you and do what makes you feel right and there are always people out there who accept you for you &lt;3,False,True

My personal therapist definitely told me this will be something to explore in our next session since this might be where my problems stem from.

There is burning a bridge, but she really found a way to just fucking blow the bridge up. And I know I shouldn't feel guilty, but I hate to let the treatment team down with relapsing. The guilt and shame will be there no matter what, but thank you for being here with your kind words and support. I appreciate you!",False,True

Because usually, when ""loved ones"" snoop into private stuff like that, it's because they have suspicions of things that could possibly harm us. However, everyone is already aware of everything. You are already in treatment. So really, she violated your privacy and broke your trust for what exactly? Nothing except self satisfaction of knowing your private thoughts? This is all just a big 'wtf"".     I agree with your support/treatment team that you shouldn't let this backtrack your progress, but I do think that strong words need to be said to her because this is completely unacceptable and she should be told that. Boundaries need to be established, otherwise, I don't think she'd be able to stay in your life, not with that sort of negative impact and terrible behavior.",False,False

In a few days when you've had some space you can look over it and decide if there are parts of it you want to send to your mom or just talk about with your therapist.,False,False

Absolutely none. I'm so sorry it happened to you. The one piece of advice I'd give is not to make any decisions right now. Don't cut all your ties to your mom, don't decide to never speak to her again. Not yet. Let yourself be as angry as you need to be, but maybe you'll be a little more okay in a day or two.",False,False

That was your jurnal, your safe place and she went ahead and read it. I'd be livid if my mother did this. I'm so so sorry you had to go through all of this mess and then, on top of all, find that she read your diary. And she did not even consult you first! No! She went to all these other people first as if talking to you would have been impossible?? That's so messed up on so many levels. WHY WOULDN'T SHE TALK TO YOU FIRST???  I hope you'll feel fine and remember, it's alright to be angry with her. What she did was not okay. Even if she read it, she should've talked with you first, then, optionally, with all of the other people. Sending many many many hugs for you",False,False

My mom used to read my emails without my knowledge, and for literally no reason other than “needing to know my life,” and it’s so insanely violating. The only reason I know she’s never read my journals is bc I wrote about trans stuff in there and she is convinced I’m randomly making that all up for attention and have no actual history of gender dysphoria  So so sorry you’re going through this &lt;3 It is a truly awful experience even if your mom did mean well",False,False

You say you have trust issues but I feel like that makes it sound like they’re *your* fault? I don’t know your life but if this is typical behavior for her then I’m not surprised.  Just please try to be kind to yourself. This reflects entirely on your mom and not on you.,False,False
