I don’t know how much I’m supposed to weigh they don’t say that for good reason lol. But I assume 190-210lbs is the safe zone? When I was 185 (I weighed myself) they said I was at the bare minimum.,False,True

I know everyone is different, but I'm close to your height and my parents insist that even though I'm in the normal BMI range I need to gain more weight.",False,False
