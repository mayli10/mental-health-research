Aspartame, stevia, erythritol, acesulfame, saccharine etc. are all different chemicals with different properties. Even if we found out that, say, aspartame gave you cancer (which it fucking doesn't), that would say *nothing* about the other sweeteners.  It's like people can't grasp that there's something on this god forsaken earth that's not completely evil. The whole world is living by the mantra that ""if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.""  Personally I don't like the distinction between ""natural"" vs. ""artificial"". I propose using ""natural"" vs. ""supernatural"".",False,False

It specifically states most issues were found w women who were obese, which we know for sure is a major cause for health issues, drinking diet soda or not. It also states the study cannot show that diet soda is the absolute cause for any of the health issues.   Nutrition is super hard to study and make any sort of ‘yes or no’ claims in terms of what we eat and how it affects us.. if you’re having a diet coke every few days otherwise with a ~healthy diet, you’ll probably be fine. If you’re overweight or eating a lot of junk and neglecting essential AA and vitamins &amp; minerals I’d have a look at changing that first rather than just stopping diet soda ya know?   Sorry if that doesn’t make sense. Most studies these days are crap and it only takes a quick skim of the abstract or material &amp; methods to see whether or not it’s a concern. ",False,False

They cherry pick the worst studies/journal articles they can find and reword the results to get the reaction they want. I can almost guarantee you that all the studies mentioned have never been replicated and aren't peer reviewed. And they wouldn't have included any of the thousands of studies that refute their stance.  The FDA would remove artificial sweeteners if the cost outweighed the benefits. If it really causes so many health problems they would have to remove it or be liable for medical expenses.  Many long term national studies aren't accurate because they fail to take into account things like dietary habits and environmental factors. There are too many independent variables for the results to be considered valid. Correlation does not equal causation.  Also, it's CNN.  Whilst I personally think that there are some negative side effects of artificial sweeteners, it's the same for almost every thing we consume. I know I would rather have artificial sweeteners then sugar, especially since we know that there are too many risks associated with sugar.",False,False
