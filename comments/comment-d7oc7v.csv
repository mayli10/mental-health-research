I went on fam vacation in June and ate above maintence for 4 days and when I got back I ate a little below maintence and was back at my CW Iâ€™m like 3 days. Eating over for one day will be okay trust me ðŸ’•,False,False

Just the fact that you know that purging shouldnâ€™t be an option is an amazing thing to be able to think and just know that it is only going to benefit you long term stopping  In regards to feelings of overeating equating failure and weight gain remember that our bodies are quite smart and will not be ruined with one bad day(s) sometimes itâ€™s even helpful to up calories periodically as we can speed up our metabolism like this (I THINK THIS IS WHAT I FEEL HAPPENS IN MY CASE),False,False
