Yea, its kind of hard to get information since ED classifications in general are kind of stupid, but i didnt think you meant anything harmful :)",False,False

Like we all wish we could do better than we are cause that's the nature of having an ED is never being able to control your own mind. I can do that but I can't make myself purge and I can't make myself eat regular meals or healthy food. We all have different things we struggle with the most but the disorder and the mindset are pretty much the same. ",False,False

Also I didn’t mean to seem like I thought EDNOS was “lesser” or anything of the sort. I was just looking for more specific and I didn’t know there were many sub-parts of EDNOS like that. I’m gonna look into that!  ,False,True

Particularly Purging Disorder, which is part of EDNOS seems like it fits. Its like Bulimia but purges are triggered by all/most meals and there doesnt have to be any binges, though there may.",False,False

I call it that but in a way I guess it's really not cause I'm not restricting what I eat either, I'm just not doing it. Cause I don't have enough self control to just eat little amounts of food over a decent time lol. When I do eat it's everything I'll eat for the day and then I'm done. Sometimes I'll have the willpower to just eat a little bit that one time, just to get rid of a headache or something but I'll wait until I feel really sick and nauseaus that way I won't want to eat a whole lot. I'll eat like a can of tuna or some deli turkey. And then I'll feel better and not eat again cause I know if I eat when I feel okay ill end up binging ",False,False

And I don’t consider myself a person who restricts really because I always considered restricting as having self control to eat tiny amounts over a decent amount of time, whereas I just straight up won’t eat anything at all unless it’s a binge/purge. Is that even considered restricting? Idk. ",False,True

Usually binge and then restrict to make up for it. Technically im bulimic too cause to get diagnosed bulimic you have to have a pattern of binge eating and then either purging through throwing up or trying to purge those calories through over exercise, extreme restriction, or taking laxatives. I never really thought I fit that category but I guess I can see where it makes sense. Its not BED cause I don't eat normally when I'm not binge eating. Not eating feels so good sometimes tho. Like, powerful. ",False,False
