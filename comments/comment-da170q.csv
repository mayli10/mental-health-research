I've stopped compensating for my binges and have put on weight because of it. Much needed weight I think. At 5'8.5 and 125lbs my mind and body have not been happy. This morning I was 131lbs and I always told myself I'd never go to the 130s. The past year has just been hell. I am still scared to gain weight, but I think I'm ready to accept it and binge freely until I can calm down. I just ate an unhealthy 1500 calories and feel like I could easily eat that over again. It was stupid that I didn't eat nutritious food because that's likely why I'm still so hungry, but I'm trying to give my body what it's asking for rather than saying ""no, that food is evil and will make you fat.""",False,False
