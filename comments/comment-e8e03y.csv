So I think weight isn’t really the issue, sure, lower weight = more attractiveness (a very simple formula not to be taken literally) for many people including myself, but what I hated about myself more when I was heavier wasn’t actually how I looked, but how I looked as a result of the lack of control in my life and of course behavior. Weight loss was just like any other goal in life, but one I couldn’t achieve without much struggles, and so I hated that.   Therefore, even though I’ve lost a bit of weight now through years of relapses and binge/restrict episodes, my behaviors haven’t really gotten better, if not more unhealthy.  So yeah, my enemy is still my ED, i.e. binging, and restriction is just an unhealthy attempt to defy this vicious cycle which of course ends up to no avail.  Although gotta say societal beauty standards of course still fucked me up and fueled my ED, that my self-esteem really isn’t higher now that I’m “thinner” because I’m also “flatter,” it’s just a different form of self-hatred. Although I’d also argue that I have beauty standards and aesthetic likings myself as well and the unfortunate truth is that it is also one that’s pretty hard or even impossible to achieve, because it’s basically the same as the societal ones. Gotta be blessed with them genes baby.  Eh I don’t know where I’m going with this lol, my self-reflection and awareness rarely really helps me with improving my situation, knowing how I got here but unable to find a way out is, fucking hell.",False,True
