My favorite thing in my kitchen is my aarke carbonator (my second favorite thing is my hot water dispenser).   I like to add a squeeze of lime, grapefruit, or a dash of bitters. While some people keep a home bar I’ve just got a ridiculous collection of bitters.   Right now I’m sipping on sparkling water with a splash of dashfire’s lavender bitters.",False,False
