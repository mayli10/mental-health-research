Maybe you can start out by eating low calorie foods whenever you feel hungry and then work your way up to maintenance? I certainly didn't go straight from 500 calories a day to 1500 when I started counting. I started by going up just a little like to 600-700. Then eventually I went up a little more. And eventually a little more than that. It took quite a while to get up to maintenance, but it worked out eventually.",False,False
