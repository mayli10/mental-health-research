I've been maintaining/losing slowly for the past few months while eating maintenance calories for my height/weight, so quite a bit more than 1200 most days after losing weight quickly on low restriction for an extended period. If anything I'm continuously surprised that I'm not putting on weight because I got so used to restricting.",False,False

So youâ€™ll gain your weight back + some more if you go back to 1200 even if itâ€™s under the amount of calories you burn per day?? Oh my god.,False,False

I was a healthy weight when it started. At my lowest, I was underweight for my frame, and at my highest almost 220lbs. I've gained and lost over 100lbs. Repeatedly. It's wrecked my body. So if you never seek help to learn to have a truly healthy relationship with food, you could be either starving or overeating for the rest of your life like I apparently am. I wish I talked to someone when I was a teen.",False,False

I could have maintained it but i was still sick in the head from my ED, i wanted to get better and rid myself of this mental illness and also get my period and hormones back so im intentionally gaining all my weight back now",False,False

Was low-restrictive and came down from an overweight BMI to underweight last year - now I'm still underweight and not nearly as restrictive. I'm disorganised when it comes to food intake/calorie counting but I've been maintaining my weight with some slower loss throughout for the last few months and my constant crushing fear of putting heaps of weight on has been continuously thwarted so far this year.  I've noticed that my stomach isn't nearly as upset after meals now that I'm trying harder to maintain. For a while after I started eating more, it played havoc with me but it's levelled out now. I do still hold on to weird water weight - e.g. for the last two weeks I've felt like I've been eating way too much, the scale was consistently showing an unsafe weight for days and I was terrified but yesterday it dropped all the way back, I'm talking 5kg difference, meaning even when I feel like I'm over-eating I'm still actually just maintaining.   I think I feel shocked by maintaining because I went for such a long time at such a small intake when I was losing, so now I'm terrified of ""undoing"" all of that - I was so focused on losing a certain amount per month and every calorie over counted against that, but now the game is altered because if I lose any more my loved ones will stage an intervention. It's scary moving from low restriction to maintenance but it's the ED logic, I keep trying to remember that - it took such a big deficit for so long to get here, it would take so much food over a sustained period to come close to undoing it, and it's okay to eat a normal amount of food again. I haven't had such awful orthostatic hypotension lately either, it was so bad when I was low-restricting that I got ominously used to it.  Long-winded way of trying to say you will be okay if you up your intake - it absolutely does not equate to out-of-control weight gain. CICO still reigns supreme. I went through interesting strata of hunger levels when I upped my calories - from little appetite to way bigger than usual to now normal levels for me. I know it's scary to eat more normal amounts again but it's doable.",False,False
