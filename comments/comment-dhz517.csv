Like 20 minutes later they are cooking breakfast and pour an ungodly amount of bacon grease into the pan to cook the eggs...   😱😱😱  Then... it’s time for the biscuits... they buttered every biscuit when they came out of the oven. Then put butter on the table so people could apply butter to their biscuits.   😱😱😱  My fiancé heated up a biscuit the next morning and it was so buttery he had to get a new paper plate  My secrets in a nutshell: I WOULD FUCKING NEVER EVEN CONSIDER DOING ANY OF THAT. I’m so paranoid about calories, I wipe the pan down after a tiny bit of spray oil to make sure there isn’t too much and they are over here pouring a cup of bacon grease into the eggs   And my fiancé wonders why I freak out about eating when we go see his family (like 2 sticks of butter in mashed potatoes 🤦🏻‍♀️)",False,False

It's just never okay to comment in someone's size. Sure, maybe 8 times out of 10 it's no big thing but those 2 other people are SCREWED UP over it. It's not worth the risk.    My sister in law did that to me at a wedding once. ""How do you stay so skinny!?"" She asks. I LITERALLY said, ""I stopped eating""  There was a long pause followed by big laugh. ""nahh I walk a lot at work I pull like 15k steps before 5pm have you seen my new fitbit you should get one!""  It was awesome.  Kudos for walking away from that one. You made the better choice.",False,False
