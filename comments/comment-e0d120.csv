I think being able to laugh at/with myself is really helpful. My therapist and I chuckle a lot during sessions and I enjoy that. It’s not malicious. More Douglas Adams-esque; laughing at the absurdity and using that as a tool to enjoy life more. (Body-wise, I call it my “jello booty” cuz it keeps me away from despair.)",False,False
