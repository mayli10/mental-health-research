What it can do is make you have stronger food cravings. And also medications have different effects on different people. It might not give you cravings at all. Either way, it’s best to consult your doctor about any concerns you have! Don’t stop taking your medications with consulting them first. Take care!",False,False

The only advice I can offer is the same as another commenter, if the medication helps the symptoms you're on them for please stay on them. I hate when people say this to me but it's 100% true and I'm just stubborn: The benefits are greater than the con of POSSIBLE weight gain",False,False

No medication will make your body create fat tissue out of thin air, medication weight gain is caused by an appetite increase - stick to your selected deficit and you *will* lose weight (source: I was on mirtazapine for a while and gained 10kg bc I was craving carbs so bad I ate sugar out of the bag... lost it all later by eating less)",False,False
