They hide a lot plus, you can mix and match tops. Worse comes to worst, you can also rent an outfit for just for each event so that way you'll have something that currently fits you and no one will be any the wiser.   This might be a last ditch option but self tailoring is also on the table. If you undo backside stitches on a shalwar or something and add a panel, it'll be a bit more roomy. For a top, you could undo both side stitches and add evenly spaced/sized panels. If you're wearing a sari, then just wrap it so it covers the panels if they're not done neatly enough.   Honestly, losing ten pounds of even water weight requires major dedication so altering your clothes might be a better option for you. ",False,False

There‚Äôs tons of diy recipes if you don‚Äôt want to spend much at a spa too. You lose inches almost immediately. Also cut out carbs, processed foods, and sodium to reduce water weight. Also dark leafy greens, too much fiber, and carbonation can cause bloating so try cutting those out the day before each event. Plus with the addition of some high quality shapewear/spanx you should be good. Also a spray tan can make you look leaner as well.",False,False

Definitely don't do a salt water flush/lax, you might just end up with more bloating, and it's really not fun:(    What I tried to do last time was to chill out, eat lots of veg (spinach, so much spinach), avoid really salty and carb-y stuff, and drink lots of water/plain tea. Maybe try epsom salt baths, they've always cut down any water weight I was holding, and they're great for sore muscles.    &amp;#x200B;  You won't be able to lose ten pounds in ten days,  but if you stick to stuff that wont bloat you up, and lose any water you're holding onto, you might pull it off, and it'll be way less stressful.  All the best to you&lt;3",False,False

Just say you want to mix it up with a different outfit.   No matter what remember that your friends an family I voted you to their weddings because they love you. They‚Äôre not inviting you to see you wear a particular outfit.   I genuinely don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a healthy way to lose that amount of weight in the time allotted but you can minimize bloat by being low carb with a moderate salt intake.   ‚ù§Ô∏è hugs ,False,False

You‚Äôd need to be at a deficit of 3,500 calories each day. If you were able to exercise enough to burn 3,500 calories you‚Äôd probably gain water weight for your body to repair your muscles. You might be able to flush some water weight but that‚Äôs running into really dangerous territory if you‚Äôre also not eating anything for 10 days. ",False,False
