I developed an eating disorder after loosing all my friends, during that time i was actively trying to loose weight and once these two things came together they crushed me completely. I am turning 19 in less that a month and i just wish i would have gotten help once i started spiraling. I remember my GP noticing my quick weightloss and telling me that ""when you feel like you cant eat anymore, please run as fast to my office as possible."" A bitch never did that. I recently realized that two girls i know who are also 16 are developing eating disorders and i cant help them. They are in deep denial about it and they believe that once they will hit their ugw everything will be fine. But it wont. You will go through hell. I would literally not wish an eating disorder on my worst enemy. It fucks you, every single aspect of you as you are now will dissapear. From stuff like falling out hair to brain damage all the way to a complete loss of your personality. Shit i completely changed my walk just so my legs look skinnier and now i cant walk normally anymore. Eating disorders are scary and they kill. Please, reach out for help. I dont want you to go through this. I dont want you to suffer. You may think that you are not enough and you will abtain it by loosing weight...but u wont. Because you have always been enough. No matter what your head might be telling you. You are you and you are beautiful. Please reach out for professional help and stop this illness before it can completely manifest itself in your head. Sending you love and strength",False,False

I know I should tell someone. My mum struggled with body image issues when she was a teen I think. I’m just scared that if I tell my parents that they’ll just try to make me eat more which will not fix the problem. I would go to the councillor at school but schools finished for the summer. Thanks for your advice though, I’ll think about telling a friend.  I feel like I could eat what I used to, physically, it would just be a question of trying to over come the overwhelming guilt which would accompany that. I know it’s all in my head and it’s completely illogical, but I just can’t seem to seperate myself from it right now, and look at it with an outside perspective to understand that actually I am beautiful and I don’t need to change anything. It’s just really hard.  Thanks again for replying",False,True

I was 14 and decided I was going to make my diet a bit healthier, and then the amount I was eating became less and I started paying attention to calories. Then I developed anorexia and now it’s a decade later and I’m sick.   Can you talk to anyone in your life? Do you have a school counsellor you could go see? You’re 16 so I think it would be confidential (check though). Or if you have a nice relationship with your parents, would you tell them and ask for their support? They can help you and would want to. I say this because one of the biggest things in EDs is the secrecy. We hide it. Just like you are currently trying to hide this from your parents.   You’re looking at food related media because you’re not eating enough and your body and mind want food and are going to obsess. Like you say, what you’re doing to feel comfortable in your body isn’t working. This isn’t going to work. If you keep going like this you’ll feel increasingly uncomfortable.  My #1 advice is to break the secrecy and tell someone and ask for support. It’s really hard to do, I’m not trying to minimise that. It will take courage. You have that within you and you deserve the help. You deserve better than this. My other advice with your current eating is to try to stop keeping track of everything you eat. And try to increase the amount you eat, even a little bit at a time, until you’re back to healthy amounts. It sounds like you were eating a healthy diet before this all began.",False,False
