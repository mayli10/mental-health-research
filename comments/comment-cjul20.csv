If I remember correctly, the recommendation even says tale 1-3 at once. If you saw them all when you puked then you won‚Äôt have any laxative effects, obv.      However (big sister alert here), if you‚Äôre going to try again. Take one, and drink a full glass of water with it. Repeat for the next 2 pills, and drink 1/2 - 1 glass of water per hour until the laxatives take effect. I don‚Äôt care if you aren‚Äôt thirsty, it‚Äôs for your intestines, not you.      Your day will be absolutely RUINED if you do not drink enough water. Of all the scary stories you‚Äôve read, probably 80% or more are from not being hydrated enough.      Be well and poop on, my dear.",False,False
