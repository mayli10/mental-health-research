Living in NYC- you can be anybody. It might be tempting to fall into the trope of these long + slender all black everything - but you can wear more exciting things than that and get noticed.   Youâ€™re wicked broke right? Second hand stores in the city will become your goldmine. Go to the cheapest ones and I guarantee there will still be great clothes there.,False,False

Which is saying something, bc I'm from L.A. But the mere difference in aesthetic norms was startling enough to fuck with me. SoCal is more about the whole fitness lifestyle and toned body thing. Manhattan? There's more of a professional model base, as opposed to the whole Hollywood circuit, so there are startlingly thin people (and their imitators) out on those streets. Doing the whole ""black coffee, black clothes, pianist fingers"" aesthetic.   Plus, there is just so much concentrated wealth in Manhattan itself, and so much older wealth - and you can see it in the clothes they wear, which are ostentatious in their (very expensive, tRÃ¨S cHIc) simplicity. Like, you could compare vast swathes of Manhattan to walking in Beverly Hills, but it's just not the same. Beverly Hills is a younger place, and it's diverse, and it's full of flashy ~nouveau extravagance~ that doesn't necessarily exert downward cultural pressure (bc it's SO clearly inaccessible). In general, NYC and the whole East Coast is dressier and more put together than where I'm from, and it's intimidating simply on that level. (I like dressing up, but wildly so, not in deference to cultural or business codes.)   Ultimately though, I wouldn't pressure yourself to blend in with the New York a e s t h e t i q u e unless you really want to. They're mostly all just signalling to each other, you know? The non-bitches aren't judging newcomers for not dressing like them. (And the judgy bitches? They'll only judge harder if you strain but fail to look like them, as opposed to just being your """"""""quaint"""""""" """"""""little"""""""" self. But like, I wouldn't advise hanging around judgy, shitty people like that to begin with.)   It's just...An Adjustment. And you're really playing it on hard mode,  by moving straight from a rural area to one of the most triggering cities in the world. For that, I salute you. Good luck! It will get easier, and less distracting!",False,False
