I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre stuck, I think about my IF times as my darkest.  I don‚Äôt know how I got out.  It was such a cycle of fast, exercise, binge.    Is an equilibrium even possible once you‚Äôre in the cycle?   You can escape somehow.  But shit dude I have no idea.  It SUCKS.  I hope the antidepressants help.  I hope the psychiatrist helps.  Try not to let yourself put that off for too long.  I just look back and think how exhausting it is, the cycle makes existing such a chore.   There‚Äôs light at the end.  Not a lot,  but enough.",False,False

I feel literally lost. It's like I have completely lost the ability to eat like a regular person. Part of me is like yes but I always ate snacks at night so idk if I am actually eating that much more than normal before I close my eating window. I am still eating at a deficit but I eat more than anyone I see posting here and been hovering around bmi 19.5-20 for a month now, I clearly can't lose anymore weight without really cutting my calories, despite eating in a deficit.    IF has sent me way way way down the rabbit hole of relapse. I have no idea how people do it without turning into lunatics. I also started it in a way to just curb my morning snacking, I used to let myself have two days a week where I'd eat before 12, and I ate at night until I naturally just got full. That started in March, well now I can't eat before 2:10 pm or after 7 pm and take 2 lax a day plus fiber supplements and I have started smoking again at night to curb my appetite. Every week I tinker around with my eating window to make it smaller and smaller so I feel ""safer"" that I won't over eat but then it also creates this false scarcity that I need to eat. Except it's not exactly false bc I am fucking hungry. That's why I am eating so many calories in a sitting. Idk where this is all going. I ask myself this daily. Idk what my end goal is here. Even though I hate it, my body needs food. I need to get to some kind of equilibrium with it all. I have been screwing around with this shit for longer than most of the posters here have been alive.   I am exhausted but also apparently completely unable to make a change. At this point I don't even know what to do. I see my therapist 2x a week, I have been extremely honest with her, and things have gotten so shitty I am finally willing to try an antidepressant but I can't find a psychiatrist lol.",False,False

I‚Äôm fine with restricting before I‚Äôve eaten anything for the day, but if I eat anything before around 5pm I get mad binge urges - this literally happened on Tuesday.

I literally snack every hour if I‚Äôm not doing OMAD. While OMAD helps me tremendously, eating a 500 cal OMAD will definitely lead to binging down the road, at least for me. Also eating fast during my one meal will lead to binging and eventually the binge/restrict cycle begins again. For OMAD to work for me, I‚Äôve got to eat slow (whether that will take 2 hours to finish my meal), lots of vegetables and fruits, and stay around 1200 cal. It definitely works for me but have to be careful about consuming enough.",False,False

You‚Äôre not going to find *those* people on this sub.  And intermittent fasting/OMAD is NOT recommended for people with a history of EDs.  Sure, the first few days OMAD seems like a godsend.  You‚Äôre eating 800 calories a day!  All at one time!  And feeling good!  Until your brain feels deprived and goes haywire.  Shit hits the fan.  Before you know it, your OMAD is over a day‚Äôs worth of calories.  You‚Äôre literally gaining from your OMAD.      Be careful.  Be careful.  Like others, OMAD is also why I‚Äôm here.  Intermittent fasting ruined my life.  I‚Äôve been focused on recovery for close to a damn year and still struggle.  When I get those nasty post-binge thoughts of going back to OMAD, I talk back to those evil ED thoughts immediately.  OMAD and intermittent fasting is disordered eating, it promotes eating disorders.  It‚Äôs dangerous, please be careful.  Edit to add:  I appreciate you‚Äôre trying to help people.  That‚Äôs super kind of you to think of others.  But I think you‚Äôre going to be getting many ‚ÄúOMAD fucked me up‚Äù responses bc that‚Äôs what so many of us have experienced.

OMAD is one of the reasons i'm in this place to begin with. It's the first ride on the binge-restrict rollercoaster, which eventually led to full blown binge-purge for me. OMAD made my head go funny around food, I cannot eat breakfast and lunch anymore without me leaping into full binge mode. I can barely drink coffee for breakfast anymore.",False,False
