The whole ""it's not bad enough when will I be valid what if I do xyz will that make me yzx"" mentality is hella ED. Finding your purpose in life is up to you sis, but I'm going to let you know right now it is absolutely not weight loss. Life is this whole epic thing where you can do all this crazy shit and meet new people and go new places and grow yourself as a human. Your body is just the vessel through wich you experience this journey. I know it's hard to bust thru them ED thoughts but you got this. Being in refeeding for a year is definitely an accomplishment you should be proud of. Having wacky absorption does not negate the validity of your ED or of your recovery attempts.",False,False
