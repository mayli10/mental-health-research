If somebody is just socially unaware of things then I find it wrong.  Because you're valuing them for being skinny, not devaluing them for being fat, that's pretty clear. Both are wrong but one is far worse.   And yes, they were paid to show the world how it is so that people don't get to that stage, that still doesn't make them worthy of being shamed for their bodies. As someone with an eating disorder I thought you'd understand more than anyone that shaming somebody over their weight can be devastating. ",False,False

How is using someone's photo as thinspo a better thing? You just value this person for their skinny figure, but you don't know how they are behind this. At least, as you mentioned, most people on those shows will try to improve (and I feel happy for them when they do), but they were clearly realistic when people said ""we want to pay you to show the world how it is to be 600lbs""...

Thinspo doesn't always do it if it's too much ""goals"" because ive never been that thin so ir just looks unattainable even though it isn't. Pics of Obese people don't help me either do, for the same reason. I don't relate to them and it doesn't disgust me. I do like looking at pictures of celebrities who've gained weight though. Reverse thinspo. People like xtina Aguilera or Taylor swift who went from thin to chubby or even overweight.
