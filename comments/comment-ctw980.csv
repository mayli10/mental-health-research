It sounds like medical parole lol. There's no equivalent in the US that I know of- basically forced psychiatric hold or nothing (for adults). I suppose you can't force people to go to all those appointments because you'd have to have good insurance to make it work, which most people don't have. But that's a huge failing of our system and results in reactive medicine rather than preventative.   I hope you're getting better and your body is also getting a chance to heal, that sounds really stressful.",False,True

When I realized I had no control I realized it had gotten too far.   Don't get me wrong- subjectively I feel like I have control and its still a choice.

But I get the guilt of using up resources that should be used to help actually sick people, I feel like I don't deserve it because it's my fault. I know what to do and I don't.   But i guess to be fair, it's not like most people with an ED know they should eat more or not purge- it's the overwhelming anxiety that comes along with choosing to do the healthy behavior that makes it hard.

It feels like you'll be an exception to the case, surely you have more control. But your brain chemistry gets messed up and you're trapped before you even realize.   I'm glad you were able to talk to your doc! It is so scary. I held back in therapy for a while because I was so scared to give it life. It took me like 10+ minutes to get the confidence on the day I actually decided to say it. It felt weird saying out loud and to someone else. Like before I was able to pretend it didn't happen still?

In the beginning I was just sad and fat and felt so proud of myself for dropping XXXlbs in 6 months because I had a shitty relationship. Thinking I was the next big thing getting compliments and told how good I look all the time.   Within that same 6 months I ruptured my oesophagus. Realised after a while that what I was doing was gonna kill me but became so insanely conceited that my body went from being this thing I carried around to my greatest obsession.   Depression reared it’s ugly head so did alcoholism and drug addiction. Somewhere along that time I gained XXlbs. I got clean I got sober I got my shit together I got my bipolar disorder treated.   Flash forward to this year and I was like shiiiit I got fat and it was like I got my eating disorder back out of the cupboard and said “listen buddy you managed to shred my weight once before in life how about we try this again” and now I’ve lost XXlbs since March. I started off with such noble fucking intentions and now I’m back to heavy restricting crying over calories and shoving my entire fucking fist into the back of my throat or chugging salt water to turn my stomach inside out.

Like, numbers that at one time seemed crazy low are just normal now because once we got there it lost its untouchability or mystery or something. That’s the horrible thing about losing too much because suddenly everything above your lowest weight feels like a failure even if it’s objectively very very small.   I’ve talked about this in other comments too but for some reason a majority of specialists still operate on the belief that if you gain weight your mindset will improve magically, which I can speak from experience is bullshit. Eating enough and getting more nutrition definitely can help you think more clearly, but unless you’re really in a medically dangerous spot  that is possible to do without weight gain. They draw false correlations between gaining weight and improving mindset because they don’t realize it’s the longer duration of improved nutrition that did that, not necessarily the weight.   I absolutely feel like more people would be open to recovery and success rates would be higher if the main focus in the beginning was not on weight gain but improving mindset and eating better. Obviously the point being you would start getting help before you got so sick that it was medically necessary you gain- but maybe for a lot of people it wouldn’t get to that point because they’d be more open to recovery sooner if it wasn’t so associated w forced weight gain. I would have genuinely gotten help voluntarily way before I got extremely dangerously underweight if I didn’t 100% associate it with people who were going to force me to gain and undo my hard work.",False,False

I didn't actually have a lot to lose but I got addicted to seeing a lower number and I guess I also see it is ""if I'm at this weight then it means I can still get to a lower weight""   Then yeah, intense fear of gaining makes me scared of recovering.

I sometimes see articles or people saying eating disorders are genetic and you have no power over it happening or not etc. and I don’t even agree. I had a lot of weight to lose at one point because I was tired of looking heavy so I went on a diet with a totally healthy mindset but like, in order to lose a shit ton of weight in my opinion you basically *have* to implement some kind of disordered eating at some point, because otherwise you won’t lose all of it even if you’re at a healthy weight, if that makes sense? A lot of people normalize it and don’t understand that counting calories and restricting your intake by a lot month after month is in a lot of ways just as unhealthy and doing the same thing to your body as someone who actually has diagnosed anorexia. Your label only switches from “healthy dieter” to “anorexic” when you become underweight.   Through this whole process your brain becomes accustomed to certain strong-willed patterns because that’s what is required to successfully lose weight (this is why so many people can’t successfully lose weight and keep it off- the only difference between them and us is we weren’t going to let anything, even our deepest primal needs, get in the way of us successfully losing). Once you do lose to a good place your brain is still stuck in that state and it becomes harder and harder to turn it off. I totally made this happen to myself because if I didn’t I would still be overweight to this day, the question is how tf do I change these patterns to more healthy ones without gaining weight? And the problem w a lot of treatment is, no matter what weight you are even if it’s like 2lbs underweight their main goal seems to be you gaining, which immediately turns us off from trusting them or wanting to recover.",False,False
