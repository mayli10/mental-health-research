I let them weigh me.  They didnt freak out and want to put me in in paitent rehab or anything like that. They just talked about how they want to help me not use food (or lack of food) to control how I felt. They started me on an out paitent treatment plan. So seeing the thearpist once a week and seeing regular medical doctor every 2 weeks and a dietitian here and there.  It's ok to be nervous and the drs I talked to just want to help. Best of luck!,False,False
