It’s her projecting her own body image issues onto you; it sucks and it isn’t fun but know that it’s nothing to do with you and how you look or act.

Do as much as you can to not let it get to you, and if you feel it really start to affect your body image or relationships with others, speak to someone like your school counselor or a trusted friend/adult.",False,False
