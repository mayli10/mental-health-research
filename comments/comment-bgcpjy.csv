It does make sense, and I definitely have that ed competitiveness thing (I live with someone who is underweight despite wanting to gain, and I'm so jealous) but I think this is more the perfectionism for me. Like I just need it to be acknowledged that whatever it is is just so hard it feels impossible, then I don't feel as overwhelmed and can try again with more energy, telling myself I can try one more time and if it doesn't work then I can give up and I'll have tried my best and it's okay to fail.",False,False

I hope you know that your feelings are very much so valid, and maybe the whole being-negative-makes-you-do-whatever is to do with the competitiveness of eds in general? because it makes us feel like we've ""beaten"" something by doing something we've been to disillusioned to not be able to do, and by doing so it makes us feel better about ourselves. I have no idea if any of that made sense, if it didn't (and even if it did) I hope you have a good day :)",False,True

So now I just blame that then and whenever I eat and immediately feel guilty and anxious. Knowing it's just how my body works makes me feel a little better, and makes it easier to move past it. (Similarly, if I tell myself I can't do something aloud, I immediately can do the thing. It's like I just need to validate how I feel for it to be less unmanageable. Apparently that's weird though, lol; people always try to tell me I can do whatever it is, and I'm like, ""guys, you're literally not helping, be more negative"")",False,False
