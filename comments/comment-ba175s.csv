It’s nice to get some reassurance. I’ve been working hard at loving myself and my body over the last year. I’m happy to be in a pretty good place like 80% of the time. ,False,True

I was critically delicate when it came to dressing my new body and you've done two things which are out your comfort zone; the meal and dressing in clothes which fit you.   Even now, I have a really turbulent relationship with form fitting clothes and waistbands in particular. If I am going to be eating a meal in anything other than pyjamas at night then i go for flowey, lose tops or dresses. I know the logic of ""everyone bloats/gets food babies"" etc but for me, I chose not to try and force myself to go through experiences which I find traumatic like eating a meal out in clothes I know are a lil Bit pushing my comfort zone. It's fine. I don't consider it a disordered behaviour, it's a compromise I am happy to make. During recovery you will learn more about how to adapt challenges for yourself and realise it's not black or white. Generally if I'm challenging my comfort zone in one area (example: eating a meal out) I look to maintain my comfort in other variables (example : the location or company or clothes). You're doing fine! ",False,False
