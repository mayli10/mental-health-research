Yeah my ECG was taken when I had just laid down, so that makes a lot of sense. I'm at my clinic tomorrow so I'll mention it and see what they suggest as well. Thanks again!",False,True

If your ECG occurred during full consciousness and you didn't sit or lie for a long period before hand it would only tell you about your ""active"" numbers rather than your ""inactive"" numbers. It can be very, very dangerous and often accompanies long periods of restriction. It's a BFD (and why in IP doctors wake up some patients at various points through the night to eat).  I'm not really sure what to do about it beyond maybe making sure you eat before bed? I wouldn't call that a cure but it *might* help. ",False,False
