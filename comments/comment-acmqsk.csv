Frustrating,  I know, but what more can you do. It took me ages to get out of the 180s even though I was eating right and exercising, counting calories, never binging. I was doing everything right but no change. I ended up doing a water fast to jumpstart my weight loss again but even if I didn't do one, I'm sure if I had continued doing all of those things, the scale would budge. Also dont forget that if you're gaining muscle the scale isn't gonna go down as much as you think. ",False,False

Do you feel sore/like you’re retaining water? Exercising has a lot of benefits but it’s still a physical stress on the body.",False,False

And if I wanted to lose weight slowly I would eat 1200 calories every day. I’ve earned a lot more weight loss than I’m getting and it’s incredibly upsetting ,False,True

I’ve been (high) restricting since around september/october and i’ve only lost 10 lbs total. Just remember that it’s easier to keep the weight off if you lose it slowly. I know it’s frustrating but slow progress is still progress! ,False,False
