So, your BMR is your Basal Metabolic Rate, aka metabolism. That's the calories your body uses purely by existing - brain activity, cells doing their thing, your heart beating, lungs breathing, etc. Usually 1100+, often higher.   Then there's your TDEE, your Total Daily Energy Expenditure. That's your BMR plus whatever calories you burn through daily activity. That's not necessarily just exercise either; whatever steps you take throughout the day, doing housework, anything you do at work, that all is your TDEE.   So, since your bodily functions that make the calorie burn of your BMR always happen no matter what, unless you die, every day you'll burn that many calories. So as long as you're not consuming more than that, your body is going to have to use those calories in order to sustain its functions, so you won't gain weight, as the calories have been used!   Now, your metabolism can slow under some circumstances, but definitely not to the degree not commonality people like to push. It drops when you lose weight because you have less of you to sustain, and when you hear about people having a slow heartbeat or being cold all the time, that's indicative of the metabolism being a touch lower, because it means their body isn't using as many calories, since it's doing less work. But even then, it's still generally 900-1000+.   I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any questions! :)",False,False

There is so much misinformation about nutrition floating around the internet. Your body works through your food stores ( the food you eat daily) and then starts eating away at fat stores. StArVaTiOn mode is a myth.,False,False

For example: if you starve yourself during the week only to drink 5 bottles of wine on the weekend you will gain weight. :((((,False,False
