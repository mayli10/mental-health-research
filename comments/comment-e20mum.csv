Even when I can intellectually discern a thought is wonky, I sometimes still feel it so strongly that I‚Äôm confused about what is real.   It‚Äôs hard to put faith in a treatment team over listening to our own instincts and I hope you‚Äôll be able to do that. &lt;3 The BMIs you mention are flirting with serious body/brain damage and death. Trust the statistics and the doctors more than the voice of the ED. This shit is real. I so relate to wrapping my identity up with being sick - it‚Äôs a tough mentality to break out of, but with time and help I think I‚Äôm getting traction.   I hope you‚Äôll find a way to a life where your body is safe and your mind is peaceful.",False,False
