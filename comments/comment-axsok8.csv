Also I know how demoralising and frustrating it is when you do feel like youâ€™ve lost control, but try to take a breath and remember that just like one day of fasting doesnâ€™t make you skinny, one day of eating wonâ€™t make you fat. Itâ€™s all about consistency. Okay, maybe you overate today, maybe you didnâ€™t, but itâ€™s done now and it doesnâ€™t matter anymore. All that matters is what you do next. ",False,False
