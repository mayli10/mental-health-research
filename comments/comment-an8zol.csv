It's not so black and white. We exist on a spectrum. Normal people can do these disordered things and not need therapy because they won't continue to do it until they kill themselves. Doing something ""unhealthy"" a few times is different to doing it compulsively. Normal people aren't trapped or controlled by their eating habits, they utilise them to suit their needs and it doesn't go further than that. So what if some people only eat when they're high? So what if some people eat one meal a day?   Other people not being the textbook picture of health doesn't make you any less ill. ",False,False

These habits aren’t necessarily a result of the same mentality as eating disorders but they’re unhealthy regardless and should be addressed. ",False,True

Plus there’s a lot of secrets that go along with it.   I felt the same way as OP in college. Especially after I spent the entire second semester of my senior year of high school hospitalized for AN. “Am I making it up? They told me I was sick.... but everyone else seems messed up too?”   How I spent my college years was not normal- as I found out later. The absolute agony of an ED followed me everywhere I went and never let up. In my experience- my friends who I felt were so disordered quickly gave up their behaviors in certain situations or when it risked their health. ,False,False

It is a big global issue, the ""diet culture"" the excessive amount of stress in college and being short on money to eat properly is making us have absolute shit diet and relationship with food.

On the other side companies are pushing shit products high on calories, pack with sugar and fat and no nutrition for cheap, being as addictive as science has shown them to be, people struggle.

My response is still valid; people in this sub equate the two quite frequently.   You don't know these people's reasoning behind their eating habits. It's university; unfortunately it's really common to be so busy or stressed out you legitimately don't have time to eat normally. Some people also just dislike the food available to them if they're dependent on a campus meal plan. When not in the school environment the majority probably eat just fine.   Sometimes I feel like we try to spot disordered habits in others so we don't feel alone with ours.   This is just my opinion and I could easily be wrong. ,False,False
