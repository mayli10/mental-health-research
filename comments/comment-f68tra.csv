Just eat. Just get treatment. Just be positive and don't be sad. As if a switch can be turned in a second. If only it were that easy. So much corruption and more than just basic ignorance, as the internet is at our fingertips to research and understand some of our issues for the people who supposedly ""care"" for us.  In the end, it makes it way worse and more alone. Or even giving into it further so that they may take us more seriously when the consequences are plain to see. üòî",False,False
