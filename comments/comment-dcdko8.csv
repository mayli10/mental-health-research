I found this out upon googling for a few hours for some around town. Almost every “nutritionist” is a brotein gym rat selling Herbalife and other vitamins/shakes. There’s only 4 certified dietitians in my town and the only one that specializes in ED behavior is on leave until January. She gave me a number of 2 other 5+ hours away and said i could work with one until I switch to her in January.   Hope it works out until January with one of them.

I know it's a tough position to be in.   I'm sorry he said that. I know it comes across as a very hurtful thing. He quite possibly is genuinely looking at it from a practical standpoint, seeing how your ED is expressing itself and how quickly that can kill you.   I'm not sure regarding who would be the best to help you with that, I'm not 100% sure tbh. I think the other reply was good, that you'd look for a therapist to help with disordered patterns and a nutritionist to help guide you to a healthy diet.   As for weight loss.. you'll lose just fine with a normal diet. It won't be a pound a day, but truthfully, it's probably not a pound a day now; purging drops weight super fast but it's water and food weight as well as fat. I spent eight years of my life trying to lose as fast as possible, and what a waste that was. Now that I made myself reevaluate things for the sake of my relationship, I'm losing 2-3lbs a week and that's fine - I'm deliberately not pushing myself, because everything else in my life, the important stuff, suffers when my priority is losing weight asap is my priority - and I wind up just gaining and losing and gaining and losing until all I've lost is time and love I'll never get back. I'll get to where I want to be. But why the hell would I destroy so much in the process when I don't have to?   You don't have to have an active ED to lose weight, but having an active ED makes it hard not to lose a lot of important stuff.",False,False

I know that's not what you wanna hear, but the way he talks to and about you is *really* fucked up. Sure you chose this life, but you can make a new decision to leave it. I'm not sure someone preparing for your DEATH is a very good recovery ally.          You don't have to get a tubal if you don't want one. There are other options. Abortion, IUD, adoption...you could even use a copper IUD and use hormonal birth control as well. I did that for a bit but hormones make me crazy so I had to stop lol.            And....if your partner wants kids...they're gonna resent you for not having them. It happens constantly on /r/childfree. Maybe it'll be when you're 35, or 40, or 70. But it'll happen.            I know I know I know you said you don't want this advice. But neither did I when I was in a toxic relationship. I thought I'd never find someone better. Well guess what? My fiance is wonderful. He's childfree too, he uplifts me while I struggle with an ED, he helps me with my therapy ""homework"", he WANTS a vasectomy, he takes care of me when my chronic pain is bad, he drives me to the hospital at 3AM when I'm not doing good, he makes me laugh so hard it hurts, he helped me be comfortable with sex again by being EXTREMELY patient when I told him about my trauma, he started seeing his own therapist when I told him some of the things he does are harmful/unhealthy....my ex wouldn't do any of that. And I didn't want anyone to tell me to break up with him.             You're incompatible. He's not a good supporter for your mental illness, and you both want an EXTREMELY different lifestyle (kids vs no kids).             All this doesn't even mean he's a shitty person. He's just not your person. Y'know? I disagree with the stuff he's doing, but I'm sure he's not a monster. He's just different from the partner you need and deserve. You're different from the partner *he* needs and deserves.           Again, I know you didn't want this. And I'm sorry for not listening to you. But...I don't have any input on seeing a nutritionist. I do have input on being in a toxic relationship for a lonnnnnng time. You're married. It seems impossible to start over. Well it's not. My fiance's dad divorced his wife after 30 years. I cannot believe how happy he is now. Its night and day.",False,False

Thank you for it all. Yeah, he said he wants kids when I die or if we divorced so he doesn’t want it. I’m scared to death of the surgery so I won’t get it, so for fear of getting knocked up, we just stopped being intimate. I’m on the birth control patch but that doesn’t ease my mind any. My counselor told me basically what he did, that I need to get the surgery. But they don’t care to see it through my eyes.  Would a nutritionist know how to handle B/Ping? I’m just worried who (professionally) I should contact for help with this. I don’t want them to push work out vitamins on me and try to get me buff and muscular. I don’t want muscles, I just want to be thin without being sickly thin so my husband will love me and consider things for our future and also so I’ll have some self esteem.   I think he just wants to see me lose weight in a healthy way. Which I have no choice but to do even though I’ll lose weight probably 5x slower than I have been. Which will make my ED brain freak out when I lose not as much as 1 pound a day like I have been averaging. This whole situation is stressing me out :(  Tldr; is a nutritionist my best option to help me deal with my ED and eat healthier and also lose weight?",False,True

I've dealt with similar.  I agree you should get some help with stabilizing things. Your description of your habits is obviously super unhealthy, which you know. And while you seem to associate your husband's fears for your health with your weight, it isn't weight related, what'll kill you. It's the way you're basically beating the shit out of your insides constantly and never healing anything, just using stimulants to keep pushing and pushing until you break.   The dissatisfaction with your body, I get where you're coming from - it isn't that you think you're obese or have an unrealistic view of yourself; you're just not thrilled with your current appearance. Most women aren't and, without meaning to seem rude, you have the awareness that you're not where you want to be weight-wise and it's not an unreasonable feeling, as it would be if you were super underweight.   Has he actually said things about wanting to have kids after you die or something? If so that's very fucked up and you should definitely address that with your marriage counselor. If it's something you're sort of assuming he feels, though, be very careful with that. I won't lie, I'm so guilty of assuming my guy feels certain ways based on certain indicators, but ultimately it tends not to be the case. That would be a very good thing to discuss. He may truly be so happy to just be with you, but he's afraid to take such a pretty permanent step.   It sounds like he's just terrified to lose you to the illness he's seeing taking over you and doesn't know how to help you. And here's the thing - at the end of the day, he can't. Only you can. I get it, I spent so long hoping my guy would do and say the right things for the relationship and the ED to coexist or whatever, but ultimately, I had to make the choice to really work to stabilize myself, view things differently, handle him differently and vice versa, etc.   But if you feel it's worth working on, which you must, given the intro to your post, seeing a nutritionist or someone who can help you get the B/Ping resolved and get you on a steadier track will make all the difference in the world.",False,False
