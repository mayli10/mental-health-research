This is something you really should start doing, not just in this situation but in all aspects of life—learn to just say no!

I know it may not feel that way, but you're more than capable of setting this boundary and you have every right too! Food is personal.  Next time she inches close to your food, just say "" hey, I know you like the food I make. but I would rather not share it. If you want I can show you how I make it.."" This way, you are telling her no but offering a little olive branch. It may take a few tries, but each time you will feel a sense of victory.   Let us know how it goes.",False,False

Asking to try food once in a while is fine, but some people take it way too far. And then to criticize it afterward makes it even worse.   I still remember specific moments from years ago of friends or roommates asking to eat my food and taking *so* much of it. In middle school I was eating a sandwich for lunch and I made some comment like ""I like this sandwich a lot."" My friend wanted to try it so I let her, and she took an ENORMOUS bite out of it, like 20%, and was like, ""It's just a normal sandwich."" I???? And once in college I made a lot of pasta in my rice cooker so that I could save some of it to eat later. My roommate walked into the kitchen and commented on how good it smelled several times. Then she kept looking at it expectantly. So I begrudgingly offered her some, and started scooping it out into her bowl, and she kept asking for more, more, until she had at least half of it for herself.  It's like they think it's cute or something but it's actually just so impolite? It's *your* food. You paid money, time, and energy to make it. Pressuring you to feel like you have to let her try food every single time is crossing a line. These days the roommates I have and I are pretty respectful of boundaries as far as food goes, but I've still decided that if they happened to ask for food that I knew I wanted to myself, I'd just tell them ""no, sorry. maybe another time."" I hope she can respect your right to keep it to yourself in the future.",False,False
