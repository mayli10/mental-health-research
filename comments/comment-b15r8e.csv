Whatever that means, lol, you don't need other people's comments to be that. Though I can see where you're coming from.   To be honest as a short person (5 ft 2) i think people just see my height in addition to my size and call me ""tiny"" or ""small"". Not necessarily skinny. Also, again I think due to the fact I'm shorter, I weigh 108 lbs which is not remotely underweight for my height and wear xs or xxs when I can find it because S is too big on me, like falling of my shoulders too big. My sister is 5 ft and 150 lbs (so overweight) and she usually wears a small! It's all about height and other body proportions as far as clothes go",False,False
