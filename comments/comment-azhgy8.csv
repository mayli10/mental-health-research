My ED started getting bad when I was around your age. I thought that I had to conceal what I was going through and keep it a secret but I was wrong. Unfortunately, I never did ask for help so here I am almost 15 years later dealing with the same disordered garbage. I wish I would have reached out then because it only gets more difficult and more complicated as time passes and at this point I've really backed myself in to a corner.  I'll tell you what I wish I could tell my 15-year-old self back then:  Your health and safety are more important than anyone else's opinion of you. Your deserve to be happy and healthy and recovered -not because of how sick you are or how much you've suffered, but because you are alive. You don't have to wait until your situation is sure. You deserve recovery just as you are right now. ðŸ–¤",False,False

Dealing with an ED is really heckling hard and not something that can always be done alone. Its awesome that you are trying because that's the first step but you can't let it stop there. ,False,False
