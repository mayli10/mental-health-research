The pain sucks ass, but idk. Maybe i only absorbed calories for half the pizza ðŸ˜¥âœŒ   Sending some love back your way!ðŸ’™",False,True

I finally found the actual size of the pizzas in inches and compared thin crust pizza calories between a few different chains and came up with a guesstimate. Super annoying how it's not all that exact, though",False,True

I ate the whole pizza  And my calorie count is probably way fucking off because they don't even list how much a large thin crust pizza is, least of all a medium thin crust. In fact, they don't even list the cal count for a normal medium cheese pizza. Just the large.   Precision is clearly not prioritized by them, so i'm never eating food from them again because this is stressing me out.",False,True

But if you must count try using the large as a guide and then break the medium down into its parts. Pepperoni? How much? Etc. You should be able to come close. ,False,False
