Idk it was all disjointed and confusing ,False,False

There was a strong fear of ""impurity"" and I wanted to be ""clean"" on the inside.   This led to my eating disorder/AN because then i became attached to the weight loss, but it wasn't originally about weight because I used to consider myself slender (at 125lbs and 5'3"" ðŸ™„ I was in high school though)",False,False

At this point, it's neither included in the DSM nor in the ICD.   Assuming it is an actual, separate thing from other disorders that has yet to be formally recognized: No, it doesn't sound like orthorexia, but like an extension of your other disordered behaviors. Your primary concern is obviously cutting the calories, and not being overly concerned about the *quality* of the calories you ingest. The only calories that are worth it for you are extremely low caloric values combined with high volume.  Orthorexia, as it has been proposed, differs from other restrictive eating disorders mainly through the focus on the perceived health benefits of a food, not the calories.   Vegetables are low calorie foods and generally considered to be healthy, so overlap between orthorexia and anorexia is to be expected. ",False,False

Whether it is disordered or not, eating less meat is actually one of the best things you can do to reduce global warming. I think people making vegetarianism/veganism about the moral question of killing something for food is a terrible strategy that gives both diets a bad name. When you eat iceberg lettuce, you've essentially killed that plant. How is that morally worse than killing an animal? Because it doesn't have a central nervous system? How specifically sized a heart do you have to have empathy for one kingdom of life while engorging on the others? Sorry I've completely gone off the rails again haven't I...",False,False

This sounds like AN to me, since you don't seem driven by health. The label, in my opinion, should just be a tool, anyway. What do you identify with? That's what's going to help you.",False,False
