Every time I wore that jacket for the next year I'd crush and play with them inside the packet and remind myself not to eat. Then I'd go an binge and entire jar of peanut butter some nights. Like wtf. Won't eat 28cal crackers at work and act normal. Will take 100 bites that are 100 cal though!,False,False
