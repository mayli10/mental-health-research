It got rid of the scraggly ends, and eliminating some of that extra deadweight made it possible to keep my hair kind of fluffed up so that it didn't just lie limply against my scalp. Before I had it cut, I could see through the curtain of hair that would normally hang between my chin and my shoulder, if that visual makes sense? It was just really sparse and stringy, but less obviously so once I cut it to a shorter length.  Relatedly, I was really shocked by how flattering a short haircut actually was with my facial structure. I had always thought I was ""too fat"" / not gamine enough to pull it off, or that it would look too boyish or ""masculine"", but I decided to say fuck it to those fears and it actually turned out to be unexpectedly great. I'd say go for it, especially if you have a moment where you want to feel like you're turning over a new leaf.",False,True

Combined with the stress of uni, my hair falls out like crazy and I have noticeable bald/thin spots essentially everywhere. My hairline has also somehow receded and my temples have been left with this kind of thin coating of hair.   You can see so much of my scalp when my hair is wet and its come to the point where even putting my hair up in a ponytail doesnt hide the hair loss. rip, It sucks.  Did you find that going short helped it look thicker at all? I have been seriously considering it. ",False,False

I'm just glad I've always had really thick hair because at this point I would it would be obvious by looking at me if I didn't. My hair is just average now :(",False,False

I used to not be able to see my scalp but now... if I lift my hair up a bit and it’s wet I want to cry. Since it’s curly though, it looks just less voluminous dry. But of course I still know.
