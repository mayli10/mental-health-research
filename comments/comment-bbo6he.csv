Remember that curvy bodies are like super in rn esp for dudes   I remember when I was around 140 like 4 years ago due to a medication some dudes stopped to comment on my body and were tryin to get w me and I was ofc grossed out and felt unsafe but also was like wtf I‚Äôm a beached bloated whale   Either way it doesn‚Äôt matter how they meant it bc that never should‚Äôve happened in the first place!

I'm so sorry this happened to you.   When I was seventeen I was walking the dog with my dad and this guy yelled: ""That's what I need, a fat woman!"" and his friends burst out laughing. I was *with my dad*. I had my earbuds in and pretended to not notice. I saw my dad look at me, but he must've thought I didn't hear so of course he wasn't going to tell me it happened/react to it. It was humiliating.",False,False

This isn't a pathetic post either, it's heart wrenching when something like that happens, you really can't expect that a stranger would say that to you, and why would/should any one expect it? Even if you were 600lbs you don't deserve to have someone point and judge you to your face like that.

To give you an idea of how much of a loser this guy is, the only time I had to deal with something similar was literally in middle school - my classmate said ""wow you're fat"" so I said, ""yeah, and you're ugly."" In your situation (where everyone is an adult), I think a direct ""fuck off"" is appropriate, or ""Wow. Rude."" if you want to be more polite. But it also sounds like what you did (not engaging and walking away) was also good, since obviously he said that to try to get a rise out of you, and you didn't give it to him.  Unfortunately there's not much you could have done to make the situation 'right,' so you just have to realize that the other person is an immature asshole, and what they said had nothing to do with you.  &amp;#x200B;  Sorry it effected you so much &lt;3",False,False

If it helps, look at why he was smiling. He has no illusion about how much this didn't help you at all, and didn't make you feel good about yourself.  Nothing is as ugly as being an asshole who gets off on putting other people down.  There's also a certain breed of 20-something douchebag nowadays that gets a special kick out of trying to jab at the self-esteem of ""women who think they're better than me"". They seem to define this as any moderately attractive woman who doesn't pay them attention they expected.  Nobody with your stats is obese. He's just an asshole. If anything, pity him.  For the future record, nothing pisses people like those off more than cheerfully replying ""thanks!"" and breezing on by, unaffected.",False,False

He's just part of a fucked up system that has told him HE isn't worthwhile unless he puts other people down. 2. Very narrow perspective of beauty.  3. Very messed up idea that if he shames you, you'll fall into line and ""become attractive"" to him so he can feel better about himself.  You are beautiful AS YOU ARE.
