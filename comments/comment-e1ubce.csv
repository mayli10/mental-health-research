Dump him! you deserve someone that adores you as you are and makes you feel gorge every day. He has a very unhealthy perception of female beauty and that would make any one sick.  And kudos to you for deciding to do the hard but best thing for you.,False,False

Even more since your sick. But dont talk about you this way, I'm sure you're fine the way you are and being skinnier or smaller won't change how you are.

He sounds like such an ass and you deserve someone SO MUCH better. I guarantee you that there are plenty of people out there than will love you just the way you are and that will treat you like a goddess. If my boyfriend said that I was average or made it obvious that he likes girls with a different body type than me - that I cannot achieve without ruining my mental health or can't achieve at all - then I'll dump him because as much as I hate myself, I know that I deserve better. I'm so proud of you for realising these things ‚ù§Ô∏è I was so afraid that at the end of the post, you'd write that you still love him and cannot imagine dumping him, so I was so pleased when I read the ending.
