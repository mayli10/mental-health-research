My “storm cloud” usually always starts with a feeling of depression and loneliness and I start fantasizing about hitting up the red box or bingeing a comfort show on Netflix and how great it would be to pair that with a shit ton of fast food and sweets.,False,False

I used to be able to binge under my TDEE but lately I’ve been having the 6000 calorie food fests and it’s so distressing. :[  Can I just pay you to follow me around and repeat these things every time I walk past a packet of Oreo cookies though?,False,False

One of the themes they talked about was procrastination can crop up and become problematic when the person doesn’t have a good sense of their future self, which really hit home for me.   Your first bullet point reminded me of exactly that as well.",False,False

I'm impressed and I can def try these. Thank you so much, legit. I'm in a weird break in my binge cycle and I know that if I implement these now, I can break free. Mostly just typing this out for myself tbh. I know that if I write it in definite terms that I will follow through",False,False

It's because I already have tasted all those flavours and want more. After eating dinner I'm already almost full, so why not just shove some sweets down there too and just purge all of it out so you would gain even less calories than if you had just eaten your normal meal and not have binged at all.",False,False

These days I’m able to prevent myself from acting on impulse by waiting through the insufferable time where you want to binge and feel the wave of thoughts come over you and then gradually pass. I don’t try and suppress or kill the thoughts, I observe them and recognise that I know they won’t last forever and I can get through it. It sounds easier said than done but when I was at rock bottom with bulimia this was the only thing that helped me get out.  It’s like when you are really angry and have to hold yourself back from saying something you’ll regret even if the desire to react in anger is so so so extreme - it can be done and this sort of thing gets better the more you practice it. Embrace the temporary uncomfortableness and in the long term things can get better.",False,False

It’s as if someone flicks a switch in my head and all I can think of is the flavor and texture of food.   One thing though, i think I’ve identified a “storm cloud” on the horizon when the binge monster is coming.   I start fantasizing about food, I start thinking about what food we have in the pantry and fridge, then I start thinking about what it will feel like to eat it, and eventually those thoughts are overwhelming and my only goal is to get away from what I’m doing and go binge like in my fantasy.   Now I can usually see this storm coming, and I’ve been pretty successful in identifying “storm thoughts” for what they are, and redirecting them to something else.   It’s like at the grocer, sometimes my brain will think “we need some chips or snacks for the kiddos”, then I catch myself “no, YOU want them”. My brain replies “oh no no I don’t eat that, just keep it in the house in case the kiddos want some”. “No, brainbro, don’t try it. You know quite well the kiddos don’t even like those. This is a binge setup!”  Ah fun internal dialogs.",False,False

As someone who suffers from binge episodes, I think I’ll print these out and keep them in the kitchen so I have to look when I have the urge to binge.   Those 6-8k binges are no joke. Knowing that you overcame that... it makes me feel like I can overcome my own disordered eating. Sometimes I read about people having a 500-1000 calorie binge and I would always use that to make myself feel worse, because some part of me wished I could stop at just that. I can (and have) easily down 4-6k in under an hour. I felt alone in the fight, never seeing anyone binge to the extent that I did. Your post gives me hope that it won’t be this way always. ❤️",False,False

I don't suffer from binging but the mindfulness you've outlined here could also apply to feelings of wanting to restrict (ie how much weight would I *really* gain if I have something small instead of fasting, thinking about *why* I'm restricting, the party anxiety tips). Congratulations on overcoming your binges!!",False,False
