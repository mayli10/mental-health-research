Iâ€™m 20y female started vyvanse likeeee 6 months ago, not prescribed. The first time I tried it I took a 40mg in the morning and a coworker egged me on to taking another 40mg around 3pm, it felt like i was rolling, didnâ€™t sleep or eat that day. Iâ€™ve tried adderall, Ritalin and concerta nothing is quite like vyvanse. It really is the best appetite suppressant. I recommend it for those who struggle with both adhd and BED. Only thing I canâ€™t stand is it really fucks up my sleep schedule and very weirdly ever since I started only my right arm sweats a lot, no quite sure what to do about that ðŸ¤£",False,False
