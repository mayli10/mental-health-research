It sucks major balls too, I’ll exercise until my whole body is sore and then do it all again the next day.   There’s no logic to why I do it either; gained water weight from an intense workout yesterday?? Guess I’d better do another just to make sure it wasn’t the two bites of a cookie I ate. I can make jokes about my disorder a lot but this part of it is kinda distressing.   I feel you on being excited when you burn more than you’ve eaten though, that feeling never gets old lol.",False,False
