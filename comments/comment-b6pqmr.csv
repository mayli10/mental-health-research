I have not had an ED for years, but when i did...HUGE laxative/bulimia.  Food coming up hours later is not new for me, nor has that changed in the last 15 years.  However, I have lost about 8 pounds in 2 weeks, and if i drink water through the day, i get extremely nauseous, and have had to throw up, but the water thing is what scares me.  That and the weight loss...   anything you can relate to?",False,False

I have not had an ED for over 10 years, but did abuse laxatives in HUGE excess, and then had a little spout of Bad drinking problem... I had IBS-constipation side- and now fear that it is this.    Do you have weight loss as things got worse if I might ask?    I am assuming it is this or something like it as I can get something like corn, and wake up 6 hours later in the night and throw up.  One other question is, did you get sick after drinking water throughout the day?  Even a sip and I am extremely nausea.  It lasts for good few-5 minutes, and happens all throughout the day.  I can;t find anything with that specifically listed.   Glad I am not alone.  It is hard to talk about this one...",False,False

For a while I was trying to fix my bloating and slow digestion by slamming hundreds of grams of fiber in the form of psyllium husks, fiber one/bran cereals, salads, etc. This only made things worse and reducing fiber was the solution. This is the way it was explained to me and I will pass on the knowledge in ELI5 form:  &amp;#x200B;  The digestive tract at the end of an eating disorder is not able to move nearly the volume of food it would normally be able to because of atrophe of the muscles that actually move the food through your digestive tract. If you think of your GI tract as a highway, you've gone from having a 5 lane highway to a 2 lane highway. What fiber does is put more cars on the road. This does not solve the problem, it makes it worse. Now you have the same number of lanes, but more cars to deal with. Your large intestine is like a stoplight that waits for enough cars to build up before turning green. When you have gastroparesis, the light's green all the time, but the problem is that there's a massive traffic jam and hardly anyone is moving, so nobody's going through the light. Now for normal people who have a 5-lane highway but choose to eat a lot of junk food that's almost 100% digestible with barely any fiber, they'll have infrequent bowel movements without supplementing with fiber because there just aren't enough cars on the road to build up to the point where a stool needs to be passed.",False,False

What worked for me was continuing to eat and take miralax in the morning and exlax at night (recommendation from my doctor). Exlax will make you cramp badly so that’s why I took it at night. Very horrible time in my life to see all the food go in and not go out. Just knowing you’re walking around with everything you’ve eaten for days. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. I’m so much better now tho thankfully ",False,False

I do understand how awful it is to have permanent damage caused by the ED in other respects and it definitely does suck. I'm sorry you have to deal with this but I'm glad you're working for recovery regardless. I'm also sorry if my comment came across as dismissive of your reality. I just wanted to share my own perspective but I do fully understand that it doesn't always work out the same way for others. ,False,False

Nothing is more frustrating to me than having confirmed GP. Usually I eat whatever I want and deal with the consequences, but it gets so bad sometimes that I can’t. It reminds me of restricting but I don’t want to be doing it! I think I got a little hurt by your initial comment because I am one of the people for whom GP is a chronic illness, even after all my work in ED recovery. It sucks. I wish you all the best and appreciate your explanation. ",False,False

I asked her if she feels bloated after eating because I thought I remembered her mentioning that and when she responded she said it feels like the food she eats just sits in her stomach instead of being digested. That sounds super typical of gastroparesis according to what I read on WebMD. Would you say that's accurate?,False,False

I do know people that have it permanently from their EDs, but it isn't common. My comment was just to point out that the large majority of people will fully recover from it with normal eating. I don't want to dismiss anyone who has not recovered from the GP with recovery or lead anyone down the wrong treatment path, only a treatment team can help navigate the appropriate way to move forward. But I know for me, the diagnosis hindered recovery because I believed I had to further restrict and alter my diet to digest foods. ",False,False

I’m so glad you’ve recovered from an ED and from GP. However, myself and several other friends who recovered from EDs and developed GP still have it. It’s definitely not always reversible. If you are recovered from your ED and still struggle with GP, modifying your diet is exactly what you need to do sometimes. I go through flares where I revert back to ensures. I don’t like it, but it’s what I need to do. I just don’t want people with active EDs out there to think they can recover away their GP if they develop it. It can be a lifelong condition.

I’ve been minimal behaviors for a couple years now, and I still have GP. Not as bad as I did, but my flare ups can be incredibly painful.

I had severe gastroparesi s for years because of my ED. When I went into treatment I was extremely uncomfortable but I followed the typical meal plan for recovery with no adjustments for the gastroparesis. I did not follow a liquid plan or eat low fat or easily digestible foods. It took a long time but eventually my body got used to regular meals and snacks and the gastroparesis resolved in its own, no medication either bc I'm allergic to it.  Honestly, I followed a gastroparesis diet for a long time before entering treatment and it kept me from recovering. I developed a million fear foods and was terrified to eat because of this diet and what I assumed was the right treatment plan.   Treatment for gastroparesis caused by eating disorders is eating normally and regularly, not adjusting your diet. There are a few medications that can help with some of the discomfort until it resolves itself.   My case was very very severe. I would throw up undigested foods days after eating it. It got better once I recovered. ",False,False
