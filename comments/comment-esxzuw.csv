I kept going from picture to mirror and I still dunt understand how I can't see what everyone else is.  Maybe we just get that wrapped up in our self hate.

I hung out with my high school sweetheart a few weeks ago and was really embarrassed about how fat I thought I was. I tried my hardest not to talk about it, but he saw right through me. He pulled up a photo of me at 19, what I thought was the ""golden age"" for my body. Concerned, he says, ""I don't know what you're seeing. Because you look the same. You might have a little looser belly skin, but you're shaped the same.""  That photo blew me away. I legitimately didn't realize how warped my perception of my body was, always certain that I really was as ugly as I saw myself as.",False,False
