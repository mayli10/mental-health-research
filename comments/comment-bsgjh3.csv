We don’t have holland and barrett here. You can always try a cheaper product, and if it doesn’t work well enough, you could splurge? I wish I could suggest a cheaper product, but that’s the one I use religiously because it works so well. If only things that actually help were covered by health insurance, huh?",False,False

I'm not sure if enzymedica is primarily an American product, but I'm looking at then on Amazon right now and they look quite expensive. Do you have a Holland and Barrett where you live? I was thinking I could get something from there as it's quite a health shop. They don't seem to have enzymedica though :(",False,True

This is the only brand that has worked for me. Amazon sells it for the best price, but whole foods also has it (do you have whole foods in the UK?).",False,False
