Each time you try to best the other. You hide in closets and jump out. He dresses as a clown and jumps out etc.   It’s hard when you lose it, like someone tells you Santa’s not real. I have tried a lot of things to feel the high again.   But nothing. Working as an engineer doesn’t help. When I was BP and restricting I use to do funny stuff around the office, pranks and stuff.   I think part of it was the fact it was hidden it was secret. You maintain the lie for another day, week or year. Like an affair your hiding from your friends or family.  I took in my neighbor's cat. That helped &lt;\^-\^&gt;. I just call him Cat and together we just don’t care. Lying on the couch together.   Hope my sharing helped.",False,False
