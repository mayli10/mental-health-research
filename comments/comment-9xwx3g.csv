Maybe I'm just giving you advice I could give myself XD  It's hard to not always measure myself against standards I'm not meeting and I certainly struggle with how to gain support from those who care for me while also keeping them safe from being overwhelmed/emotionally affected by my insecurity issues.  ,False,False

I didn't ask him about my arms I didn't even mention them yesterday. But I know he doesn't think it's bad. He finds me attractive and would probably prefer if I gained weight. But my ED was never about him. I've always been really self conscious about my arms but because of my body dysmorphia I have no idea what I look like. So I was just kinda hoping it's not as bad as I think and now I'm super triggered. But I'm not blaming him in any way. He is usually really sweet and I know he meant nothing negative by it.,False,True

I would suggest maybe not asking him about how skinny/big he thinks certain body parts are. I know it's hard, but it kind of traps someone in a place where they need to choose the ""right words""... I mean if he called them skinny before he was either lying, or last night he was responding in a more truthful way (btw finding someones arms big is not necessary an insult, as of course many people are attracted to bigness/big body parts). Because you were drunk, I am curious if he just felt flustered.   It is hard to tell much about him or your relationship based on your description of the hurtful comment but I hope this comment is helpful.",False,False

This one time someone sarcastically called me skinny after I showed them a pic or something of me that I did DEFINITELY not look skinny in :((  I hope you feel better soon. It will be alright &lt;3,False,False

Logically I know it’s because they’re a different brand than I’ve ever worn and weird AF but my husband joked “are you sure it’s the pants that got smaller? ;)” he was joking, he was NOT expecting me to cry, he felt terrible.. fucking clueless. Now I’m fasting today..   Feel better, dear ♥️♥️ it’ll be okay",False,False
