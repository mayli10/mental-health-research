I used to watch her like 5-6 years ago when I was young and impressionable. She used to make “my diet and exercise routine!1!1!1!” videos and pretended she was super thin due to healthy eating and light exercise. This was before she went public with her ED. I don’t have a problem with her keeping her ED private from YouTube. That’s completely understandable. She’s not obligated to share her personal struggles on YouTube. I just think it’s gross and dishonest to make videos specifically to pretend your underweight frame is healthy when most of your audience is young girls.,False,False

Like she’s telling herself it’s easy in order to help make it easy kinda thing. It’s similar to those on a certain subreddit when they say they’re “so stuffed”, but I can see how it’d be tough for us to watch",False,False
