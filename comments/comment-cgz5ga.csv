Jam a knife into it really hard a few times, microwave on high for 12 minutes,  then on 20 percent power for another 12 minutes. Leave it for 30 minutes to cool. Cut in half lengthwise.  Scoop out mountains of what looks like spaghetti.     It has a different taste and texture, but chopped tomatoes and a tiny bit of sausage and you can't tell too much of a difference.  A whole plate will run you 100 calories.",False,False
