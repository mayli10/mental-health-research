When I think about it it makes me so jealous (she is very petite), and we are about the same height as well. I think i compare her whole life to mine and this just feels like another aspect where she’s better than me. I really try not to dwell on it and I value our relationship too much to let this derail it, but yeah sometimes it really gets to me.   My other therapist is very normal and I’ve hardly ever thought about her body. I think since we are so different - she is far taller than me, it is difficult to compare and get upset",False,False

And that was before anyone knew about my eating and stuff. I remember thinking ""I'm fatter than her, I just know it."" And then one day she called me ""skinny"". And I thought to myself ""Wait, she thinks I'M skinny!?!?!??"" I almost told her about how I see myself and stuff but I didn't. Eventually she moved. Now, the psychologist I have now knows about my eating/body stuff. I find myself thinking ""How much does she weigh? Do I weigh more than her? How much does she think I weigh? Maybe she's heavier than me. But maybe she's not. But that shouldn't matter makeitfancee!!!"" It's a gross cycle in my head.",False,False

Anyone super tiny and I would be triggered af and probably try to be smaller each time. Anyone big and I wouldn’t be able to trust their assessment of normal/healthy weight.   That totally sucks because I KNOW there are likely great therapists for this out there who are pretty big or small but I think at least early in therapy, you should be able to work on stuff without being triggered. Ultimately the goal is likely to be to be able to handle triggering things like this but that isn’t the first thing to work on.",False,False
