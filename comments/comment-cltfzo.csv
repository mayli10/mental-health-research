I found out I have was obese last year on June then my mum got me a gym membership. It was pretty healthy in a way and I didn't restrict my diet much.  A month later I got my wisdom teeth removed and couldnr eat for days. Somebody told me I got thinner that week. And that's the story on how I started restricting and got conscious about calories! Crazy what triggers you.,False,False

Exactly one year ago I started ""a diet"" that quickly developed in a full blown ED and today, one year later, it ruined my life. This disorder is making me insane. I am losing my mind. I can't live like this. Every day is pure hell. I would not wish this upon my worst enemy. I thought I had the control but my ED has control over me. I just want to be normal. I really do.",False,False
