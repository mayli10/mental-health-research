I'm maybe a lb or so shy (and a ton of ab workouts) away from having a six pack. I've always wanted to look like this. Soft but lean and strong. But it doesn't fit. It doesn't feel like my body anymore. I think I hate it. The picture in my mind looks different than the thing I see in the mirror and it scares me how different I look from even a month ago. That's not me, and if it is me, then why isn't it enough? Why do I need to do more, lose more, be tinier. I've wanted to be this lean for so long. But now I want to be as thin as I can be.  I'm high, sorry.",False,False
