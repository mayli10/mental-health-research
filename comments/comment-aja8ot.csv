I struggled with the same thoughts you're having for years. I thought if I stopped compensating I would just binge all the time. I was convinced that the binges were purely emotion based and eating properly wouldn't fix it. That's not how it happened. I'm not going to lie and say that it's easy once the restriction stops... I still got urges to binge BUT I could manage them and they didn't come up often. I don't even remember the last time I binged now. ",False,False

My anxiety has been increasing all week and this afternoon all I want to do is stuff my face until I feel better, filling the emptiness like you’ve said. The only thing that has stopped me is I know I will feel fat and hate myself afterwards and also this is the longest I’ve gone without binging.  I’ve found exercise is really helpful. Even when I reaaaally don’t feel like it I always feel better afterwards and usually don’t feel like binging but I’ve had knee pain all week so can’t run today :(",False,False

Literally *nothing* is as soothing to me as shoving my face with a bunch of whatever I'm craving right then. I've been on a good restriction streak for a few weeks now but I still feel like I'll eventually break and binge out of control, just because my brain can't handle the idea of eating in moderation like a normal person ",False,False
