I also feel like they're doing this all really inefficiently since they return a massive amount of data every time you reload the app which puts an excesive amount of strain on all parts of their infrastructure. Like seriously, anytime you open the app you get sent every single one of your friends most recent (25?) posts. If you have 500 friends (limit that it'll return) that ends up being upwards of 9MB of JSON data.   If they were a little bit more reasonable they'd absolutely save a lot on the outbound traffic costs as well as their CPU usage ",False,False

My only concerns are non-technical issues (DMCA? Bullying? child porn??) and Iâ€™m not ready at all to handle those things. ,False,False
