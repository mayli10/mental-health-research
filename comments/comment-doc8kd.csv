Ive definitely felt exactly the way you feel rn. My ex had problems gaining weight and would straight up forget to eat, and even though he never made comments about my weight or made me feel bad, i couldnt help comparing our bodies aaaalll the time.   And just bc you feel like he enjoys sex with you when youre a lower weight, that could definitely just be your ED making you feel that way. Im sure you look fine ðŸ’• just try to do whats best for you (not seeing people that trigger you, etc)",False,False
