Even someone with bulging abs gets a little bit of a roll when they sit.   &amp;#x200B;  Exercise will reduce them if it helps you to lean out and/or gain weight and then lean out. But bear in mind that it is likely they look bigger to you than they actually are. ",False,False

In any case, I would think that any exercise that strengthens your core would help. And remember that everyone has stomach rolls, even people competing in the olympics :-)",False,False

Did you lose a significant amount if weight quickly? I don’t know if this is helpful but maybe try to improve your posture. I notice that when I’m slouching my stomach rolls are a lot more visible. Good luck! ,False,False

But once I started doing a ton of ab / Pilates / yoga stuff, people REALLY started commenting on me being skinnier and I wasn’t even too far from the weight I started from, maybe 3 lbs under. I also had a butter croissant and ice cream daily so it wasn’t really a protein shake and broccoli type of lifestyle. So definitely start to do some form of abdominal type exercise and of course stick with a deficit of calories obviously. ",False,False
