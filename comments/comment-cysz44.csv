What you set as a goal weight will never be good enough. BMI 18? Not good enough. Ok let’s try 17. Nope too fat. Let’s go to 15.5. Ugh fatass.   At BMI 12 I was too fat. I wanted to carve it all off. I needed to get it all of me. Fat everywhere. Needed to lose more weight.   It’s bullshit. This- this fucking disease- is all bullshit. Please. Please talk to someone. I’m so glad I finally did.,False,False

Obviously made the border my GW and still wasn’t happy when I got there.  I’m fighting to maintain here, even though I’m not happy yet. Eating high protein and hoping my body will recomp. Because... I know from experience that continuing to lose weight until I’m ‘happy’ is a losing battle.  Being almost underweight is enough. More than enough. That feeling is definitely your ED talking.  I know this is tagged shitpost but I hope you fight the ED voice. Feel free to message me if you ever want support maintaining.",False,False
