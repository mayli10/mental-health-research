Quite a few people pride themselves or brag about how much they could eat.  I dont think they had any negative intentions, but you arent wrong to feel offended.  I mean yesterday at school I mentioned once that I was hungry, and later brought up ""lunch time"" and my friend told me ""stop thinking about food so much you fat ass"", and that could be rude and insensitive coming from  a friend who knew about my ed, but I wasnt hurt when it came from her.  I laughed, and we joke around like that with each other.",False,False

We all know if we are eating or not eating. Petty comments do zero good to zero people.",False,False
