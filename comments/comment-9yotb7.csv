We are sort of off the radar but we need to be cognizant about optics to not get banned. A normal person looking at it would see that as encouraging EDs, not supporting someone who has an issue.  We would probably need to change the name of that post to start. Do you have any suggestions?",False,False

I don’t feel like that’s bad because we’re at least eating??,False,False

I got so many great ideas. I feel like it should be okay to post recipes. Maybe we just don’t need to include the calorie counts.   If the mods allow us to post what we eat, we could just say what it was rather than how much it was? I’m not sure what they think but hopefully they can give us feedback.   Surely recipes should be fine though right? ",False,False
