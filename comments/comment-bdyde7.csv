My teeth are getting worse with more and more fillings since I was little (mostly my fault but I also believe in having bad genes) but I don't know about grinding my teeth. The last thing I should do is bath my teeth in stomach acid.  Of course stopping puking would be the best, but I know that's super hard so that's what I do:  I try to make myself feel better by using toothpaste and mouth wash with a lot of fluoride, of course don't forget to rinse your mouth with baking soda or antacids (the ones you can chew, try not to swallow them, just chew and swirl it around In your mouth, then spit it out) and the obligatory break between purge and brushing your teeth.   I recommend telling your dentist so he maybe can give you some advice on harm reduction and just knows. Trust me, he probably has seen worse and he has to keep his mouth shut (not sure about it if you're underage)  I hope this helps. Otherwise there should be a post about this topic somewhere and also I found this vid of a recovered girl once where she gave some advice.  Lots of love ðŸ’œ",False,False

I don't actually grind my teeth, so that's good. But my jaw is really clicky when I try to open wide. I actually just got a wisdom tooth pulled today, and the extraction didn't hurt a bit, but trying to open my jaw/shift it aside so the dentist could get to it was painful as shit.",False,False
