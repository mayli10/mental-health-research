It's how the messages stack up and come together and the picture that paints for everyone that is dysfunctional. It creates a dysfunctional and very confused narrative relating to food, weight and health for everyone  Intuitive eating is difficult if you're below your set point, but you can take whatever helps you and implement it into a recovery mindset/attitude. It's normal to have binge urges and crave calorie-dense foods if you're markedly underweight. It's difficult to switch it off. Bingeing is a survival mechanism. You could just take bits and pieces from it, if it helps, whatever resonates  You can also experience numbing and confusion around your hunger signals, difficulty making decisions about what to eat, etc. You might not understand or respond to what your body is telling you and what it wants. I'll restrict less some days and attempt to eat intuitively and other days I'll restrict more and feel less confident and secure in my decisions/choices",False,False
