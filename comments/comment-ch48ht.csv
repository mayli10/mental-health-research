And I can't choose what to wear to the nutricionist. Am so anxious. Doctor treated me like an idiot. Told me crashdieting was stupid and only referred me to nutricionist because she said she was worried because most people become fat after trying a crash diet. And fat is unhealty. For her to be worried about ED I would have to 'lose a lot more' (she said while laughing)     Hope appt today will be better.",False,False

Just watching his usually-flat face contort in a combination of disgust and concern as I described the method I recently used to use to purge kind of brought me to the reality of my extremism. I always doubted my ED just because my usual mode is just bingeing every several days with an otherwise healthy diet, but I really don‚Äôt know if someone without an ED could ever do what I did..  I‚Äôm sure if I was told 10 years ago that people did this to themselves, I would be completely flabbergasted and at a loss for words..  I‚Äôm really not sure if this is a sign of weakness or a sign of strength, given that I was able to control my body so well that I made it do something that really shouldn‚Äôt be done.  It would have been so much easier had I just had the ability to purge hands-free smh.",False,False
