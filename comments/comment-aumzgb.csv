""just don't anymore.""   And I always thought the idea of ""pushing away your base animal thoughts"" was like dissociation.   Lmao good stuff honestly. That's sort of what you can boil depression recovery down to too. ""just retrain your brain"" ",False,False

Basically the bottom line is that EDs are not all alike. Even specific conditions like AN-r aren't the experienced the same way for everyone. So this advice is gonna be pretty tone deaf so some sufferers but I totally get you.  I think the more practical and universal advice for ED sufferers is just to think positively. Which is kind of lame and reductive, but that's what this boils down to I think. Being a part of an ED community can definitely make some people people worse just by making them hyperaware of their disordered eating. I know it's true for me.",False,False

Help with what, though? With weight loss? With recovery? People with eating disorders have a wide variety of goals, not all of them healthy.   I’m in therapy, and my therapist and I were actually just talking about something along these lines at my last appointment. She asserted that I may always use eating and food to feel in control and that my recovery might need to be more centered on harm reduction rather than ✨getting better magically✨. I think it is very helpful to be realistic in my goals, and sometimes that means I’m shooting for something a little bit south of typically accepted health.   But that doesn’t hand-wave away the problem, just because I’m making a little room in my life to coexist with my eating disorder. It would be intellectually dishonest to equate my harm-reduction with true Recovery^TM. ",False,False

What if this community’s big secret was how fun and easy this is?  Except for that a lot of people here, their eating disorder is focused on bingeing. Or is a form of self-harm and is *intended* to hurt.   Sure, sometimes I will have manic days fueled by the power of Bang and Adderall where I feel ascended and thin and perfect. But then I eat dinner with my husband and I want to punish my body for giving in to what I consider failure. Starving myself to cope with my childhood or my feelings of inadequacy as a mother will never be fun OR easy.   The eating disorder isn’t the weight loss, it’s the struggle itself. To deny the mental aspect of the illness is to deny the illness. ",False,False
