This was me more venting about an on going issue. It's gotten to a point where I've stopped initiating because my self-esteem can't handle getting rejected everytime. But he's having his own serious body image stuff in addition to being depressed, so I can get where he's coming from. It just all sucks. ",False,True

First of all I want to say thereâ€™s nothing wrong with wanting your partner to express physical and sexual desire for you- thatâ€™s pretty central to most relationships. I would be upfront with him about how you feel, just try not to frame it as something heâ€™s not doing or doing wrong. Have you tried initiating things with him? I find I have less spontaneous desire when Iâ€™m depressed but if my fiancÃ© shows that he wants me it helps me get in a more sexual and desiring mood. Hope some of this is helpful and feel free to PM me if youâ€™d like to chat more or just vent ðŸ˜Š (also sorry if there are any mistakes English is not my first language). ",False,False

I wish I could give you advice but it would be hypocritical of me. I just wanted to say I hear you and understand where you're coming from. I hope you and your bf find your way through these tough times. You guys seem to love each other a lot. ,False,False
