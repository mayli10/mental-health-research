Skip breakfast. (I have not religiously eaten breakfast since high school.)  Allow myself a tall (sometimes grande) cold brew with almond milk from Starbucks, and if I feel like ‚Äúrewarding myself‚Äù, a cheese danish to go along with it (lowest calorie bakery item there, plus I actually like them).  Don‚Äôt eat lunch, don‚Äôt eat dinner.  Have a cliff bar and a dove chocolate at night.  I‚Äôm insane, I know. It‚Äôs literally not enough to keep me alive, but I actually have no interest in food anymore. I work all the time, plus I‚Äôm in law school. No time (or feelings of hunger) to make myself eat more.",False,False

If I eat a sweet potato I take off the 'meat', mash it a bit, and eat it separately from the skins, eating the skins firsts.  Spices don't count, I heard the calorie amounts for certain spices I use often and was not ok so I ignore it, spices don't count and I can use unlimited amounts.

I cannot CAN! NOT! Be in the red on lose it by the end of the week. If it means fasting for 5 days, then so be it. My calorie average per day *must* be sub 850. Which is fantastic when ya girl is Binge Queen  That being said, if I binge it better be fuckin worth it and I‚Äôm gonna go all out and fuck future me, the calories are that bitchs problem. It‚Äôs basically punishment for being a fuckin shit idiot.   I have to measure myself once a week and weigh myself at *least* once a week in order to update my stats. I also must calculate out my calorie average, estimate what my deficit is in comparison to my TDEE, and approximate what weight I should‚Äôve lost and see if it‚Äôs accurate. If it‚Äôs not, I must go back through my logs and see what foods I underestimated the calorie count on.   When I weigh myself, I‚Äôll do it once naked/empty, and once fully clothed with a fully belly/bladder since that‚Äôs what my ‚Äúreal‚Äù weight would be if someone were to pick me up/weigh me on the fly.   Also I must calibrate the scale (put a 10 pound weight in it and check for accuracy) before I weigh myself and then add 2 pounds to whatever comes up, always.  Cheap bathroom scales are *not* actually accurate, even when tested. I will not trust that.   My goal weight is decided on how heavy I might be with water weight. So if the weight I‚Äôm okay being heaviest at is 115, my goal will be 113/111.   I don‚Äôt like numbers that end in evens because for whatever reason, even numbers are Fat. I honest to god do not know why. But odd numbers are Thin, evens are Fat. So goal weights can‚Äôt end in evens, calorie goals can‚Äôt end in evens, etc. 0 is the exception.   ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I‚Äôm just kind of neurotic",False,False
