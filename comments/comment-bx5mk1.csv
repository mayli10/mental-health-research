There's a lot of ""recovery"" advice going around that very convincingly tells *malnourished* sufferers to eat to their hunger...  I bought into it one time when I was 14 and went from 1 meal a day, purged, to 1200 calories in one sitting. I suddenly developed severe oedema and had to go to hospital because of the shift in my blood phosphate/electrolytes caused my heart to start failing.

Here are my thoughts though.  Sometimes, what’s best for us isn’t what the doctors say. Sometimes it is.
