I was freezing so bad on Tuesday and she offered to switch my sweater for her heavy af Patagonia fleece. I insisted it wouldn’t fit, she made me put it on. It was loose.   I don’t get it. Is it the sisterhood of the traveling Patagonia? Someone needs to explain this bullshit cause I’m like 3 times her size.  Like you know in your head you only weigh 25 more pounds than someone else and have 8 inches on them but the fucking head tricks you so bad. When I see her I think she is skinny and my only thoughts of myself are me with an extra 75lbs+ that don’t exist. Why can’t my reasonable brain be louder than my dysmorphia brain?",False,False
