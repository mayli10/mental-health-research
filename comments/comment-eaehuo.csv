If they look inside me and still don't anything, no cysts, no tears, no inflammation, no nothing, then that just means I have no idea what's wrong with me and I would then have no idea what to do next.",False,False

It would make me rethink if the stuff the nurses saw on the CT scan was really just poop. I guess I am supposed to start laxatives on order of the doctor doing the scope test, but my insurance hasn't approved the prescription yet after over two weeks. ðŸ˜’",False,False

But that makes sense because they didn't ask me to fast for it. I have a scope test on Christmas Eve which is not going to be fun ðŸ™ƒ I don't remember which way they said they'll be going, but the only stuff I'm allowed to consume for a whole day before is that stuff that clears you out and water. I would think they're going in through the throat because my stomach is a concern, but so is my colon so maybe they won't. I would think the scope is long enough to go all the way through no matter which way they go in though.",False,False

I would always avoid the morning hurdle or afternoon hurdle by sleeping lol. I would be doing fine in class one second and the next second I just get so hungry and tired and I feel like crashing and sleeping the entire day, so I just drink lots of water to keep myself awake and crash during lunch or free periods.",False,False
