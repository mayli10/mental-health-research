I know it’s the sensible thing to do, but the fact I’ve never fainted? The fact I don’t restrict dietary fat, or eat like 200 calories a day? The fact I’ll probably never end up in *this* sort of situation? It makes me feel invalid, and it makes me wonder if doing all this (precautionary stuff) is even worth it.   Hell, I’m not even diagnosed. I have the same thoughts about not really being sick, or Sick Enough™, but how can I be, when I’m not even diagnosed, and I go about acting on these urges in relatively logical ways? (Referring to my taking supplements, and not restricting dietary fat.)",False,False

When I was admitted I felt like the least sick person there, I felt like I didn't need to be there, I had energy, I perceived myself as ""normal."" But they weren't lying to me when they told me I would die within the month without treatment, I did so much damage.   It sometimes feels validating that I was really sick back then, but the other half of me can't accept that I was *that* sick. The fact that I'm trying to recover without treatment right now means I snap back into that ""I'm not sick"" headspace, I think seeing my charts would drill it in my head that this needs to stop.",False,False
