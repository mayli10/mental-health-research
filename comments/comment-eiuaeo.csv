I'm not going to tell you to break up with him, although I do think it would be for the best. As harsh as it sounds, often the partners we find shortly after a significant breakup we are less selective about, we just want to feel loved and desirable again and fill that void we feel. The way he is treating you, even if he is an angel the rest of the time, is unacceptable. Have you talked to him about it? Maybe he is unaware of just how hurtful he is being (optimistic perspective), and a long and difficult conversation can help. Honestly your lack of orgasms should concern him (your enjoyment of sex should be his priority), even if your body image doesn't, and could be a way to break into the conversation. Either way, you deserve better than anyone who would make you feel this way. It could be salvaged, maybe, but if you cannot see a drastic and lasting change in him quickly, get out.",False,False
