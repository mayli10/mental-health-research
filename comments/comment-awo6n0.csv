I used to wake up and look forward to eating and now that I restrict most of the time it feels like a huge part of my life is missing. Guess it goes to show how fucked up my relationship with food is!!",False,False

I just want to have dinner, and get it over with.   Restricting on weekends is easier, but it's mind numbing boredom for me. I can't concentrate or do anything but think of the lack of interest. At least when I was binging there was something to focus on/obsess about. This is just a waiting game. I want to go to sleep, so I can wake up to the busy week days. ",False,False

After two years, two continuous years since early 2017 of trying to accomplish a ten-day fast and failing every last time, I've refined my issues to this: fasting causes me to obsess on food and to become overwhelmingly bored with the void where normally I would be *eating.*  So, sooner or later, in every fasting attempt I'll cave and eat. Usually it'll be an ""OMAD"" ‚Äî a day's worth of calories eaten inside 4hrs, to kick of a new fasting attempt. But never yet have I hit 130hrs fasting, and I'd say my average fasting duration has been 40hrs, accomplished twice or thrice per week. In the month of February just past, for example, I finished ten fasts exceeding 30hrs, once reaching 90hrs. Typically it is not physical hunger that does me in; being keto-adapted and even ""metabolically flexible"" (a state with scientific validity and quantifiable markers) my body knows how to utilize its fat stores without demanding external carbs for energy. And I'm convinced that this pattern of repeated 40hr fasting has conferred significant benefits on me. I'm closer  than ever to ""a healthy relationship with food.""  But while fasting I'm fixated upon thoughts of food, and it's almost like a pressure builds and builds until I'll eat a bite just to release my tension, to get it over with, to ""show food it's not the boss of me!"" Only, of course, then food ""wins, "" since having eaten even a handful of nuts or whatever it might be, the dam breaks and I'll slide into a full meal, at times even a binge reaching 4000Cals.  It truly now feels like I'm locked in an endless war with food, each day another battle or skirmish in the ongoing conflict. No end in sight. But perhaps victory for me or an armistice with my foe, food ‚Äî maybe even the holy grail of that ""healthy food relationship"" ‚Äî will come once I ""process my goal"" (thanks for this idea, u/ywnktiakh!) enough to overcome the boredom inherent in fasting, enough to stay the course.  Right this very minute I'm 16¬ºhrs into my latest fasting attempt. If history repeats itself, I'll get thru' all of today, Sunday, only to cave and eat tomorrow Monday, or on Tuesday, or on Wednesday‚Ä¶  But this just might be the time I'll keep endure for ten days, twelve, or more! ""Hope springs eternal."" üòî",False,False

Even OMAD is no different because you'll still find yourself in the predicament of waiting until you can eat your OMAD, eating your OMAD, popping triple doses of Diphenhydramine to fall asleep until you can eat again and so on.
