I really get pissed when someone younger mentions dietary restriction or talks about wanting to be a little thin too. (Especially when a parent/adult makes them insecure)     ""You dOnT nEEd to dO tHat! YoU aRe FiNe!""      And then give them a lecture on :    * how their bodies are beautiful as they are      * not to fall for fads     * to focus on:     * * nutrition,     * * growing up      * * being physically fit by participating in sports and activities.",False,False
