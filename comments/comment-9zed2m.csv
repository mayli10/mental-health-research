Instead, my daughter wanted me to make honey baked ham and my mother insisted on the main dish being a Middle Eastern classic: rice and beef stuffed grapeleaves. Turkey is a safe food for me: no one ever eats the white meat and I get tons of leftovers for the days ahead while the marshmallow covered brown sugar coated sweet potatoes eye me in the fridge.  I love Thanksgiving because I can surround myself with safe foods and not seem like a freak. As I get older and 'wiser' but still carry this fucking ED with me, it becomes so imperative that I cover it up so I don't infect my sweet 9 year old daughter with it's demons and people don't see the 34 year old woman who is shopping for a home, running the executive boardroom at work, breadwinning for my family is ACTUALLY constantly starving, secretly binging, secretly spending hours at the gym and sticks to a handful of safe foods.   I've been lurking a long time and a redditor for nearly a decade, but I made a throwaway this morning when I saw this because I just want to crawl in a hole and die because of fucking turkey. I was too busy at work this week to fight the fucking turkey battle and also realized there isn't a single diet soda option in this house because I made my mom in charge of buying the groceries.",False,False

I’m bringing honey-balsamic roasted Brussels sprouts and sweet potato casserole, and if they’re not finished, my family will definitely try to send them back home with me.  I will not have that.
