She told me no one would remember that I was as skinny as I was when I died. Something like that. Like.. you think I want to be remembered?   Anyway no one asked but Fatlogic comes off as pretty similar to TiA. Nitpicking and making fun for the sake of it and missing the point of most of whatever they decided to nitpick.,False,False

So much. I was happy when I looked in a mirror and restricted. Now, I could definitely lose 10 pounds.

Like, how is that fatlogic? There is literally nothing in the meme that talks about being fat, it is clearly for young girls who obsess about what they consider the skinny status symbols like a teeny waist or thigh gap.

As - you can fit all of those things in a healthy lifestyle without carrying extra weight/being thin doesn't necessarily equate suffering or missing out. Which is true for normies. Plenty of people who don't carry an extra 5-10 pounds enjoy all that shit.  What sounds like guilting - there's no excuse or need for 5-10 extra pounds - when you have an eating disorder isn't an unreasonable thought for a healthy person. It's just a gentle reminder to not overindulge for them.,False,False

Sure, I could lose 10 lbs.. But at my current weight, I don't restrict, I don't have to over-exercise to maintain (hell, I don't have to exercise to maintain at this weight). My clothes still fit, I can get dinner with my friends, I can have a drink at dinner with my fiance, I can sleep at night without panicking thinking about my morning weight.

But the question is: 5-10 pounds compared to what baseline? Going from BMI 20 to 22? Nothing wrong with that. Going from BMI 24 to 26? Fine. Going from BMI 29 to 31? Much less fine. Also, let's be honest: it's never 5-10 pounds..  yes they sometimes post stuff meant for ed recovery, that gets appropriated by haes people, which sucks. but it doesnt make the fatlogic not true? if youre recovering i can see them bashing the post as being harmful, but if youre an average person reading the posted image and then their comments, if anything its more enlightening and like ""oh, i dont have to give up and be ten pounds more than i need to. i can be the weight i want to be if i really want to. As another commenter said in that post, you can do all those things without overeating and maintain whatever weight you want without a 10pound buffer for pizza nights",False,False
