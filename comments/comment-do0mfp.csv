I’m sorry that that happened. He probably didn’t meant anything by it.   I really don’t see why people don’t just keep their thoughts to themselves. Like, I’ve never felt the impulse to go out of my way and comment on someone’s personal stuff...whatever it may be. I guess I’m an introverted person by nature, but I don’t know. I don’t see what that dude accomplished by saying that to you.   Don’t think anything of it. And whenever people say stuff like that to you, it says more about them than it does about you. Just brush it off. Don’t doubt yourself. You’re doing fine and you’re going to be fine.   We all gonna make it brah",False,False

Sometimes it’s like this sub is the only real place to share what we are going through, in terms of the life we live. I hope it makes you feel better to some extent.   You don’t have to be sorry. Everything you’re experiencing is valid. Don’t apologize ;)",False,False

Thank you for saying I'm doing fine. I hope I don't sound too whiny-- I know a lot of people are going through way worse, but I'm weaker than those people I think.  I don't get why he said that to me either. He's a little awkward, but he has a good heart. I'm going to try to let those kind of comments roll of my back from him; I just started working there, so I expect that he'll say more things in that manner as time goes on.  Just a disclaimer that I'm rather wasted right now, so my apologies if this comment doesn't make sense. I hope you're okay, too :)",False,True

I hope you’re feeling better now.   Also, I have no idea what impulse drives people to make those comments. Okay, like, good for your manager? No one asked him what or how much he eats at work. Congrats bro. It honestly peeves me how some people can make comments like that, yet at the same time I recognize that there is no malicious intent behind them a lot of the time.   Take care of yourself. You’re honestly doing fine. Good luck with school and everything. You’re a trooper.",False,False
