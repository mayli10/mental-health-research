While eating drastically lower than your TDEE *will* lower your metabolism, it's impossible to put on fat because you can't store extra energy if you're using more than you're putting in. Your metabolism is more a measure of how efficient that process is.  If you're dehydrated or have eaten carbs/sodium, you'll retain more water which could also give the illusion that you've gained.",False,False

I didn't think I was exaggerating thinking a week is more than enough time to lose weight, but that is because I keep comparing to my old self two years ago when I first started restricting.

I always stall out over the week before my period starts and a few days after, I think just bc of hormonal fuckery/water retention. Also depends on how much salt you're getting and the kind of food you eat (high or low volume, fiber amt) bc it can stay in your body for different amounts of time. I know a week feels like plenty of time to us mentally but weight loss and digestion wise it's not a lot of time at all ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False

What I've started doing is incorporating more protein (trust me its hard when I have a sweet tooth and I love chocolate!) and hitting the gym.  That way 8k building muscle to increase my metabolism, look and feel physically better and bonus - protein helps you feel fuller for longer. Apparently :)",False,False

Sounds counter productive, but if you don't eat enough your body will try to store everything as fat because it thinks its dying.
