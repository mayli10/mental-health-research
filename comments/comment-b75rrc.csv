Iâ€™m 5â€™4 and my starting weight was 215. I lost about 17 lbs through fasting before I knew I was basically just restricting. I have some mental health issues too â€” I just found out last summer I have aspergers and along with it I get some OCD traits, depression, anxiety, and high/low periods of energy where Iâ€™m either go go go or lay on the couch forever ðŸ™ƒ    I also found out (not formally diagnosed) that I probably have BED and am also currently restricting. Not doing as much exercise but the desire is there for the first time in years. My husband has no idea and tbh my friends and family donâ€™t either.    So yay us! If you ever wanna chat hit me up lol sounds like weâ€™re in similar situations. And welcome to a very supportive sub! ",False,False
