It only seems that way because you're looking at still images of their life where they always look good and seem to be having fun. If you could watch an honest day in the life of your favourite Instagramers you would see that they put a lot of work into putting on the appearance they do for the Internet. Also, typically these people are either very rich and can afford to live lavishly or they put all of their resources into living a certain lifestyle. Like, there are people who spend more on clothes and travel in a year than they do on food or other necessities.",False,False

Also, just because we see a snippet into their life doesn't mean it's real; it doesn't mean they aren't purging or starving themselves behind the camera, it doesn't mean they don't hate their own body and see every flaw we don't see, it doesn't mean they have have happy and healthy relationships with people (or food).

I’ve deleted it years ago and never looked back. One of the best decisions of my life. I don’t have many friends so I don’t feel the need to check their stories etc, but I feel like that’s still unnecessary in itself.

Instagram makes me feel so restless and stuck, in addition to feeling ugly. I follow some of these beautiful, eclectic girls who are my age or younger, who are traveling and living out their dream careers and living their best lives. I know that they most likely suffer from their own depression, self doubt, loneliness, etc. But they at least get to travel and live an interesting life while they're going through stuff.
