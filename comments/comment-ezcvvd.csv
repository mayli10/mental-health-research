You're strength is shown by how you choose to navigate thru and around them.  You've just shown yourself how capable you are of facing just such a challenge Best wishes,False,False

I ended up opening up a bit to my advisor about what had been going on; I was incredibly fortunate that they were receptive to my struggles and willing to discuss what could be done to prevent future discrepancies.   When I read ""proactive"" when you first posted this (I have finally gathered my senses to respond to the comments after a few glum days) I felt a surge of empowerment. Luckily mental illnesses are gradually being more recognized in today's society...",False,True

Thank you for sharing your experiences-- I was in a really dark place when I posted and I felt pretty alone; it is really junk that we have had to experience losses because of our ED.  I hope you are doing better nowadays ;\^; Thank you for reminding me (and other possible readers) that we aren't alone in these struggles ;o;",False,True

It just gets in the way of everything and I really need to take 12 weeks FMLA and go to residential but I canâ€™t afford it.,False,False

Things got really bad ED-wise when I began studying for PhD... ED caused me to lose my ability to concentrate, to memorize, and pretty much lose all other cognitive functioning, while PhD and my falling behind made the stress and therefore ED worse. So it was a viscious cycle. I ended up having to quit the PhD, unfortunately, for the sake of my health / sanity / ED recovery. I still to this day grieve my PhD opportunity and blame my raging ED for taking it away from me.   I'm truly sorry to hear you're going through a similar thing... That really sucks!",False,False

Say you're having medical issues. Yippy arcuate the concern and don't your best to work on them.  Your ed isn't just going to go away or get better so you need to get work school on board and protect yourself. Compile therapist/psychiatrist notes you can bring to Dean/ hr department that aren't overly specific but say you're recurring medical care. You may need special accommodations in the future. I don't eat to be negative but getting fired or having to drop classes /failing is very common and not unheard of in the slightest if you keep shrugging this off acting like nothing's wrong. You need to be proactive about your health.  It's best right now to just tell you're advisor you're struggling with health issues and show you value the class and if they can work with you and any help is very appreciated you're not asking for for a free pass or making excuses just uncomfortable sharing too much information and trying to do your best.,False,False

I skipped soooo many classes last year but didn't get caught somehow.  This year, I skipped a few and my principle was like ""what's up, why didn't you go to class?""   I had to tell him that I just wasn't feeling well.  I couldn't tell him the truth that I was stuck hating my own body and in the middle of fasting because i ate 10000 calories the night before.   When I fast, I feel crappy. When i binge, i feel crappy.   Hope it gets better for you :)",False,False
