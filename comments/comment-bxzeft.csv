Have followed her from the beginning and noticed such a change in her physique as well as her content ( and not for the better).  She doesn't share much about her life (which I respect), but I'm sure there's some underlying issues (ie, her mother's health) that can affect  her eating.  I admire what she's doing and hope it'll contribute to her wellness.",False,False

I mean idk how well she’ll follow through with this but watching the video made me really happy for her,False,False
