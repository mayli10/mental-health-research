I'm very good at resisting junk food 99% of the time but my mind was like hahahaHAHAHA IT'S YA BIRTHDAY WHY NOT HAVE A TREAT? That turned into 3738926 treats and much regret.

I just wouldn't eat for a couple days a week to speed up weight loss. I would do it for several consecutive days preceding and after a vacation with my parents, restaurant meal, party, etc. Pretty much any situation that would cause me to eat in excess. I made sure to balance my electrolytes and it was all groovy. I can still do if I am sedentary but as soon as I start heavy lifting for my job my body is like NOPE.",False,False

I hate doing nothing and want to be active everyday! What's the reason for fasting? Intermittent fasting or not eating for 24+ hours? I go to the gym 4 days a week with a focus on strength training to try and get more toned and it has worked well. I'm kind of forgetting this isn't a fitness subreddit because I follow a lot of those haha. When you're that tiny there's no way you could look like an orc!

I am very muscular because of my job which allows me to maintain it fairly easily. However I find fasting to be much more difficult.

I know it's hard to be sure and so mant devices are inaccurate. I'm around 15%. My binges are never emotional either.

When I learned about it when reading up on recovery I felt so validated. I thought it was abnormal. My binges are never emotional it is a purely physical DEMAND for more food.,False,False

I have been very restrictive and obsessive with my food for about a year now. I'm not sure what triggered it, but now it's all in the name of maintaining my low body fat % and staying lean.   June was pretty bad for me since getting my binges mostly under control so I decided to increase my calories which I think has helped, but I still don't think they're enough. I had around 5 (not super awful) binges in June and have been good up until yesterday at my birthday party and after (I'm estimating it was a 5-6k calorie day of mostly sugary garbage) so I'm struggling with the guilt and shame right now.

I’ll tell myself okay just some xyz then that’s enough I actually am finally full. And I’ll still keep eating more. Then a few hours later and I feel so sick that I could throw up with out making myself. 50% of the time I have continued to eat more at this point.

This is generally a result of restricting heavily for several consecutive weeks. I end up eating until I can barely breathe, waiting until it settles and then continuing to ""top off"" until I snap out of it.     The most recent adventure was     3 protein bars, one peach, 2 smoothies, bowl of tofu scramble, 2 cups of peanuts, a handful of dates dipped in yogurt, about 6 baby naan dipped in hummus, bowl of chili, quart of mint choc chip ice cream, entire box of reeses puffs and a box of parmesan pitas chips.

If I plan for multiple trips through a buffet and made that decision ahead of time it's fine.   If I suddenly become aware that a package of snacks is gone after I've been desperately trying to hold off a binge with zero cal drinks, then it's a binge.

I feel like a lot of people are diagnosed with binge eating disorder when in reality it’s a result of restriction. That restriction might be food groups, calories, meal times. Also caused by food guilt. There was a study where two groups were taken to a buffet and one group was told the food was really bad and unhealthy but they could eat as much as they could, the other group was told it was fine and they could enjoy the food and eat as much as they wanted. The food guilt drove the first group to eat significantly more than the second group. Therefore, I believe you’re only binging if you believe you’re not eating much because you have no restrictions or guilt. Examples are 600 lb life reality show participants who are in denial of how much they eat.",False,False
