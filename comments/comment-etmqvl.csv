I use the bf% from my scale with a grain of salt, but itâ€™s probably close enough.",False,False

I don't think I managed quite 35,000 calories. In my mind me eating 3 meals a day counts as bingeing which is pretty skewed I know :/",False,True

Iâ€™m sure that you didnâ€™t gain 10 pounds of straight fat. I know you said you ate a lot but if you gained 10 pounds of straight up fat you would have to eat 35,000 calories over winter break. Plus weight fluctuates a lot too. I also gained 10 pounds by bingeing but then the next day I lost 5 so it will all balance out",False,False
