I was sexually abused by a teacher at my elementary school when I was a kid, and around that time I started to binge eat to comfort myself. Then I got raped at 17 and turned into a complete control freak who was even scared of sleeping because it made me feel defenseless and vulnerable, so I basically just went to the complete opposite and became extremely restrictive and developed anorexia.",False,False

Multiple instances of sexual assault in the past 10 years has really fucked me up, and severely worsened my eating disorder. It's not really about my curves for me though, more a need to 1. control my own body however that may be and 2. if I treat my body so so horrible in multiple ways, then no one will (most likely) never be able to punish it as much as I already do myself.  It generally seems like sexual trauma is a huge trigger for ED's. Which makes so much sense of course.",False,False

I was just sensitive to everything, like the way people perceived me and the thought of growing up. At 19 or 20 I was on holiday where I got into a situation where things easily could've gone wrong. I was high and drunk and about to sneak into the closed off pool with 2 strangers, at the last moment I realized how vulnerable I actually was, so I made a fool out of myself and left. So nothing happened and I still doubt anyone had malicious intent, but it messed me up bad. It was very scary and triggering.",False,False

The curves on my body make me feel disgusted with myself and I feel extremely uncomfortable when people look at me in a sexual way. It‚Äôs something I experience a lot of anxiety over when I‚Äôm out in public.   It‚Äôs difficult because I love clothing and fashion and often dress up, so I think people would look at me and think I am trying to get noticed. But fashion is a way for me to express myself and when I dress nicely, it helps me to feel a bit better about myself. A good outfit helps to boost my mood a bit when I‚Äôm feeling especially down and insecure. It‚Äôs about the clothes, I‚Äôm not trying to draw attention to my body- although those often go hand-in-hand as far as people noticing.   I just despise things like being looked up and down, it feels dehumanizing and is triggering. Even just lingering stares that feel sexual in nature. Like I‚Äôm not here for your visual sexual  enjoyment. I just want to be a body type without those curves, where people are not viewing me in a lustful way. I hate my features that are seen as ‚Äúwomanly‚Äù. They are a painful reminder to me and cause me discomfort and anxiety when I look in the mirror.   I am so sorry for what you have gone though. If you ever want to talk with someone, vent, cry...anything. I‚Äôm here. üñ§",False,False

I reject my body and its responses more than my gender. As far as my relationship to food, I deny my body. I deny it all sorts of things, including food, so that I AM the one in control of my feelings, not by body.   This makes me think....it seems like I blame myself for what happened to me more than I blame other people. Also seems that I seperate myself from my SELF in some notable ways.  Thanks for this post.

I was molested by a disgusting old guy at my previous job and reported it and lost a ton of friends and colleagues in the process. I don't feel the need to be genderless, but the guy was morbidly obese and I feel like becoming smaller is my way of proving to the world that I can control myself, unlike that gross pig. I haven't wanted to wear makeup or work on my appearance since it happened because certain women felt the need to voice that I deserved what happened to me because of my appearance. Many of them commented on my weight before it happened as I was always thinner, and I feel like the 'otherness' of looking after my weight and the added layer of f*cked up from the sexual trauma has made me very withdrawn and sad and most definitely contributed to my relapse.
