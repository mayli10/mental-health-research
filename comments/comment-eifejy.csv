I never thought it would be possible but I'm doing it.  This year I would like to challenge myself to be purge-free.

My late night eating is ridiculous so I’m going to try to work on that. I never feel full. Mom says it’s from starving for a year, my body’s out of wack.

They haven't seen me in a while and I've lost a lot of weight, to the point I should be desperately trying to gain. I've had some comments from my family about looking too thin and ill - but bizarrely, my mother is trying to stop me from eating. I told myself I'd eat while off work, but every time I do I'm accused of eating too much. I'm only eating at mealtimes, skipping breakfast and never snacking, and yet she tells me 'you've already had enough', 'you don't need any more', 'don't finish everything on your plate', etc... She doesn't say these things to my siblings, who are average weights, or my overweight father. Just me. I don't understand.",False,False
