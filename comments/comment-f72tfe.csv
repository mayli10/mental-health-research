I’m anorexic and just a week ago hit a new post relapse LW, but since Friday or Saturday I have eaten a shameful amount of food. I just cannot stop no matter how much I want to and I hate myself for it. Idek exactly how much I’ve eaten calorie-wise, but I ate an entire frozen pizza yesterday and a whole cheesecake in 1.5 days—those two things alone total 3800 cals, on top of everything else I’ve had. I’m terrified and ashamed.  None of that is helpful to you at all, but I hope you can find some comfort in knowing you’re not alone.",False,False

I think it’s also normal to even “overshoot” the amount that you need. earlier on in recovery, I high restricted for just one day, and was bombarded with very extreme hunger for the next three days. I think it’s because it takes time to rebuild trust with the body. now I’ve been eating (relatively) consistently for a longer time, I still have extreme hunger sometimes, but when I eat less on some days due to uncontrollable circumstances like work etc. I don’t overcompensate as much.   I’d say that if you have a past of restriction, it’s hard to go wrong with eating more. I know it can feel physically awful and mentally daunting. but for me at least, and a lot of others I know, eating (more than) enough and consistently for a sustained period of time is what helps the body restore its energy balance, and signals to it that it doesn’t need to reactively eat anymore. now it takes a lot fewer calories to satisfy me compared to earlier on, when I’d have the bottomless pit of hunger 24/7.   also, mental hunger qualifies as a valid hunger cue!   do you have a dietitian or professional you can work with? maybe a meal plan to help you up your intake but in a structured way so it feels less daunting?   stay strong and good luck &lt;3",False,False
