For me it was when my daughter made a comment about how skeletal I was looking. She‚Äôs the same age I was when signs of my AN started to develop. A day or two later the kids told us at dinner that one of their teachers had gone into hospital with an ‚Äúeating problem‚Äù.  I suddenly became very conscious that their ‚Äúskeletal‚Äù mother was sitting opposite and about to leave half the food on her plate like she always does. I didn‚Äôt  want to be that role model, especially not now.  The subject changed and no one really noticed but I made a slow and determined commitment to keep forking my food in my mouth and chewing until it had all gone. Even after I felt like I might burst. It was a child size portion, i can‚Äôt let that happen that I can‚Äôt finish a child‚Äôs portion. So I did it, felt inwardly proud (didn‚Äôt want to draw attention to my ‚Äúachievement‚Äù especially as they‚Äôd all eaten twice as much as I had!) and I‚Äôve continued to make a point of doing so every single time since then (about six weeks ago)  I snack between meals, and when I‚Äôm thinking ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point in this, I don‚Äôt want it and there‚Äôs not even anyone to see me eat it and think, wow she eats like a proper person!‚Äù I remember that what I‚Äôm doing is ACTUALLY what ‚Äúa proper person‚Äù does! LOL, a ‚Äúproper person‚Äù doesn‚Äôt only eat chocolate when they have an audience, just to show off how ‚Äúnormal‚Äù they are! FFS, what sort of thinking is that, lol.   But yeah, after 25 years of conditioning I have to rewrite my whole code, it‚Äôs tough man.  Another thing that happened at the same time was I did not ovulate and was having symptoms of early perimenopause, and after reading about AN and the criteria for early menopause and that I was meeting all the criteria like a mofo, I thought omg I can‚Äôt cope with turning into an old lady as well while I‚Äôm still in my thirties.   I was having chest pains too and i had a ‚Äúholy fuck, what am I doing, I‚Äôm spiraling here‚Äù and I hadn‚Äôt even realized it.  That was probably the biggest one, how close I came to losing touch with reality.  Losing touch with reality is terrifying and I want to get as far away from it as possible.  I‚Äôm soooooo scared of losing control and I‚Äôm scared of gaining weight.  But I‚Äôm way more scared of losing my mind, losing my youth and fertility, losing my life and god forbid, passing on this curse to my kids with my example.  In moments of weakness, i think of all that and i fucking take that bite, then the next and the next until my ‚Äúdose‚Äù is complete.  It sucks sometimes but afterwards I do feel powerful. Fuck you, ED.",False,False

I hope it never is relevant to you.   A few years ago, my ex's Mom died from anorexia. She was ~55.   I wish I could say she was a pleasant person, but she wasn't. She was an absolute nightmare. She mostly lived on ros√© wine, and would scream at her sons, or her mother, if they suggested she eat anything. She had bald patches all over her head. She smelled absolutely horrifying, because she couldn't stay conscious even sitting in a hot shower. Her personal hygiene was absolutely awful, a layer of perfume over weeks of unwashed, flaking off skin and cigarettes.   In the end, she died technically of a quite banal respiratory infection. The nurses in the hospital refused to treat her because she was so angry and abusive to them. My ex couldn't manage to go into the hospital to see her ; it was too much for him. She liked me quite ok because I never to bring her ""disgusting food"" like the others, I just brought beauty supplies. I think about that a lot. I also think a lot about the smell coming off her as I tried to dry shampoo her hair.   My ex has never really been the same. He calls me every now, sometimes drunk at 3 am, and then and says things like ""I don't know if my Mom was proud if me, if she was, she might have taken better care of herself and chose to live."" His Grandmother changed personality completely since her death. I don't know if she is still alive now, but she went from being a sweet old lady to never saying a word. But none of this was a surprise. She, My ex's Mom, was anorexic for 30+ years. 30+ *years.* She stopped working (formerly an actress), her husband walked out on her, her children gave up on her.  This is not a disease you grow out of. r/EDAnonymousAdults is proof of this. No outside measure of adulthood : Job, Marriage, Kids, Flat, will ever take this brain worm away from you. This doesn't just go away. And sadly, for many of us ""functional adults,"" it's just a daily battle. Sometimes hourly because food is omnipresent.  It's all, in my personal opinion, a question of reducing both the frequency and amplitude of the parasitic thoughts. One _can_ do this !! But, the body checks still happen. But, my grocery trips don't take quite so long. Once this parasite gets its roots into your head, the sad truth is, it doesn't go away. I hope with all my heart I am wrong for all reading this, but in my experience, and from what I've observed : you don't ""grow out of"" this.   So, all one can do is be gentle with yourself, now and in the future. Every tiny occasion there is the possibility to do so, today tomorrow and forever, choose gentleness. üíï  ",False,False
edhulqi,t3_adjctb,t1_edhjxei,Hopelessmangos,1,2019-01-07 12:59:34,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/adjctb/recovery/edhulqi/,"This is so true.  For me, the real turning point was the fear that I had damaged my fertility.  I had always taken it for granted that I would eventually have children but it was always a future me.  Then all of a sudden my husband and I were ready and nothing was happening and I was terrified equally of the fact that I either had to face real consequences or face my eating disorder.  Even at that point, it wasn't an easy choice and it's a choice I have to keep making every day.  I'm so much happier now in recovery, but it's a fact I have to remind myself.  Hopefully someday these coping habits will become reflexes and will become effortless.",False,False

The early years of my diagnosis I was pro ana but most of my adult years have been hating it but not ready to change.   For me I got a cluster of occurrences in a short space of time and it seemed like a sign from the universe.   A major factor is fear. When you fear the illness even more than you fear getting fat or losing control (even more!
