I felt really stupid in most of the classes. Engineering is a difficult major. So, we shouldnt be hard on ourselves. This semster might not be the best, but your mental health is more important. Try to do something to relax, I know it is hard, but I guess theres smth you like to do to soothe yourself. Let yourself rest for a day. Dont blame yourself for what happened or your actions etc, your ED. We didnt get ED because we wanted it. Hope you dont hate yourself, I wish you be kind to yourself just for a day. and move on from there. I am not good with words, but.. it will improve. surely. You will be okay, not everyday, but at least some other days. Good days and bad days.   ",False,False

I‚Äôm such a failure.  &gt;I‚Äôm an engineering major and I just feel so dumb compared to the rest of my class.    These right here. This is me. I failed all but one of my classes this semester. I only passed the one since the exams were straightforward and open notes. I think about food, exercise, and weight so much that I think I'm now the dumbest engineering student here.  I'm supposed to graduate fall 2019, but I know that won't happen now. It's too embarrassing to admit that I failed a whole semester because of this. Unfortunately, I'm also poor so idk what to do about paying back the tuition for my failed classes.",False,False

Some days it just gets so bad I'm simply too sick to get out of bed. Of course this semester I actually ended up being sick for other a month straight (not ED-related) right before I tried to catch up on all of the assignments I missed when I was just always too starved to do anything. ,False,False
