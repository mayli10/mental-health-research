I know it's not ideal but it's all I've got.   I found out recently that the work VISA I need could be revoked if I fail a medical exam and that was kind of the final straw for me to actually start recovering. It's been on my mind for a while and I knew I couldn't really go on for much longer. So I decided that I had to recover.  I just focused on mental stuff in the beginning, looking at my relationship with food, etc...but for the last week I've actually increased my calorie intake so that I will inevitably start gaining weight. Compared to other people I think my symptoms have been pretty manageable but the bloating/change in my appearance has started to make me really anxious  I was kinda hoping someone who's been through this would have advice for coping",False,True
