I'm a bit of a sicko though and LOVE the chase.  Sometime's it's been more exciting than the relationship, ha.  He's interested.  That lipstick comment.  I've never had a platonic male friend say anything like that because it's what you say when you're flirrrrrrtingggggg.  Shame I'm not there because I'm a great fixer-up er.  I'm a fan of sending stupid little notes about something random and including a little gift type thing that costs f all, like a novelty candy or something.  Usually I'll attempt to woo them with a book if I know we have the same tastes (bookworms are sooo sexy to me).  You should definitely step it up a bit.  Really, he doesn't care how much you weigh.  It sounds like he thinks you're cool, so you should fix something up outside of work with him or whatever.   Life's too short and shitty to not try to get the most out of it.  (I vape too, but only because cigs are too expensive now.  I'm on banana right now, mmmmm).",False,False

So many people love so many different body types, plus, most people would say that a good personality makes a person more attractive overall. If he says no, ask him why (not in a rude way). If he says no, it could help you to get closure, because I doubt it would be because of your body. And if it is, he's not worth your time.  I hope you find the strength to ask him out!!",False,False

If he judges someone on their weight then he's not worth your affections.  Ask him out, ffs.  There's a lot more to a person than their appearance - personality, humour, etc.etc.  He's going to have insecurities of his own, too.  Tell your ED to fuck right off.  They take away so many opportunities in life.  Don't let it win.  Do your flirt thing and see how the chemistry goes.  You think he has a crush on you so go for it!!!",False,False
