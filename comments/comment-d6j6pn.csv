I pre log the week when I make my shopping menu. Everything is perfectly balanced and I'll use every calorie and hit every macro.   And I eat it all. Even when I have a bad day and cave on a bag of chips early afternoon...or more. But I still have to eat the dinner I logged because I worked so hard to come up with the eating plan! And I'm full and unhappy...but I eat it anyway like a dumbass and go over for the day. And then sometimes the week. And then I get pissed at myself and exercise more than I'd ever want to in an attempt to salvage the day. I'm always playing catch up with myself.  Intermittent fasting doesn't help...I've lost and gained and lost again the same 17 lbs in sections since November of last year. Fuck this disorder.,False,False

Cried once because I logged ricotta and tomato toast, hated it, and “had to” eat it anyways.",False,False
