It was probably for the best though, as when I looked in the mirror before I purged, I noticed that my stomach was extremely distended. Also, I was starting to get sick of all the sugar by the end anyway; unfortunately, I wasn't home alone, so it's hard to get my hands on ideal binge food..instead I'm left trying to tolerate 99 cent store sugary crap haha. I hope I didn't forget anything.",False,False
