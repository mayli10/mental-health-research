On the day I ended it, my aunt was playing with my hair and said, ""You're look like you're losing hair; I can see your scalp."" I didn't believe her at first, but right after, my hair starting falling out. Like, every couple minutes, a full piece of hair would fall out from the root. I would get into a car for a 10-car drive, and I'd stand up and look back at the seat, and the seat would be covered in my hair. And I had hair that reached past my butt at the time, so it was fucking long strands of hair everywhere. I'd go into the shower, and hair would cover the walls. Every time I brushed my hair, I'd feel like 30 strands fall out.  It continued at this pace for about 6 months-1 year, and finally slowed down after that. It's been almost 2 years now, and I've mostly stopped purging, and thank god I think my hair loss has stopped.  But as I said, I used to have hair past my butt. It reached the bottom of my butt cheeks. I didn't even cut my hair during this time, and now my hair reaching my mid/mid-lower back. It was just my mid-back for a time, but I think it's starting to grow a little longer again (it's been 2 years since I started purging).  My volume? Gone. I had a lion's mane before this. My hair has the same volume as the average white chick now.  I used to be insecure about my hair because people would say it was too messy, and my best friend at the time called it a rat's nest.  I regret not appreciated my hair more. My hair is actually what made my current boyfriend notice me. It was the first thing his parents commented on to me. This was a year back too..I wish he could have seen my full head of hair when I had it.  Unfortunately though, it would take like a decade of growth for new hair to emerge from my scalp to past my butt. I'm not sure if I'm going to want hair THAT long when I'm 30.  It's very sad for me. At least though, I take a lot better care of my hair now.",False,False

It’s the worst. It definitely comes out all over, not in clumps, and is always the worst during and after showers. I take collagen pills and hair vitamins daily and I have collagen protein powder to help slow the fall. All of these together only SLIGHTLY help. I also eat as much protein as possible.
