It might be the time you stick with it. I hope this time, it will be your time, but if it’s not, perhaps the next time will be. I wish you the best of luck on your recovery, I believe you can do it! Don’t be afraid of slip ups, it’s better to have slip ups than quitting your recovery. You’re not a failure if you slip up, please remember that (you never are a failure).   Ps: if you’re not OP but also starting recovery, this comment applies to you too.",False,False
