I feel sort of ambivalent about the way you're talking about him—berating you for binging and calling it ""eating shit"" sounds worrying, and being more affectionate to you when you're restricting is *extremely* worrying. Although you said he's not ""withholding affection,"" he sort of *is* in a *relative sense* if he's different levels of affectionate at different times.  Again, I hope part of it is just your ED projecting. And it's totally possible his intentions are not malevolent and he indeed wants you to be healthy. However, he may *subconsciously* act towards you in ways that are unhealthy towards your mental state because he is so ignorant about the way EDs work. He may be thinking that your ED is just a diet and he's being encouraging of healthy behaviors—the ""omg just BE HEALTHY how hard is it??"" attitude—which is why he's berating you after you've binged (like a ""psh, you did something disordered so I'm gonna act like telling you to STAHP and making you feel like shit about it works"" attitude).  Or, he might not. I'm concerned that he might *really* have abusive/manipulative tendencies. I don't want to jump to conclusions though.  See, this part bothers me:  &gt;He doesn't withdraw affection when I'm not a preferred size. He's just way over the top affectionate when I'm shrinking. I've told him how it makes me feel when he criticises a binge and he'll stop.  Does he still do this? Even if he stops criticizing you in the moment I don't want him to do it again.  &gt; His excuse being ""When I'm sad, I hate people asking me if I'm slipping back to depression. I didn't want to upset you by asking if you're slipping back to anorexia."" Sure.  I think in this case I personally would say something like ""While you may dislike inquiries about your own mental health, I don't want to feel alone if I'm in a relapse. In the future I want you to be more supportive."" Idk.  &gt; He is ridiculously tall and keeps the snacks (even the ones I've bought) out of my reach so I can't eat them without him getting something for me.  I think you should tell him how this current arrangement is making you feel uncomfortable about food.  &gt; Mine is way, WAY kinder and sweeter to me when I'm restricting  I guess some people really just think it's a normal diet and they are being encouraging... I would ask him to not give ANY comments on your body since you are currently relapsing into your eating disorder. Even if it's positive comments.  &gt; they can just cure us with their awesomeness and enough compliments  I HATE THIS. A LOT OF GUYS THINK YOURE SUPPOSED TO TELL PEOPLE THEY LOOK BEAUTIFUL OR WHATEVER AND THAT CURES ANY BODY IMAGE ISSUES. WELL IT DOESN'T. for me it's not only about looking a certain way; it's about feeling like I deserve food :(",False,False

From how you've described him he sounds abusive. But I know that ED brain in general likes to focus on negatives and not being able to binge if you want to or eat what feels safe without having to have someone else get it for you may feel tough and may cause you to, like you said, project. But please think very critically about how he treats you. You dont want your child to grow up seeing his mom allow herself to starve, and his dad allowing, enabling, and sometimes causing it to happen (if that is what truly happens).  Also I dont like the sound of him berating you for binging. Even if it is disordered, you dont deserve to be belittled or yelled at for something that is already a struggle",False,False
