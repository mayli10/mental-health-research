Bread, two pieces of cheese, two pieces of meat, and some submarine dressing, oh, and some smokey almonds too. Then, here it is y'all, I didn't snack at all the rest of the day!!!!! :D I didn't eat again till dinner where I had a cheeseburger, with buns, and barbecue sauce. There was an option to have a hashbrown with my burger but instead I opted for grapes!!  I am very bad with snacking and being an emotional eater but today I did neither! SO proud of myself!
