It's not habit forming or addictive in any way like traditional stimulant laxatives are, so there's no problem with long term use. I've been using miralax on and off for about three years now and it has been an absolute life saver.",False,False

Despite the name, it's not a laxative but an osmotic and it helps to keep your colon hydrated and moving regularly. If you're restricting at all, the reduced volume in your digestive system means that stool will take longer to move through. But the longer it takes, the more dehydrated it gets and that can lead to even slower movement and constipation. Miralax is really effective for me in preventing 'slow transit' constipation- 11/10 recommend.",False,False

How about instead of laxatives, an enema with only slightly warm (not hot) water. It's much safer and not habit forming.
