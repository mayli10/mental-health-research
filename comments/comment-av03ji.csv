It may be time to start a conversation with her in private. She's old enough to be self-aware. When I was 11, I was very anxious and depressed and was old enough to understand what was going on with me. She may be hesitant to ask for help, but there are likely resources at her school that you could encourage her to access. I wouldn't accuse her of anything or approach it like an attack which may cause her to get defensive.",False,False
