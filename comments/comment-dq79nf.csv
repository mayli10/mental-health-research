The important thing is not pushing them away, even when you feel that threat. I do understand that. My SO does know, but it's one of those things where I'm not sure that he really understands what it means?",False,True

My husband has been there for me on my really good days and my really bad days. I’ve shared with him countless times my struggles and how my brain works. He’s endured endless restrict/binge cycles. He’s on board when it’s time to eat chicken and salad and workout at the gym and he’s on board when I say fuck this shit it’s time to go HAM at Taco Bell. He can read me like a book and I know he worries like crazy when I’m going through a restriction cycle. Sometimes I hate him for it. My ED hates him for caring, for being too intrusive or questioning me about what I’ve eaten today. It sees him as a threat to my end goal. I feel so guilty about feeling like that because I know he just loves me. We’ve had to have many talks about the way he goes about things, because while he may see it as caring I see it as I’m being interrogated and want to be left tf alone. Does your SO know about your ED? If they do, it really helps to talk about what things they can do or say differently when you’re struggling. But yes, long story short I feel your pain!",False,False
