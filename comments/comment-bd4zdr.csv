I forgot to add that the other poster has a good point, there's no ""threshold"" where overeating crosses over into bingeing. There are other factors, like the timing, reasons and emotions involved. Did it feel similar to what you remember from the past? Or did you just have a ""fuck I don't feel like dieting anymore"" moment and enjoy some snacks?",False,False

Try to think of each day as an isolated event, not affected by the days before it. If you cut too deep it's only going to make you want to overeat again, rinse and repeat.  Also - if this continues to be a problem at 1200/day, maybe double check that 1200 is truly a good goal for you? The safest margin for weight loss is 250-500 cals below your TDEE, whatever that may be. So if your TDEE is 1700 or more, 1200/day is no bueno.  Maybe rich coming from someone on this forum, and I wouldn't suggest advice like this normally but you sound like you were pretty well recovered and I'd be awful for you to jeopardize that just to lose those couple pounds a little faster.  Stay safe, friend, and good luck!",False,False

It has to do with the feelings that accompany the eating, loss of control, guilt afterwards etc.   If you identify that you were truly hungry and ate to that amount that day satiety and felt no emotional turmoil before during or after then it wasn’t necessarily a binge.   If you suddenly crave chips, go to the pantry and end up eating what was left in the bag because you cannot stop, and then feel as though you’ve ruined your diet or now have to restrict heavily to compensate and feel immense guilt afterwards, but the bag was only 200 calories, that is still a binge",False,False

If you have been restricting, I doubt that 1,000-1,500 additional calories is enough to actually put you over your TDEE on a longer basis, though (say the past week, two weeks, month, etc).  For an eating behavior to be binging it must meet two criteria:  * the person eating feels out of control or dissociates while eating * the amount (volume) of food is excessive or far beyond what a non-disordered person would eat in a given period of time (normally a matter of minutes to two hours)  Given this was logged over the course of a day, assuming you took breaks while eating and consumed this amount in meals, I don't think it's necessarily a binge. You also don't mention feeling as though you couldn't stop. You may have made impulsive decisions or engaged in ""reactive eating"", which is overeating after a period of restriction (includes but isn't limited to binging). 1200 is doubtless below your TDEE and is a calorie deficit even if it is not necessarily disordered restriction, so it could result in urges that lead to overeating. This is not uncommon in people recovering from or relapsing in anorexiam",False,False
