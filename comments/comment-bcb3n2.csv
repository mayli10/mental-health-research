When I get overly hungry I end up just eating EVERYTHING bc I become a bottomless pit. I was trying to push dinner back later and later so I’d have less time to snack afterwards bc I tend to enjoy late night snacking. It’s the only time of day I eat stress free bc I usually have a beer or 2 or some wine and food doesn’t stress me as much. But I realized I was getting so hungry that after I ate my meals, I’d still snack bc I was ravenous  I try to limit my day time calories but if I did OMAD I’d definitely binge bc I’d be so hungry.",False,False

Eating 3500 extra calories than you burn (you burn 1400-ish a day for someone your weight if you didn't move at all) means gaining 1 or 1/14 of a stone.  Perhaps remember you have the same power to lose weight that you have to gain. But I'll be honest, I cant beat the panic either. I think continuing with the 1200 Omad without putting pressure on yourself to restrict further would be the best for you from what you described. Stop you from that all/nothing thinking.",False,False
