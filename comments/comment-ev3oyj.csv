Also, the sides like kimchi or spicy cucumbers, etc are relatively low cal. Like kbbq is going to be way less calories than a regular restaurant, I think. Just try to have a few bites of things here and there and have good conversations with your coworkers. They won't even notice what you're eating probably.",False,False
