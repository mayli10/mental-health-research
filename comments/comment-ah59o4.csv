I throw mine into a nonstick pan and heat them without moving or touching them for about 8ish minutes. I let them sit and get a crispy side until they are pretty much thawed. Then vigorously shake the pan so they loosen up. I find if I use a spatula/water/oil they get mashed and pull apart :( ,False,False

It is possible to enjoy a meal!  So, for my records:  I had dinner with my brother and his family tonight. We ate poached salmon with roasted potatoes, cauliflower, &amp; broccoli. I was in the kitchen playing with my nieces while their mother was cooking and I couldn't help but keep a nervous eye on how everything was being prepared. I watched her coat the chopped veg with olive oil, watched her mix up cream and mayo for the cucumber sauce. . . panicking because if I were preparing the meal at home I'd have just sprayed the veg with the very lightest amount of oil (like hardly any at all) and cooked the salmon with just lemon and dill - no cream sauce. Dinnertime comes, my brother serves us and bless his heart he doesn't put any sauce on my salmon, also loads my plate up with broc and cauliflower and only one small potato. The veg tasted better -  &amp; crispier - than when I make them at home, due I'm sure to the olive oil. I even tried some of the cucumber dill sauce and I admit it improved the fish. Shocking!
