I did that for a while and I was never satisfied. I met my boyfriend irl, he's much better than anybody I met online. That's an understatement, he's fucking amazing. The trick is to forget about dating entirely, don't make it important. If a guy comes along, he comes along. If he doesn't, he doesn't. Either way it works out, you can find ways to be happy. If you put value on the idea of a relationship, it'll turn sour even if you find the right guy. He might feel smothered by your expectations, or you might feel dissatisfied for the same reason. The key to love is to go with the flow, not that I'm an expert, but I'm really happy in my relationship so I think my perspective is valuable? Good luck though, I think I know how the loneliness feels because I was there for a long time. Not to jump the gun, but if it's a sex thing, most of the time you can make yourself ""get there"" better than any guy can.",False,False

Not a lot of people on this subreddit can say that about themselves. For me, knowing exactly why I was doing this to myself was the biggest step in recovering. I'm not fully recovered, and I don't think I ever will be, but I'm so much happier now. I've also gained some weight, and it looks good on me.
