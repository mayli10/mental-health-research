I'm 16 now. I've definitely had some people say that I was too young to have an ED or blocked me, with good intentions I'll admit, because they didn't want to expose someone my age and younger to the triggering world that is ED culture on the internet (most places. Reddit is actually the only place I've found that doesn't go out of their way to trigger the shit out of you) and I understand that but I was already deep into my ED at 12 years old and it hurt to not be able to find somewhere I was accepted (even at the olderish ages of 14 and 15) but I think I've found my home here on Reddit and I'm finally finding people that won't belittle me because of my age and are understanding and not triggering pro anas. Anyway I'm rambling so I'll leave it here.  TL;DR: It sucks being a ""kid"" with an ED but Reddit is my happy place",False,False

I’m 32, was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa at 16. Started having signs and symptoms of disordered eating right around 13. I’ve been mostly recovered since about 24, recently relapsing a bit. Honestly, the only difference in how I see my ED now vs when I was a teenager is that it’s no longer a competition with the world/others, but with myself. I don’t “joke” about it like I used to because I recognize that it’s a very serious mental illness, and I do a lot more hiding then flaunting. As a teenager, I wanted my ED to be obvious. I wanted people to recognize my weight loss, to see me not eating. I wanted to be known as the skinniest girl in the room. It was just part of the disorder with my less aged mind. Now I cringe when people ask questions because I’m almost embarrassed that I’m SO OLD and dealing with this. In my mind, ED’s are a “young girl” mental illness, and I loathe that I crave being thin so much at my age.  Just for anyone who actually reads this, it’s my own experience. I’m not saying all kids/teens with ED’s want to be noticed etc and so on. It’s just a timeline of my own personal development with it.",False,False

I began seeking out online ED forums and tumblrs around 14. Now here I am, 10 years later. When I see someone young here, I feel guilty and irresponsible for posting, because my internet usage definitely made my ED worse. I just want to shout, ""turn back now! Seek help! It's only going to get harder!""  Your ED is 100% valid. But, the longer your ED is a part of your life, the harder it is to let go of. And during these formative years, it will start to replace your personality and self. You'll be stuck at 24 like me trying to figure out who I am so I can start shoving the ED out without a gaping hole of nothingness.",False,False
