Or to know them. If they are your friends they should be aware that it's a sensible topic for you, or maybe you should tell them you are not comfortable with them joking about that.  I mean, living in the society we live in it should be obvious not to mention somebody's weight imo   Btw you are definetely not fat, I am shorter than you and weigh around the same",False,False

They could still be joking, but they also could very well be projecting or lashing out if you're smaller than them.   Idk. It's hard to judge since I don't know them and I don't know the specifics of the conversation and if they make you feel like this frequently or what.   But either way, I'm sorry your friends made you feel that way. ❤ everyone deserves supportive people in their lives to lift them up, not tear them down. I hope they're supportive, too, more often than not.",False,False

But they don’t and now I don’t know if they’re joking or not.",False,True

It's also super weird since it sounds like they picked up on the fact that you have an ED. Do your friends usually joke around with each other in insulting ways?",False,False
