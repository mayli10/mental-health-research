Her diet is really bad, mostly junk food, so before I payed a lot of attention to what she ate I was really jealous lol. She eats like a bird, barely makes a dent in anything she eats, she leaves bags of chips halfway full. I don't think anyone is naturally thin, but rather have a better understanding of how much they need to eat. It's hard to believe that for some people food isnt something to think about for days.",False,False

There’s this girl on youtube who is trying to gain weight before her wedding. On one of her videos about this, someone commented that she shouldn’t count calories because she could become obsessive about it, and her response was something like: “I need to count to make sure I’m eating enough. One day I thought I had eaten a lot, but after adding everything up, I realized I actually only ate under 1,000 calories that day.” and from then on I never believed in the whole “naturally thin” thing again.

Metabolism has nothing to do with it. I ate inconsistently. Sometimes a lot and sometimes hardly anything at all. I’m stressed and anxious and move a lot but never actually exercise. Now I have health issues making me really thin so it’s hard to remember what it was like before, but now I just can’t eat a lot and have no appetite.",False,False

Male, 5'9, sport boy. Eats VERY slowly, exercises a LOT, eats less when stressed. Doesn't restrict. Believes he eats a lot but doesn't notice how he often doesn't finish meals. Also doesn't take into account that he exercises more than others, since it's a lifelong habit (a given) for him and not for others.  2. Female, 5'10, no exercise. Always had a small small appetite. Meal skipping is not frequent but happens; rarely finishes meals, will skip to work, reports no cravings.   Common trends are that 'naturally thin' people have smaller appetites and generally don't fixate a lot on food as an emotional outlet. They get used to fat/normal weight people around them talking about skipping meals and saying how little they eat and so believe that they eat more than others, as their concept of enough is smaller.   They also tend to remember a big meal more, and will keep that in mind as evidence for eating a lot, whereas smaller meals are their norm and don't have as much salience in their minds. For example, sport boy cites being able to eat ""a lot"" and says he eats ""a lot"", saying that **once** he ate **three whole tacos.** ""Big tacos."" He has no idea.",False,False

Actually watched their eating patterns. Nope. They avoided snacks or had snacks for dinner, skipped breakfast, pretty much unintentionally IF and I wasnt even sure how they werent even thinner due to how much they didn't eat. My bf of 6""1 can down a large pizza at once but a lot of days he eats only 1k or less. Some days he literally forgets to eat anything.      There were two girls I knew who had a BMI of around 17~ both admitted to having trouble eating not due to ED but just being lazy to get food, or having snacks for dinner.       I think fast metabolism can be a real thing but it's probably less than 1% of the underweight population. Like Yuko the girl who eats 4k to 10k cal meals on YouTube is one of them. But most of them barely eat.   I think they brag about how much they eat because they are meaning they can eat huge meals at once with their friends,  but the rest of the week they are barely eating, they probably dont notice it either.",False,False

Rather it's a matter of perspective, ""naturally thin"" people naturally eat smaller portions, so if they say ""I ate a lot today!"" its a lot from THEIR perspective - but might still be little from the perspective of someone who eats way more on a daily basis. But we just assume our definition of ""a lot"" is the same when it's really not. I hope that makes sense?  I used to share meals with a very thin coworker when I was at my highest weight. Basically a restaurant allowed us to split a daily menu (soup, main course, dessert) so we did to save money. She'd always complain how it's still a lot, would never eat the dessert, and would wonder out loud how anyone could eat the menu by themselves. Meanwhile I always left feeling hungry, and would say no to the dessert because I was too embarrassed (then proceed to stuff my face once I got home). Now that I got used to eating smaller portions I completely understand where she was coming from, but back then I thought she was just being bitchy and lying lol. ",False,False

Oh, plus the increased wine intake to deal with work stress. I found myself up 30lbs in a matter of months.
