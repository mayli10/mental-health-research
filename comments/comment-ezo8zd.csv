I'm up from 98 lbs to 125 and I feel HUGE already like I struggle with how much weight I've gained but my hunger has no off switch. It's a shit trade but I'm healthier like this.,False,False

The way to help stop that would be to eat normal meals like before you started restricting which can be really hard. Idk your situation or your struggles so I’m sorry if something I said was triggering or made you feel uncomfortable or invalid.",False,False

It could technically be considered a binge, but if you were restricting the entire day, or have restricted for a period of time, and then finally eat something it’s natural for your body to want to get the energy it needs. If you feel out of control and like your are eating past the feeling of fullness and more into pain then there is concern. But if you feel full and then stop eating then I wouldn’t be too worried. Would suggest spreading out the food intake so that you eat throughout the day rather than in one sitting.",False,False

So I suggest that you listen to your body and just make sure to eat balanced meals, making sure to include fruits and vegetables of different varieties if possible, give yourself a little treat often (aka: “fun foods”, some suggest eating a fun food daily, like maybe a dessert, it’s really up to personal preference), and you should be good. Listening to your hunger cues &amp; your fullness cues is extremely important, feeling full is temporary and doesn’t mean that you binged,  Binging is when you eat, in one sitting(or if you’re like me 15-30 minutes of walking in and out of the kitchen) past the feeling of full &amp; discomfort and more into the realm of pain.",False,False

Huh.  Tho it takes me 1200-3000kcal to ever feel full so I'm confused. Is this extreme hunger??,False,False

It could take a couple of weeks, it could take 3-6 months, it really depends but the end result will be that you return to having normal hunger cues.",False,False

The way I like to think about it is that the body has only one thing that it wants to do and that is help you live and survive, it wants to protect you and keep you alive. So extreme hunger is perfectly normal and once your body feels safe again you will be able to establish normal food intake. It’s apart of the process of healing your body so don’t get scared, binging feels a lot different from extreme hunger, if you are constantly hungry then it’s extreme hunger and you don’t have to worry. If you eat and feel full yet continue to eat past discomfort/pain then you should probably talk to someone about it, but since you are recovering from ana, I think it’s just extreme hunger.",False,False
