Triscuits are delicious, and if you want to stray away from those they have a new kind that’s thinner and lower cal and those seem pretty good. I also love skinny pop rice cakes, they’re vegan and pretty tasty :)   Other than that I’m having a hard time with food rn so most don’t feel safe.",False,False
