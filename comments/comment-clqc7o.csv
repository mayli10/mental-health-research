I feel like the difference is maintaining a BMI of 18 is a ton of work that leads to ED-like habits. But someone with a true ED would get to a BMI of 18 and still feel fat and try for 17.,False,False

I see all these lanky boys and I'm super jealous because they don't need an ED to stay thin. Meanwhile my ED doesn't even succeed very well in making ME thin.,False,False

I secretly assumed they were all ED too but getting close to them I realised most of them didnt like being small.  It's not fair that people eat a lot and dont gain, as well as that they can not eat and barely lose.   If anything I've actually found people that are slightly larger than average size are more likely to have an ED.",False,False

A friend of mine is SO thin and I get so jealous whenever they share photos. But then I remember they barely eat a small meal a day, and that that's disordered, even if they don't consider it as such.

I think society, and diet culture, and beauty standards all endorse disordered eating, even if they like to pretend they don't.  For most celebrities, it's impossible to maintain an underweight body without becoming a little neurotic over your eating habits and your exercise. I don't think it means that everyone who's thin has an eating disorder, but I do think, unless they happen to lead an active lifestyle, they've had to adopt disordered eating habits.  It's kind of like how children of narcissistic parents can develop narcissistic behaviours without being narcissists themselves. People raised in a society that glamorizes eating disorders can develop disordered eating habits without having a full-blown ED.  On the flipside, though, I do think for a lot of skinny people, the only difference between them and someone with an ED is a formal diagnosis. But because they're never diagnosed, society holds them up as an example of how their body type is perfectly achievable for everyone without having an ED, and everyone else is just lazy.",False,False

We talked about eat schedules too and they eat 3x a day?!! They thought it was weird to skip meals/eat inconsistently too.
