Dabbled in fad diets and starving/bingeing in high school. Lost a ton of weight through starving/over-exercising at 20 but gained it back pretty quickly. Full blown eating disorder (anorexia b/p sub-type) at 23. I‚Äôm 27 now. So basically my life has been a shit show when it comes to food from a very young age üôÉ,False,False

Childhood onset is much more common than the public seems to realize. Personally, I started feeling fat and ugly at 7 (I was neither :/). By 8 I had some disordered behaviors that worsened at age 10. Anorexic at 11.   I too had totally forgotten about some of my earlier behaviors. And it was really upsetting when they suddenly started resurfacing these past couple years. How are you doing? I'm glad you at least have your writing as an outlet, but it can be rough dealing with unexpected memories.",False,False

I've always been self-conscious, and one day after feeling guilty for eating too much I had the brilliant idea of simply... throwing up! Wow! I was so amazed at myself, genuinely thought I might have been the first person to ever think of that. I kept doing it for a few weeks, then decided to google it just in case there was someone out there who might have thought of something similar. That got me for good into the ~ana/mia~ world and then I started restricting very low, fasting for a few days, taking loads of caffeine and concoctions of medication (that I'd buy secretly) to give me arrhythmia and boost my BMR (I also always tried to be cold to the point of shivering for the same reason).  I'm very disordered now because this shit lasts for life but I can say that at least mentally I'm way better than I was back then.",False,False

I was a chubby child - because i'm really blessed with good genes - and so was everyone in my family, for the most part. I was mostly raised by my gran til the age of 11/12, along with my cousins, who happen to be very naturally slim and skinny. I don't mean normal slim figure i mean so so skinny that it's almost unnatural, but that said don't get me wrong they love to eat. They used eat incredible amount of food(even for me, a food lover as a child) that i can't even imagine, how light-speed-fast their metabolism must be, and next to them i ate nothing - but looked twice as big as them. And i was always told as kid the phrases we all know too well - ""You sure you wanna eat that?"" -""I think you've had enough"" and i was straight up told i would get fat if i ate a certain amount of food. I would watch my cousins down a whole loaf of bread and full-fat butter with jam at 1am while drinking tea. And things were worse because that was the general vibe of my family - My mother, is dieting as long as i remember. I fully think that disordered eating is genetic from my grandmother - who i feel like was the start of my mothers misery first, and then mine, I love her a lot, she's the sweetest thing ever but i don't think anyone in my family understands how disordered their eating habits are.  Then when i was 12, i was put on a diet by a nutritionist because one of my hormones or something was high(also genetic, thank u very much) and it was a ruthless diet for a 12 year old - even from like my perspective as a person with ana - : i was not allowed to eat anything sugary, no sweets, nothing fried, only allowed two slices of black rye bread a day, no dairy also. no sugar in my tea/coffee. no sodas. It was like a crazy change for a 12yr old child. I did lose 5-6 kgs on that diet and everyone seemed so happy, as if my weight was the most important thing in everyone's life around me. My fucking relatives were invested in this - My talkative neighbor who constantly-to this day- comments on my weight etc. After that i was left alone for a while - not completely but still, it was better than before. I never stopped being insecure though. No one ever taught me body positivity. I didn't know such thing existed.  A few years passed after that, 2 or 3 three. I got a really and depressive episode that summer, during which i was completely turned off and as a result lost my appetite for a few days. When i went back to normal, i thought that i lost some weight, which apparently was true - and i remember this so vividly - me walking in the kitchen in the morning and my gran asking ""have you lost weight?"" and my heart doing a little flutter but just shrugging.  Thing got worse when last year, my mother was on a very strict diet to lose weight - and she did, 15 kgs and everyone was just astonished(and is to this day). Don't get me wrong i'm immensely happy for her, but we all know how irritating it is to watch someone lose weight faster than you, and someone eat less than you. Everyone just commented about how she looked even skinnier than me! the audacity of this damn! it was ""oh you are even smaller than her now!"" ""your mother's winning' etc. i got used to it but it still had an impact you know.  I feel like, disordered eating is so persistent in my life, i would be surprised if i didn't get an ed out of it.",False,False

Anyway, I remember having a pretty... uncomfortable relationship with food around about age 6-11. I hoarded food a lot, had tons of secretive eating sessions, and almost compulsively ate *everything* edible within sight. I remember eating some pretty unsanitary stuff, too.  Idk if it was actual bingeing but it definitely felt yucky and out of control at that time :/  I'm not sure if those two phases were related, though. But EDs in adulthood can definitely be in part due to childhood anxieties surrounding food! So I'm pretty sure that you aren't alone.",False,False

(I was 14 at this point, clearly disordered) 2. I had been trying to lose weight since maybe 3rd grade, I went on weight watchers as a 10 year old, and started to count calories with an ipod touch because I was too young to have a phone. 3. I remember being very young (young enough for my mom to bring my pajamas to a cousins house because we may be staying past 8pm) and eating so much that I involuntarily threw up.
