I use the elliptical and if I'm not burning at least 10 calories a min then I've gotta up that resistance or speed. Then I have to spend my time constantly watching and calculating how many calories I'll be at by x time at my current speed to monitor how many calories I'm burning each minute. The only plus is doing all that mental math distracts me from muscles getting sore. üòÜ,False,False

I typically will do the elliptical at the gym and I have to be burning 10 cals for every minute. So if I exercise 30 mins I need at least 300 cals. If I find myself at, let‚Äôs say, 320 cals at the end of the 30 mins, I will push for 350. If that brings me over in time I‚Äôm like ‚Äúmight as well get to 40 minutes, 400 cals.‚Äù I can‚Äôt even take breaks in my sessions. If i stop long enough to lose my numbers I get really peeved and it feels like that whole workout was wasted.  There have been so many times where I‚Äôve had to pee 5-10 minutes in but wouldn‚Äôt let myself stop til I got to 30+ minutes because that‚Äôs always my minimum.",False,False

I absolutely have to end my rides in .25 increments at minimum (1.25/1.50/1.75)... but prefer to end my rides at an even .00 of a mile. Any other decimal is just unacceptable.
