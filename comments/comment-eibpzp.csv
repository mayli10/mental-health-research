I don't use them too often just b/c it's cheaper to make your own, but they're incredibly convenient to have everything already put together and the portions/cals measured out.  Their split pea blend is really good but a little higher in cals. : )  I'll have to try to 13 bean mix!",False,True

It has lentils, wild rice, beans. 1/4 of the bag makes about 665 calories and it‚Äôs kinda a lot of soup! I make it with 1 cup chicken broth (10)  and I‚Äôll add 45g. Chopped onion and 165g chopped carrots or whatever veggies I want. I‚Äôm going to make it tomorrow without any veggies I think, maybe spinach. But god that stuff is SO FILLING and I love beans. It takes only 2-3 hours of simmering. But it can give you gas so bad but it helps my stomach get moving. Your post makes me want to try lentils now! I‚Äôm always so afraid of things like that",False,False

I also have a recipe that came out very good once and just pretty good a second time. I‚Äôve learned to take notes when I am making it so I know what to do the next time if it came out DELICIOUS. Maybe I will try to make it again now that you mention it. My husband hates lentil soup. Do you know if it freezes well?? Because I think that could be a good solution for my husband not eating his fair share. üßê  Happy New Year to ye and I wish you many days of being satisfied off of lentils. ü•Ç,False,False
