It's probably because I've eaten so much that of course nothing can be shifted in a day haha... wishful thinking.   Ughhh I know how that feels, it's gone up for me before too and it's just like ??? The audacity?!  I'm sure it's your period though, and related to the birth control. Things will definitely settle down, just got to hold on!",False,True

I‚Äôve been eating 800 calories all week and dropped it down to 650 because the scale wasn‚Äôt moving and it went UP .06 this morning. And I know it‚Äôs not the scale because someone weighed themselves after me and it was lower for them.   I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs just my body acting weird because of this new birth control (I‚Äôve been on my period like two weeks and finally stopped) and I‚Äôll be pleasantly surprised later. I‚Äôve never had trouble losing weight restricting so it‚Äôs so frustrating and scary.,False,False
