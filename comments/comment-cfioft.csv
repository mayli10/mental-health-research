My appetite came back with a vengeance at like day 5 last time iirc though, so I‚Äôm trying to eat to avoid that. But also, since my ex left, I realized there was no point to weight loss/my ED. I did this to be perfect for him, and all it did was cause me to lose him.  I met him at 130 pounds and ballooned back up to 150, which I felt like shit at, but tbh, I think he would have stayed with me at 150 pounds if I was mentally healthy. This weight loss feels so pointless now. I don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs gonna happen to my weight now when my appetite kicks in, but I don‚Äôt want to binge anymore. I just want to recover. I can finally say I made it to ‚Äúnot obese‚Äù once in my life, and that‚Äôs all I needed. I lost all my muscle mass and replaced it with fat, and I just give up.",False,False
