Age/aging isn't a trigger for me, but dealing with such intrusive food issues that fuck up my ability to function as an adult is such a HUGE source of shame for me. It's infantilizing. I feel like I'm too old for this shit. I feel like the world perceives EDs as a juvenile issue and admitting that I'm struggling at 26 makes me less of an adult.  My little sister is in a PhD program. I never finished college. I'm a useless fucking baby who never grew up.  How does your age trigger you, if you feel up to explaining it?",False,False
