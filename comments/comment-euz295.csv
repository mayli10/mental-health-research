I wrote to a free ed support therapy group and i think I'll talk to them in a few days.",False,False

Get help so you can have more beautiful memories to hold on to when it is your time. Get help because every single moment, blink, inhale, exhale is so precious. Your life now even in this messed up vulnerable state is precious.  Call your doctor. Make that appointment and they will not only help you keep living but will help you set up to thrive.  Much love because I know it takes courage to ask for help &lt;3",False,False
