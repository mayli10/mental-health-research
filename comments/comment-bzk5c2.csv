I feel like I make a small distinction between ""binge"" as a noun and ""binge"" as a verb.  I can binge on a small amount of calories. I've binged, I'm binging, I will binge, on food that ultimately still puts me at under my maintenance for the day, but I was compelled to eat it and felt a loss of control during. I've binged on pickles, I've binged on Halo Top, I've binged on safe foods. I've probably binged on 500cals of food.  But I would not consider the results of that binging to be ""binges"".  A binge - the noun - to me is at least 1000+ calories of food in a single sitting ON TOP of what I already ate that day. So I can *binge* on anything, but my binge*s* are 2000-4000 calorie clusterfucks of junk food. 500cals would never be *a* binge.",False,False

Agree with above poster that it’s more about the feelings/experience that goes along with it, less about the actual foods or amount of food/calories.",False,False

But for me personally, there is a difference between food that is not eaten mindfully/rushed/unplanned and an actual binge...a binge to me is thousands of calories (and nowadays always purged...)",False,False
