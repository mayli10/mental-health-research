This is something I’ve had to come to terms with myself because my body seems to be extra sensitive to retaining water. I know water weight is the devil and it can ruin your day, but try not to let it get to you too much! Try to really dig into your mind and find that little rational nugget hiding amidst the disordered thoughts that knows you couldn’t possibly have gained fat at your deficit and that it’s water weight you’re seeing and cling onto it for dear life. Now this is easier said than done of course, but I hope this helps just  a bit. ",False,False

It could be because of hormones as well. There is glycogen (which bind to water molecules)!, working out, menstrual cycles, etc. ",False,False
