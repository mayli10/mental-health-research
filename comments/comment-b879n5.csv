This isn't some kind of control or success for me either. It's fear and self-punishment that makes me weird, childish, judgmental, weak, and selfish, more than anything else.  Sometimes it's made me need to be empty to feel human enough to function. Or, it's made me need to be full until I'm afraid I'll rupture. Or vomit until I feel clean.  But I don't get to choose which one. I just find out which breed of nightmare goblin my brain is going to turn me into *this* time when I can't cope.  I make other people self-conscious about their weight, even when I'm only judging myself. I know too much about nutrition, and either my ego or obliviousness make me blurt it out. I don't hide my disgust well enough. I don't hide my anger well enough. It's a grisly, slow-motion car crash of honest reactions/actions/patterns that just slip out and erode relationships.  What hurts most is how the lip service adds insult to the injury of the illusion of control. I've spent years gathering up my fragmented shit, collecting it in a mental box, and sifting through it. I had to keep dissecting the conclusions ""I can stop any time I want"", ""I'm just succeeding at what everyone wishes they could"", and ""it's just my tool to feel better"".   Dissembling them down into their components: ""this doesn't end well for anyone"". ""I want to stop, so if I can, why an I still here?"" ""It's causing damage."" ""This isn't sustainable."" ""You can't trust how you feel about this.""  And then...every so often, someone says something that contradicts all of that. They're jealous if they don't get it, or they're proud if they should get it. They talk about how disorder is about weightlessness and willpower.  And then it just feels like drowning, tied to the bottom of a swimming pool, while I watch people happily swimming laps up above.",False,False

For example, as a teenager, I was put into inpatient for a laundry list of issues, including my ED. The doctors always asked why I did this or that. The actual answer (for me at least) was there isn’t a reason. Fifteen years later, I still can’t articulate why I would hurt myself or starve myself. They liked to bring up the control thing, or because I needed to “feel something” but honestly, sometimes there isn’t a reason like people think there is. It’s just a thing. It doesn’t make it right, and certainly makes it harder for others to understand, but it is what it is.   Fortunately (I guess?) I’ve gotten rid of my other vices. This one is the only one that stuck with me. And people stopped asking, so I don’t have to BS a reason. ",False,False
