I was in treatment from ages 15-20 for bulimia. I considered myself doing well, and could manage a healthy lifestyle.  I got pregnant at 23 and didn’t weigh myself for a year. I weighed myself when I was 3 months postpartum in January 2019. I had gained 50lbs. I have lost that 50lbs this year and no ones questioned my methods except for my husband. I thought I was doing better, but all the ‘look at your curves!’ comments got to me.",False,False

Honestly, I’ve had an eating disorder since I was 16. Check my flair and you’ll see how long it’s exactly been. I’m either restricting or eating a lot and gaining weight. The past year and a half were reallllly horrible because of some personal trauma and I just stopped caring to restrict or workout and ate and drank myself to the biggest weight I’ve ever been. I try to lose weight healthily, but it just leads to calorie obsession and heavy restricting. Even when I was eating “healthy,” I would say I was purging through exercise. 1300 cals a day, good macros, 4 hours a day in the gym. I’d like to get into *actual* healthy habits, but to be honest, I’m still not quite sure what that looks like. I always spiral - in one direction or another.",False,False
