I felt like I couldn’t eat more because it was gross, but once my bf forced me to eat some meals - I was doing wayyyyy better on practice tests. So the night before my MCAT I even went to go get all you can eat sushi! (Lol Ok obviously I just ate some but still progress!) remember your brain burns calories and needs more energy, please try to eat something even if you feel like you don’t need it! Exams are hard enough :( good luck!",False,False

Your brain needs to be 100% during exams. I know it's really hard when your ed wants to tell you otherwise, but trying to study hard with no fuel in the engine is just not going to work out. Eating and being distracted is much better than not eating and being distracted, lethargic, exhausted, worn out...etc  Stick in there! You can do it!",False,False
