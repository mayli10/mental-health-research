You're not an awful monster. I think it's fair to say that most, if not all of us struggle with intrusive thoughts related to our respective EDs. Having these horrid thoughts doesn’t mean we're awful people, but I'd be lying if I said I don't feel like human garbage for deliberately jeopardising my health when my father would give anything to have a few more years with me.",False,False
