I do more posterior work with some core but not obliques. It lowers my blood pressure and heart rate, enables me to eat more calories while still losing fat and keep muscles so I look healthy thinner.  It's just really important you are eating the nutrition to keep up with lifting. Protein so you keep muscle, fat for hormone production, calcium so you don't snap your bones.   Even if you don't want to lift heavy, any weight/resistance training is great for the body",False,False

It’s enabled me to eat more calories and sort of “mold” the body I want.   That being said, i only do isolation movements now (lateral raises, hip abductors, hamstring curls, etc,) as opposed to compound “big” movements (squats, bench press, leg press) because I noticed that my core widened (“strengthened”) a lot when I did the big ones.",False,False
