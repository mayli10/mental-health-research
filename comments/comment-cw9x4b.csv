I don’t know how much it helps, OP, but 8 months of progress isn’t going to be undone in not 3 weeks - it’s hard to get past ED brain thoughts like “i fucking ruined everything like the fat pig I am and now I’m enormous” but I *guarantee* most of that fat you’re seeing in the mirror is water weight and bloat.",False,False

Sometimes I look at math/physics and am just like, ""...I hate so much about the things you choose to be.""   Like in school it similarly pissed me off that you could get As on every test, but get just one F, and your class grade was instantly in the toilet. And then even if you got all As for the rest of the semester, your grade would only come back up very slowly. I lovvved the teachers who threw out one or two outlier tests from your overall grade.  Which is to say, I wish the scale could just fuckin throw out certain days/weeks as outlier tests :(",False,False
