I just want to add a socio-religious perspective. I don't know where you hail from in the world, but if you're from a culturally Christian place - especially one with a ""Protestant work ethic"" culture - you've likely grown up with the assumption that pain and suffering must be ""for"" something. When you suffer in the name of God or your economic future or your diet or whatever it may be, our culture teaches us to consider that pain a moral good. The problem with this interpretation is that ""meaningless"" pain and suffering - suffering without a clear teleological purpose - can then feel intolerable to us.   But not all cultures interpret pain and suffering in that way. For instance, Buddhism portrays pain as an inevitable and relatively impersonal part of the human condition. We experience pain, and may suffer in the face of that pain, but our suffering doesn't carry a greater meaning or nobility or endpoint. It's just suffering. And one of the reasons we *do* suffer is that we try to attach meaning to our suffering, and suffer even more when the universe makes clear that our cycles of pain/alleviation are largely arbitrary.   If you talked to a Buddhist priest, I suspect they'd tell you that you're currently very attached to your ED-related suffering...and that in the long run, you can't live your life either trying to avoid pain, OR trying to enshrine it. Only choosing to be at peace with pain as an inevitability, as opposed to an experience with greater meaning, will rid you of suffering (and help you with recovery).     Of course, I'm not saying that's the answer. I'm not a practicing Buddhist, and if you do practice an Abrahamic religion, I would never suggest your religion's perspective on pain is wrong. But I just wanted to throw that out there, the idea that suffering doesn't have to mean anything or be worth anything - and that that's okay.   ...Which can be a devastating idea to grapple with at first, I know. But it's certainly helped me cope with my ED and its cycles of pain. Best of luck - I know this must be a really hard time for you.",False,False

All the pain and the struggles... they were for nothing. It may be hard to understand because often times with mental illness things feel like choices, but that's not really how a mental illness works. It's not how eating disorders work. When you suffer from a physical illness, like cancer for example, you go through a lot of pain and hardship, but it doesn't help you achieve anything. It's purely a hindrance. It only makes your life worse. Eating disorders are the same way. It might feel like you have a goal you're trying to achieve, but the reality is that you have an illness wrecking havoc on your mind and body. Like with any illness you don't achieve anything by getting better. You just end the suffering. I think it's fair for you to let your suffering end now. It's gone on far too long. Recovery isn't easy, but you have people around you who want to help support you as you get better. I'm sure with their help you can do it. The responsibility still falls to you however. You need to remember that this has not been worthwhile and that no distance you continue down this path  will ever make it worthwhile. Just remember that a better life is out there waiting for you. You have in you to become healthy and to live a happy life. Now is the perfect opportunity to take a new path toward that version of you.",False,False
