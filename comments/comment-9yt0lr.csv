Try psyllium husk tablets or powder 3x a day (Fybogel sachets in the UK) which will help. But you should also see your doctor if it continues. And keep hydrated! ,False,False

It can happen to runners because of the bouncing and agitation by hitting the ground.   Persistent and recurring diarrhea can be a problem. Best to get this sorted. Take care of yourselfðŸ’•,False,False

I canâ€™t remember why it happens but it does happen. Definitely not a fun process but i hope youâ€™re drinking enough water so you donâ€™t get dehydrated ! ,False,False
