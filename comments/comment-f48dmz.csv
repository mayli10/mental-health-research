You don’t need to bar her from talking about all aspects of her journey, but certain triggers like numbers might be a little easier.   I wish you the best of luck- relationships with EDs are hard",False,False

You're probably right we need to have another conversation about what's okay and what isn't.",False,True

I don't feel it.    This is my first same sex relationship (also bi) and I think this is part of the reason I'd always dated men up till now too. I also used to have a boyfriend who was taller than me and lighter than me. Are you me?? Haha   I'm trying. I'm sorry for freaking out. It's just so hard. Thank you so much for your support, truly.",False,True

Which makes it hard to combat this competitiveness. If your girlfriend knows about your ED I would strongly suggest communicating about this with her. If nothing else, it will make it so that the strain it has on your relationship is much less and so this doesn’t fester over time. I’m sorry this is happening to you.",False,False

And that no one thinks you're a whale when you're walking next to her.   But that never works for me either, so I'm going to just say that its a really really shitty feeling to have. I'm bisexual, but a reason I date men (and one I never admit to) is that I never want to compare myself to another woman because I hate my body so much. Even then I've had boyfriends who are lighter than me, which just makes it all worse.   I wish I had actual advice to give, but just know that you are very much understood. It's all difficult to deal with and is not a reflection of truth or reality, just bullshit our brains our telling themselves. Try to be kind to yourself. You wouldn't let anyone else treat you like this, so be your own best friend.",False,False
