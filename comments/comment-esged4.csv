Holy fuck you have a thinner neck than me and it felt really good,False,True

I appreciate the recommendation but I don't think I want to see a doctor about this. I'm enjoying being skinny now - it just feels right some how - like its me. Part of me thinks this is is a bad idea - but and I also don't even care about living anyway,False,True

If you have disordered eating habits or are on the verge of developing an Ed, a place like this can inadvertently push you to become worse. It’s great that you can recognize these unhealthy behaviors early, and I really encourage to seek support as soon as you can. Best wishes.",False,False

Just to see if there’s a healthier route for your control to exert itself or maybe get more autonomy? But also I’m just some chick who also has this shit so it’s not like I know,False,False

Well in that case I do have both of those really - I feel out of control of my life and work right now. I wouldn't say I was exactly abused when I was younger but I did feel like I was neglected - I do need lots and lots of validation now - I crave it. I kinda wanna disappear really - I don't like living really I do like these dark feelings - I feel they make me more interesting as a person.,False,True

You sound relatively young (I’m young too but the ED community is younger), but I’m getting to my mid twenties and I know my ins and outs of how this disease affects me.  Lots of people who have an ED might be in denial of it, but it helps to know, because I encourage you to try and find the root of it. A common cause of EDs is control over yourself (like if you don’t have a lot of control of your life around you, and this is the one thing you can control). Sometimes it can stem from abuse (needing validation perhaps from neglect or wanting to be unseen).   But try and get on top of it as soon as possible because it is not glamorous. Much better to maintain a healthy weight healthily",False,False

I thought you had to be unaware of what was happening or deny whats happening for it to be an ED?,False,True
