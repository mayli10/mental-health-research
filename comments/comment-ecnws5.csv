I do agree that weight and mood comes down to what you out in/out so it’s good to be mindful of other factors affecting all that. Thank you again ❤️,False,True

I’ll also add that I have bipolar disorder and am really sensitive to things that can affect my mood. It did seem to lower my sex drive but that’s typical of hormonal BC and at least it isn’t mangling my genitals.   Adding an extra hormone to your body will subtly change how you feel, but I think a lot of people blame their birth control for weight gain or depression or mood disturbance when the reason you go on BC (long term relationship, medical issue) may be causing those effects too.",False,False

I gained weight on it and it did increase my appetite a bit, but it didn’t cause weight gain like depo provera, and I can lose weight on it without issue—so there aren’t metabolic side effects. It also doesn’t cause the bloating and breast size increase that estrogen bc does. It can cause a slight depressive effect but nothing as bad as birth control pills, which made me extremely emotional.   I had paragard too and really recommend against it. I was in terrible pain all the time, sex was painful, I was bleeding a lot and all the time but my diva cup couldn’t fit with the IUD in there, and the doctors kept telling me this is normal just take ibuprofen. Months later at my scheduled check up I finally got an x Ray and the thing was forcing its way out. I had to get it removed immediately and take Plan B (which is a hormone overload that made me feel like shit). It could have perforated my uterus and caused serious problems. I developed digestive issues and high tolerance for ibuprofen due to all the nsaids the doctors kept telling me to take.  Nexplanon is good. It’s also pretty easy to remove if you change your mind. I’m on my second implant.",False,False

(tmi below)  i actually wanted an IUD and i went back to the OBGYN three times for them to try to put it in but my cervix is just too shallow, like i physically don’t have room for an IUD. so i was originally disappointed that i couldn’t get an IUD but i honestly am really happy with my implant. i haven’t noticed any side effects other than occasional spotting at the beginning but that’s really a given whenever you switch birth control. i was on the pill before i got it and switching really helped my chronic migraines too bc the implant only has progesterone, no estrogen!",False,False

Thanks so much for all the details; it’s very helpful. Honestly I can manage the weight I think with diet and excercise but the mood swings do make net really worried.

I think this is a totally appropriate question for the sub so don’t worry. :)   I was on the pill for 1 year and 2 months and then I switched to the implant. I did not like it to be honest. I got it removed after 5 months (in July of this year) and then took a break from birth control and then went back onto the pill. My implant was called Nexplanon.   Here is how it effected each of these categories for me:  Acne: no change but after I got it out my acne was insanely bad until I got back onto the pill for 2 months.   Mood swings: I think I was more depressed and moody overall. I feel the same on the pill as I do without the pill and I think I felt a bit worse on the implant.   Weight: My appetite and weight didn’t change while I was on it.   Bleeding: I only got my period twice the whole time! I didn’t like this actually. It bothered me and stressed me out sometimes. My friend had the opposite luck and bled for a month straight when she first got it. My periods returned to normal after I got on the pill again.   I really didn’t like it because of the mood impact and it bothered my arm a lot. It would sometimes hurt after the healing phase, especially with tighter t-shirts and it overall freaked me out.   I don’t mean to push you away from it if you like it, this was just my experience. I feel better on the pill :) if you do get it out, I felt like it hurt more going in than out.",False,False

Those 3 months were awful, it was like I could feel and see myself absolutely losing it but there was nothing I could do about it. It may not have been as bad at the time, but looking back I just remember feeling furious and upset a lot of the time.  However, once that initial 3 months was over I felt absolutely fine and I never had to think about it again until I got it taken out.",False,False
