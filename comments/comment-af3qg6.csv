Try to resist purging again, maybe go for a walk instead? It’s a constructive way to offset any imagined surplus and the endorphins will make you feel better. I know that panicky feeling when you feel overwhelmed by what’s been consumed, it feels like having parasites or something, trust me walking makes that feeling go away, even just an hour will do it. If you have time, walk for 90 minutes. Even better, if you can walk in nature, by a brook, in a wooded area, along footpaths etc.",False,False
