My personal opinion is that OMAD is trendy marketed disordered eating and you'd probably feel better if you ate throughout the day but who am I to judge. If you can up your calories to a good amount on your own and don't feel massive anxiety about food/your weight then you're fine, but you didn't really put your whole story so idk. The whole thing about having to gain to a certain BMI in order to be free of disordered thinking I have found through personal experience to be absolute bullshit, so I think at this point it's more about learning how to nourish yourself appropriately to maintain and just being more relaxed and happy about eating.",False,False
