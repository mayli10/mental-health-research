I think people can overreact in the comments not only here, but I see it on reddit as a whole often. People will read ONE venting post about someone's relationship from one frustrated perspective and then flood the comments like ""wow he/she is horrible, you need to break up now this is abusive"" and I just think that's not enough information to say someone is for sure in an abusive relationship (which is a VERY serious accusation, coming from someone who has been in abusive relationships) or they NEED to break up. Sometimes a post is appalling enough or has enough info to indicate something is wrong with a relationship but people tend to jump to overreactions so fast. Often the OPs have not even tried to discuss their issue they're ranting about with their partner, gone to counseling, or taken ANY steps to repair it or fix the issue. If people just walked away from relationships whenever anything went wrong with no communication or attempt to fix it, it'd be impossible for anyone to have a serious relationship. Very few couples are perpetually perfect and never ever bother or offend each other.  People on here especially tend to be EXTREMELY sensitive to comments about weight/body, which is understandable but also means you need to take comments with a grain of salt when complaining about partners. Often times I see people posting venting about an innocent partner accidentally saying something hurtful and then comments treating them like an absolute monster who needs to be dumped asap. Oftentimes men do not understand EDs and can say hurtful things without realizing. Try to keep that in mind and discuss it with your partner if they continuously make comments that hurt you.
