They're natural with no added sugar or salt, taste super rich and satisfying/satiating, and best of all, they come in individual sized cups that REQUIRE STIRRING. So to open a single dip cup and stir it, then savor it, slows me down enough to only have one serving at a time. Plus, it's portable so I can eat it somewhere away from the rest of the packages!
