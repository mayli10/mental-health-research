Sometimes I feel like it is a lot worse, especially when I have been fasting or purging too much.  Like, I start getting so jittery and paranoid that people think I've taken drugs.   But on the flip side, if I've been low restricting for a few days, I feel almost normal. Like, it soothes my anxiety ridden brain to have the sense of control that my ED occassionally gives me.",False,False
