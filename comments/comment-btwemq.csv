Deviated from restricting because I was with family over the weekend and yesterday I had a big dinner as well (Still probably under 1,000 calories though). Today I came home and had a couple of pretzel sticks and pecked at some leftovers and ate a piece of bread with a slice of cheese. My dad had planned to make something for dinner when he got home from work, but I felt guilty and when I got home I texted him that I was pretty hungry and was just going to make myself a sandwich so that I wouldn't have to eat dinner and I could keep my intake below 500 calories. Was beating myself up for giving in and went on a 30 minute run. Felt great afterwards and my mood changed and I was feeling confident and good about my body. I've secured the right attitude to keep it up this week and stay motivated :)   I really enjoy restricting in lieu of social events because it lets me enjoy myself guilt-free, and I light up around people and socialize more.
