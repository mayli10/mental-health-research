Some are knowledgeable about eating disorders and work on harm reduction and try to work with you on eating meals or providing you with relatively safe food options. Others can be aware but ignore. Others can just turn such a blind eye that you can do whatever you want.   It’s basically the same how the quality of treatment and experience depends on each individual ward and the staff at that exact time.   I hope your friend does what (s)he needs to do to be safe. I almost checked myself in this morning and I’m traveling in a far away city, screw the risk, because sometimes being safe for at least 24-72 hours is most important.",False,False
