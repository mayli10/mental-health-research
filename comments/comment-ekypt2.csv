For in-the-moment coping with acute anxiety I do various breathing exercises, and I have phrases I repeat to myself (sometimes as much because I find repetition soothing than because of the actual words).   But for me the bigger issue seems to be addressing why my body and mind have locked into such an extended state of high-alert. My anxiety/worry can seemingly expand to fill any situation. I thought my job was a big part of the problem, but while on disability I tried working part time in a low-key retail position and I was *just as stressed* working the register at an office supply store as I was working on multi-million dollar projects where people's safety depended on me doing my job correctly. (Alas, wherever I go, there I am.)  I'm working in therapy on looking at and reframing my beliefs about myself, my worth, enough-ness, etc. It's slow and uncomfortable, but I feel like it really could be my way out. Sometimes I get a few seconds where I glimpse my day in a new way - a much less stressful way. It's a magical 3 seconds. (""Is this how other people feel *all the time*?!"") Then I lose it and my day seems like a dark labyrinth again, but the fact that I get that 3 seconds is progress and enough to give me hope.  Wishing you the best! I hope you'll find what works for you &lt;3",False,False
