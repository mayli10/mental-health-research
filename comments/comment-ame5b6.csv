But I also have a problem with alcohol, and my sister wrote me a very loving but honest letter about how it was affecting the rest of my family and left it on my nightstand one night and I still think about it every time I see a drink. I don’t know if that would apply, but they both feel like addictions to me so maybe that would help. I think the best tactic is to assure her that you aren’t forcing her into anything, explain that it hurts you to see her like this, and that you understand + are willing to talk if she needs someone. That’s what I would have wanted to hear. I pushed away everyone that came on too strong at first ",False,False

I had a diary when I was going through puberty where I wrote down all my sad thoughts and about things I was doing with my grade school boyfriend and my mom read it.  I still feel violated 20 years later.  I never wrote down my darkest or most intimate thoughts again and I never will.  If your sister is showing signs of her ED—losing weight, having a poor relationship with food when the family is eating together, hearing her gagging in the bathroom after a meal—that’s what you should talk to her about.  It’d be helpful for her to hear about your own experiences with an ED and how it’s been life changing in a negative way.  Be explicit about how making herself healthy is a good thing (if she’s self conscious about being overweight) but starving and throwing up to get skinny won’t make her feel better.  No matter how thin she gets, it will never be enough.  She should hear the reality about how it doesn’t bring happiness to lose weight in disordered ways.",False,False

Big sibling saying “hey I’ve been thinking about when I was your age, kind of silly, but man [age] sucked. Don’t tell mom but I struggled with [ED] and I saw this thing online that just reminded me of it. I really like how nowadays body positivity is really popular, I wonder if I would’ve felt differently when I was struggling. I honestly still feel [whatever you wanna share about yourself]. If you ever feel weird about your body you can let me know and I won’t tell mom or anything. Sorry if this sounds strange for reminiscing like that! I’ve just been thinking about high school now that it’s been a while.”  sorry for my imaginative dialogue but this is something I feel like would make it sound not too weird to becoming out of the blue but is also very you sharing so she doesn’t think it’s about her.",False,False

I just wanted to check in because I care a lot about you and I want to be here for you because it can be hard going through things alone.""  That way she doesn't HAVE to admit to things, but will know someone is noticing and picking up on her behavior...and that makes you a safe person to come to with those concerns since you are indirectly implying similar experiences. idk how close you two are, but it may be worth trying to start a dialogue.

I would read it to her.  So she knows what you went through. That you also suffer(ed) and don't want to see her in the same pain. No not confront her like 'we know' but more in: I want you to know this about me. A good way to help others is creating a bind of understanding, empathy of the common issue. Sharing something is what bring people together and hopefully will bring you 2 even closer.  Also maybe search for professional help, hold to that info, just put it out if she think is ready for it or in bad shape, if not it could scare her. But above all be patient, I know you understand what she is living.",False,False

Obvs your mom shouldn’t have read the diary, but assuming she’s not the type of person to read diaries just for the lols, so she must have already had concerns about this that she was looking for confirmation of. And now you have a 12 year old who needs help.  So you have 2 options as I see it.  1. You come clean about the diary. Apologize and offer her help (drawback is she might be angry about the diary which could hinder the cooperation)  2. You offer help based on the concerns your mom already had that made her read the diary. (Drawback is you’ll have to live with the deceit)  Either way approach it with lots of love and understanding as she must really need it rn.  Good luck ",False,False
