First of all, I can almost guarantee that you didn’t gain 15 lbs/3 weeks. That’s roughly 5lbs/week. That in itself is nearly impossible.   I’m assuming by “eating normally” you mean eating foods that are a bit fattier/saltier than you are accustomed to. That can cause bloating and water retention, and it can be even worse when you’re not used to it. If you’re not used to junk food, eating it will quite literally make you FEEL like garbage.    And let’s say worst case (ABSOLUTE worst case— probably not even the case) you gained like 10lbs. You can lose that in about 3-5 weeks by eating healthy, avoiding sodium, and exercising. Even though it sounds like a while, the time will y.  Finally (and this has helped me so much): don’t weigh yourself. Just don’t. The scale is fucking evil. The numbers change every hour of the day. They’re 100% meaningless. Go by how you feel, how your clothes fit, and how you see yourself. I don’t even let my doctors tell me how much I weigh anymore, I just face the other way and tell them I don’t want to know.   So just take a deep breath, maybe just start planning your meals, write in a journal, etc. just to take your mind off how you feel right now.   You will be absolutely fine. ❤️❤️",False,False
