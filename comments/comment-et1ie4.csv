If you’re fasting for weight loss (which I’m guessing is the case) you’ve already maximised the benefits and your body deserves nourishment. You’ve done so well and eating now is not going to hurt your progress in the least. You’ll feel so much better once you eat. Also the previous commenter mentioned breaking your fast slowly with coffee/tea with stevia, which I use all the time. It’s a good way to get your body used to something other than water, without the fear of calories. Take it slow but you deserve it :))",False,False

I fast and dang it’s difficult, but what you did is epic.  I would start off by having some plain coffee and water and then having some coffee with stevia or some artificial sweetener. That’s how I break a fast, I sorta ease into it.",False,False
