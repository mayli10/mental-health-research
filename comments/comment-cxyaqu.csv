The weird thing about it that I don't get hallucinations, like there are all these drawings where a person sees themselves in the mirror but fat, it's not like that, I look like myself every time, i don't see fat rolls that aren't there or anything. I just *feel* too big, even if rationally know i can't possibly be. It's weird.",False,False
