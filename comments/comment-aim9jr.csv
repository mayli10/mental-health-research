It makes 4 dishes and lasts 4 days in the fridge or freezes really well and defrosts in the microwave in about 8 minutes.  You can cook the chicken breast however you like (I steam it with a bit of lemon) then fry the sliced onion until soft, add crushed garlic and courgette. Cook for a few minutes then add the harissa paste (1.5tbsp) stir in, add tinned tomatoes and drained chickpeas then simmer until courgette is cooked through. Add sliced chilli and stir in chicken to heat altogether, season how you like! It’s in the 300-400cal region per meal, add couscous if you want more carb to bring it to a 500-600cal meal (possible omad?) hope this helps!",False,False
