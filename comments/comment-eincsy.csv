Meat is pretty central to most of my binges since usually they’re just fast food. That’s why this year I decided to cut out livestock and go pescatarian and see how that helps with my binges. Nuts aren’t too big of a problem but the calories definitely add up so I don’t bother consuming them usually and I see why you’d fear them. I don’t avoid fear foods during binges usually.,False,False
