The feeling of potentially harming others rather than yourself can be the biggest recovery catalyst there is. I hope you are able to find your way with ease ðŸ’œ good luck.,False,False

I've purged (hah!) my followers and put it so people have to request to follow me.  Kinda worried that my insta got posted on MPA or something. I'm mutuals/friends with someone who used to be a prominent figure in the 2000's YouTube ED community so that might be it as well.   I'm still kinda upset about it all but it pushed me to eat some fear food snacks at least, which while scary numbers wise, were damn delicious ( I had to tell my ED to stfu even typing that I enjoyed food ).  This was honestly a bit of a wake up call. Being paranoid of dying wasn't a wake-up call but somehow triggering others definitely is.",False,True

I understand how you feel, I don't wish an ED and suffering to anyone, is not something to look up to.  Maybe if you make your account private for a while that can give you some peace to know they are not going to search for you?",False,False

You have a right to share your life with people, and share selfies, but you also have a right to choose who gets to see them. I think going private is the perfect solution here. Please try not to feel bad",False,False

If you wanted to be more pointed you could add a simple watermark that says ""I am struggling with an ED. This is not a healthy goal."" or something over your pics, but idk if that would be better/worse.",False,False

It's NOT your fault they found those pictures and you haven't done anything wrong by posting them online. You're allowed to exist even if you're visibly ill. That said, if it bothers you that other people use your images as thinspo, it might be helpful to go private?  I'm sorry you're in such a bad place at the moment. I really hope you get the help you need. You deserve to have a good life.",False,False
