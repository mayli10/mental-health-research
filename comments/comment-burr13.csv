I understand how awful it makes you feel but you have to remind yourself that you could literally fix this problem if you try hard enough. Don't try to go over the top right away, start small by idk running  for 10 minutes in the evening and then just continue on from there dude I belive in you :)",False,False

I just know it will boost my confidence by so much. If I feel more confident in myself, I‚Äôll be more willing to take risks and go out and socialize, and go to the supermarket, and go out shopping, and this, and that.  If I‚Äôm skinny I‚Äôll have motivation to do stuff. I‚Äôll feel more motivated to take a shower, I‚Äôll feel motivated to put on clothes more. And I won‚Äôt be as scared of it as before.  I know all my problems won‚Äôt go away, but it will help my overall situation.",False,True

My depression and food issues didn't magically disappear, but I could go to a coffee shop with friends, and I could feel ok in whatever clean clothes I grabbed, you know? I know that losing weight won't cure my eating disorder, but it DID bring my anxiety down slightly, and I desperately need that.",False,False

I still can't go outside in nice clothes, I can't meet people, can't buy new clothes, can't socialize, because I am too damn insecure about everything.   I feel worthless and insecure even though I am underweight because it's never enough. I'll never be good enough or perfect to do any of these things.",False,False

After all, if I just sit at home depressed I'll be more likely to eat something than when I'm keeping myself busy. Also, I've considered starting to use some of my skinny clothes (not the UGW ones) because why tf not, I'll look better in them one day but wearing them now too doesn't take away from that.
