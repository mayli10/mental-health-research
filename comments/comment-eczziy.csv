I honestly go out/drink maybe one a week and I’ll have 3-4 drinks and I’m WASTED. I’ll eat something “crazy” like a slice of pizza or a grilled cheese then maybe puke especially if I don’t eat anything before and then feel sick the next day so I basically have a 24 hr fast without even trying. I feel fucking amazing even tho I’m hung over lol.,False,False
