I hate when just a minor thought gets magnified and becomes a compulsion via my ED.  That being said, as a vegan, if you do end up making this transition, please be careful about planning your diet to the best of your ability to gets your essential vitamins/minerals. Technically, the only thing a healthy vegan needs to supplement is b12, but it might also be worthwhile to look into iron/zinc (or maybe just a multi) if you plan to be restricting heavily while also being vegan.
