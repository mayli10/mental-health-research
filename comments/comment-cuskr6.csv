Your doc will try to tell you that you’re stressed, how have anxiety, etc... they’ll give you the run-around, but don’t walk out of that office without a script for blood tests for your TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone), T4, and Thyroglobulin.   I am a thyroid cancer survivor, and this is not something you want to mess with.",False,False

If you've been heavily restricting for months/years before this it's entirely possible for your metabolism to go into overdrive once it starts getting normal/big amounts of food and lose weight on huge amounts. I have personal experience losing weight on amounts this high too and it doesn't last but it sure is strange as fuck while it's happening. The ""good"" news is is there's probably a lot of repair going on which is why you feel tired. The nausea is probably just your digestive system being uncomfortable with the huge change.  If I can make one recommendation it's this, the worst possible thing you can do now is go back to heavily restricting out of 'guilt' or whatever, because that's going to really fuck things up and likely lead to bingeing and a huge weight gain because that kind of irregular eating pattern fucks up your hormones/appetite and predisposes you to gain  (this is what happened to me).  Twice I had what is happening to you right now happen- the first time I went back to heavily restricting and the effects of that made me gain a huge amount of weight in a very quick period of time, I felt sick and starving despite getting bigger than ever, and it was beyond words miserable. The second time I didn't restrict and I made sure to keep eating regular meals and snacks, evenly spacing out calories having at least 2500 calories, and I continued this for 3 months to let my body stabilize, and I didn't gain ANY weight. After the three months I felt healthy and started more safely losing again but because I had taken that time it was much easier and I felt well and lost on higher amounts. If psychologically you can handle doing this it will pay off so, so much in the long run, believe me. A lot of bingeing and issues people with EDs have is because they restrict too low for too long and it just really messes up your body and makes it easy to eventually gain big amounts  I would still recommend seeing a specialist though just to be safe. This honestly sounds like just one of the many weird things that haven't been studied that much that happens to people with long term eating issues, but you don't want to risk it if there is in fact something medically wrong",False,False
