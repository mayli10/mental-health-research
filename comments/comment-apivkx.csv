I donâ€™t like the layout, the features, or anything else about it. It seems that a lot of ED people like it, but I have no clue why. ",False,False

Basically instead of everyone's posts jumbled together on one long timeline like facebook or instagram, you click through people's profiles one by one to see all their updates individually. I prefer it to the conventional system honestly. You can also favourite people to be directed to their profiles first.  The only downside is that it can be a little tricky to tell people apart sometimes, and it gets awkward when one person follows you but you don't want to follow them back because they trigger you or their posts are boring or you don't like them",False,False

It was big in 2016. A lot of people moved there when proED went down. Now peach has been down for almost a week causing panic among us but it's presumably coming back soon. ,False,False
