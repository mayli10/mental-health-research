Every one of my restriction cycles has started with a complete nosedive. Currently trying to find the switch again bc I've literally been at maintenance since Thanksgiving  \^\~\^,False,False

I was googling for hours on end to try and get behind WHY I suddenly became a binge monster after being able to restrict fine for months before. Thats what I found from a science perspective. theres a lot of content when you google recovery related mental/extreme hunger that also gives some info about the psychological aspect of it. Understanding the whole thing didnt make me gain less weight, but it did help me get through it because I realized it doesnt suddenly mean I suddenly developed BED, and I had good reason to believe the phase will pass again on its own if i let go for a while (this was insanely incredibly brutally disgustlingly hard) :)   there are some percs though: My BM became regular again and I do have more energy than before AND most importantly - all my fear foods kind of dont bother me that much anymore currently (this will probs change again)  But again, I don't want to pass this off as official knowledge, its just my experience and what I found out from googling that I could relate to hehe",False,False

But MENTAL hunger - whole different thing. I just got out of a 2 week binge phase where my mental hunger - ie lack of satiety even though my stomach is full to burst - was so strong my normal selfcontrol just didnt cut it. gained 11 pounds (water and food weight included though) and now just started getting things under control again. high sugar, high fat, high carb all the way before.   if you dont even get mental hunger - lucky/unlucky you i guess (depending on your stance towards recovery)  so tldr - physical satiety doesnt need to control mental satiety. leptin &amp; ghrelin are not only controlled by a filled stomach",False,False

Satiety is controlled by leptin, which comes from fat cells, if you starve, leptin levels go down Appetite is controlled by ghrelin, which increases as well when restriction occurs. Natasha oceane has a pretty good vid about it. So losing weight or restricting makes your appetite increase AND satiety decrease  It's not you, it's your hormones keeping you from being a skinni legend.
