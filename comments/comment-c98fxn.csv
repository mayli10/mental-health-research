But I‚Äôm sure you know your skinny friend was speaking out due to her own insecurities. It sounds to me like she might have disordered eating and/or body issues. A double 00 on any woman is considered super small in my book. I have never been able to pull a 00 past my thighs!   I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs still getting to you a month later. Maybe the best thing to do this remember you see that those girls are undoubtedly small, regardless of how they feel themselves, because we are all highly critical of ourselves. It‚Äôs societies standards that make us more critical about this bullshit. That‚Äôs what all this is- bullshit. Before marketing and sales tracking existed, we could at least tune out all of the crap for a while. But the companies now have constant insider access to our psyches and use it to their advantage.   Think about this- I just started daytrading last week. You know what I get ads for all the time now? It‚Äôs day trading website subscriptions, or YouTube channels, or books. I even was sure to use private mode on bing because I don‚Äôt want to be tracked. So now companies see what I want to do and are trying to get me to buy and be even more hell bent on spending money in the market.   I know this sounds hella off topic, and maybe it is. But I honestly think that‚Äôs a major factor. We take in all these messages every day that tell us we lack something, and they tell us in so many ways until we believe them. Then buy their shit. Then all of us believe in it and we criticize the hell out of people and ourselves.   I hope maybe this helps even though I‚Äôm aware of how random my message is. I might have waked and baked haha. But remember you‚Äôre beautiful in ways your friends aren‚Äôt. We‚Äôve all got our strengths is what I mean. Sounds to me like you‚Äôre way less judgmental than the one friend, so that already makes you more beautiful inside ‚ô•Ô∏è  I hope you can recover soon and your username is awesome!",False,False
