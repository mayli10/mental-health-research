She’s at my GW and two inches taller than me. She told me that she had to force herself to eat something, so we went to the food court and had to walk around it twice because she couldn’t find anything she wanted. After all that she decided that there was nothing she wanted to eat, so she just got a hot chocolate instead.    The thing is she’s really picky, and while that’s a trait that really, really gets on my nerves, I really wished I could turn down food like that. What a skinny legend.",False,False
