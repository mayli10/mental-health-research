It makes me laugh when someone binges on like, one poptart and a spoon of peanut butter  Unfortunately my brain always tells me that X pounds of fat gained can be lost with X days of fasting. The good news is that's my way to cope and not immediately kill myself, but I'm also stuck in this cycle and can't ever eat normally. I don't ever purge.",False,False
