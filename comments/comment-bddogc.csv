I recently reached out for help after 20+ years of ED behaviors. A friend who struggles with AN told me that I had to wait until I hit rock bottom before I was ready but now I realize that was really shitty advice. I'm still waiting for a therapist to call me back but I am definitely ready to start feeling better. I hope that you are doing well too.,False,False

I think it comes from this feeling that if I do something about it then it becomes true and real. Like its easy to let it feed into itself and spiral because it is hard to accept mental health problems. But you are 100% right. Thank you.,False,False
