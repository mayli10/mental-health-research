I’m going to enjoy myself, I hear they’ll have Oreos, turkey legs, and all other kinds of stuff. All my friends are going with me so I best make the most out of it.   I’m excited for it and I’ll do my best to make it a good memory. You have a good night btw, and thank you, I feel pretty good about going now. :]",False,True

State fairs only come once a year and who knows what all they’ll have. I never went to mine every year but did last year and still feel upset I didn’t get to try what all I wanted. (I ended up breaking down and crying out of nowhere in front of my family over a lot of emotions including guilt but lemme tell you what I ate didn’t affect my body at all I’m just a baby)  I’m low-key praying I get to go this year because there’s gonna be a bunch of neat new things at mine (pumpkin spice corn cobs, the same stand that did a Mac and cheese in a cone with coleslaw thing that was really popular I really wanted but didn’t get is gonna be back and they have something similar but in a turkey leg and I never had one of those either, Cheerwine hush puppies, etc.)  Funnel cakes don’t taste the same if not made like the way a fair does. I wanted to try deep fried Oreos a few years back at a mini fair but they shared a fryer with snickers. If there’s something you want that has nuts in it then I’ll indulge with you in spirit! I’m allergic to peanuts and the only nut I know I can have is coconut.  It’s just one day of fun in a life that will be filled with many. You deserve it op!",False,False
