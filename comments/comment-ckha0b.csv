I feel like there was a good moral in the episode somewhere but it got completely lost in the fact that Sailor Moon herself is so impossibly skinny. I'm still a Sailor Moon fan, and I would have to admit that the characters on the show are a motivation for my weight loss. I know I'm never going to look like an anime character, but I can look the way that they do in clothes.  It's weird because I recently decided to rewatch it, watching the new dub, and found out that apparently there were a bunch of episodes from the first season that never aired in the version I saw as a kid. Which just made me question, of all the episodes to cut, why was THAT episode left in?? The girl fasts for days and exercises until she faints. I know it was framed as a bad thing for her to do, but again, she was super skinny the whole time.

Zelleweger did an interview after one of the later movies talking about how she hated gaining weight for the role. The interviewer or whoever was saying that it must've been nice to be able to eat a bit more, but Zelleweger was saying that she hated it and couldn't wait to be exercising and losing weight again afterwards.  Looking back on it now actually I'm not sure that's a totally normal reaction either, LMAO.

The opening sequence is weirdly dreamlike in my head sometimes.

I don't remember the exact line, but I know it was definitely less than she weighed in Weight Loss part 1.  Erin has her weight said as 115 on Secretary's Day when Andy is about to sing a song.
