But all I really can afford is like.... low cal microwave meals. And steamed cauliflower rice. That's pretty much it lmao. I absolutely adore the vegan diet though. One of the only things that had helped me actually lose more weight. Although my depression likes to kick in and make things harder. But of course! I've had an ed for the majority of my life so I've learned a few things..but I wish you the best of luck!! and stay strong :),False,False

If I feel I'm plateauing, I allow myself a cheat day or a high calorie cheat meal, it always works and makes me drop A LOT real fast. Maybe all you need is a high calorie intake day?",False,False

You could make a little difference in the way you spread out calories? So instead of like 400, 400,0,0, 400, 400,400, rather 200, 500, 0,0,300, 600,100. Sometimes that helps. Sometimes it's just your body holding on to water weight as mentioned above. And sometimes it could be what you're actually eating. If your 400 calories a day are junk food (pretty much where all of my calories are from lol) your body will definitely hold onto that whereas if it's more nutritional the calories are more being used rather than preserved. It could also be that if you've stuck to the (relative) same amount of calories for extensive amounts of time, your body could be getting used to it. There are many many factors that could cause a plateau. I'd say first reaction should be to just drink a bit of water and remember that your body is going through A LOT. And it's trying its hardest to keep you going. Give it a week and see if you've wavered at all. Just, dont panic. Cause panicking never helps at all. And dont blame yourself for it. You're doing really good!",False,False
