Imo the thing with binges is the loss of control feeling and how you feel physically afterwards, as opposed to the amount of food you ate. 1300 cal is not enough to maintain on much less cause you to gain weight, though you may see (temporary!!) fluctuations due to water retention and the like.  Try to go for a walk or listen to music or find something to distract you for a bit. Its can feel hard but you'll get through this!",False,False

Your body must have desperately needed the nutrition, and for once its survival instinct has won. This does not make you weak, it makes you human. 1000 kcal ""binge"" cannot possibly cause fat gain. 1300 kcal per day is still restriction. One binge does not invalidate the existance of your restrictive ED.",False,False
