At first, i was a little anxious, but ate the american diet, felt a little unhappy with my appearance, but was a normal weight. Then i stopped eating as much, and i was happy for a while because my brain wasn't working right and i didn't feel anxious, and food became the source of anxiety. Then at one point i started to feel severely anxious and would have crying fits for no reason, because i never addressed my anxiety. I started eating again, and I'm back to a normal weight, and i cook random stuff and graze throughout the day to give my mind something to focus on so i wont be as anxious.   I feel like i kind of worsened my own anxiety and i hate that. I say i was normal before with my relationship with food, but i suppose i never was, i always had abnormal thoughts regarding food and bodies.  It seems like i can only go on either sides of the spectrum (not eating, or grazing throughout the entire day) and what you said about meds theoretically helping me not to feel i need one or the other, is what i hope for  Thank you for answerimg",False,True

It depends how you cope with anxiety in the first place; do you lose your appetite when anxious or do you eat more when anxious? The meds should theoretically help you not need to use restricting/and or binging as your main way of coping with anxiety.  That said, I have been on an anti-anxiety med/ antidepressant (Effexor) for 2 years now. I feel SO MUCH BETTER than I did before. Also my weight hasn’t changed from taking it.",False,False
