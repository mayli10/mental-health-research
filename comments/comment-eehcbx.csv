My ED started at 13, body image issues since childhood. I'm 28 and consider myself nearly? fully? reccovered.

I am now 26 (almost 27), and I have no idea who I am as a person. I can only describe myself as boring, empty, dumb. I am an empty-minded shell.

They could be having revelations about wanting to delve deeper into their ED's and they are moving away from the fun/spontaneous pre-ED. Is it romanticised though I wonder?
