I don't need support in gaining weight cause gaining any more would make me overweight (like, actual BMI overweight not dysmorphia overweight). I know that I need support to manage my ED but I want to be like, a normaler normal weight, like, middle of the normal range if possible, but I dont think they'd be okay with me *losing* weight in treatment, ya know?",False,True

It only gets worse the longer you wait. Having support to gain weight is honestly so helpful and the likelihood of succeeding in your own is low. It sounds like you need to go ASAP or tbh you might not make it.",False,False

I'm just so nervous, and I know a *lot* of that is being scared of recovery in general, too.  I've got a cardiology appointment on March 10th and I'm not gonna *not* tell her, so like. I know she's 100% gonna say to get treatment but I'm p much fully committed to like, if she says I should go then I'm going to go no matter what.  The only potential lowered risk is that my job *might*, be willing to be lenient and keep me on afterwards? I told them upfront about my chronic health issues when I applied, and they know abt me having ""doctor's appointments"" once a week (it's therapy, but saying it's cause of the chronic illness stuff feels like it'd make them more okay with the scheduling annoyance? idfk), so if I say something like ""my cardiologist says I need to go to this like, months-long medical thing so they can monitor me to make sure my heart is still okay after some recent health events"" it's not a *lie*, and they'd maybe be accepting of it...? Idk lol. Just am scare",False,True

You need to do it.   Yes, there’s your job etc to consider - but honestly, if you don’t get treatment, you’ll likely have to give it up anyway for health reasons.   Yes, you might relapse again. That’s true for anyone starting treatment. Hopefully you won’t, and if you do it will be acted on quickly by the people around you, but it’s a risk you need to take to ensure you have a good quality of life for a long time to come.",False,False

And I feel bad about it, cause even though I've got all these health issues, I'm not ""underweight enough"" for them to be able to force me into capital h Hospitalization, so all they can do is just sit there and be clearly worried about me and watch me scare myself out of the treatment I really need.  And yeah I really really hope that the treatment helps that worry, and honestly I feel like it improving my quality of life by no longer exacerbating my chronic illnesses would make a *huge* difference. But the fear is just so fuckn overwhelming ;-;  I agree that I really need the help and that I need it soon, I just... I can't figure out how to get past this wall.",False,True

I really need to go *soon*, I agree with that... I'm just scared I'll be right back there soon after. I added this info in an edit just now, but the difference between my current weight and the ""normal"" GW is large enough that it'd take like, 3-5 more months of Losing Weight at an Unhealthy Rate for me to get down to that weight, which is uhh... you know, not good.  I know that being that scared of losing the job seems like it's a bit much, but like. My disabilities and mental health have made it *super* fucking difficult to find a job. I had to drop out of college in fall of 2018 and I *just* found a job literally a week and a half ago. And it's not even like, a ""Job,"" it's a ""job""! Like, I'm working minimum wage at a small local sushi place. It's really not much but it's taken me fuckin forever to get even this tiny tiny tiny achievement.  And I just added this in an edit as well, but IOP and PIP aren't an option, sadly. The closest place that offers either one of them is over two hours away, which is, as you can imagine, a bit far to drive every day lmao. And my local healthcare system (UF Health/Shands in Gainesville, Florida) has *wonderful* mental health resources, but their ED stuff is kinda lacking... I'm looking to see if there's a good ED specific therapist I can see, but that's about it...  But yeah I know this stuff seems small but I'm just real scared of wasting it, if that makes sense.",False,True

You need to find a place that will work with you on all of this.   I understand totally where you're coming from and why you're worried about relapsing, but I would hope that once you were recovering and felt physically more well and were working on mental wellness, this is something that could be dealt with.   It sounds like you really need some help and soon, so I hope you can take those first steps.",False,False

You mentioned starting a new job as a deterrent for treatment but it's just as possible that you'll end up needing to take time off from work for your coexisting physical problems that have been exacerbated by your ED.  Have you considered an outpatient program at the very least?,False,False
