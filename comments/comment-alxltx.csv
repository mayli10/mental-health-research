I forget how expensive health care is outside of Australia (I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre in America?) so I hope you can pay your boss back soon and get to an appointment! Just look after yourself in the meantime üíï,False,False

Only problem is I had huge hospital bills and my boss, bless his heart, is paying the last 350 of it, and I'm paying him back through my paychecks. So he has me working A LOT to make up for it. Like 11 am -10 pm one day. So I dont know when I can make an appointment",False,True

My doctor, parents and therapist know I have ‚Äúeating issues‚Äù but because I haven‚Äôt been diagnosed with anything yet (because I hate talking about anything emotional/personal), I feel like it‚Äôs not really a problem. It‚Äôs the same reason I won‚Äôt weigh myself because if I end up seeing that I‚Äôm underweight I feel like I‚Äôll have to deal (??) with my issues and acknowledge that I actually have a problem. Idk if that makes sense but...  If this helps, just from reading what you wrote I‚Äôm concerned about you and it sounds (in my very unprofessional opinion) like you have an ED. Please please try and see the doctor, at least to check that your health is as ok as it can be! I know how scary it is to acknowledge and face that you have a problem and I‚Äôm probably a hypocrite because I still haven‚Äôt gone to the doctor and got tested for any problems (but reading this post has motivated me to book an appointment). Sorry if this is a rambling reply as I hardly ever comment on Reddit but I saw no one had commented yet so I thought maybe I could help... Anyways, good luck! I hope things work out :)",False,False
