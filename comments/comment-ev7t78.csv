Maybe it’s the paranoia in me, but I’d be wondering if he was telling the truth about the numbers to either a) make me feel better and b) try to trick me into gaining more. I think it’s weird af that he says he’s going to weigh you and check on your weight. Unless you full on agree to this, I’d tell him no.   Even then, if a scale is a trigger I’d still say no. If he wants to help y’all should talk about ways to do that without weighing yourself, etc. If he’s trying to help, that’s awfully sweet, but there are definitely better ways to go about it.",False,False
