She was full of shit though because she’s a type 2 diabetic and definitely didn’t seem like someone who eats one bagel a day. But whenever I would have a snack or a meal (during my 8-hour shifts) she’d always say shit like “oh wow you must be really hungry” or “oh you’re having lunch? I haven’t eaten all day I’m not even hungry”,False,False

What a weird attempt at validation.  Not entirely the same, but I love when people say ""I'm soo hungry, I haven't eaten all day"" and then I'm like ""really, nothing at all??"" and slowly they remember they had a protein bar for breakfast....and half a sandwich at lunch....and some chips, lmao.",False,False
