I was in the gifted program, had friends and was happy. Then my parents divorced and my mom's mental health went down the drain and she married a very abusive man, and my mental health went down the drain too. My parents still see the bright kid with potential even though I haven't been successful in a decade and dropped out of college basically immediately. I don't see friends or family almost ever because it usually involves food, and when I do I'm checked out the whole time panicking and disassociating.  Im sorry you're going through it too. I don't know how to be better honestly, all my shit is so intertwined and messed up.",False,False

I was enrolled in all honors courses. I was involved in several academic extracurriculars and spent a lot of time hanging out with my friends, which often involving boba and cheap sushi. I was rather social and became somewhat recognized on campus.  I mean, nothing *really* changed after I became disordered except that I would obsessively track the calories the few times I still went out with my friends. I became reclusive. I would skip school for days in my worst times. My grades dropped significantly. My performance in my extracurriculars became embarrassing, especially being in leadership positions. I ended up barely getting my diploma and not being allowed to walk for graduation. That was fun.",False,False

I have always been guarded due to the walls I’ve built but I just want to do something impulsive once in my life. I am such a control freak that I once tried to impulsively dye my hair blue but chickened out because I started to overthink the things that could go wrong. I am 22 and haven’t even kissed a boy or even held hands with one because I am scared that it’s all a cruel joke( this stems from some guy in elementary school who said he wanted to be my valentine but then said sike because I was the chubby girl in school and then went it laugh to his friends about it). I don’t let anyone past my fortress that guards my puny, weak little heart. But I really want to love and be loved. That feeling is inescapable and I constantly ask myself if there’s something wrong with me, but the truth is I just don’t allow myself to see the positive regard others have for me. I run away from my feelings but their fast and always on my heels.   I find myself thinking far too much about food and then getting mad when I want to be the complete person I was pre-this raging mess. I truly forgot what it’s like to only think of food whenever you’re hungry. I forgot what it’s like to view food sans morality clauses. No one really gets it either. Unless you have the ED, there’s always this mild frustration around stupid Ed behaviors. My mom is literally a clinical psychologist with a doctorate and everything and even she doesn’t truly understand how this disorder used to control me more than I did it. She would get frustrated with a lot of the self sabotage and she really could t do anything to save me at the time.   I developed this mess around 11. The weight loss wasn’t noticeable until I was 12 and it wasn’t medically catastrophic until I was 13. Looking back. My childhood ended way too early because my innocence went out the door before I was old enough to have a period. I am have a good family and I don’t worry about money. My family takes care of me, but sometimes I feel envious of the girls that were in my class that got to experience the normal teen life. Going to pool parties, drinking punch at the school dance, falling in puppy love.   I totally forgot what it’s like to be normal. This is my new normal and I will never be the same girl I was before getting sick, but I can build a new me and that’s my goal for this year. To stop letting these thoughts eat me up and just be the alluring girl I have always wanted to be by participating in hobbies that are healthy and doing things that bring fulfillment to my life.",False,False
