I was once purging in a shopping centre bathroom, to my shame a disabled bathroom. It was a particularly long and difficult purge. I was struggling to get started and as a result it became noticeable. When I did finally start the process of throwing up. It became a long and noticeable affair.       As a result, a knock came on the door. “whats going ‘n in there. Open’ Up. What you doing in there.” To my eternal surprise the security guard opened the toilet door. Only to see me hunched over a toilet bowl of undigested food.   This is were the story gets a little meta. The security guard was someone I had grown up with.   He looked at my surprised face and said “Sean you throwing up…..” He looked at the vomit in the bowl and then looked at me. He smiled and said, “night on drink ah.” I stumbled out a yeah. He closed the door and told me to finish. I just gathered up my things and left.   We walked to my care and I made up a story about being hung over and feeling sick from the session the night before. To this day, I wonder do we have so many undiagnosed issues in Ireland due to our lacks approach to mental health and addiction.   to err is human.",False,False
