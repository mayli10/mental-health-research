I think its exactly that, dont want anyone else to go through it. I get really really anxious when I realize my dads going to bed only eating 1000 kcal  cause I immediately think ""OH SHIT THIS IS IT HES FALLEN INTO AN ED"". Of course, he always does fine and eats well the next day, hes just eating based on hunger which is a ridiculously foreign idea to me",False,False

There is this tiny, rational section of my brain that realizes how irrational I am about certain subjects. But it gets drowned out by the large, loud, irrational, terrified section.  It’s very strange, almost like the rational section is some outside observer to the chaos. And also, sometimes invalidating. Because recognizing that I’m being irrational and doing stupid, irrational things anyway makes it feel like a choice.  But in the moment, it never feels like a choice.  My therapist basically says that giving into my irrational thoughts is a bad coping skill to ease the anxiety. And that I have to not give in to the thoughts to train my brain to stop defaulting to bad skills. Easier said than done though.  I’m not sure if any of that made sense. But brains are weird.",False,False

Literally “gained” 6 pounds from yesterday. Yeah yeah I know it takes 1300 calories of surplus to gain a pound of fat, BUT MAYBE I ATE IN MY SLEEP. Where did it all come from?! Water weight my ass.
