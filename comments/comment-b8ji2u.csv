Reading through this comment has been a turning point. I feel like I’ve exhausted the online resources on recovery/rebound weight (although folks who reply to my posts do offer helpful insight I can’t find elsewhere). It’s just that I’m so consumed and overwhelmed by shame/guilt/confusion/you name the emotion... it feels like grief — I’m mourning a body I was just finally starting to feel somewhat comfortable in. but I achieved it through self-abuse, so it’s probably best that I accept this inexplicable weight gain as — like you say — the natural, remedial response. I’d like to just continue aiming for decent nutrition and rest, but my fears are amplified by the fact that I’m in a high pressure, intense environment, where no one else is overweight or even unfit. I think I internalize the stress of different demands and it fuels my ED and poor self-image.. your advice makes a lot of sense, and i do believe it’s what I need. making that safe environment to heal is the hard part. I’ll try to at least manage my anxieties and be kinder to myself (also hard).     I am so sorry for filling this comment with long ramblings, but your response truly got me to reflect and confront what I was avoiding. finding the “right way to eat” is simpler to me than dealing w what got me to this moment. It’s just hard to let myself feel anything more right now. but thank you so much again for reading through and replying to my rambles with attention and empathy — it genuinely makes a difference. &lt;3",False,True

I also take metformin for the insulin resistance. ,False,True

I’ve been desperate for some sort of direction/guidance that takes into account my variables, so I really appreciate your giving it so much thought.    I haven’t gotten a formal diagnosis for the gastroparesis yet but I think at the very least I’m dealing with poor gastric motility (eg. the intense bloating, discomfort/shortness of breath after eating, etc.). I’m thinking my restriction paired w c/s and b/p might’ve messed things up. it could be a vagal issue, but I will try to see a GI doc to confirm.    low carbing has worked well for me in the past so I’ll take your advice. separating from the calorie counting is the difficult part for me :/ but maybe it’ll actually make me less anxious and prone to binge? at this point I’ll try whatever’s been successful for others w my similar situation. I’ll be cautious and try to hold off on the fast, but it’s so helpful to have your explanation of it.    your closing words hit me hard.. I have **so much** anxiety 24/7 surrounding my changing body. I guess I thought i could recover more quickly, but I can’t give up on trying to nurture it properly.. having those words come from someone else however is what I need. so thank you again for a really meaningful response.

I've been going around here probably contrariwise to the rules saying that the golden rule is to eat for nutrient density. Counting macros MAY be useful, but if it causes you to become anxious, don't bother counting. This sort of rule is naturally going to steer you towards things like eggs, meat, fish, cheese, liver, and nonstarchy vegetables. The calories per gram is high but you don't need to eat much to feel full because it's all protein and fat, not carbohydrate (which for some people has an orexigenic (makes you eat more) effect).",False,False
