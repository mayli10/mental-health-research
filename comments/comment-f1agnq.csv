In the past few months, I've let myself eat pretty normally. If I want sushi, I eat sushi. If I want a 10 piece chicken nugget from McDonald's, I eat those damn nuggies. If I want a salad, I'll eat a salad. And if I want a damn milkshake, ya girl gets a damn milkshake. Yes, I still restrict but it's getting better every day, I don't deprive myself of the things I want.  And I don't look any different. I feel better on most days, my skin is regaining some color, my hair doesn't look *as* thin (it's still pretty thin but it's looking healthier), my heart isn't hurting as bad, my joints aren't aching as often, and I'm not miserable because I'm withholding cravings!   You go eat what you want and I can *promise* you that you're not going to ""balloon up"" like your ED says you're going to. You're going to feel better and happier :)",False,False

I stopped tracking my food and eventually got a healthier relationship with food. now I eat breakfast lunch and dinner and occasional snacks and I have gained basically nothing (~2lbs) compared to what I thought I would gain. my body feels so much better after stopping the restricting and b/p:ing that I did many times a day. sending you all the support and love &lt;3,False,False

Im slowly starting to increase my daily calories from high restriction to maintenance and towards gaining a bit and its very rough and rocky and hard. Im constantly convinced im going to overeat one day and never stop and end up 400 lbs. this helps so much. I want to stop feeling weak and tired and completely obsessive over food and be like that. A goal to work towards and encouraging words like this really help.,False,False

I attribute about half of that to stress and exercise, but it just goes to show that control *really* is an illusion.   for the record, i'm at a healthy weight now- with conscious effort i've managed to get back up to 18.5 BMI, and while i *feel* like i look different, it's only noticeable to me. it's okay if your bones aren't prominent at every angle, and it's ok if your stomach folds when you lean forward. your body will do what it's meant to if u care for it i promise",False,False
