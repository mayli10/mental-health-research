As someone who purges, fasts, heavily restricts and has _major_ binges (diagnosed with EDNOS),  Bingeing, even regularly and a very large amount of food ≠ BED. It can, but don't diagnose yourself with it as almost like a punishment and to show just how ""bad"" your binging is. It's just as credible as any other eating disorder, and it is not better or ""worse"".",False,False

This post makes my invalidation stronger and yes maybe not everybody who thinks it’s a binge is actually struggling with BED but also can we please not invalidate each other?? I have gotten plenty of that and it’s really hard for me.

It's called ""reactive eating,"" and it happens as a biologically-driven response to ACTUAL PHYSIOLOGICAL STARVATION because, you know, at some point your body will fight really hard against sustained deprivation.  I mean yeah, it looks and feels like a binge, but when you're in a state of famine this is really a  sucky kind of survival tactic from your body that drives you to eat.

I get a little frustrated because the binging problem is the reason I'm medically obese. I lost a lot of weight in high school by starving myself and I just got congratulated because I was overweight and had only managed to get to a normal weight. It gets so confusing. Because I'll like, fast and restrict for days or even months, and then eat like 3 times my maintenance in one day. Or maybe even more since I'm small in stature and don't count in binge mode. It's like mindless shark feeding and the food in my pantry is a tiny drop of blood in the water. My weight hasn't been steady in a while, but I've never been thin, so when I admitted my AN-type behavior to a doctor last year she brushed it off and congratulated me on the weight loss.   I feel like it's hard to find support for literally any ED until it's far too late, because we're all so different in how we express the illness.",False,False

I might be closer to EDNOS too because I restrict enough to stay a normal weight despite binging, y'know? (EDIT: another thing i noticed is that i only actually manage to lose weight when i'm in a good place mentally and diet in a healthy way) To me it's about what's going on in your head. I binge because food is an escape from depression and anxiety. People with restrictive disorders usually binge because they haven't been eating enough.  My irritation came when people at healthy weights who would binge up to say, maintenance, acted like they had BED. The binging isn't the disorder there, it's a restrictive eating disorder that makes you feel out of control when you eat a healthy amount.  So yeah, mindsets",False,True

I've been told that I might have some form of bulimia even if I don't throw up.
