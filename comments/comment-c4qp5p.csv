But it has gotten a little easier the longer I do it. It's like all that noise in my brain is quieting down and I can focus better.  You'll get there! Just keep reminding yourself the reasons you are doing this. Literally write down any positive aspects as they come up. It helps.  ðŸ’šâœŒ,False,False
