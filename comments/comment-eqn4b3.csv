When my ED first developed, people blew it off &amp; ignored it... and that definitely didn't help in the long run. I think an important thing to try to get people to understand is just how serious your ED is, so that they can try to support you. I know this sounds weird, and it'll definitely be scary to share so much, but maybe consider writing a letter? It could be to your therapist, mom, dad or all of them. Tell them exactly how bad your eating has gotten. Tell them how you feel. Tell them you are worried and have an eating disorder. tell them you need help. And I understand it may feel like ""I shouldn't even have to do this"" but it has nothing to do with you or the severity of your ED. People are incredibly naive about eating disorders, it scares them and subconsciously they'll come up with any excuse to explain your appearance/eating habits/etc before the idea of an ED would come to mind. It seems obvious to you, or me. But that's because we understand eating disorders. We have eating disorders. The general public really does not. Sorry you're feeling so unheard. I hear you. Please stay safe",False,False
