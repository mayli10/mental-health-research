Especially if it continues. I just don’t want you to be in pain :(   If that’s not possible try cutting down on caffeine and see if the pain persists - if it does you can rule out caffeine as the cause. It might be vitamin deficiency like someone said but I don’t think that would cause pain. I really hope you find out what’s up so you can fix it. ,False,False
