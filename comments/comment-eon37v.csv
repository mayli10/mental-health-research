No worries tho, cause I'm still 10kg away from that :))))))",False,True

Iâ€™m less than 4 pounds away from my original gw (which is a really healthy weight for my height), but my hell brain keeps trying to get me to go lower and lower and tbh I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll be able to stop once I reach underweight ðŸ˜•  I hope things work out well for you and that youâ€™re able to get help and recover ðŸ’•",False,False

Now I know I would want to get help, but it has to be just when I reach my gw :) which I know might not happen and I'll still want to lose more. Hopefully I'll be sane enough for that lol",False,True

Unfortunately, thereâ€™s little he could help me with because I wasnâ€™t ready to recover, but a good dietician can be really helpful if youâ€™re actively trying to recover. It might be worth looking into dieticians who are experienced with EDs and know how to help someone who has disordered eating habits.",False,False
