I may finally have it all down: it'll consist of coffee with half and half (maximum a cup a day) which will be where the entirety of my carbs come from - 10g, a lot of fat in that as well, and a tbsp of MCT oil along with magnesium and potassium supplements for electrolytes and some salt in my sugar. This seems perfect. My brain will be up and running during long classes and cravings should be curbed, as well as increased energy during the day.
