Birthdays are always hard for me because they remind me of how much life I've missed out on because of my shit. I'm working on it now and maybe by this time next year I will be in a better place and not so stressed by a birthday,False,True

We are quite a mixed workforce with close bonds. Every birthday a cake would be bought or made. On my birthday every February the women who worked as the cleaner would always make me a cake for my birthday. We had a close relationship and I valued her friendship. So each year I would eat a slice. It was a gesture of love and I appreciated it. Then on my lunch hour. I would go for a walk. Hoping to burn off the calories from this oh so small slice of cake. Eating is my own personal hell.    I am 35 years old, male, an engineer. I don’t eat in front of my colleagues and hate attending work related dinners. I have had issues with food since I was 14 years of age. I hate the fact that cooking and baking has become so fashionable. It seems to have bled into my work life. Colleagues bring cakes and dishes to work. It’s like a narcissistic arrogance. The food is not for my enjoyment but their own sense of achievement.    My advice, remain calm, even though people seem to think it’s acceptable to group guilt people with food.  In any other situation it would be identified as bullying and it would be socially unacceptable.      All you can do is politely say “no thank you.” There is no point making excuses cause it’s not about you and your comfort it’s about their narcissism and sense of self-importance. “Oh have a piece of the cake I made (or bought) it is delicious.”      I am working through my EA problems and working my steps to get healthy. I am trying to establish healthy eating regimes.       Don’t fear it and don’t let the cake define your day. Just politely thank everyone and explain you will have some later. If needs be. It’s hard when you are recovering or living with an EA cause food is seen as an acceptable gift. While if you were a recovering alcoholic no one would dare to think of offering you a drink on your birthday. Remember though a supper pressurized moment it will pass quickly and everyone will get back to work and move on with their day. Have a great day. Don’t forget pressure is how diamonds are made. Shining sparkling and tough.",False,False

Except, for once, I allowed myself to eat. I still exercised that day, but I didn’t regret eating it. I felt even.. happy? People I knew surprised me. I didn’t know they were going to do that for me. At first, I refused to eat it. But then I felt touched, because my sister went through lengths to prepare the celebration for me and even got the cake from an expensive place. I even slipped and said, “I can’t eat it” and I got a reply “It’s your birthday, just eat it!” And I did. Because the cake was given to me by my sister. I allowed myself to eat it and didn’t feel guilt afterwards.   Happy birthday💗 please take care. I hope you have good days and years to come. You deserve more happiness than you think!",False,False
