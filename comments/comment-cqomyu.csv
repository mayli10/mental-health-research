Don’t know if I’ve had Woolie’s Slimmer’s Choice things, I’ll see if I can find those.   Clicks has really become obsessed with stocking sugar-free things too, which I’m making my way through...",False,False

But the sugar-free jam here is pretty crap, they don’t have decent broth powder, low-cal dairy-free ice cream is a fantasy... And in general there aren’t a lot of options.   &gt;   &gt;At least alcohol is cheaper and sugar-free tonic water is pretty ubiquitous these days lol  There's Sugar Free Pudding/Jelly too, it's called Simply Delish - It's vegan and sugar free, very low calorie I think (26 calories = 19gr which is one serving) I also really like the Nutritech Vegan Protein Power that is high in protein, low calories (115gr per serving, Protein 25gr) and it's really good. I also like anything Woolworths Slimmer's Choice. They also have Seaweed Snacks.",False,True

Some of my go-tos so far are the little boxes of sugar-free jello (bonus: they’re vegan), the pre-packaged veggies from PnP I can toss in a microwave easily for 100–150 cals, and rice cakes.
