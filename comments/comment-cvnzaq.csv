That’s not healthy or normal, so you’re eating is disordered.  I personally believe that *specific* eating disorders like anorexia, bulimia, orthorexia, and EDNOS are purely medical tools to describe how someones disordered eating is manifesting at one point in time, and so they’re not useful or relevant outside of a clinical context, as disordered eating behaviours and attitudes are dynamic and highly individual.   All that matters is that you’re struggling and you deserve and need support.",False,False
