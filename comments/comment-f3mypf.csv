It’s hard but it’s things like this that really make life special. In the past my strategy had been to focus on enjoying the time spent with my ex. You don’t have to eat heaps - I wouldn’t count calories but generally just chose stereotypically lower calorie menu items when eating out (e.g. eggs on plain toast, salads, stir fried, protein and veg, wraps), shared desserts and snacks with others. Maybe go for walks together or something active like bike riding? Enjoy your weekend together, I’m sure you’ll have a great time like you deserve to.",False,False
