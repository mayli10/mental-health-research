Whether they're slim thick, regular thick, or literally obese as long as they're hourglass or pear shaped it looks absolutely beautiful to me. I watch a lot of plus size fashion channels on YouTube and I'm very jealous of their bodies.          But I'm only curvy when I'm underweight. I have really big hips but when I gain weight it goes straight to my waist and fucks up the ratio. Doesn't go to my butt, thighs, boobs...just my waist and my ARMS (Ugh!?! Rude?!?!).  So when I gain weight I'm JUST fat.            It's really bullshit lol. Anyways yeah I feel you. Big girls are super cute. Not me tho. No thx.",False,False
