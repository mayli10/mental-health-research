Most of the images on these subs are girls at such a low BMI that they should probably be hospitalized. Yet we constantly have to worry about ED subs being quarantined or removed. According to reddit, sexualizing being underweight is fine but talking about the behaviors that go along with it isn‚Äôt.",False,False

Not that this helps my dysmorphia that much but maybe a smaller silver lining.  The thing that helped me most was getting of social media as much as possible. I realized instagram was just fanning the fire and was so unrealistic you cant even compare yourself to it.,False,False

But it would be so laughable for me to walk out and show my bf, because he can see perfect bodies in any sort of clothing whenever he wants. Why would he want to see my dumbbutt standing in the kitchen spilling out over a garter belt it took me ages to get into.  It's embarrassing. You want to act sexy too but it's like... He can literally see anything and has likely seen everything. He has an ingrained image of a sexy woman in his head and it's not me.   I wish there was a community where I could put on my stupid expensive lingerie and show other girls, and we can all share our normal bodies in cute stuff to each other with no judgment and no perverts and no men to impress. I've always wished there was a resource for seeing regular women in lingerie, I think it might help some women understand what's normal.  There's plus sized everywhere which is awesome! And then there's very thin, also awesome! But not much in between. No cellulite or scars or rolls either. It's to the point I feel like a monster for having those when I'm not supposed to.  This surely didn't help, sorry. But you're not alone anyway.",False,False
