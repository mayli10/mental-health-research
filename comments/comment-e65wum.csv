Others think it can be fierce and edgy. I do not think anyone automatically thinks that short hair equates to being fat. If anything, I believe that it signals that that individual is secure in their personal appearance.  I have had short - and I mean not even jaw-length short - hair due to donating and it does take a lot of confidence to do and wear - you go OP! Let the world see your beautiful face and confidence!",False,False

I’m 5’5 and my hairs to my waist rn. I’m getting it a little below my shoulders but a pixi or bob would look fine too. I think short cuts are very flattering and slim short/average height people down a considerable amount.,False,False

So much fun.",False,False
