Most don’t think of it as working out but I think it’s a good way to exercise because it’s sustainable. It’s therapeutic because you’re outside in nature. Sometimes you get to see wildlife. Its not distracting like working out in a gym since there are very few people. It’s not as strenuous as running so you can go further. Or if you want to make it strenuous, you can do steep hikes. And it’s really satisfying if you do a hike with good views.",False,False

Running burns a lot of sugar, it depletes the muscles of glycogen. But walking burns glycogen and body fat at a 50/50 percentage so if fat loss is the goal, walking is great.",False,False

Then I do 15 min speed walking up hill on a pretty steep incline on the treadmill.  Its perfect because it gets your heartrate up but you can adjust your pace.,False,False

It burns loads of fat, just as much as running without the exhuastion. I usually sprint/walk around my neighborhood in the evening, and it doesn't make you more hungry like running and weight training do either so that is a big bonus for me. I do spinning and yoga as well, but only a couple of times a week.",False,False
