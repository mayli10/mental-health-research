Just tell them it's making you have diarrhea. When I was on Prozac for a long time I had no side effects, and after a few years I started having OD side effects, starting with runs, ending in shaking, puking, dehydration, etc, ask your Dr to help you find either a lesser dose that still works for you, or a different medication! I ended up switching to another brand, no ill side effects yet.",False,False

From what I know adding more fiber is useful for both constipation and diarrhea--though there's also different types of fiber so maybe do a little googling and see what's typically recommended. Of course it's best to get it from your diet but they make supplements for a reason.,False,False

I never thought to try that. The calories are pretty negligible too and it may help give my digestion some cushion üßê I‚Äôll give it a try! That‚Äôs a helpful suggestion thank you :),False,True

I have IBS which causes diarrhea, and my GI and physical therapist both recommended that I use something like Benefiber. It's a lot of guesswork in terms of how much to use, but it's pretty harmless so you can increase the amount/number of times per day you use it if it isn't working. The instructions I got were to use 1 teaspoon 1x a day, then move to 1 teaspoon 2x a day, then if that didn't work to try 1.5 teaspoons 2x day.   (note that I haven't actually started using fiber supplements since my symptoms have been pretty manageable lately)",False,False
