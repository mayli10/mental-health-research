I don‚Äôt eat breakfast or lunch. I eat a snack around 3 that‚Äôs usually under 200 cals, then dinner after I get home from my run, and it‚Äôs always fairly small because I really don‚Äôt get hungry anymore, then a snack about an hour before bed. Typically this is under 1000 cals for the day, but I prefer to split it up over a meal &amp; 2 snacks cuz I hate eating a bunch at once and feeling full.",False,False

Chipotle bowl w/ some chips? Looks normal if you get one bowl and one thing of chips, but the more you get the more they look at you weird.  Vietnamese place with the best fuckin vegan stir fry on the goddamn planet? Easy 1400, super filling, and too expensive to buy two lol.  Vegan pizza place with a personal pizza? Literally *e x a c t l y* 1500 somehow. Dunno how they managed that.",False,False

Pretty much it works for me only because my stomachs shrunken and I have little to no appetite the rest of the time. Not enough to bring me to eat anyway.  Also honestly I get high a lot. So I kinda gap out after ‚Äúbinging‚Äù for half an hour. Appetite pretty much goes away",False,False

Never below 1000cal and I cannot skip it. I struggle with binge/restrict cycles and big food guilt and OMAD is actually helping a lot. I'm trying to just ballpark calories bc I'm trying to get away from the obsessive mindset too, and I eat anywhere between 1000 to just above maintenance. This is the first time I've gone without a binge in 2+ weeks. I get the urge but it feels really dull and I know I'm about to eat a big, nourishing meal soon, anyway, I can wait. And when I don't binge, I don't feel guilty, and I don't need to restrict. My binges were rarely on actual food or meal-stuffs and more on every snacky thing I can shovel into my mouth by the handful. I still eat the snacky foods, I just have them in one or two portions as a side during my meal.   I eat at around 6pm every day and usually don't feel hungry until about 5:30. I've never been a breakfast person anyway so I just swap out lunch for a meal that actually makes me feel full and then I don't have to think, guilt, or obsess about food for 23 hours.",False,False

Ah fuck it"" but with OMAD I know I'm going to be eating all day so resisting all other food is super easy, and because I am emotionally prepared to eat, and hungry so excited to eat, my meal ends up being a pleasant thing. Plus I know I've had exactly 0 calories and I want to stay stay at or under ~1000, which is actually a fuck ton when you are having a salad, a main dish, and something else (usually a yogurt for dessert). Yes when I binge I can easily put more than 3000 cal in my stomach... But idk with OMAD I get the pleasure of eating a big quantity and still knowing I'm technically restricting. It almost feels like I'm cheating at restricting but my counts and progress speak for themselves.   Long story short, all this seems to come together to give me more emotional control than a binge. It's planned, it's happily anticipated, it's real food not snacks and garbage, and it's like the tourist experience of binging at the calories of restricting. I guess it ticks all the boxes and I have an easy time avoiding the shame/hunger/desperation spiral that typically makes me bingy.",False,False
