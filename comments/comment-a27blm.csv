I looked and neither have a medical policy.  This means that your physician likely just needs to show it is interfering with your day to day life and that outpatient treatment would be insufficient. They'll fill out an authorization form, attach clinical notes and send it off, and they'll approve a certain number of days for inpatient treatment. You may need to try outpatient therapy first. What you might want to do is request a referral from your physician, who will then contact the inpatient facility and work with them to get it approved.  It looks like there is no weight limit for these plans. ",False,False

What insurance do you have? I can look up their medical policy. Generally it's like 25% below expected weight but expected weight can be like your regular baseline. It's not necessarily 25% under 18.5.  It's actually more up to your doctor.  I work in insurance stuff so I can help. ,False,False
