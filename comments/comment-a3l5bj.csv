The ones I hate most are the shoulder ones.  Bones remind me of a chicken carcass.  STILL feel the need to lose weight, but the fact I think my body looks disgusting (and I actually think women who look softer and with curves look hot) really brings to home that THIS IS A DISORDER and fuck all to do with wanting to look good.  They're really uncomfortable too.  It'd kinda be better if skin was really thick and didn't need a layer of body fat to cover bone.  Felt revolting at a higher weight, feel revolting now.  Where the fuck is the middle ground?  Honestly though, when I see others with EDs with visible bones, unless it's being used for bragging, I don't feel revolted because it's an illness in the same way I wouldn't think someone looked a freak if they had a bald head because of chemo.  I'll never understand bonespo, but then my ed isn't wired up to want that.  You're not gross.  I'm not gross.  The disorder's fucking gross.",False,False
