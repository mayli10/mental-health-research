It's just baby fat. Of course, nobody told me that when I was younger. I was in cross country and other sports so I was very in shape, but bc of baby fat nd being a ""late bloomer"" my ED and body dysmorphia started up. I still struggle now, 6 years later )-:  I saw your other post, and your feelings are definitely valid and we are all here for you. Its terrifying, but open up to your parents. Ask them to help you eat healthy and maybe ask them to do workouts with you. At your weight (aka very healthy, and thin) if you see something you dont like, it's due to body composition. So, working out and increasing muscle mass could help you out. I hope you get help and dont let yourself become consumed by your body image like so many of us here. It's truly hell",False,False

We often don't have control over our ED but at 13 years old you would only just be starting or in the middle of puberty. Your body is still growing and settling into itself and poor nutrition can permanently alter how your body develops. If you focus less on restricting (if that's what you do) and more on eating a balanced diet - lots of different kinds of vegetables, lean mean, fruit, plenty of water - your body will develop well and probably give you a better fat distribution/body composition.  Also, I do weight lifting and I have a flatter stomach at 121lbs than I did at 115lbs a few years ago when I was only doing cardio. ",False,False

Everyone's thighs flatten out when they sit down because they're soft. The only way they wouldn't is if you had solid, inflexible legs, like bricks. Imagine a sack of flour being held up vs being put on a table and how different it looks. It's just gravity.  I don't know what your eating habits are like, but your stomach can look bigger due to bloating, having just recently eaten, and from salt retention/water weight. All of those things are totally normal; the appearance of people's stomachs shifts over the day, it's just natural. On top of that, I doubt your stomach is even that large. It's just how we see ourselves.  That said, if you have lost weight lately, you can lose it first from unusual/disproportionate-feeling places, like your limbs, because they are less vital to your body's survival so you will lose from there first. After some time at your new weight, you will adjust and your body with recompose itself.  Look after yourself okay!",False,False

Next time you're at a pool, see if you can catch a person with a 6 pack sitting. Even they get a bit of a roll. ",False,False
