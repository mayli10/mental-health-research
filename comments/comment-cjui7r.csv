I have a great family and I feel disgusting for it. The only “traumas” I’ve ever been through have been my dad dying (which I got over in like month) and getting bullied (happens to everyone).

I think there's some whole psychology thing, snowplow effect yada yada that boils down to: humans are meant to struggle. a bird in a cage, being fed regularly, is living a ""good"" life, right? as good as we are, in its own way. but a percentage of the time they'll start pulling their feathers out. why?   our lives (""our"" referring to the general first world population) are almost too easy. having an eating disorder is an easy way to occupy your time. if it wasn't for the fact that we hate ourselves and are ruining our bodies, having an ED would be a great hobby. it gives us a sense of purpose and achievement.",False,False
