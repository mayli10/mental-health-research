I’m all for people being motivated to loose weight but I don’t think they should feel embarassed along the way. (And obviously everyone is different so what motivates one person may not motivate the other).  Congrats on taking up therapy and I’m glad you’re getting help :),False,False

And they have a lot of wiggle room. But as someone who avoids roller coasters after realizing binging almost daily made it UNSAFE for everyone else. It's safety. And im UNSAFE to ride. It sucks. But it's a slap in the face.   If I ever want to ride the coasters at Michigan Adventures with my nephew again I need to drop at least 95 pounds to get back to my high school weight. It's a real slap in the face. But in some cases, it's much needed. I accepted it and took steps toward therapy again and finding the underlying reason to my unhealthy relationship with food. CICO and some fun exercise. Im glad I was embarrassed. It kicked my fatass into asking for help.",False,False

For some reason, this specific ride has smaller chairs/restraints. I don’t know why they built it like that, but it’s my fault I couldn’t ride it, not Universal’s. At least that’s the way I see it. The whole part about this that sucks more is, what was my first reaction when this happened? I wanted to curl up in bed, watch Netflix and eat. Thanks brain.",False,True

Do you think it would be beneficial to give feedback to Universal Studios about what happened? Hopefully no one else has to go through what you did.,False,False

There were people looking at me though when I was sitting in the seat and the girl was pushing on it - she wasn’t lightly pressing on it. This wasn’t in a back room either, but right in front of everyone standing in line. And then when I got up out of the chair, my group kept urging me to try it anyway because “it worked last time.” That’s when people were judging me.",False,True

I used all the disabled sections for rides when I went to Universal because I tend to pass out just seeing a rollercoaster (no joke) and I had to wait with the VIP guide there whilst my husband enjoyed the rides lol (It was for his birthday).",False,False

For the rest of the day he and one of my friends kept saying “we can do whatever you want!” They would let me cut in line in front of them or let me have the better seat kind of stuff. Stuff they wouldn’t have done normally, but I guess they felt sorry for me. It made it worse. I felt like a freak exhibit tagging along. They kept wanting to ride more rides and I didn’t want to, had to make stuff up like “oh my motion sickness...I’m not feeling well...” when really all I wanted to do was ride and laugh and make good memories - like what we were doing up until we got to Harry Potter. I’ve just never wanted to melt out of my skin more.",False,True
