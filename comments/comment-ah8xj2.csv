Lower or upper abdomen? Do you have ovaries?  - Lower right: appendicitis, go to the hospital quickly   - Upper left/right: could be ovarian torsion or an ectopic pregnancy (if you have ovaries &amp; have had sex recently). You'll have to get bloodwork done to diagnose I think, so go to the hospital if you suspect either of the two could be the cause. I don't really think so since you say it goes away fast, but if you press the area and it hurts like a bitch, it could be  - Towards the back: kidney problems. Hospital, IMMEDIATELY  - Middle/anywhere else/also any of the above: could be really, really bad gas. I say this unfortunately from experience, twice in the past 2 months I've gotten gas so, so, SO bad that I thought I was dying. The first time it took hours to lessen, I was at the hospital and they were testing me for ovarian torsion/ectopic preg. and couldn't seem to find any evidence. Left after 6 hours still not knowing for sure, but by morning it was gone. Then earlier this week it happened again, but only took maybe an hour to go away.   Also consider constipation, which can happen if you haven't eaten anything with fiber in a while, or anything at all. You may feel this close to your butt or maybe stomach area, so around the middle of your torso but further down, and front or back depending.  ",False,False
