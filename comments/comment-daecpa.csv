Your kidney’s failing? Fast? You broke your foot? Fast. Your wife left you for a mcchicken? Fast. Easy fix to hard hitting problems,False,False

I think that for those people who medically need lose 100+ lbs to be healthy that water fasting once or twice a week will reteach them that hunger is okay sometimes. That they can even be hungry all day and still be okay.,False,False

I think it’s terrible that people actively do this as extended fasts. fasting for three days (or even just one day) solely for weight loss and not religion reasons is so bad for your body and it should not be glamorized like it is now in the health community.,False,False

The fasting community thinking is just nuts. They'll say in all seriousness: Restriction bad, water fast good. IF good, Extended Fasting = better. It's just nonsensical because how is it better to have no food at all versus some food? If you so much as mention to the fasting community that IF/OMAD/EF is just CICO, they go off their tree. They don't understand maths or science well at all.  The IF movement and my desire to lose weight and to be socially acceptable while doing it is what made it possible for me to cross that bridge into fasting and now my ED has never been worse. And I can look socially acceptable while I do it because I'm fat. No sarcasm intended. It's mind boggling.",False,False
