Honestly though, even when I do fully recover, say my TDEE is 1500..that's like 1200 a day + dessert. Obviously, if you browse over at r/1200isplenty, you'll see that everyone complains about it not being enough.  Okay, fine then. So I'll eat 1500 Calories a day of healthy food...but wait..that means no dessert, 100% clean foods, and we're back to orthorexia/ED behavior.   If I ate a single, fucking cinnamon roll with a glass of almond milk, that's 700 Calories, and that gives me 800 Calories for actual food for the day...that's literally two meals of clean food for me.  Honestly, I think when I do recover, I'm probably going to have to keep my treats to once or twice a week and eat at a slight deficit every other day of hyper clean foods. Which, I love hyper clean foods, so I don't mind, but the issue is, is that really recovery? Probably not.  I have other theories like, sort of intermittent fasting (eating like a light, 200 Cal protein bar for breakfast and splitting the rest of the Calories for a bigger lunch and dinner), or perhaps varied meals (500 Cal pizza dinner would involve a 300 Cal slice of pizza with a giant, 200 Calorie salad [most of the volume would be from lettuce, and the 200 Cals would come from a couple, healthy toppings like nuts, olives, fruit, and/or meat). But besides that, I honestly don't know.",False,False

Like when I'm with friends and they're hungry and they pull a single granola bar our of their backpack and eat it and they're satisfied. H o w. Or I'll be at marching band camp and they'll provide us with a snack in the morning of like, one of the small bags of chips. What is the benefit of eating this? Does this really do anything for you people besides just make you want to eat more? What is your secret?",False,False

This is exactly why i volume eat and most of my fear foods come from the fact that i can't eat much of it. I *could* eat a nice thick chicken parmigiana topped with crispy bacon and slathered in gooey mozzarella cheese *but* because it would be so high calorie, i wouldn't be able to eat much to stay under for the day. Why would i do that when i could have more of a lower calorie food for the same amount of cals? It's honestly one of the main things holding me back from fully recovering.",False,False

I don't want to have 1/4 cup of ice cream or a single slice of pizza, which is what I would consider a reasonable, acceptable amount. I know it will take all the mindfulness &amp; deep breathing in the world to be satisfied with so little. Therefore, I'd rather just not — it's not worth it.  What this means in practice is that I haven't had ice cream or pizza (or dairy or gluten or junk food in general) in over two years. All or nothing = NOTHING. Ha.",False,False

Personally, I don’t feel like I need huge portions all the time but there is a certain level of satiety that I need to feel like eating was worthwhile. Something that helps me not binge or have overly large portions of things that are unhealthy is eating bulky vegetables prior to the really yummy thing. That way I get to have the thing I want without overeating and still get that full feeling. It really helps me cut down on feelings of guilt.",False,False

I used to be able to have 1 slice of pizza and be okay.

I HATE throwing up so much) was after a particularly terrible pizza binge. Your policy sounds similar to my family's informal policy too, but I really don't feel comfortable these days eating three pieces of pizza. Don't get me wrong, I'd love to eat the whole thing (see above), but I won't even give myself the opportunity to make that mistake these days.",False,True

One piece is not enough, unless I'm also having some salad or something along with it, in which case, one piece is a normal portion.    If it's just pizza, two pieces is a normal portion.  Whether I feel satisfied by two pieces is irrelevant.  Two pieces is a normal portion for every woman or child.  Three or more pieces are okay for a man, but too much for everyone else.  I devised this Pizza Portion Policy when I was about 6, and have never deviated from it (unless bingeing, in which case all logic flies out the window, but I don't binge pizza much because purging it is so horrible.)",False,False
