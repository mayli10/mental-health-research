I also have very few friends after my best friend, who was like my twin and I used to always talk about dieting and social stuff and boys with, dumped me for being a ""bad influence"". When that happened (in October), I was so insecure I kind of stopped socializing altogether for a while. But recently I started taking prozac (under the guidance of a psychiatrist) for depression and bulimia, and I've been taking as much time as possible for self care during my winter break. Shopping, new hairstyle, home facials and brow-dos and long baths and such. In addition to high-restricting with extremely healthy food instead of low restricting with shit food/purging all the time. It sounds weird, but I've kind of fallen back in love with myself, which is an amazing feeling I haven't felt in so long, and it's made it *so* much easier to focus on/appreciate the friends I do still have and get excited/comfortable getting out and socializing again.   Big recommendations: *talk to a professional*  if at all possible. It may feel kind of shitty to have to hire someone to hear you vent, but friendships are so fragile and people are so flakey that you don't necessarily want to dump all the really deep issues you may be dealing with on any new friends and risk overwhelming them. Talking to someone who's actually trained to deal with these issues is a massive help, and although it may be painful at first, you'll start to feel better. If you're depressed, they may even recommend treatment that could be a huge help to you. Try your best to take care of yourself, because it's easiest to attract other people when you're happy in your own skin. Finally, I also have an obsession with watching ED-fueling online videos (except for  me it's Amberlynn Reid because I feel like she embodies my irrational inner obese person), but remember that what you take in is what ends up filling your thoughts/personality. If possible, try watching more uplifting or even just neutral stuff in your free time.  :)",False,False
