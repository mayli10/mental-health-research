I think when youâ€™re warm/hot your heart rate slows down to preserve energy but when youâ€™re cold your body expends more energy trying to warm you up. But Iâ€™d double check that because Iâ€™m not a science person.  BUT ALSO, please please no one do anything silly like purposely making themselves cold or putting themselves in a dangerous situation just to burn a few extra calories. The calories burned would be negligible and the risk is way too high. Youâ€™re much better off just being consistent with food and exercise than trying crazy freezing techniques. ",False,True

If you're mountaineering on rough terrain you can burn up to 1000kcal/hour. Maybe not 1kg/day but maybe like 1lb/day can be doable in Canada or something? ,False,False
