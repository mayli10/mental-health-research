It's so difficult to explain to people who know my about ED about this. To them, it seems like I'm continuing to walk deeper and deeper into this vicious cycle for pity points and validation, but that's further from the truth. I know it's killing me. I just don't care how unhealthy it is. This is all I have. It's all I'm good at. I trust the voice more than anyone and it's doing its best to help me. Even though logically I know it's bullshit, I don't care. I contemplate suicide everytime I look in the mirror. I don't care anymore.",False,False

Almost like it’s an integral part of my identity, and the moment I feel the anorexic part loosening its grip in favour of the bingeing part I feel extremely de-validated (lmao is that even a word?).  Also, it kind of comforts me and makes me feel “superior” (? literally why lmao) as if I had some kind of secret nobody knows about but me.",False,False

I love all of things associated with my eating disorder. I love being secretive, I love throwing up, I love feeling empty and floaty and clean.

The trade off for how it feels to be thin and the attention I get and way I am treated is worth every second I starve. Maybe I will tire of it in the future, but for now being beautiful is exactly as wonderful as I pictured it to be when I was ugly. It is like a superpower.",False,False

And worst part is that I love all the fucked up bits about it — the vomit, the laxative abuse, the lightheadedness when going from prone to standing up (which I’ve affectionately dubbed “open world cell loading”), when people say I look great and that I’ve lost weight, when people say I’m skinnier than some of the young teens passing by and I shouldn’t lose any more pounds — I relish it.

Like I’ll wake up and see 3 pounds gone from the scale and nearly shit myself from happiness (like that could actually happen lmao).  But then there’s days where my stomach hurts so much and I literally have to crawl across my floor to make it for food.  Then I eat and feel bad and restrict again.  It’s a vicious cycle that, while it physically hurts I hate it, but when I feel comfortable (watching tv, at a party, etc) then it’s great because it makes me feel skinny and proud.  It’s visceral and honestly only one of us is gonna be left standing by the end of it.  My bets are still on me, but I def don’t want to go into recovery yet  I fear for when I’m gonna see my mom again.  I haven’t seen her in about a month or so, and if the little old Korean shop owner noticed my significant recent loss, my mom will for sure",False,False

Until recently, I always told myself I'd never tell anyone about it because it's my safety blanket that I don't want taken away. I recently told my doctor (because I need to be validated) and supervisor (because I felt alone in my struggle), but I by no means am ready to give my ED up. I sometimes think I couldn't ever recover, it's been with me too long.",False,False
