The normalization of forcing your kids to eat their vegetables pisses me off so much. It is possible to dislike healthy things, please as a parent find a solution instead of doing this.

I went from eating everything to never eating any vegetables. My parents would harp on my CONSTANTLY. I wasn’t allowed to leave the table without eating the vegetables and there were days I’d sit there until bedtime. I had such terrible issues that just putting them in my mouth would lead to me gagging and sometimes vomiting. I don’t know why or how it started but as an adult I STILL can’t eat most vegetables and if I do they almost always have to be raw. I feel ridiculous even admitting this but it’s processed in my head like a trauma even though it sounds silly now typing it out. I just remember feeling so out of control and angry and confused as to why everyone made such a huge deal out of it. To this day my family will watch my plate and make fun of me for picking out things I don’t like from meals.,False,False

He’d force me to eat whole plates of foods he knew I disliked, while screaming directly in my face.  Sometimes I threw up in fear.  Sometimes he made me eat the vomit.

But, the thing they did that fucked me up the most was that I would only get fed if I was “good” that day. B it my bio mum has severe mental health issues and a heroin habit so “being good” was something that the definition of changed daily, and was highly unattainable due to mental illness logic. That being said, to this very day I feel like i only deserve to eat if I have “done enough” for the day/was “good” that day. This means waking up at 5 am and doing housework all day, exercise to burn at least 2500-3000 calories, etc, and if I don’t do everything that my brain tells/expects me to that day, I feel like I don’t deserve to eat. Also, (my s/o is extremely supportive of me and doesn’t try to intervene with my issues, just to be supportive regardless of where I am) I can’t eat when I am home alone during the day and only once my s/o comes home and says how nicely I’ve cleaned the house and etc. If I even fall short of one (1) task that I told myself I would complete that day, then I feel like i have to restrict so hard until I can “do better”, because I see all food as a reward for “being good”. As a child, if I didn’t do good enough that day my parents would eat in front of me and eat my portion while verbally degrading me, and etc. There’s a lot more to this story but I think it’s probably really upsetting for others to read so I’mma just stop here. Sending solidarity and support to you, friend. Abusive parents are the literal scum of the earth, you didn’t deserve to be forced to eat nasty foods.",False,False
