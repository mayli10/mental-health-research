It made me dumb. Like I forgot my phone number, age and pet's names dumb. I work a very technical job that requires me to memorize a lot...and my work suffered so bad I had to stop.   There is hope with some vitamin supplementation to combat the ""dumb"" though. I think someone posted about it recently in the migraine sub. Deffo check them out. Everyone is really nice and has been through the trial and error. Search the sub first tho, you will find TONS of topamax posts since we've almost all been on it at one point.   Also, I am so fuckin sorry about your diagnosis. That must be absolute hell. Hit me up if you need to talk about it. I've had migraines for 16 years now. But I hope you find some relief soon. ðŸ’—",False,False

You'll probably be fine, but I am glad to hear you have a good support system looking out for you just in case. I hope it helps you! ",False,False

My weight stayed the same, but the side effects were hell. I was tingly all the time, I sounded like an idiot every time I tried to talk, and then one day I woke up and my teeth were so sensitive I couldn't brush them and I felt like they were all going to break off even with eating soft foods. I didn't have a migraine, but my mouth hurt so bad. I also got severely dehydrated even drinking 100 oz. or more of water each day - my kidneys were starting to hurt really badly. I think Topamax can really help some people but to me, it's poison. I'd never recommend it. Even though I've been off it for almost 2 years, my teeth are still way more sensitive than they were before Topamax. I don't think it's worth trying because the side effects are literally the worst.",False,False

Turns out what you experienced only affects 1% of patients. But I did already warn my husband and mom so they could be on the look out for what you just described. Iâ€™m sorry that you went through that. ,False,True

I was on the highest dose, twice a day, for six months. At first, it was awesome: fewer seizures, no migraines, I was waking up at 7am (I am not naturally a morning person *at all*), I wasn't hungry at all, and I felt giddy all the time.  Things got worse gradually. Food and drink tasted weird. I would lose my train of thought in the middle of a sentence, or use the wrong words without noticing. I couldn't remember my name. I went to work and forgot to wear shoes. I couldn't make simple decisions. I would forget where I was going while driving and get lost. It was like my brain just stopped working. It got so bad that I had to taper off, because it was getting dangerous.   I don't know if the side effects were so severe because of my body chemistry, the very high dose I was taking, or some unknown reaction with the changing cocktail of prescriptions I had to use at the time for various other health issues. But I strongly urge that you (or someone you trust) is aware of the potential side effects and can keep an eye on you, especially long-term.",False,False

So I didn't lose any weight but a lot of people do. My roommate is on topamax for migraines and has lost a bit of weight.,False,False
