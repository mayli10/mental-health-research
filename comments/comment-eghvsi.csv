Also having needs and recognizing them is a nightmare. I‚Äôm currently trying to work on asking for things and seeing that there is a difference between having a need and being needy. And like I know my therapist is right and long term working on all this nonsense will help me but I hate it so freaking much... it feels like I‚Äôm weak if I ask for help even though I‚Äôd never begrudge someone else for asking for it? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  It‚Äôs a whole mess. Probs has to do with my childhood or maybe with a deep seeded belief that I do not deserve cared? Idk I‚Äôm not going to figure it out while back at my parents house for Christmas break. But there‚Äôs at least a solid 4 hours of ugly crying in there somewhere.   Anyway some people do really well with FWB, if it‚Äôs the right person it can be really good and fun üòä",False,False

I feel like asking your sexy friend if you look hot every now and again is pretty much the same sort of vibe as asking normal friends if you look good? Idk I know it gets complicated sometimes but it sounds like you‚Äôre good with the boundaries and are in a friendly place with him so it‚Äôs just asking a pal to share their opinion and that‚Äôs not too too needy right?   Idk I really struggle with thinking it‚Äôs needy to ask for literally anything (like I could be dying of thirst and would still feel like a needy bitch if I asked for water) so I‚Äôm not the best judge but I think it‚Äôd be normalish? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",False,False

I‚Äôm pretty sure that he finds me attractive, I‚Äòm just so starved for some nice words and honestly I hate that my brain wants to get them from him specifically... I think it‚Äôs because our relationship is so physical so he would be the ‚Äûexpert‚Äú when it comes to my body, since body dysmorphia makes it so hard for me to judge myself objectively. I know it‚Äòs far from healthy if I‚Äòm honest with myself.   It‚Äòs a different story when you‚Äòre in a relationship, and I think you did something very good for yourself and your relationship by talking about your needs with your boyfriend!

Everyone does, ED or not. I think asking for it is totally acceptable. I recently went through a whole thing with my boyfriend where I told him I needed more from him, and he's gotten a lot better at expressing attraction to me.  Simply saying ""Hey, I could use a pick me up. What do you like about my body?"" Is perfectly acceptable.  The other thing though is you have to be able to recognize other ways he's showing you attraction. He wouldn't be sleeping with you all the time if you weren't attractive, watch the way he looks at you. I bet he watches when you take your clothes off, I promise he's enjoying it. He wouldn't touch you and try to please you if he didn't think you were a goddess that deserved it. There are more ways to feel validated than hearing it out loud.  Ultimately though its up to you to feel good about yourself, it isn't fair or productive to put that responsibility on anyone else. But asking for a boost is totally fine and totally normal.",False,False
