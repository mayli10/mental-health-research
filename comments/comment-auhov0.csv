But apparently if you do ingest an extremely large amount of calories in a short period of time, your body does not digest all of it. So I think 7000 cals then fasting would make you gain less than two 3500 cal days. And I’ve noticed the same thing, binging and fasting seems to make me lose weight faster than eating an average amount everyday ",False,False

When you constantly eat, you spike insulin which doesn’t allow you to enter into fat burning mode. ",False,False

If you eat 7000 calories over the course of a week, (for fat gain/loss) it won't make a difference if you ate 1000 calories per day everyday vs eating at 800 calories per day for 6 days and then eating 2200 calories on the last day.  You may see the scale jump around depending on your sodium/liquid intake.  This is actually my preferred method of eating. I will eat 200-700 under my calorie goal for 5-6 days of the week and then on the final day I will let myself eat a portion of the calories I've 'banked'. It helps to deal with days like tomorrow where my boyfriend wants to go to the buffet.",False,False
