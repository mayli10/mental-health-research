So I guess this embarrassing overshare of a post was some kinda good omen or something, haha. Of course time will tell if it actually becomes regular again or not...and I will be talking to a doc about it, but yeah!  I was actually surprised at how encouraging it felt! I think the only other times in my life I’ve been that excited about a period were the times when I *had* been explicitly worried about a risk of unplanned pregnancy, lmao. Made me feel like maybe there’s some silver lining to be found in me currently being a fat ass again aka “recovering” and fucking it up real bad, like maybe I actually am less malnourished at least? ??  Thennn I got turned away from donating blood because my hemoglobin was too low (which was honestly surprising because I’d been binging on fuck tons of iron fortified stuff), and that nice assuring feeling flew right out the window. But maybe it’s something I should try to hold on to? To some extent? Idk.",False,True

There are loads of other reasons you could lose your period and it’s worth getting them ruled out for peace of mind. Mine is booked for April 🤞🏽 ",False,False

It took about 2 years into recovery to get my first one back. Any eating disorder that messes with your nutrition and stress will change your hormone production, so it doesn't matter if you're this or that disorder.  Have you been checked for PCOS? Poly cystic ovarian syndrome, I was diagnosed with that when I brought up the hormone issues with my doc, could be worth looking into. They said mine was caused by my anorexia 😔",False,False

That is a great and very reasonable question in retrospect, hahaha, but yes. I probably should have also mentioned that I’ve had sex literally once this entire time and have confirmed that I’m not pregnant. More than once. Thank God. 😅😅",False,True
