Plus I'm a volume eater. So it's really best for me to wait until the end of the day. I get by by drinking lots of tea, coffee, and/or seltzer.",False,False

I eat a high carb diet b/c I'm a cardio junkie, but unless I'm being really active first thing in the morning, I get an unpleasant appetite spike if I eat much carbs with breakfast. No matter how healthy they are.  So if I'm not, I usually just have eggs/meat/etc for breakfast. Often my breakfasts will top 70 grams of protein. Then the rest of the day, I eat mostly complex carbs, and feel totally satisfied.",False,False
