I *especially* won't buy it from the tap at McDonald's or whatever. What if the cashier messes up my order and gives me the regular one without realizing it? What if he realizes that I have an ED and tries to give me the regular one either out of kindness or just to troll me because he's that nasty? What if my tastebuds aren't able to distinguish between diet and regular anymore?,False,False
