After a certain number with every kg I lost I hated myself more and more and I couldn’t look at myself in the mirror. I was disgusted by what I saw. It’s weird bc I actually liked my body more when I weighted more. Hitting my ugw was horrible, I wasn’t feeling happy or satisfied at all. More so depressed and really anxious about what I did to myself. There‘s no number on the scale that‘ll magically make you happy and love yourself. That’s just something that your ed is trying to convince you of.",False,False

At first I thought maybe it would be nice to weigh X amount or fit in whatever pants size, but I just kept getting smaller and smaller without a firm end game. And then one day I was &gt;!92 lbs!&lt; at 5'5"" and had never felt worse emotionally in my life. I remember the day I weighed myself and just looking down in disbelief. The only emotions I felt were fear and regret. And worst of all I still felt fat. EDs won't make you happy, but goddamn do they make you feel like they might.",False,False

Whenever you hit a gw, it’s never an ugw, EDs will push you to always want more. In my case, I didn’t feel anything. I was 99lbs at 5’8” and I wasn’t happy when I saw that number finally on the scale. It actually pushed me to recover for a little while. I’m back within 3 lbs of my “ugw” now and it hasn’t been great. I hope you find some peace from this ❤️",False,False

When I was approaching it I lowered it to 42kg/93lbs. When I was approaching that I lowered it to 37kg/82lbs. I haven’t reached that one yet but for *a decade* I was sure it was the Final UGW and I’d never come up with a new one. Guess what’s happening?,False,False
