Look real close at the serving size and do the math.  Maybe 1 serving is 120g and the package is 250g, and it lists 2 servings.  Especially when it says ""about...""    2. Understand how calorie rounding works.  That's how white monsters list 0 kcals, but they're actually 11 kcals per can (I'm so sorry).  It can help to look up another country's version of the label–idk every country's laws, but French labels are much more precise than American.    3. Chill a lil.  We all get the ed anxiety, but the cals are sometimes less than the label too, and let's be real, the difference is not THAT big a deal in the long run.     4. It can't hurt to add an extra 10% or so.  afaik one study found the average counts on frozen meals to be off by 8%, and the legal max is off by 20%.  Manufacturers want to err on the side of giving the consumer ""their money's worth"" so they don't get sued, but they don't want to push the 20% rule either, nor spend a lot on extra food.",False,False

It's unlikely that they're always totally accurate, but the thing is, calorie counting just is not an exact science anyway. And I say that as someone who does it religiously.   If you are feeling unsure about something, check that the macros and calories line up. ",False,False

If Stouffers advertises its Mac and cheese as 350 calories per 1/2 cup, and it was actually 400, somebody would undoubtedly take legal action for lying to consumers. Also with packaged food from the U.S., the calorie count is always a nice multiple of 5. This obviously doesn’t occur in nature, so I assume they’re rounding up the actual calories to get a pretty number.  I could be totally wrong, but it helps me sleep at night. ",False,False
