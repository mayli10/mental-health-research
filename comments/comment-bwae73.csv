I'm never full. I could always eat more. It's because I run out of food, or I meet my calories limit and have to stop myself, or other people are around and I get self-conscious. I'm never satisfied. I could always eat more.",False,False

It takes time for your stomach to tell your brain it's full. Something like 20 minutes. So if you're binging fast enough, you may not even realize you're full until you're about to start throwing it up. 2. How full you feel will depend on the types of foods you eat, not just the calories, as you alluded to with the rock, pebble, sand, water analogy. And 3. If you rarely eat except to binge, your binge may not be the equivalent volume of food that someone who eats more regularly would have for a binge (eg someone who regularly eats 2 plates of food at each meal might have a binge on 5 plates of food, while maybe you only eat 1/2 a plate of food each meal and your binge is 2 plates of food). If you're eating less, you won't feel as full, even if it's more than you'd typically eat.",False,False
