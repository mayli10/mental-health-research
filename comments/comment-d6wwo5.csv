Like, very small. Literally I canâ€™t wear a regular bra without the straps falling off.

If you arenâ€™t proportional it could be off.  https://www.myfooddiary.com/resources/frame_size_calculator.asp This one uses elbow and waist measurement.

You can build muscle to look leaner though. For your height a small frame is a wrist under 6 to 6.25 inches (your right on the cuff of med/tall height). And frame size doesnâ€™t indicate body shape.,False,False

Personally neither of us have never just been skinny lol so I'm also jealous of tall women that happen to just be like that. But I'm also a skeptic so I kinda think that if an otherwise tall lady is really skinny then she prob isn't eating enough or something  I think it's because when you're taller/bigger your body uses more calories so you naturally need/want to eat more. Before my ED I just ate normally, 3 meals a day and a snack and I was definitely not skinny. Now I have to hit a BMI of about 16.5 (at 5'10"") to actually look skinny :( I have quite a small narrow frame",False,False

I was on the beach this week when a gorgeous tall hourglass shaped woman with a 24 inch waist just existed. Super triggered. But itâ€™s not healthy to compare especially when itâ€™s unrealistic. That why my thinspo is petite women or old pics of me. You can only look like the best version of yourself.  Being able to make the most of what you have isnâ€™t easy but itâ€™s the most satisfying. Thereâ€™s plenty of skinny gorgeous women of all types.,False,False
