If you have a low enough body fat percentage, you'll often see yours even if you don't really work out. However, not everyone has a visible structure of this type. Also, even if you do, you have to work out a lot to make it look dramatic. And on top of all that, if you want to look like Emily Ratjakowski? You're also gonna need lipo. Facts.   It's not a realistic goal to pursue, imo. And I honestly just think they look weird. Mine reminds me of a seam where the factory was putting together my doll parts or something....like idk, it's just mildly squicky.",False,False
