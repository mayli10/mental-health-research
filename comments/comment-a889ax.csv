I struggled with B/P for an extended period of time (2+years off-and-on) during my initial recovery attempts from AN. I remember feeling like I would never be able to stop. I felt so helpless and hopeless.  I am now solidly 4 years purge-free. I have gone through binge phases during that time, but it was so much easier to overcome without having a purging habit to use as a crutch. I'm certainly not the poster child for recovery. I'm not even sure if it's possible to truly recover from a disordered relationship with food. But I KNOW it's possible to recover from certain behaviors. ",False,False

It’s a long journey, and I love and support you. Thank you, and I hope you find inspiration in my story.  I was a bulimic for years, and it started in sixth grade. I stopped in at the end of my Freshman year. It is now my senior year and I haven’t purged in three years. Although, I have participated in purging within the form of exercise, I still count myself as not having relapsed as per the recovery process. I experimented a lot with Chew and Spit while I was in recovery as well. Anything to stop myself from regurgitating all of my food, because I knew that I was making it riskier for myself and I almost choked on my own vomit on various occasions and clogged my drains. My dental health was also always at the back of my mind.  I turned to bulimia because I gravitated towards the control it gave me. I had little to no control over things I was experiencing in my life, and the abuse made me feel like I had nothing left and I was just a walking body bag. It was fueled by suicidal tendencies and the need for something, which in turn spiraled my mental health even further. An absolutely vicious cycle.   I was homeschooled up until the second half of my first year of high school, so I now no longer could give into the urges I had constantly. I couldn’t run to the bathroom right after and smell like vomit- I’d just walk around and try to get as many steps as I could. I remember being on the Keto diet. I’d eat nothing but chicken breasts (and other various meats), salad, and light mayonnaise for months. I’d binge on these items and force myself to keep them down. I was so ashamed of myself and my body and I felt the overwhelming pressure to look good.   I started properly exercising a few months into things. Running helped clear my mind and just being alone with the goal of improving myself was the point in my recovery where I knew I could do it, and was determined to do so. When I felt like I was falling off and back into bad habits I told my best friend about it, and did not have to bare the weight on my shoulders alone. I made a promise to her that I wouldn’t relapse and I haven’t since I made that promise. I know I couldn’t keep myself accountable, but promises are something I hold very dear to me. I know it’s cliché and not something everyone can do, but it’s something that’s kept me going.  Although I have not recovered with the binging part, I am considering myself a success with being a recovered bulimic.  ",False,False

Let's talk about food first. Eat more. Binging and purging causes all sorts of imbalances that make you *hungry,* especially if you diet or restrict in between.   Eat *smart.* The helpful thing for me has been eating high-density, low-volume foods so that I don't get that full feeling that screams ""time to go throw up!""  Avoid foods that trigger a binge. I know that if I have one chip, I'll eat the whole bag.   Now, let's talk about what goes on inside. My internal dialogue has been *vital*. I was straight mean to myself. I addressed myself in my head almost exclusively as ""you dumb bitch"" and it did me *no* favors. I now remind myself constantly through out the day that I am doing my best and as I keep going my best will become even better. I forgive myself when I slip up. I remind myself about the things I like about myself, even when all i can come up with is, ""I like my outfit.""   Finally, just keep busy! Busy busy busy. Too busy to binge, too busy to purge. I find that working my hands and my mouth is extremely helpful. I sing constantly. I write. I do cat's cradle. I braid my hair half a dozen times in a row.   Even though it's only been a couple of weeks, it's already getting easier and easier to resist. Every time you turn down a b/p session, it makes it easier to turn down next time, too. Sick to it. Success is cumulative and failure is not final.   I believe in you &lt;3 ",False,False
