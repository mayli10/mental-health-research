I hated life. Spent a good 4-5 years doing nothing. It hurts to think about the time I've lost...  But then I tell myself, ""hobbitprostitute"", that time was not lost. Sure I don't have a great job or a degree yet and I'm behind my peers. But I have lessons, I have a newfound humility that my cocky younger self never would have gained had I not failed. I have a new attitude. I treat people nicer because sometimes other people fail and we don't see them fail and they may be rude because they're having a bad day or their health is bad or they don't have money to pay the rent. EVERYBODY SUFFERS. EVERYBODY FAILS. What's important is what you do next.  For me it was at a breaking point (similar to yours) where I just got tired of failing and not learning or improving. I made multiple small steps one day which almost a year later have taken me miles down the path of improvement. It's hard to see where you can be in the future when you're at your lowest point. But you have to trust me that you can and will get to a better place OP. Never give up. Turn your losses into lessons and make small steps towards bettering yourself.",False,False

Was in my last year when I decided I hated my program and switched to a different one then switched again. Hoping to be finished this year but due to majorly fucking up this semester I think I'll probably fail at least one class and what pisses me off is, not to sound cocky, but I AM smart when I try, but its like I self-sabotage and just dont hand things in... so there will be huge chunks of my grades missing and I go into exams being like ""well if I get 91% on the this 55% exam i can pass"". And I dont even want to do this. I just want to work and go to college in September for what I really want to do (waiting to hear if I'm accepted) but I've just sunk so much money, time, and SANITY into this degree that I just want SOMETHING. But I feels like I cant even do that.   So I feel you brother. Stay strong. Even if you cant see it yet, there is a light at the end of the tunnel.",False,False
