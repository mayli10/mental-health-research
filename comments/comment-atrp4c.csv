You can't control much of anything else that goes on around you or certain things that are going on with you psychologically (in my case bipolar type 1), but you can control what you eat so you cling to it like a security blanket. That's why binges are so upsetting. It's not about the food or the calories because we know between laxing, purging, restricting, or just riding it out those just go away after a while anyway . It's about losing the control. I binged. I lost my control. I'm worthless as a person yadda yadda yadda. Gotta get the control back so back to restricting. Once that's on you get that high and back on the radish salads for dinner train. I tried fixing it and it doesn't really work. Coupling this with a massive fear of being obese again and having to stay above a certain weight or they'll take my favorite meds away and I beleive I'm fucked.   ",False,False

I can't weigh myself and I don't even have the desire to. I just want to restrict because I'm obsessed with the discipline aspect of it. I love putting myself through stupid ""mind over body"" shit tests just to feel a little bit less weak. My boyfriend says my definition of disciplined is shit. He's right but I don't have much else going for me right now so I'll control what I can. ",False,False
