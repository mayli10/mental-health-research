Fuck I thought I was the only one who felt this way, like, fat looks okay on smaller girls because I kind of just disperses all over and in contained ways if that makes sense??? but NOT on tall girls, it disperses weirdly and is sooo noticeable. I have a weight at which I know I look long and elegant, I currently weight 4 kilos - 4 GODDAMNED KILOS - more than this weight and look like a beached whale. Like, I go from skinny goddess to fat fuck with just a few kilo difference because of the way It shows up on my body. From thighs almost not touching to rubbing every time I walk, from flat stomach to beer gut in the blink of an eye. Insane.",False,False

My body isn't really one shape but it's a subtype of rectangle. I just look bad is all I know üò©üòÇ  And seriously what long legs my legs look stumpy af currently ü§£ and they wouldn't ever look good with this much thigh fat esp my inner thighs. They'd only ever look good if they were skinny and toned, which takes a ton of hard work and is so time consuming and tiring.",False,True

Like until I‚Äôm at an underweight BMI, my entire lower body is just a mess. And even then, I have to get pretty low before my legs are ‚Äúlong and elegant‚Äù. Honestly, I feel bad for models. They‚Äôve got to be *ridiculously* underweight to look as good for as long as they do.   I can‚Äôt even manage to get toned, lol. My body doesn‚Äôt take to muscle well at all. Even at my lowest bodyfat percentage, I had no hint of abs or even arm muscles. And I was working out for hours every day and bulking up with protein!!! Annoying.   It‚Äôs all genetics!!! What‚Äôs passed down is passed down. Sadly I‚Äôve got my moms Jewish wide hips and huge thighs. Why can‚Äôt humans breed more intelligently like we do dogs and horses. ‚òπÔ∏è",False,False

Seriously tho, I look like an ogre. I look 'thick' not 'thicc'. Unless I'm underweight, I will never have that 'omg is that a model' effect on people. I just look big until I'm skinny I will look somewhat okayish. I don't think people realize why most models are skinny and remain skinny. It's really hard for taller girls to weigh more than a certain weight without the weight really worsening what is supposed to be a good thing(the whole long legs long body model body thing).  Like it's actually difficult af to get a nice and slim body. I have to workout everyday, restrict and somehow eat a lot of protein to remain toned, can't eat more or any of that shit cus my body is fucked up and if I eat more than 1500 cals I'll start gaining.  Also im black so naturally that means I'm thicker(not every black person is like that ik but that's sorta common for people of my ethnicity/where I'm from) so that's hard to deal with tooüò©",False,True

So many people act like being tall is such a blessing because ‚Äúyour BMR is higher‚Äù or ‚Äúyour BMI can be lower at a higher weight‚Äù but don‚Äôt realize how fucking *awkward* and *noticeable* bodyfat distributes and appears. Like, my square ass perma-muffintop hips are basically fuckin eyelevel with some of you blessed shorties. And I‚Äôm not even that tall LOL   At least short people can almost pass chub off as cute??? While I end up looking like a misshapen golem???",False,False
