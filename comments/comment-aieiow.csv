And your body could be holding on to any water it can in order to avoid dehydration.  In my own experience I had kind of a similar moment, but it was sort of the opposite, and I don't think it's technically ED-related, but also it could be. Probably not though. Basically I had changed some prescriptions and then noticed after that that I was getting thinner. Then I weighed myself while I was visiting a family member who has a bathroom scale and I had supposedly gained 5lbs since getting weighed earlier at my doctor's office. I know bathroom scales are less accurate, but it was very confusing. Basically, what I think happened in my case is that I did not actually gain 5lbs and also I was just storing fat differently on my body after changing my prescriptions.   How that might relate to your situation is that you may have made yourself sick by binging all of that food and your body is simply responding by changing the way it normally functions in order to make the healing process more effective. Basically, the human is weird and complex and you really can't know for sure what's going on just by looking at it or taking a few measurements. You're just going to have to trust that things will return to normal shortly enough once you start feeling better :)",False,False
