It’s about as truthful in this situation as you can be without having a conversation you may not be ready for yet - though she would probably listen if you were.   It’s good to feel a little guilty at times like this - means your conscience is working. You’ll pull through. xx",False,False

I've stolen money, food, and drugs from friends and family. It's a good thing that you feel this shame though, because I didnt for a long time. And then, after stealing thousands of dollars worth, the guilt hit me all at once.   It's good that you learned your lesson after one measly ice cream sandwich. I know you feel bad, but this addiction has led to people doing much worse so try not to beat yourself up too much",False,False
