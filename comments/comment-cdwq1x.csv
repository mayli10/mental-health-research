If you are getting a lot of salt and a lot of fluid, your body will release fluid as you get more. What likely happened to her is she was getting high salt and high fluid, but stopped drinking the Gatorade hasn't replaced the missing fluid with water. Her body is now in a high salt/lower fluid situation, so will hold any and all fluids she takes in. As she dehydrates (which happens faster than losing electrolytes), the concentration of her blood increases, and fluid is badly needed back in the blood stream. Any fluid she takes in will go into the blood stream to bring down the concentration, but the body is now ""worried"" water will continue to be scarce and packs any additional water into tissues (this is called edema) and this causes bloating and swelling. The best cure is to drink tons of water! Reassure the body it's still going to be hydrated, and the water you drink pushes the edema in the tissue out!    While drinking the high electrolytes can cause some edema, it's more the change in fluid/lyte balance that is making the edema so pronounced. This is why I don't get fluid restricting for weight loss. It doesn't work and it's so not worth it. If you remain super well hydrated and keep your lytes up, yes the scale may read a little higher than if you fluid restrict... But any weight you lose is actually real weight and you look so much better hydrated instead of the puffy bloaty dehydrated look!    (An aside, yes stars and performer dehydrate to get their muscles to pop on camera or at body building shows but it's a short term, very involved process of keeping your carbs, lytes, and fluids all at the optimal level to LOOK super lean and it's not sustainable. Drink water. Look thinner. See REAL progress only!)",False,False
