I binged once and I successfully purged. And then like you I thought “ok this can be a back up plan in case I binge again”. Next thing you know I’m in a hell cycle of binging and purging multiple times a day. My teeth are so weak now. I literally broke my tooth chewing gum. Please don’t try purging again. I wish I could go back in time and stop myself from starting.,False,False
