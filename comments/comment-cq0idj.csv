Yeah, definitely know the movie (kids remember, haha!). And I absolutely feel you on the lack of sense of direction. I've always been the one that needs directions to be *turn left at Walmart, the street right after the light, etc*, instead of directions or streets. Before smartphones with maps I got lost a TON. Even with the damn GPS I manage to get lost. I'll never understand how animals can find their way home. Drop my ass off at a different grocery store than the one I always go to, and I'm probably never coming homeü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Tbh, her being so damn overprotective is probably just increasing your anxiety. By never getting a chance to do anything on your own, your brain is able to convince you that you can't for even longer until it just becomes your natural thought. And that thought process is so hard to break (trust me, I'm still trying).  Hopefully you're able to take at least some control in your life soon. You need it and deserve it. üíú. And yep, I remember the cost of first moving out. If I'm being honest, my first place was me, my boyfriend, and 3 other roommates in a 2 bedroom just to make rent and pay bills. Not ideal, but the bills were paid and we all made some great memories.",False,False

It‚Äôs like living with mother Gothel, I swear. (In case you‚Äôve never seen Tangled look up the song ‚Äòmother knows best‚Äô)",False,True

I thought I was an overprotective parent!! I guess I can see the caffine thing on a ""better safe than sorry"" note, but even then, it does seem a bit extreme.  Damn. I'm sorry you seem to have such little control or say in your life. Like yeah, you're *technically* still a minor, but you're so close to adulthood! This is the time you need to be given a little more control and say in your life. How else does she expect you to manage on your own? I may be out of touch though. Mine are only 4.5 and 3 and I moved out on my own at 16, so I'm a bit clueless to the teen years these days. But it can't have changed that much! I commend you for staying sane, because I'd have lost my shit having so little control",False,False

The ac is also broke so the house is hot enough to be mildly uncomfortable but not enough to cause any issues and my mom told me (17) to make sure my 23 year old brother spends all of his time in the air conditioned room because otherwise he‚Äôll be sure to die of heat stroke. Meanwhile he spends all day in the non ac rooms and doesn‚Äôt even sweat. She doesn‚Äôt let me drink caffeine often because 16 years ago I had a heart problem that the doctors say is completely healed and the only issue that the heart problem ever caused is I wasn‚Äôt allowed to touch electric fences or ride rollercoasters. She doesn‚Äôt let me leave the house by myself because I can‚Äôt run quickly enough for her liking.   I‚Äôm almost a legal adult and can‚Äôt walk to school by myself. She‚Äôs way too overprotective,False,True

Idk if I'd go 'it'll kill you' bad. I'm just one of the people that has an allergic/bad reaction to aspartame (triggers DAYS long migraines and horrid stomach issues), so I avoid it like the plague. So it's less of a 'I think it's horrible' thing and more of a I think it's terrible for *me* thing.  Seriously though, if you can get her to snag some flavored sparkling waters, they are pretty dang good!! Even my kids love them!",False,False
