There’s something wrong with the choices *they* are making.   Middle and high school are such a hotbed of people being mean for useless reasons or for no reason at all. To try feel powerful, to try to impress someone else and fit in themselves, boredom, on and on.   Please don’t change who you are to try to protect yourself. It doesn’t work. And to lose oneself, to become a chameleon, is a wound that lasts far longer than high school.   You are enough. No matter what. &lt;3",False,False

From my experience, high school was absolutely horrible. I was teased relentlessly to the point where I couldn’t focus on school work and I ended up dropping out. I can, however, tell you that it’s been nothing but uphill since my early 20s. Everything that happens in hs is insignificant bullshit that has no reflection on how college, your career, your relationships etc will be like in the future. Hang in there.",False,False
