I just wanted to acknowledge your pain and your strength. Thank you for posting. Its incredibly hard to find your place in the world after suffering with an ED. Its even harder when those around you will not allow you heal and own your past.   Its important to find closure or even just look back at your life lived with an ED. Due to the nature of an ED it’s usually triggered or occurs around the milestones in your life. Leaving you feeling a sense of lost potential or of stolen life moments.   Control is so important it’s what caused so much conflict in our relationships and drives our life choices.   Be kind to yourself. Don’t let others drive you to hurt yourself or restrict.   Remember pressure is how diamonds are made. Millions of years of pressure. If you can with stand this pressure, when it is all over you will be sparkling and tough.",False,False
