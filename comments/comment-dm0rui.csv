Started my last year of school in August and I was medically unstable. Therapist  told to take the semester off for treatment. I refused since I want to graduate on time and it’s a big semester since I’m going abroad soon too, so I couldn’t miss it. Would mess up my whole future plan for grad school and post grad plans. Taking a gap year too so I think that it would be a better time then to step up to inpatient/res. Kinda stabilized now at school but in this limbo where I’m too unstable to do iop or outpatient and stable enough I don’t think it’s a problem and convinced I can make it through to the end of the year. So I’m just managing on my own which has been an interesting time. I’m in this same boat as you lol it’s a bumpy ass ride",False,False
