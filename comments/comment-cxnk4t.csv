Right now. Immediately. You both need to go see a counselor together. Right now. And explain this.,False,False

I’m going to talk to her tonight about it and hopefully all goes well. If anything I hope this makes it easier to fight my ed so that my mom can be happier and our relationship improves. Much love.,False,True

I have been in your position before, and it sounds like your mom is in a lot of distress. She's just choosing to express it in an unproductive way.   Honestly, though? Not to go all Freud on your ass, but I think subconsciously or maaaybe consciously, your mom did want you to read this. Whatever's going on with her right now, it's clear she's  overwhelmed. Occupying the role of ""caretaker"" for a mentally ill person really can take a toll, and sometimes people in that position feel desperate to be seen. Sometimes they just need another person to tell them, ""Hey. You need support too.""  Bottom line, unless there's an abusive dynamic here, the last thing your mom wants is for you to feel worthless or like she wants you to disappear. On the contrary, she just wants you to be healthy. That's why she's so upset - there's basically nothing worse, as a parent, than seeing your child suffer and not knowing how to make it better.   In light of all this, I hope your mom has her own counselor, and a social support network. But either way, I don't think there's anything wrong with going to your mom and telling her you saw what she wrote, explaining how it made you feel, and then just...talking it out. Wishing you all the best &lt;3",False,False
