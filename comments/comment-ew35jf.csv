Thank you for replying. My head is a mess right now. (TW) I just worked out that when I was at my low weight 18 months ago, my BMI was WAY lower than I thought and I've just been looking at photos of me back then and it's simultaneously making me feel terrible for the weight I am now, and also I STILL LOOK LIKE A FAT WHALE IN THOSE PHOTOS EVEN THOUGH MY BMI WAS A LOT LESS THAN 17 (trying not to be too specific because I don't want to trigger you). I should have been hospitalised and tubed, and I am honestly surprised that the only intervention I received for my weight (while in a mental health hospital, I might add) was to be put on a medication guaranteed to make me gain weight. And oh boy did it. I gained more than 20kg very quickly, in fact I nearly gained 30kg. I am now off that med, thank God, but I hate myself for where my weight is now. I hate myself for this disorder so much.    And, of course, I feel guilty for wanting to be back where I was. Or, more accurately, to be worse than I was because let's be real I cannot see that I am anything but overweight in those photos so clearly I was not ""sick enough"", regardless of what my BMI said. I feel guilty for trying to work out how quickly I can get back there.   Ugh. Guilt. Shame. Disgust. My three main emotions.    I'm sorry, I'm having a rough night (in Aus, nighttime here). Sorry if I have been a trigger or a burden. Thank you for replying to me. Also, I love hearing other people's stories, so anecdotes are always welcome :)",False,True

I feel guilty for talking about my problems to people in my life, because I need support and do somewhat want to get better sometimes.
