If an eating disorder uses your moral beliefs to create more fuel for your eating disorder, that's not the fault of your moral belief, that's the fault of the disorder. This argument never seems to come up against, say, fair trade chocolate, or ""humanely raised"" beef, or locally grown produce, even though they are just as vulnerable to being manipulated by eating disorders. Because eating disorders... get this... disorder your eating.  As other people in this thread have said, if people in recovery find that recovery is incompatible with eating vegan, then there are other ways for them to express their beliefs, e.g. in non-food purchases, campaigning, etc. But there's this gross infantilising opinion against anyone with EDs - usually from people without EDs - that trying to make ANY conscious choice about the foods you want to eat vs. don't want to eat is somehow relapse. Guess what! Actually being able to make INFORMED choices about the foods you eat and having CONTROL over the food you put into your body - real control, not ""my inability to eat carbs is actually me having control over something in my life"" disordered control - is what recovery actually is. Being able to say ""No, I don't want to eat that, because I don't want to eat animal products"" is an infinitely more healthful thought process than ""I guess I have to be okay with eating everything or else I'm disordered again"".",False,False

And if I consume things that aren't vegan it triggers a full on binge.   I feel pressure from my obsessive thought processes, my mom (who has a history of demonizing carbs which are abundant in all the plants I eat) and my school nutritionist (who has sent me to the ER last week due to low blood pressure) to transition back.

That being said, this comment section is kind of toxic.

Are you 100% certain that your fruits and veggies are ethically sourced? Are the people picking your produce being underpaid, working in unsafe conditions for too long of hours resulting in injury or death? Are they victims of labor trafficking? What about your clothes? Do you know the exact source of your clothing and the work conditions/pay of the employees creating them? Are you contributing to global warming by using a non-electric car or non-solar energy, which directly results in the death of Antarctic species and plants/animals across the planet? Are you zero-waste and personally composting your trash, making sure that every item you use isn’t being dumped into the ocean and killing marine life?   People may not be vegan, but may be focusing their efforts on other areas of concern. People aren’t “immoral” just because they aren’t vegan.

Thanks for shining a light! Yes, there are people deep in their illness who use “veganism” as an excuse to restrict... often while not actually living as vegans, just eating mainly plant based foods... but there’s no justification for erasing the many, many people who have been helped, or even had their lives saved, by embracing veganism. Living out your ethics *can be* incredibly positive and affirming, in some circumstances. It can provide that small bit of inherent positive feedback to push past the constant negative thought loops of trying to get to “normal eating”. There are two residential NHS programmes (i.e. fully publicly funded, open to any seriously ill patient) in the UK which have offered vegan recovery tracks for at least a few years, and the UK is a leading centre of ED research. Veganism per se is not threatening, problematic or wrong. Undereating or eating hyper-restrictively (in an “orthorexic” way, e.g. monos, fasting, OMAD, or fully raw) is the truly concerning thing, as are uber high protein diets which negatively affect the kidneys and raise the risk of heart disease.   I’m not by any means suggesting people just jump into veganism tomorrow. But the ill informed anti-vegan posts that regularly crop up in this sub are really worrying; they don’t reflect what is actually healthy vs not healthy in recovery. We should at least try to be as accurate as possible in our terminology, and allude to plant based pseudo-recovery accounts claiming veganism when that is what we really mean (and I agree that these exist, and are frustrating and damaging, but they’re not the face of veganism in recovery).",False,False
