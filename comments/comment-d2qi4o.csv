There's quite a solid, albeit thin, line between having food tastes and being a princess. You can totally be a princess while still eating a wide variety of food - I eat ""unhealthy food"" on a near daily basis.",False,True

I also like ""healthy food"", that's not the point.

It's just not me. It's not my values, it's not my identity. I don't care about calories and all that stuff, I don't want to be superskinny, I don't use food to control whatever.
