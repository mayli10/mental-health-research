Probably not with your own mum, but many (usually overweight/obese) people will feel threatened by someone suddenly becoming smaller (and therefore better looking) than them, imho often unconsciously but they still do it. Same can be said for actually skinny people, who are often still insecure (heyyy i guess but i keep the thoughts to myself instead of sabotaging others).",False,False

It triggers the shit out of me because it makes me want to restrict even more, BUT .. I also need it to see that I'm making progress because I physically cannot see it. I don't know what I actually look like. I refer to the way I see myself as the fun house effect. Those mirrors that distort the way you look.",False,False

I'm literally a pound in the normal BMI range after being overweight/obese for my whole life. Every time my mom sees me she starts lamenting that I'm getting ""too skinny"" and that she's worried about me. I don't know how to take this. Is it just pure love/concern? Is it that she feels that she can control me with food up until now and feels powerless? Is she threatened? It's a confusing, complicated feeling, right?",False,False

My sister in law tries to be nice and tells me I'm getting sooo small. I'm like... fucking where? I'm 60lbs overweight. I've lost 50, but I don't see it at all.

They don't take into consideration that everyone is built differently though. I'm sure you're beautiful as you are, but I understand how you feel.
