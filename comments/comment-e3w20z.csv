For me it’s a texture thing. Not a fan of the stringy-ness. I also dislike carrots unless they are the super skinny baby carrots. Again, a texture thing. They’re too hard or something when they’re thicker.",False,False

It was bitter tasting and stringy.  But hummus thoughhh. Omg. It's rich and garlicky and suits celery so well.  Now I'll eat straight celery like the wild bitch I am because it eventually grew on me, but yeah. Hated it entirely before hummus.",False,False

I see people say they binge on celery...and I’m like, how!? I wish I could. I absolutely hate the taste of celery, always have. It is so gross to me.   I can handle raw carrots if they’re small, but I don’t enjoy them at all. I don’t really like them, but tolerate them a lot more than celery. I love raw carrots when they’re grated in sandwiches and stuff though. But no celery. Ever. Even in soups and stuff I hate it.   When I was 14 I had to eat a whole onion on a dare. I did it, and haven’t been able to stomach the smell or taste of raw onion since. I can eat onion when it’s cooked to shit in other dishes though.  What I do love is capsicum (bellpepper). That shit is yummy.",False,False
