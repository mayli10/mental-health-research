It absolutely amazes me that they try to justify things like 10 day fasts as ""healthy."" And I seriously doubt they've cleared anything with their doctors.   I think one of the things that bothers me most is how in denial and disordered they are, but how much shit they talk about us over here, and people with EDs in general. We aren't the ones out there giving tips on how to starve yourself for 10 days. Most of our tips on here are things like ""hey you said you're restricting for x amount of days, if you do this, please make sure you take vitamins and drink lots of water!"" AND we acknowledge we are all def not healthy. They do a lot of the same shit we do, but then act all high and mighty. Ugh.",False,False

And yeah like I totally understand exactly what you said with IF and stuff but that sub often crosses that line and goes right into being straight up toxic and unhealthy",False,True

I can understand some forms of IF being used as a way to not binge eat or to stop ""grazing"" on food all day long, especially when a doctor helps you work through it and plans something out, like fasting for 10 hours, 8 of which are when you're sleeping. (Helps people who eat dinner, then wake up in the middle the night and snack, then eat breakfast when they wake up in the morning.)   But 10 day fasts? Really? That is so obviously an ED. I would be willing to bet the majority of the people on there would be giving their doctors heart attacks if they told them what they do.",False,False
