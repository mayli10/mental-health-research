Berries. Kelp noodles in any type of sauce. Shrimp. Broth.   Pretty much can't go wrong with any fruit or vegetable, but unfortunately that's not what I want to usually binge on. Ive resigned to not allowing myself access to triggering foods, or very sad imitations of my trigger foods.   I love to binge on cake icing, but it has 110 calories per serving. Marshmallow fluff is similar, less than half the calories, and not as likely to trigger a binge, that's what I keep in the house instead",False,False
