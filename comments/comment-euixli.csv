It's feel-good shit, like yay we're taking baby steps to save the planet! It's a joke. It is not enough.  People have outlined the problem better in other comments. But with an environmental situation as dire as ours, our attitude should not be ""every bit counts"", it should be a focus on making the big moves that will actually generate measurable change.  Matter of fact it's the same thing with grocery bags and reusable containers. You could go the rest of your life without using another disposable container... and it would do nothing to save the earth.  We can do so much more with our votes than any degree of reusable bento boxes, shopping bags, metal straws, or cold showers. The focus on reducing waste is entirely on consumers right now, and it shouldn't be. Because consumers are not the biggest problem right now.  That's not to say that people should be discoraged from making small environmentally friendly decisions. If someone wants to give up straws for the sake of the earth, that's not a /problem/. But like I said, it's shifting all the BLAME for the dire state of our earth on consumers. Also, it comes at the expense of everyone who needs a straw to drink.  This is first thing in the morning so I'm sorry this isn't eloquently put at all",False,False

If someone decides the best way they can help the environment right now is by not using plastic straws then hell yea.

More accountability needs to be placed on corporations, not individuals. Placing blame on individuals is a distraction from all of the fucked-up things corporations are doing.

The zero-waste/ low-waste movement on the whole strikes me as classist and ableist. Obviously it doesn't bother me when people use reusable straws, take their own bags to the grocery store, etc. These are positive actions, and these people are doing what they can to make some sort of difference. What bothers me is the sense of self-righteousness I see in people for doing something that many people simply don't have the privilege/resources/ability to do. Maybe I'm projecting my own insecurities, but I see that kind of attitude a lot on social media and in everyday life.",False,True

A lot of recyclables just end up in landfills or the ocean anyway (even when separated into the recycling bin by consumers). Compostable/biodegradable products are better for the environment in many cases. If they end up in the ocean, they just melt away, they’re just plant matter. Plastic sticks around for like 200 years before degrading and even then is an issue as a micro plastic.   That said, they’re still single use disposables, so glass, metal, and other reusables are still better.   Regardless, I fully agree about the largest burden being on fossil fuel companies and other large corporations. As for it not being the US...well, per capita the US is the second worst culprit. China is first, so obviously the biggest burden is on them, but they actually appear to be making drastic changes. Our US senators are bringing snowballs to congress to prove climate change isn’t real and our president pulled us out of the Paris Agreement.   Also a great deal of China’s pollution is actually from foreign companies, many of which are based in the US.   &gt;	Research conducted by the Carbon Trust found that China is the world’s largest emitter in the apparel sector, **but 72% of those emissions are essentially the responsibility of companies overseas where the products are exported and sold.**  [Source](https://time.com/5669061/china-climate-change/)  The US imports most of our consumer goods. Our companies import most of what they sell. So it’s kind of hypocritical for us to just shift the blame to China when we are equally responsible for a large portion of their emissions. We basically just moved our emissions into a less developed country because it was easier to skirt around US environmental and labor standards.",False,False

The straw ban has affected me directly but I'm for it because plastic straws are particularly damaging to wildlife and they quickly break down into microplastics that affect the entire ocean food chain.

I really do need a straw for most drinks. Does that mean I don't deserve to have water with my meals anymore? Lmao...  The ban on straws does not make even a dent in plastic waste generated every day. Not even a tiny dent, not even a scratch, not even a glancing touch to the massive amounts of waste people generate.
