I'm also 17, almost 18, and I feel so miserable thinking that my future self will remember me like that.  I am throwing away the ""best years of my life"" beint obsessed over food, weight, how do I look.  I'm so mad at myself, food is literally the easiest thing in this world, and I made it the most complex and complicated.  The only thing that keeps me going is the hope that one day I'll get better, and this will just be a dark period of my life I overcame.
