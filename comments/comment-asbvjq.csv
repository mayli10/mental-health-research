I don’t have first hand experience with dry sockets or abscesses, but I have had to have a molar removed due to a serious infection that spread to my sinuses. A friend of mine got an abscess and dry socket which was super painful for her. Her face got swollen and she had to see a dentist every few days to have antibiotics and clove compresses packed into the wound.   After I got my wisdom teeth out I tried to sleep the whole time. My jaw was accidentally broken too so the sleeping wasn’t hard. Anyway, try to lay off for a week or week and a half. Could lead to some serious issues down the road.   It would increase your chances of knocking out the clot. I couldn’t have a cigarette after having my molar removed as it hurt too bad. ",False,False

I would mage sure you keep your mouth rinsed out with warm salt water, to help prevent infection. ",False,False
