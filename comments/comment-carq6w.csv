I've fallen into my ED thinking that my body and head would have something to unwind with. Excercise made it so much more believable to the point, I was sure my life's going to get only better. On the other hand... fuck my irrational thinking. My ""positive ED"" worked for like 3 months in total and from that point on I'm only more and more miserable every week. Compliments aside, how can you deal with smaller problems effectivelly, while you gradually make yourself some seriously hard, long lasting problems in the process?",False,False

A few years back I had a major depressive phase and gained a lot of weight. My well meaning friends who were  thinner than me could not comprehend why my weight made me feel such despair. I would just describe it as, every problem I have: I am also fucking fat.    Bad grade? I’m also fat.   Fight with a friend? AND IM FAT?  Feeling lonely? Try fat AND lonely",False,False
