I used to have a really good fat distribution, big ol' tiddies, big hips and thighs. Thicc I guess people would call it now but back then it was just called fat.   Now my boobs are deflated to the point my chestbones are more prominent. My bone structure that most would die for nowadays is just square.  My hips used to have a nice curve to them but now I can't sleep well because I can't get comfortable.  I hated myself back then. But looking back, my body was desirable.  Yet I'd still never want to gain weight to get to that body again. Terrified.",False,False

I'm sad because now my tops don't fit me, and they just look weird, like you can tell something is missing. Maybe it's more obvious to me because I know what they're supposed to look like, and it's not like that.  You won't catch me gaining any time soon though.

But ED combined with too much outside positive reinforcement has made me terrified to gain anything back.,False,False
