People are so horribly misinformed about these things and you need to feel secure in your expression before tackling it.   I really hope he understands and steps up beyond what you're hoping for.,False,False

Except I’m telling him “im really nauseous and have stomach problems so I think I might throw up” so he won’t think twice if he hears noises in the bathroom. It’s been almost 3 weeks of 200 cal a day, and I haven’t noticed much weight loss (driving me crazy) so neither has he. That might buy me time.",False,True

In the past I have explained not eating to being stomach problems, etc., but I’m just tired of lying and in therapy trying to recover so I needed to be more honest. I told him I had an eating disorder. And that I have a lot of anxiety about food, and issues with self esteem and body image. I told him I was going to therapy and seeing a doctor about it, and would work on it, but it wasn’t something he could fix. The only thing I have not been honest about (and might not ever be) is purging. Too shameful for me to at least go there right now. I left it at eating disorder and didn’t tell him my actual diagnosis (an b/p).",False,False

There is absolutely no fucking shame in supplementing or completely switching to formula. People have supply issues all the time for no discernable reason and while yes maybe you can pin why it's an issue for you right now that is still not your fault. Your baby will not know a difference in their life for having been formula fed at any point. Please do not pile onto yourself when you're already coping with so much.,False,False

He wanted to fix it at first and was being very pushy about food, talking about food, etc. He was basically being the food/exercise police, and it was not helping me at all. I had to set some very clear boundaries. He can be concerned, but he can’t comment on my intake or body. I still have to remind him, but it is getting better. I also have been encouraging him to seek therapy to discuss his own feelings about this (and some other stuff he needs to deal with). I know it must be very difficult to live with me when I am like this but at the same time I am not emotionally equipped to support him in his fears about my illness.",False,False
