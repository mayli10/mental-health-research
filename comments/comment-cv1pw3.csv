Definitely vicariously living through her chest days. She opened up recently how she had orthorexia. She said she couldn’t feel like she could eat “bad” foods because she didn’t want to let her followers down so she’d go in on cheat days and try to save it for one day but go back to just eating healthy all the time.  In my option, her jawline was always very narrow and very defined before the all in approach came out. She seemed healthy and fit but that there were somethings going on behind the scene of a bad relationship with food. In her recent gaining 30 pounds video, she looks so much happier and healthier, she is more curvy and it’s a good look for her. She’s still continuing her fitness but she seems so much happier honestly. Although I can’t fathom the thought of eating 4000 calories a day, she’s doing what’s best and what works for her and she’s also taking those calories and working out harder.",False,False

I guess it’s like Tabitha Farrar’s approach to recovery from severely under-eating. She’s never admitted to having an eating disorder, but from her What I Eat In a Day videos, it does seem like she was eating too little for the intense workouts she did which would understandably explain her extreme hunger. I definitely can relate to that.  Regarding the all-in approach, I, also, could never. I know you shouldn’t be too focused on eating perfectly when recovering, but I also don’t think anyone’s body *really* needs 200g of sugar everyday. She ate a lot of easy, packaged junk before this approach also. What helped me with my extreme hunger was not going below 1200 calories, not being too underweight (18 BMI right now), and forcing myself to eat mostly healthy foods. I still eat processed stuff, but I just had to force myself at 1-2 serving(s) because that shit can really get addicting. No, I don’t think I should “give in to what my body wants” when it’s really just a sugar fairy trying to get its’ fix.  But I do admire her courage to do this. That’s insane courage to gain so much weight and be ok with it (at least, halfway ok). My ED would rather take all the willpower in the world to make sure I can ignore the hunger, than to gain just 5 lbs.",False,False
