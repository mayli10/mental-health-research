Then my brain is like “okay so this person says it’s not lung cancer BUT then why am I still feeling a tickle in my throat? What about those people who have doctors miss stuff?” And I go right back to square one.   Makes me really feel the whole “EDs are often partially anxiety disorders” thing hard.",False,False

I thought I was the only one, almost every time I leave my house I get an urge to ask strangers whether I seem to be NW or not. I guess it makes sense though, given the fact that people with EDs almost always suffer from low self esteem, body dysmorphia etc.",False,False

My knees+calves+wrists are skinny but the rest of me is just fine (under clothes) because no one else can see my ribs or spine or shoulder blades or belly pooch or jiggling thighs &amp; arms. My face is thin and I have awful dark circles but more like I'm sleep deprived/on drugs not like I'm starving?

Even for me (recovered for years with good health), I could know my measurements and I could see my reflection and still feel the urge to want some sort of external entity to confirm whatever crazy thoughts I have in order to satisfy my insecurities, but that’s only ever temporary.   The truth is that no one else ever has a say in whether you’re good enough or not. That’s for you to decide alone. We could both be told endlessly that we’re immaculate and the skinniest and the most beautiful and we could never believe it because of all the inner noise telling us otherwise. It’s when we learn to let go and just redirect the thoughts elsewhere when we learn that we don’t have to rely on anyone to decide to eat, have fun, go out, live.   Our bodies are important, after all it’s the vessel through which we experience life, and there’s really only one person that can decide whether to take care of it with kindness or not.",False,False
