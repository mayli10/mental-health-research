I also have gotten downvoted for saying things like “felt that” under posts. Like why is anyone here if they don’t understand this is an eating disorder sub. Sorry if you’re offended by my mental illness,False,False
fdj65uf,t3_ellg63,t3_ellg63,red_ossifrage,9,2020-01-07 22:58:58,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/ellg63/i_hate_when_people_wonder_into_the_sub_and_leave/fdj65uf/,"&gt; I know being triggered is my own responsibility  I mean, sure, but we also have a reasonable expectation of safety in this sub. The vast majority of posters have EDs, and know how to follow the rules. This is also not the kind of sub that attracts a lot of trolls, both because we try to stay under the radar, and because this is not a rewarding trolling ground. The jargon/culture is forbidding to outsiders, and like, even trolls know that harassing the mentally ill is just sad.  So, when some jackass pops up posting ""hAvE U tRiEd inTeRmIttEnT FaStiNG"" or ""oH No uR So SeXy DonT Be AnOreXic"" and other inappropriate comments, it's really startling. Of course you might have a reaction to that! I'm sorry you had that happen today.  (Did you report the comment? If not, I would encourage you to do so.)",False,False

Exercise isn't even a part of my ED.  This is a not good thing to say to someone who has exercise as part of their ED I'm so sorry you had to hear that.,False,False
