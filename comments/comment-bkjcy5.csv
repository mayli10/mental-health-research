A little extra weight is understandable- but to get to that level of obesity and that level of dissociation, you have to on average be in denial or neglecting to deal with what is causing your compulsive eating.  So having an eating disorder and being rejected/judged my society because of the physiological representation of your eating disorder? No thanks. Iâ€™ll stay in an average body, being socially accepted or praised for my ED; itâ€™s not great by any means but beats being also judged by society!  Also- Iâ€™m biased here, but I think that HAES has become so warped that itâ€™s lost itâ€™s original message/a crock of shit - that our health is not defined by our weight. But thatâ€™s just me &amp; my drunken biased opinion.",False,False

You hear/read/see them being so aggressively vocal about the fact they!!!! LOVE!!!! THEMSELVES!!!!! and will not!!!! apologise for being FAT!!! But to me (as someone who is obese), that reeks of insecurity. People who talk so often about how confident they are... are often people who lack confidence, as contrarian as it sounds. It's still unhealthy that their entire self-worth is still based around whether or not they are attractive (either to themselves or to men, since I've not noticed a huge LGBT movement within HAES).   &amp;#x200B;  I completely understand where you're coming from, though. Witnessing someone who appears to love their body unreservedly when you/we harbour so much hatred for our own is really difficult, especially when they don't have a body that is considered conventionally attractive by society. I hope the rest of this year brings you joy and confidence.",False,False
