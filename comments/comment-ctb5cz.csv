Vitamin C is essential for keeping your gums strong and prevent bleeding. It can be found in citrus fruits, spinach, potatoes and green peppers. Vitamin A is the most important for developing and repairing soft tissues and teeth. It also prevents radicals from affecting gums and can be found in eggs, fish, cream, and carrots. Vitamin E is proved to treat periodontal diseases like gingivitis and is found in seeds, corn, wheat germ, and asparagus. Vitamin B-12 is necessary to keep the skin tissue healthy and is good for your gums to prevent bleeding. It is found in pork, shellfish, eggs, and liver.

Purging is the most obvious. We can spot it if you purge just by your teeth - the shape, acid erosion, decay, petechia on your face or palate. We can tell if you‚Äôre malnourished in any way by certain gum symptoms - puffiness, pale color, etc. Those are the main things we see regarding your mouth. If you have a lot of decay we can *maybe* think that you eat a lot of carb heavy or sugary foods but that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean an eating disorder.  I guess I can say there are signs that make us go ‚Äúhmm.‚Äù",False,True

I learned this a difficult and pretty gross way.  \- Rinse and swish like hell with baking soda BEFORE *and* AFTER to help create a less acidic environment in the mouth which will be more protective of teeth than just doing it afterward.   \- If you don't have baking soda, hate the taste of it, or find it inconvenient, chew some TUMS and swish that with a little sip of water before and after. TUMS are calcium carbonate, which works for heartburn by being a buffering agent for stomach acid.  \- Make sure you actually get any water or rinsing agent in between your lips and your teeth, and not just on the inside part of your mouth.   \- Diet soda is unfortunately acidic AF and bad for your teeth even though there is no sugar. Try to reduce your intake or at least periodically swish your mouth with water or baking soda/water if you are the type that tends to drink it all day long.",False,False

For instance, if you‚Äôre restricting but drink a lot of crystal light or something like that it could make a difference. Crystal light and drink mixes are very acidic and will make my teeth hurt if I drink a lot of it.
