I look like I still belong in highschool thanks to my baby features (#Asiandon'traisin) and I'll be 5 foot forever :/ Much of my clothes from highschool still fits, and I'm terrified of maturing and facing the future (with the possibility that my ED will ruin any relationship/job opportunities I might find in the future)  My self control around food resembles that of a child - eating sweets and carbs 'till I feel ill. It's rough, my dude, but I wish you the best in the future and hope we can get through this together &lt;3",False,False

I never really felt like  a real person and developmentally behind everyone else in all aspects mainly because I would avoid doing anything that made me anxious aka going outside my house. The regret it so strong it feeds into the suicidal feelings a lot. And life’s going to get harder and I’m just not interested ,False,False

It doesn’t help that people tend to think I’m 21 at most. My close friend group ranges from like 17-26. Everyone kinda is at a similar life stage and everyone seems to be somewhat confused at least lol.  I don’t feel ready for “real” adult things. I’m settling for having a small one room apartment and going out on weekends, playing video games and holding down my job.   I thought I met the one but then I just got dumped. Before that I never thought about anything beyond the present for that kind of thing. Even for this it was more a gut feeling than concrete planning. Plus it wasn’t official, but... gut feelings.  I place soooo many thoughts on my appearance and food holy fuck.  The only thing I kinda feel “adult” on is that I do have more life experience in some regards to my younger friends. I lived through a lot of rough things as a teenager and it’s part of the reason I also feel like those years his disappeared. I try to take what happened then and apply it to my friends for things they can learn from because I love them and want them to have good lives. Kinda like a big sister sorta thing.   Maybe everything else will fall into place someday, Idk.   Idk idk idk.   All I do know is... healing is a process patiently waiting for us all whenever we are ready. I don’t necessarily mean from EDs but just anything really? Kinda thinking about that a lot recently. It’s okay to take your time growing up and it’s your own path you have to forge. It’s not a race and the only good fight is trying whatever you want to try each day. It’s all good! ",False,False

Once I got to actual adulthood it kind of hit me that now I will never really get a chance to just relax, have fun and have people take care of me and I think that broke my brain a bit - I was a high achiever in school but I shirked my responsibilities as an adult to finally 'relax' and ended up dropping out of uni (went back but will finish post-grad 3 years later than planned, don't know if I'll even do my PhD now :() and just fucking around basically - I feel like now I have achieved less than I easily could have because I was sick of having to be an adult I guess, not to mention when you're a kid taking care of yourself you don't exactly teach yourself good discipline. I thought that I would be a great 'adult' because I took care of myself as a kid but that wasn't the case, and fucking around in early adulthood definitely didn't help me capture the feeling of being a kid it just made me feel like a fuckup. My ED didn't really develop until I was an adult either because I think I liked that I could control something in my life.  Congrats on your academic achievement, I hope your PhD is enjoyable. You really have achieved stuff and I hope you can feel some contentment in that one day. ",False,False

I just had this exact thought today, thinking of the fact that my first day of high school is so far away now. I can't remember it at all, but I *can* vividly remember enough things from high school that it's anxiogenic to think its so far away now. I lost all of that time and a bit more to this body insecurity, anxiety, and perfectionism. I'm not independent at all, but I feel your post holds up a mirror anyhow. In a sense, I feel stuck in a stasis of my own creation. I never really *grew up* like I was supposedly meant to.",False,False

Throughout my childhood and teens, I always felt older. Keeping the intensity of my disorder a secret from my family forced me to grow up and I never stopped to enjoy the opportunities of my youth.

Thank you for making me feel less lonely.   It's really hard not to think about who I could be now if I hadn't gone through what I did, and it makes me very bitter.
