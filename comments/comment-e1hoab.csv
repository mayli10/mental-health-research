I know I used to be that way. I mean I don't think I was oblivious enough to mix people up, but if you asked me to remember what someone's body looked like from several years ago, I can't. Yet I can remember the clothes they were wearing if it was some event, or numerical info like birthdays, phone numbers, and the like (not eidetic memory but it's fairly decent) because I never registered body size as something to note in my memory. Upcoming birthdays, yes. Someone getting a haircut, yes. Usually things I think people would like to have noticed or remembered about themselves. And you would have had to deviate significantly from a normal weight to be considered ""bigger"" as a descriptor if someone wanted to know who I was referring to (as in, clinically obese). So I think your coworkers are just confusing your face with hers because you both have gorgeous facial features",False,False

It was then that I realized she thought I was my coworker, who was 7 months pregnant... That one messed me up for a LONG time.   I’ve also had coworkers mistake me for this other girl many, many times and she is pretty big. She’s actually like super gorgeous but probably 50lbs overweight... It’s a really bad feeling honestly. :(",False,False
