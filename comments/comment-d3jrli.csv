I also had an alcoholic either completely neglectful or overly controlling overly critical mother. It was just me and her after my parents divorced at 7 and she was pretty terrible to live with.   My mother was also a bulimic. When I was 7 or 8 I remember feeling sick from overeating. My mom showed me how to stick my fingers down my throat to throw up and “feel better”. I did it a lot as a kid. I overate a lot to deal with the constant abuse.   And then as a teenager my mom was very controlling and unpredictable. Like I never knew what to expect. And she was always critical of my body and making comments. And at some point I took control where I could and started using the purging for weight control and also restricting. And she did not give a shit. She yelled at me for purging too loudly a few times.   Fast forward me hiding my behavior like a pro for the next 20’ish years of weight fluctuating hell until my health started taking a hit recently and I am trying to get myself some help in my 30’s. I don’t recommend.,False,False

The years of sexual abuse really made me feel a lot of shame and disgust tword my body. That combined with the fact that I'm transgender means that I'm always like yikes at my body. I self harmed in non ed ways since middle school, but when I got to college I reached a turning point with my methods of self harm. I suddenly didnt like the ugly physical marks and the clean up and the judgement. I wanted somthing I could hide and justify. Cue me downloading a calorie app. I convinced myself that it really was just me wanting The Skinny and Nothing Else. Obviously it was much more than that but I couldn't see at the time. Fast forward to a college break , my gf finds my apps and freaks. Get better or it's over. Ok. I dont.  Fast forward to the next break. Were over for now unless you get better. Ok. I actually get better. Fast forward to this summer. My close friend is revealed to be a sexual predator. Cue that bringing up memories of my own personal sexual trauma and my trust issues related to people and consent and who can I trust and whatever. Cue me picking up a drinking habit. Fast forward to now, 2nd year of college. I realize my eating disorder is and always has been about self hatred and self harm. It's about me not thinking I deserve food. It's about me wanting to punish myself. It's about me needing a way to hurt myself to make sense of anything. I realized this recently, when I was hungry but too guilty to eat real food. So I was straight up eating protien powder and I didnt give one fuck about the calories,  cause they didnt ""count"" , cause it wasn't ""real food"" (the suff I ""dont deserve""). Anways, this week my friend brought up my ed . We talked. She was very kind and helpful and I appreciate her a lot for that. I made a counseling appointment for the 24th that I really want to go to and I want to be honest in. I want out of this stupid disease. I need help and I can admit that to myself even if it feels fake outloud.",False,False

They were both insane, extremely violent and religious and would punish me and my siblings with food/lack of. Often we would go three or four days at a time with one apple per day. I remember at least once when I was 12 or 13 being forced to eat rice with live maggots mixed in :/ i can't even look at rice now. but most of the time, they forgot we existed and we would have to prepare our own (unhealthy af) food. I was overweight as a child from eating nothing but rice, pasta and bread. I ate my feelings from a very young age.   My mom had an eating disorder and was extremely overweight - she would go on these crazy diets that she made me go on too. Like she would eat nothing but honey and lemon juice in water for ages, or nothing but tuna. When she left my father, we moved to a new house and a lot of the terrible food restriction stopped, so i developed binge eating disorder because suddenly there was food, any kind i wanted, without limits. I was 15 then, and got SUPER overweight until I was 19/20.  Then after finally moving out and seeking therapy for my insane childhood, I had a bunch of repressed memories come up to crush me (my father being a head of a pedophile ring and molesting me with his friends since I was 5) plus a bunch of other terrible memories/flashbacks, PTSD, further undiagnosed trauma related mental illnesses etc etc. and I immediately, suddenly, resolved to starve.That was two years ago.  It was a little weird, because I knew what I was getting into with that decision, and I made a conscious decision to restrict my food from one day onwards until I was underweight. It was like a switch got flipped, one lunch time, sitting on my sofa. I made a decision, and I stuck to it. I've been seriously restricting food ever since, and while it was a controlled decision at the start, it no longer is any more. I've been restricting for two years, lost insane amounts of weight. I guess I feel like I chose to have anorexia, but I know that I just substituted one for another in a time of high stress. My stats say EDNOS because I binge/purge sometimes, but I'm too scared to see a doctor to get diagnosed.  Now, the more stress I'm under, the more I restrict. Especially at the moment, being too mentally unwell to work and crippled by really bad mental health - having no money, no support, close to homelessness, enduring threats and stalking from family. My eating disorder is a way of passive suicide, I guess. It's not about body image for me so much as the only type of control I have over my life. Over eating  was a way of subconsciously protecting myself from sexual abuse and beatings,  and the feelings that that stuff brought up, and now restricting is a way of self harm/self punishment in order to cope with the therapy/ptsd/aftermath of my childhood. It's pretty fucked.  So that's my eating disorder story. Thanks for reading, and the opportunity to share &lt;3",False,False

Didn't really have friends, parents got divorced and I got shoved into a basement apartment with my mom who worked 50 hours a week. I turned to food. I got bullied.  At 12 my mom was still working as much, got into meth, never ate, didn't keep food in the house. I coped with the internet, and somehow fell into a pro ana community. I knew what eating disorders were, and for ages I convinced myself I didn't have one, because I ""made myself do it to lose weight"". I was also diagnosed bipolar around this time and coped horribly with that.  I ""recovered"" for a few years, dropped out of high school. Met a girlfriend, moved in with her 2,000 miles away from home. Got my first job. Never ever ate, fell horribly deeper into ED patterns. Started smoking. Got rejected by girlfriend. Got attention from men for being the thinnest I had ever been. Slept around, made being thin and in control my worth.  Broke up, moved back home. Met the love of my life, started eating again, started drinking. Believed I was recovered. And maybe was for a few years, but my most recent job left me broke, at my heaviest weight, and we all know how dieting goes for someone never professionally treated. Fell deep in again. And here I am.  That felt good, thank you.",False,False

When I started following my rules, I instantly felt relief, a sense of accomplishment, and like my days have structure and routine.  My ED was compound by the fear of losing control, because when I was a child, my father enabled and encouraged me to binge, leading to me becoming a stress eater and emotional eater with no concept of moderation. I'm scared that if I stop restricting, I'll revert back to overeating like I did as a child (possibly without noticing) and gain weight uncontrollably, because I still constantly have the urge to eat everything in sight.",False,False

I chose outpatient, because i still had things in my life i wanted to do and I was desperate not to fall ""further behind"" my peers.  I spent about 1.5 years doing OP. I started binging to bring my weight up, and my self esteem and mental health sunk. The one thing I felt I could do ""well"" was now branded bad. My weight loss was ""destroying my body."" I felt as if I had only succeeded at becoming even more of a failure.   School was tough. My grades were ok. I started doing a bunch of activities in a desperate quest to become somebody worthy. I didn't care about almost anything I did, and I felt like I was failing at all of it. I felt like I was falling further and further behind my peers. Instead of giving me some sense of success, disordered eating was now just another failure. I watched the people in my grade do random diets, gain and lose weight, eat salads, exercise, ect, and felt inadequate both for not dieting and for dieting. Not adhering to rules anymore made me feel like a failure. Adhering to rules, however, didn't give me any relief. It just meant that I would be failing in other ways.  Weight restoration was also tough. My mother made it clear that she was unhappy with how I wasn't recovering quickly enough. She criticized my body, chastised me for my habits, shamed me and outed me to others. I feared every visit with the dietitian and doctor. I binged and binged on ""healthy"" (safe) items to gain weight out of the fear that if I failed at recovering, I would never be allowed to go out and start living again, and I would be 'trapped' and, again, be even further behind my peers.  I felt an enormous sense of guilt in outpatient. I felt it was money and time wasted on me, as I did not think I was disordered and needed any treatment. I was taking the place of someone who needed help. I was desperate to get out ASAP.  I lied to my therapist about how I felt and got out of therapy quickly. The rest took longer because I needed to get to a certain weight and have my menstrual cycle back for 3 months.   Shortly before graduating high school, I ""graduated"" from the OP program. My mom was happy. I felt empty and broken.   I recommenced restricting within a month, trying to find that sense of self and up my esteem once more.   The summer after high school I had an internship. It was fairly competitive, I got in, but I felt like it was a mistake to take me. I compared myself to the college students and post-bac students in the program and saw myself as inferior. I also compared myself to the tiny girls in my lab. I felt inadequate. I continued restricting, but in my mind I saw the amount I ate as much more than what anyone else ate. I no longer got any smug satisfaction from dietary control. I felt simultaneously bad about not controlling my diet and for being overly controlling/overly focused on my eating.   I began college and changed up how I controlled my diet. Weight loss continued. I felt inadequate, but I would isolate myself and avoid interactions that would make me feel even more inadequate. I quit everything I had done in high school and started fresh so I had no 'prior experience' to measure up to.  My mom became ill and I got to a weight a little too close to my LW for comfort. I decided I did not want to risk anything happening and setting me back. I started eating more and stabilized. I began biking. The amount of exercise I got from biking gave me an immense sense of fulfillment. Being outdoors, I think, aided my mental health. I felt much happier. I stopped feeling empty at some point. I started to loosen up my control, allow more things, greater quantities, more 'bad foods.' I aimed to gain weight to restore my menstrual cycle.   I began my second year and continued building myself. I gained weight through most of my second year. I was feeling good. I joined more activities and enjoyed them. The future was bright at the beginning of my second year.  This did not last. Novel activities became routine, and the feelings of inadequacy returned. I started avoiding meetings at one of my activities (research) out of the shame of being an 'inadequate researcher.' I felt unworthy again.  Late in my second year, I referred to my intentional weight gain as a ""freshman 15."" Something flipped. I became angry that my period had not come back yet, given I was above the weight I had lost it. I got even more into biking and started aiming to lose weight, now repulsed by my body. Perhaps I needed a boost as my mental health dipped.  My mom went through another illness. I continued dietary control well into my third year. I was so-so, still feeling unworthy, but the 'high' of weight loss and control had returned, and I got through, until this year (nowish) where I began having extreme hunger. I quit my undergrad research and began in a new internship, pursued deeper involvement in some activities, again trying to build myself.   Currently, I'm trying to succeed and get better at the things I do. I am aiming to weight restore for the purpose of getting my menstrual cycle back, among other things.",False,True

My mom had her hand in helping me construct a shitty body image with her own self-disgust and some shame and guilt directed at me.  I have a theory that if my ex-stepfather hadn’t been a factor, I’d still have an ED, but probably it would not involve any puking.  I moved around constantly, with my mom and later living with a series of relatives, and in a way I used my ED as a substitute for friends: it gave me comfort and was familiar no matter what else changed around me.  I still use my ED to give me comfort and familiarity; after being mostly recovered for years, I relapsed following a series of scary and traumatic experiences and now I feel stuck in it again.  When I think about doing the work of giving up my behaviours, I feel rising panic and fear in my chest.  I *need* it.  I don’t like the feeling, it is like being owned by something else.  I’m on a waiting list for treatment and I’m determined not to stay like this, but I’m also really scared because I am struggling to imagine life without it, even though it wasn’t that long ago that I had set it aside.",False,False
