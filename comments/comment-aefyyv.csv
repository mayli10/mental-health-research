I absolutely know how hard it is to hear (and to do!), but you absolutely need to put on some body fat.  Not to scare you too much, but this level of physiological compensation is getting to the far end of the serious spectrum.  ",False,False

You're getting close to moving UNDER the ""essential body fat"" levels for females or may already be under it. So your body is gonna start really acting up. It's not happy. At this point, if you want to have this stop happening, you need to gain body fat, even tho that is the last thing you want to hear. I hope you can get it sorted out.

It was EXTREMELY unsettling and at the time I refused to admit it was due to my low body fat levels (I was down to 95 pounds at 5'7"").  LIke others have said, your digestion is one of the first things to stop working (I had chronic daily diarrhea for about a year leading up to this) and then muscle wasting.  I had literally NO muscle on my body, so my body started to attack my sphincter muscle too.     Please take care of yourself.  I didn't see it at the time, wouldn't believe it if someone had told me, but it's absolutely true.",False,False

It indicates a loss of muscle tone in the bowel/ sphincters and I believe those sorts of things (digestion, excretion etc) are the first to shut down when the body is starved, followed by organs.   Hopefully it’s generalised digestion issues, but OP if you are underweight I strongly urge you to see a professional and be completely honest with them. ",False,False

Because I've heard of this happening before with someone who is severely underweight. My knowledge on the matter only extends so far, however, since I don't remember much of what I've been told about it but it's definitely worth looking into via a visit to your GP. And if you don't want to go to your doctor in specific or don't want your parents to find out if you're underage then you can still visit a hospital. Or even a free clinic (though, be prepared for long waiting if you go with the latter.)  I'm sorry I don't have much advice as of the moment since I'm quite tired and in the midst of studying but as for the ""right now"" situation; since you said you're having trouble sleeping because of this then have you tried sleeping in an overnight maxi pad? If you're a female, that is. But honestly, you could technically still do this even if you're a male so long as you have maxi pads in your house (i.e. if you live with women.) I'm only saying this as an option since you most likely don't have actual diapers on hand. But at least with the security of an overnight maxi pad, it may give you more of a peace mind to sleep?

It’s happened to me before. I’ve been woken up by stomach cramps after taking the tea and still had to go when I would have gone normally in the morning.
