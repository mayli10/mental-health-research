It's impossible for food to contain millions of calories. Everyone needs a treat every once in awhile and there's nothing wrong with having a dessert or treat when you want it. Many people can do it and be fine.  One day I want to be like you! Thank you for sharing this! I swear that I'm almost satisfied with myself and in a place where I can start approaching eating more I want to try and transition myself into ""normal"" eating again and be able to have things without worrying about the calories every once in awhile. I just feel like I've gained a lot of weight over 4 days I tried to give myself over the holidays and I can't tell if it's still water weight or actual water weight.  2020 will be better, 2019 was a dumpster fire for me personally. We got this!",False,False
