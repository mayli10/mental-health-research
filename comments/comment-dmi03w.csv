My ED developed a few years into our relationship and it has fluctuated since then. In the past year my partner started losing weight and I felt the need to lose more too, and so I ended up underweight. Luckily normal people have no idea what an underweight body looks like so I'm pretty sure he hasn't noticed. I try not to let it affect our relationship too much.",False,False

My Ed has always given me a barrier from really having an emotional connection to someone. I’ve never used a dating app, I usually date from the guys that approach me.  I’m glad to know I’m not alone and that many others here with ed also are on the low end margin in dating. Maybe my ed really is the reason for my lack in dating experience.",False,False

I also found out he was acting shady as fuck while we were together so that's basically sent my ED into overdrive because now I don't even think he actually liked me and my dumb brain is telling me it's because I'm fat and gross (and have a terrible personality) and that I need to reduce myself to bones if I want to feel better about myself.

Honestly all the sites are full of absolute trash people, but there are some good people. It can be very exhausting filtering out all the trash, some people can send angry messages if you don't respond quickly or at all (literally I wouldn't respond for 10 minutes and some people got mad lmao). Ton of people looking for hookups, even if you explicitly state that you're not interested in that. But I met my current bf on okCupid, so it wasn't a completely bad experience (we've been together 2.5 yrs and live together now). It's worth a shot, you don't have to meet up with anyone if you don't want to : )  In terms of telling them about your ED, I don't really have experience in this :\\ I had disordered habits before meeting my bf, but I became aware that I have an ED during the beginning of our relationship and it was a really rough first year. I only briefly mentioned to my bf about my ED last week, and he hasn't said anything about it and I'm too scared to bring it up again, so I'm not sure what he thinks. Now I'm basically paranoid whenever we eat or talk about food, because I don't know if he forgot I told him about it, or if he's looking at how much I'm eating, or whatever the fuck he's thinking. If I could do it differently, I think I should've told him in the beginning/when I found out I had a problem, definitely before we moved in together lol. Some people don't want to date people with mental health issues. I highly doubt that I could emotionally deal with a partner who has severe mental health issues, especially if they have an ED.",False,False
