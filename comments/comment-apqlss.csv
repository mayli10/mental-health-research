My mom saw my plastic surgeon the other day (I'm getting a breast reduction and rhinoplasty done on June 18th). Apparently he told her in a very worried tone that I shouldn't lose any more weight. My bf pointed out that this was probably breach of patient/doctor confidentiality because she hasn't been to an appointment with me since the very first one back in August. I've just been overweight since I was like 13, and I still think I'm very fat, so this was kind of a shock to me. Like, it's not like I have a restrictive ED. I don't even have bulimia ffs.
