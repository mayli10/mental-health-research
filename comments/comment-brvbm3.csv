The issue is that our skin and tissue tear SUPER easily so pregnancy is a huge risk of tearing inside your body that would effect the baby. vEDS effects literally every system in my body but the main thing about all types of EDS is that I have like 20+ dislocations on a daily basis. Like right now, multiple vertebrae are out of place, both my hips, and my rib cage which already has a cracked rib from the last time I had to relocate it two days ago. EDS in general is a complicated thing but finally finding it probably saved my life. I doubt any of my doctors would have figured it out. But vEDS is also terminal. But I’m still more likely to die from not getting surgery first. To be fair, it is a lot easier for the doctors who abused me to just let me die so I’d shut up about how bad they are at their jobs that they spent 11-15 years studying for for what seems to be no reason",False,True

If you want to talk about it I know a good bit about GI diseases, I could maybe at least help show you the direction to take.",False,True

My mom has IBS and she doesn't experience things the same way I do. Lately I've been kind of worried that it might be something else, but I don't know much about GI diseases, so I can't even guess what. I really hope it doesn't end up being something that requires surgery. :(",False,False

I’m so sorry you struggle with this too, it’s disgusting that this is the way chronic pain/illness is treated my doctors and the rest of the able bodied world.

I had a second meal today and strongly regret it. That doesn't have anything to do with my ED. Every meal just makes me feel sick. Of course, so does not eating, so it's bad either way, y'know? On top of that I'm also thinking about how much food is probably in me right now and that's not fun. Today in an email my doctor also mentioned she hadn't even contacted a specialist for me yet because she wanted to talk to me more about my problems first despite the fact that she told me to schedule my next appointment for three months after the last one. That's still like a month and a half away. Being chronically sick is literally the worst thing ever...
