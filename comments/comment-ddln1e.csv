I think my bf is just food phobic from about 10yrs of severe nauseous that led to him being very picky on when and what he eats. He’s 5’11” and maybe 150? And that’s after two years of us being together and me making him eat more(hypocrisy I know),False,False

One of them will postpone eating until they absolutely have to. They're both on ADHD meds too which take your appetite away. I'd venture to say most ""naturally thin"" people just have small appetites",False,False

My SO currently is ridiculously thin, too, probably a similar BMI as your boyfriend. And it’s not due to an ED. He’s legitimately just too lazy to make food and puts off eating until he’s a hungry bitch or I shove food at him. He grew up poor so going hungry for a while is just a part of living, at this point.   Could also be something up with his digestive system, thyroid, hormone levels, etc.",False,False

Doesn't sound like anorexia unless he's hiding it from you. I really can't imagine how he would be healthy at that weight unless he has a very tiny frame. I'm also a guy and my lowest was 6'1 and 124lbs and I was basically dying, I'm 128 now and still look very ill according to other people.",False,False
