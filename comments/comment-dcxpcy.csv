I appreciate your willingness to listen and adjust, it takes a lot to do that. And please don‚Äôt take my original comment too seriously, I literally said the same thing to my husband the other day when he said he had a big poop. I probably get too defensive when things on this sub ping as untrue or exaggerated because so many creeps/weirdos make things up to take advantage of vulnerable people with EDs.

It's a lot and I'm sure it's been really hard to cope. Don't let the shit hes put you through control you like that.  This isn't really realivent to your initial post, but to your responses to other users.   If I had to take a stab at why some users see a fecicious story, its because it seems a little like ""oh I'm so skinny I get called out by teens"" it reads a little like an Anna butterfly fan fic. I'm not saying this to try and hurt you. We all want to feel validated in how thin we are, or hope we are or whatever. It feels good to have someone, a stranger, notice.  Sometimes people say things that hurt us or strike a nerve (intentionally or not) I think maybe a better response to the flex comment would have been something like ""you bet I'm flexin'"" its kind of the kill 'em with kindness approach. It's always better to strike up a dialogue then immediately get defensive.  I really hope you get through all the shit life is throwing at you. I think your desire to get through is apparent.",False,False
