Friends i know are depriving themselves or dieting in some capacity or another always act like it’s just natural they’re so thin as if that makes it better. Folks just own up to the fact that being super skinny is a full time job for some people.,False,False

I can’t stand when models say that they are eating burgers and pizza every single day. The Victoria’s Secret models that walk in the show state that they often stop eating for a few days beforehand, then the whole day before often don’t even drink any water so they can be at their absolute skinniest. Can we not act like that’s normal?",False,False
