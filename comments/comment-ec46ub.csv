I kind had an epiphany this weekend that a lot of people photoshop/choose angles really extremely. Like, I obviously knew people who did it, but i also live in a major city where walking is a necessity and people tend to be thin/grew up around suburbia where people are always on keto or atkins or doing yoga or some crazy exercise fad. And i was working with this girl this semester and shes pretty thin, but i would guess her weight and size to be around mine, give or take 2 lbs. But her instagram... i wouldâ€™ve guessed shes 10 lbs lighter. I think she takes pics on white walls and slims up her arms on them, or uses that feature that lengthens your legs. Its frustrating because i wonder how many body goals type people ive found on insta who i havent seen in real life in a while who are legitimately as thin as they appear to be.",False,False
