I need clinical help because of the BDSM part? or because I am (assumed by you) a homosexual man?      Two things that do not affect you, unless you WANT them to. And yet, you seem affected by them.   &amp;#x200B;  Your life sounds fraught with pain. You came here, a place where people are vulnerable, to prod at tender wounds. Nothing to be gained but pain by strangers, and a fleeting sense of... what, joy, for you?     Legitimately: I pity you. This is not meant to condescend, I truly do wish you get support and help. You are, ironically, in a subreddit where lots of people could probably sympathize with struggles that result in lashing out against others.",False,False
