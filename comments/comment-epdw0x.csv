There is no such thing as ""metabolic damage."" As you consume less and less calories, your body slows down your metabolism by cutting certain processes(NEAT is cut, less calories are burned via exercise, TEF is smaller), and of course your BMR goes down as you get smaller. Once you begin eating in a surplus/maintenance, your body begins reintroducing those processes. You fidget more, your body heats up, you burn more calories through exercise, and your TEF goes up. Plus, as you build muscle and regain \*VITAL\* fat that has been lost, your BMR will increase. (NEAT= non activity thermogenesis, TEF= thermic effect of food)  &amp;#x200B;  TL;DR: no. You cannot permanently damage your metabolism. Eat some food and itll speed right back up.",False,False

The brain, the heart, the bones...some damage is hard to undo, especially when it’s happening during a time of life when the body is trying to develop. I try not to use threats and fear to motivate myself to change (since my patterns of doing that were part of the problem for me) but I *do* think about how I really do want a healthy brain for my career and want healthy bones for an active life.   I don’t know any statistics on metabolic damage, but I had a decade in recovery after a few years UW and while the fear of damage stayed with me, I was able to eat fairly normally - like in the ballpark of a TEEE estimate. I think studies do show that the quicker we can start healing the better the chance of a good long-term outcome.",False,False

I didn’t binge and also didn’t eat breakfast because I’m nauseous in the morning. I also wasn’t even near underweight, in fact, I was closer to overweight since I started restricting when I was obese. Your best bet is to up your calories slowly over months. Aka, by 100 calorie increments weekly. For example, 1000 calories the first week, 1100 calories 2nd week, 1200 calories the following week.",False,False

I had a teacher in high school who was overweight and told us she’d had an ED when she was younger and it ruined her metabolism and now she couldn’t lose weight. Not sure if true or an excuse.,False,False
