How much cereal can I eat? Full box of cereal and milk SCORE! One is a little low, damn... how much can I get away with? A handful of crackers... a few more... a few more.... some cheese will go unnoticed. And then dinner time was always a sit down thing if I wasn't working late.... AND all the treats MIL baked plus hubby and I would get high and binge eat together.  The worst is my MIL is severely anorexic so binging there always left me feeling even worse about myself. That's also where the BED and weight gain started. Not sure where I'm going with this now lol",False,False
