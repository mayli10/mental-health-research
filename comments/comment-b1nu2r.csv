I know that I fell for him very quickly and he hadn't been in a relationship in all that time. Metaphorically, he would get very close, then suddenly backpedal from the idea of us for no discernible reason. He had a very bad incident with his health about two years ago, literally died and was resuscitated. Something happened between us right before that incident, I mean literally right before, and it seemed like something was finally, finally going to happen for the better. Then he woke up in the hospital and couldn't remember any of it due to oxygen starvation. His family thought I was his girlfriend until I gently told them I wasn't. Through everyone's time in the hospital waiting rooms they grew to really like me and I think his mom even told him that he needed to keep me because I was there every moment I could be and bringing them food. Then... I don't know. He told me that he didn't remember any of it. He was in physical rehab, and what kind of person would I be if I wasn't anything less than 110% supportive that he focus on himself and his family? Then I had to leave for school. I'd try to text him, but he was short in his responses if I even got them. Then he found out two weeks ago that I was coming to visit, said he was excited to see me and that we should get together. Hope sparked again, I was working out like a fiend, eating clean, and drinking endless water so that I would look radiant. Then I go on Facebook the other night and see that he's in a relationship with a girl that none of us had ever heard of. My heart felt like it fell through my body and I got really feverish and started crying. I absolutely love him as a person. I liked him so, so much. I STILL do. I wanted it to be him so badly.
