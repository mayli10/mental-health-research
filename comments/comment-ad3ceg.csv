I love my brother but he totally outed my weight loss next to my mother (who was already on high alert bc of finding out about purging) by saying ""of you've gotten boney!!!"" Nd of course stupid ED brain wanted validation so I said ""yeah I've lost about 12 pounds"" and my mom was all ""what?? How many?? Dont lose anymore weight"" and now everytime she talks to me she tells me not to lose more weight because I'm almost too skinny  The ""almost"" kills me every time. Like, just let me be too skinny and not almost too skinny. Pls.",False,False
