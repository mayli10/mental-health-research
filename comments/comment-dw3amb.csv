We actually have the same exact stats, down to the lb, which is crazy! And I, too, have noticed that at this weight, my body is fighting back as well. The mental fog, fatigue, irritability etc. make getting through each day so, so difficult. I’ve been at this weight for a couple months now and I’ve got to emphasize— you are doing the *right* thing for your body! I went through something similar when I first hit 108– I said fuck it, I deserve to eat and my body needs it, and I “ate normally” but quickly realized how insatiably hungry I really was. I didn’t track calories but I know I easily ate a solid 3,000+ calories that day too.    And I’m nowhere near recovered so take whatever I say with a grain of salt, but since then I’ve been attempting to eat at maintenance which has at least helped me to not lose any more weight, but I also haven’t gained either (which will be my next step.) But there are days when I’m ravenous and probably eat more than maintenance (like on the first day I ate normally), and other days when I’m not nearly as hungry. Don’t be too afraid of those days when you’re particularly hungry— I know it’s terrifying and I still sometimes try to drown out/ignore my hunger cues, but it ultimately only makes me feel worse. When I eat around maintenance, I find my mood a little brighter and my mind a little less foggy. Next step for me is to gain enough weight to be within a healthy BMI range, but I’m admittedly taking baby steps.   Sorry that this is so long-winded, but I want you to know I’m proud of your progress and I am here for you if you ever need to talk/vent!!",False,False
