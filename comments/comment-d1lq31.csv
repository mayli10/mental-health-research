The first few times are a lot more rough, but after a while, you get used to it. It can sometimes feel like you‚Äôre in control of the food inside of you. For instance, different techniques can bring out different kinds of food; you know what‚Äôs going to come up, so you can brace yourself. Your upper esophageal sphincter is more accustomed to opening due to gag reflex.  That said, I have‚Äôt involuntarily thrown up since I was like 10, and it is definitely not something I look forward to. With voluntary purging, you don‚Äôt experience the constant nausea that makes you wanna curl up in bed and wish you were asleep..and you don‚Äôt really know what contractions are coming when, so you can‚Äôt really brace yourself.",False,False

You'll be pacing in circles with wild eyes looking like you've done every drug in the world.  4. Do the mental debate. Ah fuck shouldn't purge it hurts and I was doing so well. Ah god I don't want to get fat my stomach is distended fuck fuck fuck I must get rid of it I must make it stop oh no oh no.  5. Give in. Choke a couple times. Snort out spit and tears and drool down your hands. Get an odd sense of satisfaction that you've got it under control. 6. Numbness.  7. I won't do it again. Tomorrow's a brand new day.

Purging for me was always effortless and I didn't feel much physical sensations from it aside my throat burning after a while. I remember overcoming my purging habits for a while, though, and at some point during that period before I relapsed into disordered eating again I caught a major stomach flu and the one thing I remember most from that is that when I vomited involuntarily (which was happening, like, 3 times a day for almost a week lmao) it seemed my body was really \*forcing\* the food up, making all the muscles around my stomach seize so hard that it hurt and it came up really violently. Purging is different from this because I think there's a lot less of your abdominal muscles being used to force up the food - it comes up much less violently, which is why a lot of bulimics including myself find that self-induced vomiting is a long ordeal that takes a good while to really get everything up. Very inefficient, quite frankly. 2/10.",False,False
