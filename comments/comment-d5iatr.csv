I'm now 14 and a half and i still haven't got my first period, but i have no fucking idea if it's due to my not-ed or just being a \~late bloomer\~. Either way my ribs only show in a very specific lighting, and barely, so NO VALIDATION FOR MEeEeeE",False,False

But the book is called “The Secret Life of Fat: The Science Behind the Body's Least Understood Organ and What It Means for You” by Sylvia Tara. She has a PhD in biochemistry but the way she narrates and talks about herself in her intro... lowkey gives off ednos vibes.,False,False

Either way I don’t get my period anymore. Usually if your body fat drops below 18% women typically won’t get their period. People who don’t get their period at normal weight or being overweight are usually malnourished or may have a hormone prob/Imbalance, but body fat needs to drop below 18%. At 19% it’s usually spotty or irregular. That’s why a lot of ballerinas who have a really low bf% get amenorrhea and after their dancing careers are over and they decide that they’ve want children, they try to gain weight to increase their bf% for pregnancy. It’s all in a book I read about ~the importance of~ FAT. Let me know if you want to read it and I can tell you the title/author.",False,False
