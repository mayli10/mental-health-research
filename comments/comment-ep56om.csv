I am a full time student and I currently don't make enough money to visit bi monthly (Europe to America isn't cheap) also, we both have mental health issues so I know when things get hard to talk about and like I said on my original post, I used to have an Ed to, which does have its returns at times. I know I have to trust them on eating enough and I do but a part of me won't be satisfied and I told my therapist that. All in all were there for each other.",False,True

As an ex-sufferer, have you tried putting yourself in their mindset a little? I know for me personally, I really struggle to open up to my other half when it comes to not coping; you begin to think your issues a burden on the other person, and then you worry about worrying them constantly and it just becomes easier to... not, I suppose? I can’t speak for your other half but it’s a sentiment I’ve heard echoed a few times when it comes to struggling to open up.   Having said that, that doesn’t make it okay for the person to bottle their feelings up. It’s hard because you can’t make someone talk to you (+ pressure usually just makes someone more zip-mouthed), which leaves you with little option. I think talking to them about it was a really good step in the right direction — sometimes people need to hear that silence hurts your heart more than listening to their despair — and I hope that from that they start sharing more with you, should anything happen again. (On this note, I’d maybe recommend trying to avoid showing them how angry/annoyed it make you as it could discourage them from talking about it?)  As for what you can do, the only physical thing I can think of is visiting more often or getting in contact with someone you trust to keep an eye on them when you can’t. Both of these may ease your mind a little, though I’m unsure how your other half may feel about you keeping tabs on them?  At the end of the day, it’s important that you remind yourself that being there for someone in that situation is the most important thing you can do. EDs are secretive behaviours anyway (so even if you were together all the time it would be hard to tell), but most of the time the sufferer knows their own limits and their own times even they need to reach out for help. You just gotta hold on for long enough to catch them when they fall.   When in doubt just think to yourself, what would I have wanted when that was me? &amp; more importantly, what did I need?   [ this is far longer than I meant and I’m not even sure if it was helpful at all I’m SO sorry ]",False,False
