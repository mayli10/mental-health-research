Good god that’s toxic. Y’all I’m sorry I’m salty today but I’m so pissed my fellow friends are getting treated so shitty!!   Honestly maybe walking away when she starts is the best. And if she asks why you’re walking away you could tell her,  “I cannot listen to you when you criticize me or my body in this manner. It hurts me deeply and it’s not good for me to hear it.”  If she keeps going on, just walk away or leave. There’s no reason to listen to her be nasty or to engage. You do you and remember she’s the one with the problem and is in the wrong. She clearly is miserable and is projecting her issues onto you. I bet she says you’re fat so she won’t feel so bad about her weight. “Well if my kid is fat, I’m really not that bad off!” Obviously you’re not based on your stats-even though I know you feel differently about it. The numbers don’t lie, just your perception. Anyways I’m so sorry you have to deal with this ♥️",False,False

I think you logically understand that this doesn't make any sense -- obviously she has her own very serious issues. Part of that seems like a lot of insecurity about her own body, and part of it appears to be an abusive personality. It seems like, in her head she's thinking since you're underweight and she hates her own body, you must be thinking mean things about her body. And maybe to ""get back at you"" about that, she's saying ridiculous things because she knows it'll be hurtful. She's trying to make herself feel better, but her feelings aren't normal or healthy or appropriate.     The important part is: you don't deserve to be treated like that.",False,False

She clearly has some profound emotional issues surrounding weight/body image, and is taking them out on you. It's understandable you'd relapse, and I'm sorry you're going through this.
