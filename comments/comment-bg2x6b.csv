If I fast, 2/3 pounds are usually lost.  Though, this honestly varies a lot. This is assuming I was eating regularly. If I was fasting then binged, my weight would go up more.   The most I've gained in a 24-hour period is 9 pounds.  And then, if I b/p, if I don't eat anything else for the day other than that b/p, I usually lose.",False,False

Anywhere between 1lb and 12. Just getting near to my period makes me immediately gain 6lb water weight. I'm up 9lbs right now since Friday because I had 3 days in a row of eating slightly above maintenance. No way I've put on more than 1lb of actual fat but the scale is going to show a higher weight for the next week while I get all of the food and water waste out ðŸ˜’.,False,False

Last time I was up 4.5 lbs the morning after, and it didn't go away for 3 days. I sort-of binged again yesterday and this morning I'm only 1 lb up, but I was also dehydrated which I think played a role. We'll see what tomorrow looks like after I chug water today  Anyways, sorry if you were looking for a concrete answer. I find the fluctuations nearly impossible to predict.",False,False

My binges are usually about 3000-5000 cals so I count it as 0.5-1 lb of real weight and about 3 lbs of food and water weight. But nowadays I dont weigh my self for at least a couple of days after so I can be sure it's all gone.,False,False
