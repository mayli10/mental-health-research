Writing it down helps me prepare myself mentally, and holds yourself accountable. You can do sooo much with 1000-1200, so maybe consider setting aside 100-200 cals for something you like. I do that with dark chocolate and it's works well 90% of the time. But we all have bad days. I wouldn't really binge on dark chocolate, but I've tried having milk/white chocolate in moderation and failed miserably. Find something that works for you so you don't feel too restricted.
