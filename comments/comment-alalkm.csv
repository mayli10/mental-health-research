One of my roommates eats my cereal once in a while. It only happens when I buy ""normal people"" cereal like cinnamon toast crunch or something, so my strategy for a while has been to buy things like Bran Flakes, plain Shredded Wheat, and Fiber One, which he won't touch. But there's nothing more unnerving than opening the box and seeing the bag inside rolled up that certain way that means he's been eating my cereal.  &amp;#x200B;  I also blew up on him once for using my sugar-free ketchup. I literally bought regular ketchup for him and put it in the fridge afterwards. Touch my condiments and die, motherfucker.",False,False
