I canceled dates and dining out to be able to finish 2 sad parsnips &amp; an old apple. I am surrounded by people who dont care about that! My mum throw everything away. Sometimes I feel strangely jealous and most of the times I just make big dramas. Happy to find disordered bros and sis on this precious subreddit.,False,True

I don’t eat out so I can consume the groceries I have, and I cook everything in the order it expires. Even if I don’t know what to make, I throw everything on the counter that’s perishable/needs to be eaten and then I look for recipes to inspire me or just freestyle something based on what I have that’s going bad.   sometimes I pretend I’m on Chopped or something cooking show where you have challenge ingredients! however I’m bad about eating food after it’s expired.. can’t bring myself to throw it away. Somehow haven’t gotten food poisoning yet - knock on wood. Can’t tell you how many times I’ve scraped the mold off fruit/vegetables and eaten it anyway",False,False

The smoothie and fermentation options are really good. Idk anything about fermentation but I could read a bit and give it a try. If you have the kimchi recipe I am in ! I begin to think about meal plan, i sometimes buy the exact quantity of ingredients but sometimes idk why my brain shuts down and I mix the ingredients or just pick one to munch and... mission failed.   And meal prep reinforces my ano/orthorexia. This lack of spontaneity ends up to drive me crazy",False,True

But if it was a ""bad"" food, then major internal conflict...dont want to waste it but dont want to eat it so i just dump it on others to eat lol. I'm already well into recovery now so I've been working on this but my recommendation is to try (ik this is hard) to ignore food spoiling and decide what you vs your ED might fancy eating. A good assessment could be to ask ""is this Ed talking or is this (insert your name) talking?"" Could also have a family member help u in this by checking what u r eating vs expiration dates etc. Hope it helps :)",False,False
