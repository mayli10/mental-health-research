If you're ftm, you might want to look more top heavy? (sorry if I'm wrong, just what I'm assuming). It might help to try and excersise the top half of your body to build it up. And that could potentially make your bottom half look smaller by comparison? But that would mean eating more to build muscle which is really mentally hard for us ED people a lot of the time. My body fat goes to my hips which I hated but I've built more muscle in my butt which has made me slightly more comfortable with my distribution as I think I look stronger rather than flabby now. That's my experience as a cis female tho.",False,False

I’m not trans myself but I’d like a more androgynous figure, I feel u with the thigh problem :(",False,False
