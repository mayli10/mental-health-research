For example, I had about 3000 calories of food and alcohol yesterday, and today I could feel my clothes fitting tighter. I suspect that for a day or two I’ll still be up a number of pounds - because dehydration from alcohol plus increased salt intake would cause my body to retain water. But I didn’t have enough to gain a few pounds, so I’m drinking lots of water and tea to help my system get back to normal, and avoiding the scale for a while.",False,False

The same thing happens two days after drinking - my body trying to retain liquids and all.   Fluctuations happen and are normal. :) I’m sure you didn’t gain all that weight quickly especially If you were active! Wait a week then reevaluate after your body has had the chance to adjust.   I use an app called happy scale to deal with that panic - it stops me from binging when I see that my weight goes up and down but generally stays on course. It shows the general trend of your weight and projected weight, so that fluctuations due to things like this don’t bother you as much or get you off track. Check it out!",False,False

Still though, six pounds isn't too bad! Given how hard it is to maintain in a situation like that, I'd say that's one hell of an achievement.",False,False
