Including saying you want to go to therapy because your eating disorder has affected your ability to attend school.   I would also mention working. If you're working and going to school full time, you have a lot on your plate. Mix in any mental health issue and you're basically fucked, or at least that was my experience with college.   I've found people are surprisingly understanding if you talk to them. But if you don't communicate that your disorder got in the way, they won't consider that. Idk. I know it feels silly, depression held me back in college but I never wanted to use it as an excuse. But honestly a mental health issue makes college 10x harder. And I think you've kind of hit a wall where disclosing that health issue will probably help you continue your studies.   Good luck ♥️",False,False
