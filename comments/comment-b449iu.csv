You don't have to make a big event of it or have a big confrontation. All you need to do is notify them you've found another provider. Psychiatrists are aware that not everybody will 'click' with their style and they're used to having patients switch for any number of reasons.  I hope you're able to find someone who you're more compatible with.,False,False
