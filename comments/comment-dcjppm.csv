That doesn‚Äôt invalidate you at all my friend.  I really hope you go to the doctor before the 21st- they could at least do some bloodwork and let you know how your vital systems are functioning. The scary thing about the body is that it keeps us in homeostasis (all systems functioning adequately) as long as it can, that‚Äôs its main job. So as soon as something starts to slip (like your potassium or phosphorous or whatever) it becomes a huge cascade of systems failing.  Please message me if you want to chat or need anything- I‚Äôm thinking of you üíñ",False,False

I did drink some water this morning, and I'm going to keep up with that today. Put actual milk in my coffee, too, so I guess I am doing better today, although I feel like putting milk in my coffee cancels out having an ed altogether, aha. Brain. I think I'm just going to hold out on the doctors until the 21st, because I have an appointment then anyways and I feel like a drama queen going twice in a month.",False,True

If anything I would applaud you for coming in.   We recognise eating disorders are hard and how much it would take for you to come forward and admit what‚Äôs brought you in. Only thing we care about is ensuring your safety and trying to help you with your health. Just be honest with them.  Good luck!,False,False
