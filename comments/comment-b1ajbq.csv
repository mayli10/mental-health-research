I think what you say applies to an extent, but there is the important element of harm reduction. A lot of people on here can be either unwilling or unable to go to the doctor (whether due to cost, or a desire to not disclose their eating disorder).    Do we really want to tell the person who is puking blood ""don't post that here""?",False,False

Seeing a lot of posts about people puking up blood or their bodies hurting and it just makes me really sad. There should be a constant reminder that they need to see a doctor and we should be deleting any posts that violate this to discourage people from seeking medical advice here.,False,False

I’m not “in denial” lol, I can’t help what is attracted to me. Seeing other people who have my ideal body type for myself is more awe/fear inspiring but not sexually attractive.   I feel like anyone who actually believes that is kinda dumb? Being attracted to extreme thinness is a relatively new thing in our overall human evolutionary history and the overall societally agreed upon “perfect body” changes every 10 or so years ",False,False
