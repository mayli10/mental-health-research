So far uhhhhhhh Ensure meal replacement shake + potassium citrate powder, a McDouble combo, and some kind of fiber supplement. Probably these gummies I'm looking at. 11% daily required fiber and 10 calories per gummy. Would need 3 gummies. I looked at metamucil too but the recommended amount is 120 calories per day. It would at least add 12% to my iron intake, but it's 120 calories. That would put me above my limit if I want to lose weight in time for my doctor's appointment next month. I don't really want a powder. Gummies or pills would be better.  I'm not going to try to lose as much weight as he said would make him concerned, but I was around that weight before I went through the year long process of trying to gain despite my health issues. If he still won't help me next time I see him I'm going to yell at him for being irresponsible. He said if I was 100 lbs he would be concerned. Well, I'malready at the same BMI a girl of average height would be at 100 lbs. There's no way I don't lose more weight before the appointment. It won't be enough to be down to 100 lbs, but I will be at a lower BMI than what his arbitrary standard for receiving care suggests I should be.",False,False
