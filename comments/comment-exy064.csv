You're doing so well and you've been brave to post here.  It's scary the first few posts, at least it was for me.   Now I'm here daily.  I understand your fear.  I fast before celebration meals too.  Just remember that you deserve to enjoy your birthday, whether that's by eating some food you love or choosing not to, whichever makes you happier.  Either way this day is about you so have fun, and know that you won't mess up your weight if you did eat more than planned!",False,False

EDs have no age limit. We are recovery warriors for life. Keep fighting. My heart goes out to you. And Happy Birthday!,False,False
