It's really helping 💖 I decided to stay up, even though irs super late here, to watch a movie and try to let my stomach work through it. I haven't binged for a looooong time, but it still feels really bad. I'm still trying to eat like a normal person, but I just don't understand my body's signals. I fucked that up many years ago with my horrible eating patterns. Maybe it'll get better with time 😴",False,True

It’s ok if you ate more than you’re comfortable with, you aren’t a failure and i promise you do have self control ❤️ It may not seem like it but I promise things will be alright.you enjoyed your dads cooking, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that! There will be days where you eat a lot or feel like you binge and that’s normal, it happens to me too. But your body is not punishing you, you feel physically uncomfortable and unfortunately that happens sometimes.   I’d try to hold it in. Mainly bc whenever I don’t that just strengthens the binge/overeating cycle. Maybe go for a short walk? Drink some water, if you have some digestive enzymes or tums take a coupleC they should help. You deserve to have kindness shown to yourself and your body ❤️",False,False
