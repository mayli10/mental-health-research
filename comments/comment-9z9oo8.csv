If you are in the US, it is FDA approved for BED and really reduces the number of binges. I was never morbidly obese but I was just into the obese category. I'm now heading on my way to a normal BMI.   If meds aren't your thing, then I'd suggest getting a therapist who can help you with the emotions behind your binge eating.   Best of luck to you!",False,False

I was obese until I started losing weight at 14. I'm a regular weight now, after developing orthorexia :-/   This is a space for ALL people with EDs.  I know exactly how u feel and I know how much it sucks. Like. There is no worse feeling in the world than eating until you are legitimately scared of bursting your stomach.  You are so so so strong for working through this everyday, and especially without a clear support network. It's hard to suffer from a disorder that is constantly shamed and mocked irl.  It's ~heartbreaking~ to see the petite girl starve to death, but not to see the fat kid eat himself to death apparently.    For now, focus on self care. (Don't let yourself fall into the rabbit hole of fasting/bingeing, it'll only get worse).  Find an activity you love, and do it often. Look for ways to find comfort other than food. Fill that empty gap in you with joy and pride, rather than calories. And above all else, Forgive yourself. You deserve it ‚ù§Ô∏è   If you think you are ready for a diet overhaul, I have a friend who had great success with OMAD (one meal a day). You still get to stuff yourself, but you still end up with an overall calorie deficit.   Stay safe, friend!!!! üíïüíïüíï",False,False
