There is this really tight jeans I bought many years ago. I chose it several sizes smaller because I liked the number lol. After years of ups and downs I surprisingly could wear them but it fit poorly and it did not look 'right'. This was one of those moments when I realized that you can't run away from your bone structure. It took some time to internalize that I will never look like my idea of a perfect body. My ED wasn't magically cured but I'm more realistic now and have my moments of reason lol,False,True
