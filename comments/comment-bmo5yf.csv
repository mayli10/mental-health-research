I weighed more than he did when I met him, and didn't get much lower than him during our relationship. He was attracted to smaller girls though, and not my body. Yeah, that was absolutely a shitty feeling.  My current bf is 6'0 and 212ish lbs. We have over a 100 pound difference between us right now, and he's seen me when I was at like 147, and he didn't show any indication of being turned off by me at that weight and was still very much attracted, quite actually. Sounds perfect right? Yeah..except he happens to have my ideal body type in a partner, so no matter what, I still feel like a sack of shit, especially because my face and body are ugly even aside from my weight (spongebob-type body). Maybe if I could make that difference between us closer to 150 pounds, I'd feel better...  You can never win üôÉ",False,False
