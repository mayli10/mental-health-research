When I first lost a lot of weight, people were so much nicer to me.  And you know what?  It fucking *enraged* me.  How *dare* you treat me like a person after treating me like an object for so long?!  You absolute *fucks*.  I was really angry, and my anger has cooled somewhat, but it still isn't something I like.  Now I just want to be invisible again, but I am not willing to be the target of abuse, and also, being fat objectively fucking sucks in so many ways that have nothing to do with other people, so I just want to be too thin to treat like a person instead of too fat to treat like a person.  So yeah, I think I'd still be on my bullshit regardless.",False,False
