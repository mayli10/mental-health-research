When I count either to restrict or to ""recover"" or be healthy and normal I never achieve my goals and I end up so sad and annoyed.",False,False

I obsessively tracked for three years, weight fluctuating the whole time in like six-month periods. Stopped and maintained. Now I haven't tracked in like a week. Shockingly, the world hasn't exploded and I haven't gained at all. But logging definitely makes me feel like I deserve to use up the extra 20 calories I have, whereas when not keeping track, it's easy to know that I'm a fatass either way and shouldn't have X item.",False,False

I NEED to log everything because otherwise I ridiculously overestimate and freak out.   Logging keeps me sane and helps my mental state. ,False,False

Every time I try calorie counting I sneak in a lot more food and snacks because it’s under my limit. And even if it isn’t under my limit I rationalize eating extra junk by saying that I won’t gain for the week so it’s totally okay. And then after two weeks I binge because I’ve been “so good”.   However, if I don’t calorie count, I binge and fast nonstop ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ guess I can’t win",False,False
