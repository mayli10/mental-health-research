I have a really hard time opening up about things - it is so much easier to share my thoughts and feelings online.   Congrats on being able to juggle med school as well as recovery! That is so impressive!   I'm an NP and absolutely love it. If I had a patient in my situation I would highly encourage them to talk to a therapist,  yet I have such a hard time following this same advice for myself. It's almost as if I care more for my patients than myself. Hopefully I can learn to love myself. I'm sure therapy is going to be hard, but I need to do it for myself and for my family.",False,True

It's very normal to hold tighter to ED at this point, at least for me my ED was abt safety and control and this feels terrifying (but ultimately it's you taking control over the ED). I feel for you since I'm also in the medical field(I'm a last year med student in recovery from anorexia) and in the hospital setting every day and it can be challenging. If you ever need a listening ear, you can send me a DM :).",False,False

I ended up not even having to bring it up, my doctor did. She asked me if I am eating, then she kept asking what exactly I eat, what I ate that day, how many calories, etc. At first I was really nervous and just said I was eating, but she said it's obvious I'm not eating enough. I finally openes up to her. She referred me to a psychologist and I have an appointment on Friday.   I am nervous, and I feel like I am holding on tighter to this disordered eating, I'm eating less than I should be and less than I was. I wish it was easier to just let go of it, but I can't seem to do that. I'm scared but hopeful that therapy will help.   Thank you again for asking, it means a lot to have someone that cares.",False,True

I guess I want to get better, even if that means being uncomfortable. I need to get better for my son - I know it isn't going to be easy, but it's something I need to do.

Just a few bullet points, or more detail if you want to include it. You can show her at the appointment but not let her keep the paper (or just have it written on your phone so you can take it back), then it’s not in your notes. You can even write that you’re showing this to her specifically because you feel you have a lot of trust.   You need to think about what you want to happen next though. If she refers you back to your primary care doctor and explains everything to them, are you ok with that?   It sounds like you’re really ready to ask for help and I hope it goes well for you.",False,False
