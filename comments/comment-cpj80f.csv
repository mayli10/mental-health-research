Why should she want to meet you, she should respect that she doesn't hold that intimate space w him anymore and isn't entitled to what's happening in his life. You're bf should respect that it is p obvious ppl don't wanna chill w their partner's exes.   But if you're 21 and still travel in packs of friends, just be courteous and brave when you see her and try not to dwell on it. Idk, my heart would pound anytime my exe's ex was around, I just smiled while quietly freaking out.",False,False

The thing is she seems like a really nice person and wants to meet me as sheâ€™s still in his friend group and I donâ€™t want to come off as hostile or cold toward her because of this stupid disorder. Iâ€™ll try my best to fix it",False,True

This isn't really about her, it's about your insecurities. Focus on your current relationship and working on your confidence, not her. If you notice yourself dwelling on it, try to conciously stop yourself.   Good luck, sweet pea, you'll be okay.",False,False

And granted my choice of wording is not stellar. Yet I can't help but notice that she is ignoring the good in all this.   Granted she has an illness but comparing herself with others is not helping whatsoever.   Is that so wrong to point out??   Or would you rather encourage her to do more of the same?,False,False

Me and my boyfriend have been together for 5 years and during year one he started talking to his ex behind my back. She's like way thinner than I am and I'm still fixated on it. I know you probably can't help how you feel because neither can I but don't let it destroy your happiness because There's a lot of things in my life that could of been great if I wasn't still made about it after 4 years ðŸ˜Ÿ,False,False

And just so you know irl I know and have known a lot of depressed people.   Those who came out of it are the ones who stop looking at the bad in everything and more importantly stop comparing and competing with others.   Did your brain tell you to notice that you bfs ex is thinner than you or did you chose to see that?   And why would that even matter to your brain?   Your brain's job is to help you survive, how you chose to see the world around you is on you.   Your boyfriend liking has nothing to do with his ex, and you comparing yourself to her does you absolutely no good, eating disorder or not. That's all I am saying.",False,False
