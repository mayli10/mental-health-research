I become sluggish and lazy but when I’m running on empty, I literally feel like I’m on top of the world. I’m euphoric, I feel light, positive, energetic. SIGH I wish I could just eat air for the rest of my life",False,False

When I eat at maintenance I feel *literally* dirty and my depression comes back full force. It feels like PMS almost... maybe it's hormonal? combined with not experiencing the euphoria associated with hunger.,False,False

The control that's needed for restriction mode carries out to all areas of my life because I feel empowered!    When I'm in b/p or c/s mode I feel like I'm oppressed and unable to fight back against my cravings.  I get depressed and can't see any way out.,False,False

I guess you could call it ""intermittent fasting"", but I drink calories within that first 10 hours before eating solids, so also not really that. But, yes, I totally understand.  If I try to ""eat normal,"" aka wake up, eat breakfast an hour or so later, and then lunch a couple hours later, and then dinner etc., I'm an absolute bitch monster from hell. I also experience the laziness you describe. Food is supposed to be fuel, but in my experience I run better on empty, if you will. Like, when I first started my current job, I tried eating regular meals and could barely make it through my work night, where I'm on my feet about 90% of the time. I just felt so ""blah"" and didn't want to do anything. But since I've started pushing back the time frame in which I eat, I feel like I'm much faster, more peppy, and can think more clearly.",False,False
