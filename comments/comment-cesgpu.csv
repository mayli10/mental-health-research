I think I'm at 15% body fat right now. My legs seem to be shockingly muscular considering how long it's been since I exercised. My boobs are really small, but gaining weight didn't make me go up a cup size. They just filled out a bit. Like if I could find a small enough push up bra it would look like there's some cleavage now, but there still isn't any without one. I supposed getting my body fat up is probably more important for my health than my actual weight, so maybe I should try gaining a little more and seeing how it effects me. I would probably gain too much weight in other areas though, so I probably won't try that.",False,False

Idk the extent- I think it really depends on where you're starting and on your biology.   For me, I went from DD to barely a C (probably B now RIP) from my highest weight (still ""normal"" technically, but wtf does that even mean). So it can be pretty dramatic for some people.   I think burning fat through exercise also increased the effect for me (this isn't even my LW, but last time it I didn't exercise at all and didn't lose whole cup sizes).",False,True

I know you feel bad about it but I'm pretty curious because I was already underweight when I got boobs and I'm still not near my highest weight. Is that common?,False,False

Yep. Same. I got this pair at my all-time heaviest weight, and now I’m at my lowest adult weight and my glasses won’t stay on. They fall off every time I look down. I have to take them off to play with my kid, or cook, or do laundry. And I am blind af so this is a problem.",False,False
