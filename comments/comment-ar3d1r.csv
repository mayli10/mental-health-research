If you ate something salty, purged, or exercised A LOT yesterday, or did any combination of those, you could be retaining A LOT of water. I know that if I purge, my weight will go up by up to 10 pounds. If I exercise harder than light jogging, it'll go up like 4 or 5. And if I'm eating lots of salt, it usually goes up by 7. Also remember that fluctuation of weight by up to 8 pounds is normal. So, you may have lost but the scale isnt reflecting it because you're holding onto water. Maybe you're very overdue for a woosh.  Also, if you lost a lot of weight before this plateau, your BMR and TDEE may be lower than you thought. Rule of thumb is, every 5 pounds lost you need to recalculate your BMR, because if you have less fat on your body, it needs fewer calories to run. You also become more efficient during exercise and it burns fewer calories.  If you read through that and can honestly say you didnt eat something salty, purge, or overexercise yesterday, I would consider talking to your doctor about getting your thyroid tested. If it is underactive, your metabolism will be different, and losing weight is harder.  I hope something in here helped",False,False
