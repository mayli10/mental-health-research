It's about enjoying food without feeling guilty, but in a balance and knowing where to stop eating. And finding hobbies and things that you have fun doing without having food and calories on your mind.  A lot of people think recovery = gaining weight, in my opinion it isn't, it depends on your current weight. If you're severely underweight, yes, gaining weight should be a part of it. If you're at a normal weight or just slightly underweight, I think the focus should be on learning healthy eating habits.",False,False

To be invited to a family get together or out with a friend and spend my whole week fasting and googling menus and calorie counts. If someone says ""hey want to grab a bite to eat?"" I want to be able to say ""sure!""     To do things because they are fun instead of because they burn calories or distract you from food. To be able to look in the mirror and gauge my weight rather than run to a scale and let the scale tell me how I look.",False,False
