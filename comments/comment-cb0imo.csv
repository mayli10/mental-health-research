I mostly make lists: what I will eat, won’t eat, should eat, may eat, have eaten, would like to eat. I inventory all the food in my house and try to come up with new combinations/recipes.  I calculate my BMI a million times even though it’s the same as it was five minutes ago. I calculate what my BMI would be at other weights. I calculate how long it should take to get to certain BMIs if I restrict by x amount vs by y amount.  I try to predict what BMI I’d have to get to for this to finally kill me, and calculate how long it should take to get there. Then I try to figure out how to speed up or slow down the process, depending on my mood.  I look up research articles about eating disorders and various topics (EDs and trauma, EDs in adults, EDs in the elderly, EDs and substance abuse, EDs by demographic, etc.)  I look at recipes online. I look for new products I’d like to try, and new products I’d never try.  Annnd on a non-ED related note, I clean and organise my house and watch an excessive amount of tv.",False,False
