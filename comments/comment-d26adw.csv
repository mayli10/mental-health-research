OP, if you feel like you may have an issue with binge eating, there’s a few binge eating support subreddits you may want to join. If you just want diet tips, there’s plenty of dieting subs too like r/loseit and r/1200isplenty",False,False

I'm not 100% sure what you want tips on? If it's asking for tips on how to restrict/diet, I don't think that's permitted here. You say that you don't want tips for a ""healthy lifestyle"" but also that you want tips on not overeating. Please do not ask anorexics and bulimics for help on how to adopt their behaviors, for your own sake. There's nothing down that road except self-loathing, anxiety, hair-loss and, worst-case, death. The latter can happen no matter what your weight is, because anorexia/severe restricting weakens your heart. People have died from anorexia at healthy and overweight BMIs. And yeah, a healthy lifestyle isn't as quick as starving, but it also doesn't lead to bingeing, perpetual weight fluctuations and the other cons I mentioned.  &gt;He knows I absolutely HATE moving my body in any way really so it would be extremely suspicious if i suddenly started working out, I know it would be a normal thing for me to want to lose weight at my bmi and nothing really suspicious but I just can't tell him that I want to lose weight, I just feel too ashamed,  It would be ""suspicious"" but also ""nothing really suspicious""? I think you're overthinking this and causing yourself a lot of anxiety. There's nothing wrong with taking a 20 minute walk or doing some exercises to strengthen your muscles. If you don't want to tell him you want to lose weight, then don't. Lots of people start to exercise because they want more energy, to improve mental health and lessen anxiety, to reduce risk of future illness etc. Exercising is a completely normal thing to do.  &gt;Also I just feel so incredibly ashamed if someone sees me doing any physical activity.  Sooo many people feel this way, but the truth is *no one* who sees an exercising person gives a shit about their appearance, even at the gym. Even personal trainers and other super fit people are just happy to see others be active. If it really bothers you, there are great exercise videos on YouTube created to be followed in a living room or other small spaces.  But most importantly, I just want to say take care of yourself. If you want to stop overeating, my first advice would be to turn that one meal a day into at least three meals a day. If you want advice on how to diet, this is the wrong sub.",False,False
