I understand why some people might feel differently. We all have different tastes.   I could not adopt her diet 100% of the time, but I make that 93 calorie bagel all the time. I think it's up to the viewer to decide what is right and healthy for them. She is not saying everyone should eat like her.   TBH that video about why everyone should use a food scale does not seem problematic to me. The points she makes are just about knowing how many calories are in your food and also how to get accurate measurements when baking. Not promoting people obsessing about food weights or exact calories. ",False,False

I've never spoken to anyone who just did it to look like a celebrity or because they were copying someone and it just developed? I feel like if someone gets ideas they were already there to begin with. I mean you can't watch a shitton of videos of someone with bipolar disorder and just get it. Something was already blooming in someone who started to take advice from pro ana. You can't just *give* people disorders. It's more problematic imo to take away all Ed spaces and channels and materials and say ""no! This is to be brushed under the rug! We need to.pretend it doesn't exist because I have an unfounded idea that you're infecting people and you make me uncomfortable!!"" ",False,False

I was wondering when there would be a thread about her on here. I don’t necessarily think she’s any more problematic than other “diet culture” spaces on the internet. There’s lots of it out there, and if people want to find that stuff they will. Her channel is just a drop in be ocean, so to speak, and while she is open about restricting I don’t think her videos are especially harmful. I hope young girls aren’t watching her videos but, again, if they want to find something about calorie restriction online then they will. When I was younger her videos would have definitely encouraged me to restrict, however her style of restriction is way healthier than what I used to do (i.e. down half a box of tictacs at lunch so I’d have enough calories left for some instant ramen and a glass of milk for dinner), so if I watched her when I was younger it would have probably been a net positive. Overall, I don’t think her content is incredibly harmful or problematic.",False,False

She flat out denied her ED in videos but her comments qre a different story. I mean she knows who her audience is, but she's very careful about what she says on videos. She keeps herself at a healthy weight and eats a lot od nutrients. I don't see a problem wifh her diet tbh. Especially since she has a lot of binge days she doesn't seem to do anything too terribly unhealthy to compensate for (I mean hey there are a lot worse). She's an adult, she knows what she's doing. I wouldn't say it was any more problematic than most diets, being obese, smoking, and other socially acceptable and less taboo things. ",False,False
