I have quite wide hips regardless of my weight so the outer part is always rounded and no matter what I do my ass won't shrink (which i actually like once my thighs get back to normal). I usually lose weight first and it takes a while to see the effect on my thighs/calves but it happens  &amp;#x200B;  I think legs take a little longer to fully slim down bc they have to support your whole body and they're probably used to your old weight.  seeing as you've lost some already it'll keep slimming going dw about it ,False,False

I'm a borderline healthy/underweight bmi but my legs LITERALLY look like an overweight person's legs?? and they always have. I used to be quite a bit underweight and they STILL looked the same. its like i can only carry my weight there. it fucking sucks i just want slender legs why am i cursed this way.,False,False

Body recomposition is possible, but so is seeing using mental energy to shift ones opinion of what body parts look wrong/big/distressing to us. ...you might even already have calves that look like you wish they would (to others) but you can't see it because of dysmorphia.   Calves are a difficult area. Those trying to lose fat in that area may find that they are a problem area and that fat shift/loss happens last there. Fat shifts into different areas so it is possible some fat will naturally leave that place, however it is also possible you just carry fat in your calves. As you age you may find new spots where you carry fat/lose easier etc.   Muscles growth can make the area firmer, but apparently muscle growth/training for the calves can be tricky. Here is a very complicated blog with opinions:  https://bodyrecomposition.com/muscle-gain/training-the-calves.html/  Many people are of the opinion that some exercises like yoga can ""lengthen"" muscle, making it less bulky. I would suggest exercises like yoga, ballet/barre",False,False

My thighs have slowly loss more weight but it really depends on what type of exercise I'm doing. Like I have no ass but still large thighs and regular legs. Odd mix.   Even if your lower part of your body is were you store your weight they won't always be as large as they are now :) ,False,False

I think that’ll slim down the longer they get used to supporting less weight,False,False
