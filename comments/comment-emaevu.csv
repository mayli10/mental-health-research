I‚Äôve already gone through 2 IV sedation appointments for root canals in the last month bc I have terrible dental anxiety.  They ended up suggesting a special toothpaste that is super expensive but supposed to be worth it and a high fluoride toothpaste as you suggested.    I‚Äôm type 1 diabetic and I take mental health medications on top of that so my teeth have been doomed from the beginning it‚Äôs just my anorexia decided to speed up the process. I didn‚Äôt have dental coverage for the last 12 years and I finally do and I‚Äôm dealing with all the consequences. It‚Äôs been super overwhelming.",False,True

That's what I do. I'm more responsible when it comes to taking my psyche related meds but I'm prone to not always taking my supplements on a daily basis so I just take everything in the morning literally as soon as I get out of bed to avoid, well, avoiding them lol. It makes it easier when you can just get it out of the way as soon as you start your day.",False,False
