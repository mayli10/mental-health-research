Every time I have a stressful experience I turn to restriction. Makes me feel in control and distracts me from obsessing over my trauma. My grandfather died two days ago (he raised me) and Iâ€™ve been full tilt destroying my body in response. Hang in there love.,False,False

He couldn't stand to just let me restrict though and would get really upset when I wouldn't eat as much as him, which was well over my maintenance and put me in an obese bmi and still gaining. It's my personal hell. It wasn't a healthy dynamic, but I let it go on for two years. I need a distraction from the break up and I need to get back to a lower weight.  Got a work Christmas party and I don't intend to cry for a week leading up about nothing looking good like I did last year. I have a goal, I have a distraction.",False,True

I also came back to find some distraction and control.  It is also a way of punishing myself for making this decision to end a good relationship.,False,False
