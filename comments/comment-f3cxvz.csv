I feel like with older people sometimes it goes either way... They either want to judge you and ask why you can't eat something or they just assume you might have an allergy or blood sugar issue and just comply with it. That is incredibly nice of him and I hope he had a nice birthday. If you really want to show your gratitude you could maybe write a little thank you note. When someone goes above and beyond for me I will often let them know because it is not often people are so kind in this world.,False,False
