I somehow managed to fill in the other numbers even though I don't feel a lot of physical sensations about how much I ate until I'm way too full. so I filled it in with what I do feel (which in my case is mostly emotional or social feelings) and tried to space it pretty evenly. Not evenly in terms of how much food takes me from one number to the next but evenly in terms of how different the emotions seem to me.  and it's helping me a lot to log my food in a way that references those numbers instead of calories.... like ""I started eating dinner feeling around a 4 and then after 1 plate of food I was feeling a 6"" ""I ended the day at a 6"" and stuff like that.    I've been aiming to stay in the 3-6 range most of the time with occasional 7s.  avoiding 8/9/10 because on my scale that means I ate enough to feel either anxiety or guilt or physical pain.  but the scale basically helps me see that coming and stop sooner because I see how little food takes me from a 6 to an 8.  can post my list if you want an example but I imagine the feelings would vary from person to person.  I think that's normal.",False,False

That epic restriction spree brought me down to the slightly underweight BMI where I've stayed for almost half a year now.  Like you mentioned, increasing calories near maintenance while being really mindful and paying attention to the process of eating is what helped my hunger signals come back after a month or two. I still can't eat when hungry and stop when full (because this weight is unnatural for my body), but I've managed to ditch calorie counting and rely on my hunger signals for weight maintenance instead. Now I basically only eat when I'm really hungry and stop when I'm not hungry anymore, not when I'm actually satisfied.",False,False

I find a 16:8 split a good compromise. It's not as intense as 24hour fasts and you're still restricting. I usually go from 4pm-12am and I'm not always up that late so sometimes can go longer. ,False,False
