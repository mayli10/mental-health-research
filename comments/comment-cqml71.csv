I also used half whole wheat and half brown rice flour Instead of half spelt half ap. Rice flour is a bit higher in cal than regular flour, but my dad can't have simple carbs and I thought he'd want a piece when it was done. Instead of the frosting recipe on the page, I just combined 2/3rds of a low fat cream cheese block with 2 tablespoons of honey and 1/2 a tablespoon of maple syrup. I whipped it until it had a similar texture to mayonnaise (weird but that was exactly what it looked like)",False,True
