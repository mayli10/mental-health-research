Our goal shouldn’t be to lose weight it should be to be healthier. When you build muscle you get healthier even though you gain weight.,False,False

Muscle takes up less space though if you compare a lb of fat to a lb of muscle. The water retention is temporary as I said. Give it some time. You might get more physical changes than movement on the scale.,False,False

You won’t actually gain weight from building muscle at a deficit, that’d make no sense. It’s much more likely you’re retaining water like the person above said. That’ll go away eventually.",False,False
