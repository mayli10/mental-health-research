This relapse is fucking with me because during highschool when I had exams I would make myself eat 1200 minimum but now Iâ€™m at uni and having to force myself to hit 800 while Iâ€™m studying. The stress just sends me into the arms of my ED, itâ€™s such a mess!",False,False

So if the average person is eating 2k calories, 400 of them is used to brain power alone. Mind you this is for an average person doing average brain power things. If youâ€™re studying/learning, your brain is going to demand even more energy. Try and compromise with your ED, tell yourself you need to eat at maintenance so you can study. You can always lose the weight after finals are over.",False,False

In my experience, after the first 3 days, hunger kind of goes away, so maybe that indicates that my ghrelin levels become low enough to not cause a fuss.  Of course, I also know that hunger is said to come in waves over extended fasts, so the actual picture is probably way more complicated.  ðŸ˜…",False,False

It was a day of classes that made me properly notice it. When working by myself I always blamed myself for being lazy/too stupid for the work etc :'(   What's the ghrelin threshold?,False,True

The lack of attention and motivation to my studies was unacceptable to me, so I had to break earlier than I planned. (Which sucked, because I had crossed the ghrelin threshold and had stopped feeling hunger.)",False,False
