I guess is a positive. My thighs had a tiny gap for the first time ever a week before christmas and now that's totally gone, all my measurements have gained an inch+ and I hate it. A friend is staying with me and is with me 24/7 so I haven't really been able to restrict since she's been here and I haaaaate it.

It's swollen, but not as much as it was a few days ago. Everything else is almost back to normal visually.   I only overate about 1 lb worth at most... but then again, my body loves to bloat. My weight jumps around by 5 lbs when maintaining and bloats consistently when losing. Thing is, this past month I've been deliberately gaining, and have no idea what to expect. Pre-christmas, there was actually less fluctuation than usual.   I know I gotta ride this discomfort out and see what happens, but uuuuugh ",False,True
