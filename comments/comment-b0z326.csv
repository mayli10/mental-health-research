Instead of having a period I just have brown spotting for like 2 weeks. I tried talking to my obgyn and she acted like it was nothing to worry about. If you find out anything about it I hope you make another post!,False,False

I do not know if you are familiar with this but basically it is a supplement that helps to balance hormones, regulate cycles and make menopause a whole lots bearable. In my opinion, given your condition, this is definitely what you need.  Vitex is also great when it comes to balancing and regulating hormones. Both are natural remedies which have no known side effects. Some may also recommend HRT but you should know with HRT you the possible risks associated are quite high.    One of the best DIM supplements I know of is DIM Pure by Eu Natural. Given its all natural ingredients and very high reviews, I would suggest you have a look into it",False,False

I've gotten it anywhere from a 17 bmi to like 23 and it's always been at a time when I'd been restricting my eating for a while. Of course like go to a doctor if you're worried and all that but personally when I gained weight my period came back and seemed pretty normal if that helps lol",False,False

How old are you? I‚Äôm 38 and I did a lot of reading about it and to my dismay I am a prime candidate for early perimenopause (I was extremely UW at age 18, and mildly UW at 35.

Why is it so hard to find good doctors? üò≠  So instead of your regular period you get heavy spotting every 2 weeks with no other symptoms?
