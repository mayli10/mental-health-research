It could be an ED, or you could be experiencing disordered eating (kind of like pre-ED).    You might find it helpful to ask your doctor if they can refer you to a dietitian.  If you get help to create a healthy meal plan, it could reduce some of your distress around food.  Involving your doctor can also be helpful because they can point you to local resources to help with the mental/emotional aspect.",False,False

It's great that you're being mindful of it, especially at a young age. You sound like you're smart and I'm glad you're thinking about your health. Please talk to a trusted adult and ask them to help you set up an appointment. It is always, always better to be safe than sorry, especially since eating disorders are a slippery slope. I hope things work out well ❤️",False,False
