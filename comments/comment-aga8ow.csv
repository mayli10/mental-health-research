I‚Äôm pretty fat from like, 5-6 years of bulimia and emotional eating. It feels even worse since I am trying to stop purging. But my self hatred and 98% brain power going to food help my realise how messed up I still am.   I want you to know that suffering is a concrete term. No matter how bad, all suffering is still pain.
