I can’t relate to people who can eat Skittles by the handful, or finish a bag of sour patch kids at the movies, or who binge on Halloween candy.   Like, I like candy, it’s definitely not like I’d say I don’t have a sweet tooth, but that much sugar just... HURTS. Like my mouth and body would feel gross if I tried to eat that much candy.   Then again you could say the same thing about greasy foods and they’re my number one binge food so I truly get it but I guess I’m just grateful that sugar isn’t my particular vice",False,False

It's good and all, but there's no way I could just sit there and eat a jar of the stuff. It stuffs my mouth up and makes it all gunky and hard to swallow.  The same goes for other things like Nutella and cookie butter.  Sugary things in general, really. I've got bad teeth that cry if I drink water that's colder than tap, so I avoid sugar like the plague. Plus, after switching all of my drinks to zero cal I've lost the taste for most sweets. If I do eat then, it's part of a binge rather than the binge itself.",False,False
