I spent 2 years of my life thinking I was completely recovered in my eating disorder, but discovering her videos made me realize I was still holding onto a lot of habits for comfort, which explains why it was so natural and easy for me to relapse and spiral back into the deep end.   Outside of that though, no one else has made me desire recovery like this before, I've kinda glamorized it tbh bc watching her is so inspiring and beautiful. Honestly, she's really cognizant and courageous, and I've never really witnessed anyone take on recovery so bravely the way she does. I highly recommend her and I'm so proud and happy for you to be thinking about taking the scary but necessary steps to healing!!!!!! Wishing you all the best !&lt;3",False,False

Also I think she has a book?). She seems to be the leading advocate for unrestrictive eating and how to neurally rewire and all that stuff,False,False
