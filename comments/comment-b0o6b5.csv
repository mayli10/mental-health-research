I used it for a few months and realized that it was making me bloat like a mother fucker. Also gave me really bad gas. My body just has a hard time digesting literally anything so it wasn't ideal and I had to stop using it sadly. Advice to other people who struggle w poops but can't drink metamucil: I chug 30 oz of water every morning and drink a cup of coffee when my stomach is completely empty and it usually gets things going. Sorry for this tmi LOL ,False,False
