I don't know if it bothers me because I truly hate cooking smells or if it's because I'm so damn hungry/what food means to me.  At least I've still got the smell of fried onions and mushrooms to enjoy.",False,False

I do have misophonia for other sounds though (unrelated to food).,False,True

Most noises associated with cooking are too loud and not nice.  I can't watch things like Bake Off because cooking sounds are irritating.   Ugh, forks and knives scraping plates...  &amp;#x200B;  I like the sound of frying onions and mushrooms though, but that's because it smells so good probably.  Yeah, if it's not ED related, it's misophonia like crystal-power says.  I hate any body sounds as well.",False,False
