I know you're probably joking/venting with this post but in case anyone reading this cares to know, DBT has been helping me with my urges. It's slight but I am seeing an improvement.   EDs are different for everyone, but for me personally it seems to be a maladaptive coping skill for low self-esteem, depression, and anxiety. DBT has been helping me slowly get a handle on it (I just started it so idk how much it'll help in the end but maybe start with distress tolerance skills and emotional regulation skills) but I'm still constantly fighting ED thoughts. My therapist said that it takes a while but eventually with practice (practice on mildly distressing things and ED things so you do it automatically) it gets easier idk. There are alot of resources online so if you cannot find a DBT clinic/therapist maybe try to learn skills in your own?",False,False

Sadly I've tried it before but then a few months later they released a new promo to only replace pasta with zucchini, free of charge, but then I fell for the good ol' microtransaction scam where they began pushing small diet adjustments on me until I was down 10 kilos and worse off than before. I think at that point ~~a therapist~~ Apple Genius is necessary to re-cancel the whole thing.",False,False

I dont know how but i think that it is impossible because you will still have that ED mindset, like u may restrict less and maybe will stop counting calories but i dont think its possible to recover while you still maintain a low weight that was reached in an unhealthy way. I know its sad but i already went trough this once, but idk maybe you will be better than i was, good luck and stay save pal",False,False
