For me recovery is finally stopping the anxiety. Finally eating normal. Finally not obsessing the whole day about your food and meals. Finally accepting a dinner invite without knowing what you will eat and without fasting 3 days prior.    But, not gaining like crazy. Recovery is learning to know how much to each without losing or gaining. Just learning what your body needs to stay in a healthy BMI range, may it be 18-20 or 22-24, doesnt matter. Just stopping to obsess",False,False

It’s a gradual increase in food so your body slowly adjusts to hunger levels and the ‘weight gain’ anxiety that’s directly tied to bloat and waste accumulation. Eating at or a little below maintenance to accommodate meals out.   I went through an unwilling ‘recovery’ where I was deeply confused. I had all of the same anxieties associated with food, but I believed I should be eating like my peers. I got fat and was just as anxious about food. ",False,False
