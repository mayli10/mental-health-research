For me, inpatient was by far the most effective, pushing me over to the side of actually trying to recover, not resist. Residential felt like a vaction ft mental health. It was fun, and i was able to meet people who suffered like i do. Partial was ok, it pretty much just kept me on track and monitored me. I would highly recommend inpatient if your in that spot and insurance feels generous. Just a warning, ip will boot u right after u hit a stable weight.",False,False
