Because he's a different hight then me I misjudge things like weight on him. Also since I see him every day its more difficult for me to notice the change. Also I'm very unobservant.  Don't take 15 pounds personally.,False,False

Your boyfriend is trying to say he finds you attractive and you are torturing yourself over nothing - i know it is triggering, but if you find his comments triggering, talk about food with your therapist and not your partner",False,False

Tell him these things trigger you and talk about the disorded eating.  Men arent as stupid as we try to tell ourselves, he might be saying this stuff on purpose because he might thinkn itll help in a weird way. Or he might be saying it to actively frustrate you because hes frustrated with the disordered behaviours and he doesnt know how else to react to it.   If he really is trying to be respectful hed stop with weight talk at all or word it differently. Dont excuse this or ignore it - actually talk with him about this serious topic and if he doesnt want to even talk about it, only talks about how you look the same, or doesnt take it serious then you need to realize hes not a great boyfriend and he doesnt respect you. You shouldnt have to deal with a bf that triggers you and doesnt do anyyhing to stop triggering you!",False,False
