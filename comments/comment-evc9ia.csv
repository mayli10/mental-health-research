I have a super flat, super toned belly, HOWEVER my arms store massive amounts of fat; I‚Äôm skinny with big big arms. It sucks. I combat it with toning exercises, though. Try some ab workouts and some cardio and drink water like you‚Äôre getting paid to do it, haha. Can‚Äôt change your genetics, but you can tone the fat-storing areas down.",False,False

When I was working on restoring weight, it all went to my stomach first - I was so self conscious. One day at work a coworker announced, loudly, across the room, ""Oh my God - Congratulations!"" and pointed at my stomach (thinking I was pregnant). Some customers/coworkers laughed - I was mortified.  Even now I die thinking of that.",False,False
