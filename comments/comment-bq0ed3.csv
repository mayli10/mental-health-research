I keep thinking about how when I was sick for other non-ED reasons, I was a 90 lb fairy and untouchable. People always asked me if I was okay and I felt so light and beautiful and successful. For the first time in my life, people wanted to help me, to *protect* me. More than anything else, I want it back.",False,False

I went from 110lbs to 88lbs and no one noticed. No one seemed to care. I've gained some weight back, but I'm trying to turn that around cause I've been in a bp cycle. Now my goal is to keep dropping until someone notices my weightoss. Also I want to see my GW of 88 again. My UGW is seeing the 70s. Who knows, maybe at 78 people will notice, since they clearly didn't when I was 88.",False,False

So much of it (for me) arises from not loving myself, not accepting myself, not feeling safe with myself, so I look for it externally.  In some cases, yes, it’s possible getting sicker will lead some people to express worry/concern. In my experience it’s equally possible they will express anger/judgement (sometimes out of fear) or walk away (it’s damn hard to watch someone spiral down the path of an ED).  Bottom line, no one’s care or love or worry was ever enough for me. My own self-loathing was always corroding everything good they offered me until only the void remained once again.  You already are enough. So enough. For me though, nobody could make me believe that - I had to come to start believing a teeny tiny bit of it for myself (with the help of a crap ton of therapy and time). It’s been hard to talk about these feelings in therapy, but ultimately good.",False,False
