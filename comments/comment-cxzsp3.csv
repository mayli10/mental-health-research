I just want to avoid eating until I feel ill, and I don’t know if this is binge eating as I feel like the hunger should have gone away or improved as I gained weight.",False,True

Sometimes treatment teams or people self recovering set weight goals too low, and a lot of people in anorexia recovery have extreme hunger that subsides once they are fully weight restored.",False,False

It does sound like you’re in a binge cycle since you’re using food as a coping mechanism and are noticing a lack of control as you do it. It’s way too easy to go back and forth between extremes especially during recovery so I would just make sure to talk to someone if you can before adjusting your eating habits.,False,False
