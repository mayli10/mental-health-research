I usually do water and black coffee - and if I'm getting bored black tea or sf pop or energy drinks. If you haven't fasted before just be careful and start slow - maybe try IF then ADF. If you are going to do multi day you'll also want to make sure you are getting enough electrolytes (I think someone posted about Snake Juice). There's lots of info on r/fasting too. Be safe!,False,False

After 3/4 days of feeling quite shite usually I get a prolonged kind of runners high. I actually start doing shit, being in public is more bearable, self esteem goes up and I get this amazing sense of superiority. Iâ€™m always chasing that feeling. And I do think itâ€™s really good for you but the reasons why I do it is not. And it contributes to the ed massively.

Anything that provides electrolytes will do.  I'm currently on day 3 of a water fast, and I plan to go until next Friday, for ten days total.  For most people, this is easily do-able, so long as you take care of the essential electrolytes you need to survive.  Also, something people don't mention is...   Liquid in = liquid out.    After the first few days, you'll feel the difference!   It's not a major discomfort, but it takes a lot of people by surprise.  Fasting works really well for me.   I have a binge/fast ED, so I will binge a week's worth of calories in a weekend and then fast for the rest of the week.   I can control it, but Tbh, I'm kinda used to it now and just let it happen, it's not actually a big problem.",False,False
