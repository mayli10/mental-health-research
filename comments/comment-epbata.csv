At this point the only thing keeping me from purging every single day is the fact that I am starting to severely restrict what I buy at the grocery store... which is really sad, because even that doesn't totally keep me away from purging salad or something, smh.  Just let there be freedom from this literal hell, ugh.",False,False

I always think though if I didn‚Äôt have an eating disorder myself I would probably be one of those people who only see things at surface level, because it‚Äôs not something people are really educated about until they go through it or have a loved one go through it.

The worst part of an ED is that usually the consequences of the mental process are so visible to others, leaving you vulnerable to their shallow understanding of something as 'simple' as gaining or losing weight. In my case, gaining weight was really humiliating, coming from being anorexic and UW only made it worse, and the mental and social toll of BED really left a mark in me",False,False
