Add some berries on the top, perhaps a scoop of yoghurt for protein and you‚Äôve got yourself a meal. If you are trying to stay low carb you can opt for yoghurt with berries/other fruit of choice.  I usually like veggies with dip for lunch, because I find it digests better for me. I cut cucumber, carrots, red pepper, celery  into slices and it look like so much! Best part? You don‚Äôt really have to weigh it, because you can mostly track veggies down as 1/2 a cucumber and the calories will barely vary in different cucumber sizes. For sauce you could go with any store bought such a hummus, but I like to blend silken tofu with parsley and salt to get an oil-free, protein filed and creamy homemade dip.  For hot meals you can microwave/boil veggies and blend them into soups, eat them plain or add some packaged rice/tofu to it. I personally love butternut squash, because the calories are so incredibly low for the flavour it gives you!  If you eat animal products this will probably be way easier though, you could literally just boil eggs and live off that + cottage cheese, perhaps bulk grilling meat etc?",False,False

I'm not sure about how low calorie you're trying to go, but most people probably wouldn't question it and just assume you're a vegetarian. If they ever do ask ""Hey how come you only ever boil broccoli and i've never seen you eat a carb in your life"", just claim you're bulk cooking to store for later use",False,False
