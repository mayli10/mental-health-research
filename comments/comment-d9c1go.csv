My experience is like 15 years ago so they might be more aware of things since then. Good that you found out about your gallstones! Strange silver linings. I know nothing about that.,False,True

I of course told them no and am kinda grateful now because I just found out I have gallstones.,False,False

I was a little underweight, but people don't really have a fucking clue what a little underweight looks like it just looks like models to them.  Handful of people said I looked great, asked what I did to get there.  Everyone who knew me longer and knew my first round of anorexia was concerned and called me out.  Two people who didn't know my past subtley said that they were there for me if I needed anyone and hinted that they saw my weight loss for what it was.  But most people? No clue. The people who knew me longer, they didn't know the first time around until I informed them. Even though my parents went to the doctor with me when I lost my period, the doctor didn't even guess I was starving myself.  Sorry rambling. Point I was trying to make is that most people have zero clue.",False,True

I'm exhausted all the time and walk around like a zombie with everyone trying to ask me how I lost so much weight over the summer. All I can say is I've been sick and try and explain it away.,False,False

And I'm tired at myself. And I'm just going through the motions because I know they work but I'm so, so tired. My passion, just evaporated, poof, gone out of my body.",False,True
