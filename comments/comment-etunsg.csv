Remember that going vegan isn’t all black or white, cutting out every animal product except cheese for example, makes a huge difference for the animals and planet compared to doing nothing!",False,False

Before you start transitioning try different vegan cheeses and different vegan sour creams. There are so many options to choose from. But I feel u with the sour cream that was prolly my FAVORUTE dairy food. I would dip my chips in sour cream and then salsa and add cheese and be in heaven,False,False

I have been eating a lot of rice and bean/veggie dishes and honestly it would be as simple as just removing cheese and sour cream, but I think I first need to adjust to being just vegetarian before forcing myself to let go of dairy. I find making too big of a sudden change sabotages my chances of long term commitment.",False,True

Either way your skin will love you if u cut out dairy. But when I was vegetarian I would make alot of tacos or quesadillas and spaghetti or burgers haha. It's really easy to convert a vegan recipe into just vegetarian or even meat recipe into veggie. Alot of meat substitutes. Mushrooms or beans are alot like meat. Tofu and tempeh also.,False,False

It makes me sad I can't find any good diet result videos for vegetarian, and most vegan videos seem to focus on their lack of dairy.",False,True

I decided that i wanted to be vegan one day, maybe once i moved out of my parents’ home since i imagined it would be easier when living alone, and until then i would just be vegetarian. But when i searched for recipes/inspiration only vegan results came up. So i started eating a lot of vegan food. Then i eventually realised how easy it was (at least for me) so i ended up going fully vegan only 6 months after turning vegetarian.",False,False
