Both of you are grieving, and grieving together could be therapeutic. Both of you can have each other to empathize with over the loss, so neither of you have to struggle through the emotions alone. For me, when my grandma passed, my mom and I definitely did a lot of crying, but it was also nice to go over all of the fond memories we had of her.  Lots of funny stories that interrupted the somber feelings ever so often. Eating Disorders are coping mechanisms, so it’s understandable that you would start to slip back into old patterns with such a heavy loss on your shoulders. And I’m so, so sorry for your loss. Please try being gentle and kind to yourself while you work through it. My heart goes out to you. ♥️",False,False
