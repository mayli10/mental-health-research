I just discovered this post after seeing if anyone had posted about stephanie but omg I'm also an actor who plans on moving to LA (or NYC for school) but it's cool to see someone on this subreddit with the same dreams and facing the same issues,False,False

It does to me. It sounds like the voice that speaks to me over and over in my head. The voice that sounds JUST LIKE ME but DAMN she is mean as hell. She tells me I don‚Äôt belong, that I‚Äôm not thin enough, that everyone can see how bloated I look after that last meal. She‚Äôs loud as can be when I stand in front of mirrors or linger by the snack table at work. She screams at me when I watch television or look at social media, yelling that I‚Äôd better watch my step and lose some weight or else everyone is going to figure out that I‚Äôm some kind of monster.  &gt;And even if I lose the weight, she‚Äôs not satisfied.  &gt;That‚Äôs the thing about disordered eating‚Äîthat voice will never, ever be satiated. You see, she‚Äôs starving. She‚Äôs yelling because she‚Äôs hungry. But it‚Äôs not really food that she's hungry for.  This is on point. SO on point.  ",False,False

I think with Terry especially his eating and exercise habits could be seen as disordered, going from one extreme to another.   On a related note, I *hate* how sitcom characters  live off of pizza and Chinese food and they‚Äôre all thin (Friends, How I Met Your Mother, etc). I love Brooklyn 99 though ",False,False

But then he slips into his overeating past in one episode and binges on cacao nibs  -Terry, gina, and Amy all go on an extreme diet but it ends up with amy eating 4 burgers and Gina eating a huge sandwhich (bingeing after restricting)  - rosa is never seen eating anything but fruit or vegetables and very small portions - Hitchcock and Scully are constantly eating junk (bingeing)  - Charles is obsessed with food but is still quite small and actually chews and spits his pizza in one episode   I'm sure the other post included other instances but these are the ones I remember from the post and the things I have noticed. I love this show and all the actors and characters in it, so much. It may be that we are over analyzing the show but there are definitely a few ed undertones in my opinion. ",False,False
