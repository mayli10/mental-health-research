I put on quite a bit of weight from my lowest weight and some of my clothes just dont fit like the used to lol. I just try and keep in mind 2 things: 1) it is quite litteraly I chose recovery or I choose death . And 2) gaining a bit of weight for the sake of my mental health and quality of life/happiness is worth it. (Despots what ED brain might say) Thankfully I use my journal all the time so I can go back to the day I hit my ugw and all time LW. It's like a little time capsule.  I basically wrote about how shitty and awful I felt and how the numbers were meaningless beacause I still hated myself. For me seeing the shit I said then proved to me that it's not worth it to be skinny as fuck if it interferes this much with my happiness. I know it's hard but it gets better. Best of luck.,False,False
