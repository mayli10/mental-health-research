Your responses to my posts in a different community were very difficult to understand and they register as being closed off.   I'm positive that I'm much older than you. The age gap is probably contributing to the difference in communication style and my frustration.  I also have a hard time accepting vague information.   I welcome discussion, especially on an opposing view point. That's how we learn. Being right isn't important. Finding the truth is.   Anyway, I wasn't fighting with you but I was definitely getting frustrated.",False,False

More information on the NPYY can be found in scientific journals and literature. I was not overplaying eating disorders nor was I making narrow conclusions. That's not how I roll. Oh, and where did I say I was specifically referring to eating disorders only?    I was addressing something that happens in a general population. I go by research, data, analysis, and results. ""I feel like...."" doesn't fly in the scientific community.  Do the research and support your hypothesis/claim with facts and get back to me.  I don't know what your deal is. I welcome discussion, but childish arguments are for amateurs. I didn't finish grad school to waste time on weak debates. I'm bored.",False,False

When blood sugar decreases,  NPYY increases. High levels of NPYY  make us want to binge, especially on  high carb foods because they raise blood sugar quickly. It's a survival mechanism. I think that *not* eating is the fundamental trigger more than eating is. Appetizers make you want to eat more because you are already hungry. There many variables involved. For instance, a person's emotional state can be a factor into this.  This is just one explanation touching on a very complex topic.",False,False

Even as a kid, once I started eating I just couldnt stop. I remember being 11 and binging so badly that I was literally pushing food down my throat because I was so full that I could hardly swallow.  I guess I had BED, even as a young kid. That turned into bulimia when I was 12, but this problem with food started a long time before that.",False,False
