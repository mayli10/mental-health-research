Also there are tutorials online on how to remove bloatware (pre installed apps that you dont want). Sorry I cant help more though, I've never had an apple phone",False,False

I’ve tried that option you mention, but as far as I’m able to work the function it just deletes past data. Still tracks everything going forward. Honestly so frustrating",False,True

For now I'm ok with some of the general tracking but I \*emphatically\* dislike that new ""trends"" information. It hacks right into the competitive and numbers-fixated portions of my brain. I also wish I could turn the stupid ""stand"" ring off on my Apple watch. But it's therrrre and it's hard to just let it sit there partially closed.  If you want I think you can at least turn off the step tracking through settings -&gt; privacy -&gt; motion and fitness. There may be some other hacks out there to hide or delete data...unsure. Good luck!",False,False
