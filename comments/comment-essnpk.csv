I know it's because they are sexually frustrated and that it reflects badly on them. So why am I so upset? Ugh I hate being eye candy and I hate being ugly.,False,True

I just want to dress up because it makes me feel less shitty and ugly, not because I want every guy's dick. These men literally believe that women even breath just for them to notice. I'm sick of being gawked at (seriously some guys stare at me with their mouths open), hit on and harassed. They think I want it, because I'm one of the only women who dress up. It just makes me want to binge and purge honestly, but I'm too scared of eating.",False,True

Just leave me alone already and don’t bother me- I’m already in a long term abusive relationship- with my EDs.,False,False
