If I don’t have refined sugars for about 3 says I stop craving it, and it’s usually sugary trash that I binge on. So I just kind of isolate myself for a few days with nothing in my cupboards but veg and cereal (the only sugar I’ll have during this detox period bc it’s been my comfort food since I was 2 lol I can’t give it up but it’s too expensive to binge on) and just either not eat or be forced to eat veg. After that period I could take or leave dessert if I’m eating out w my boyfriend or walk past a corner shop without getting chocolate and it won’t feel like a huge struggle",False,False
