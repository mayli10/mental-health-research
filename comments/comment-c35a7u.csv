You could have higher bone density and a lot less actual fat than you think. Youâ€™re also close to being underweight, only off by a couple of pounds.   Are you taking vitamins and staying hydrated? My concern with the joints would be magnesium specifically.   When youâ€™re eating are you eating nutrient dense food high in protein or mostly processed stuff? Heavy carb diets will make you feel like crap too ðŸ˜¥",False,False
