When I was in the ward I had this FANTASTIC nurse for the first half of it who would check in on me and have one on one conversations and was so kind and then the second half nurse routinely forgot my meds, would be a dick when I asked for them, and then discharged me ELEVEN HOURS LATE cause he didn't feel like doing the work.",False,False

Not Ed related but I had some extensive dental work done and it was so painful the doctor kept asking why I was squirming and sweating. I kept trying to say it was hurting really bad and I couldn’t handle it and he just said “you’re stronger than that!” After I just started crying and the receptionist gave me some kind of pain medication. Obviously she shouldn’t have really done that but she prolly felt bad cuz she saw me waiting for my Uber sobbing lol.  But yeah I’m sorry that happened I don’t understand why they can act like that when a patient is dealing with serious mental health issues?,False,False

We were visiting my aunt on her death bed, and there were nurses in the hall right outside the door laughing and talking about lunch. I get that you're desensitized, but maybe you shouldn't be in that field of work if you can't show some goddamn humanity.",False,False
