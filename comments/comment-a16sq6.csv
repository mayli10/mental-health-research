I would be so nauseous I was worried I might throw up if I was on public transportation.   I started to get used to the nausea and eventually it dissipated, thank god. It took time, but I also ate a ton of high volume veggies and fiber. Psyllium husk smoothies to ‘gel’ in my stomach for the morning, huge portions of vegetables and miracle noodles for lunch, protein and tons of veggies for dinner. I kept myself as ‘full’ as possible without really eating anything.   I’m so sorry, I know how rough that is ",False,False

A few things that help (not always though):  Crushed ice (I “eat” it with a spoon)  Sour fruits like Granny Smith apples or kiwi  Nairn’s ginger biscuits  Pukka three ginger tea  Chamomile tea with honey and lemon or lime  White rice with loads of salt and either tomato paste or sumac   And if all else fails, pepto usually helps. Has to be the liquid kind though, not tablets.",False,False

The best thing I found for nausea is pure ginger tea! Not sure where you're located, but there is a line called Traditional Medicinals that does one called Ginger Aid. It's usually near the pharmacy  in stores rather than the  coffee and tea aisle. I would look it up and find something like that. The ginger is there for therapeutic effect so it's extra strong. It works great! Ginger ""flavored"" tea doesn't have the same effect.",False,False
