I saw the pictures. I don't need my family to see it in real life.  I know it's stupid and hypocritical, since restriction can kill me too and it would still be traumatic, but somehow dying next to or in a toilet full of puke is just one step too far. I feel like my restriction cycles are easier to control than purging would be. Purging seems so addictive and easy. Same reason I won't take opiates for pain control if I can help it. Tylenol can kill you too, but morphine can fuck you up even more. ",False,False

I’ve wasted SO MUCH money - that one is pretty self explanatory.   7. I’m always dizzy - purging throws off your electrolytes pretty badly, which causes you to get really dizzy all the time ",False,False

I can see my tooth wearing away. ALSO, after I purge that tooth hurts, bad.   2. my heart is fucked - I now have heart palpitations and chest pain, I’m on medication for my heart now. I don’t feel like I have to even elaborate on that, that should be scary enough.   3. my gag reflex is so fucked that I can’t brush my teeth without throwing up. literally, I cannot brush my tongue because I will throw up, then I have to go the rest of the day with puke breath because you can’t brush your teeth after throwing up, because you’ll just ruin your enamel even more than you did from throwing up!  4. my throat is always in pain - always. as you could imagine, shoving your fingers down your throat is not the most comfortable thing to do, and it does quite a bit of damage to your throat.   that’s all I can think of right now, but just don’t do it,,, it’s not worth it.

You'll lose lots of money to food, you'll feel miserable all the time, and you'll skip out on social functions so you can stay home and binge and purge. The worst part is you won't even lose much weight, and you might even gain weight.",False,False

Attractiveness of food and fullness signals are then modified accordingly: if you're eating to satiety and purging, your brain will notice the lack of calories and make adjustments to how you see food and feel satiety. The amount of food you'll need to eat to reach satiety will increase and increase, until you can't control yourself around food and will binge-eat every time you start eating.  This binge-eating won't stop when you stop purging either. Your brain will still think that only 500 calories are going to be absorbed from a 2000 calorie meal, and it will take time before it adjusts to 2000 calories eaten equating to 2000 calories absorbed again. Even if you continue to purge, on average people tend to only be able to get rid of half of the calories they've eaten. This is why the majority of people with bulimia are either normal weight or overweight.  So, at the end you will have had to get root canals from enamel damage and cavities, have yellow stained teeth, messed up your hunger cues and ended up weighing more than you would have otherwise. Suffice to say, it's not worth it.",False,False

When you start purging, it becomes compensatory for eating, and you'll probably start thinking it's not as big a deal when you eat bc you can always purge it back up again. It's impossible to really know how much you've purged though, so it's likely (esp at the beginning) that you're retaining 60+% of the calories.   It takes away so much time from what you could be doing. When I started purging, my GPA dropped. That semester, I got my first C and 3 B's--before that, I had a 3.9 GPA, but I no longer do. I started purging in the bathrooms at work. I purged when I should've been studying, and when I didn't think I purged everything, I overexercised (3+ hours at a time). I missed a morning lecture class to purge my breakfast.   Purging hurts your throat. After a bad purge, it would hurt to even talk or swallow--choir rehearsals were painful, and I couldn't perform at my best. Purging also made my knuckles bleed sometimes, and the cuts never had time to heal bc I was purging 3+ times a day.   On top of that, it's such a difficult secret. You have to be super careful all the time, especially if you live with family or roommates, and you always feel guilty and wonder if everyone knows. It's constantly on your mind. It's a constant source of worry--what if someone finds out? What will they think of me? But purging becomes addictive, in a way. It seems like such an easy solution. It isn't. ",False,False

Among other things, purging can cause: acid reflux, hoarse throat, dehydration, digestive issues, heart arrhythmia, and stomach ulcers. Hopefully these risks can discourage you. Good luck.",False,False
