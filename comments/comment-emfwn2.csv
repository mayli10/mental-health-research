At least about health and weight.   Your dad is wrong about anorexics. And the comment about ""real anorexics"" is so casual, dismissive and ill-informed. Please do not take his word as medical advice.  The current way anorexia is diagnosed focuses on the extreme fear of being overweight and obsession with loosing weight etc. It does not have a minimum BMI criteria. Even a person in the normal range can be diagnosed with it.   I am sorry we live in cultures that value so much numbers on scales and shape in relation to celebrities (who are not necessarily healthy!). And don't give a flying fuck about fitness. Not the modern ""fitness"" (fit=skinny / fit=beefy), but real fitness, as in body's ability to actually do stuff...  I don't feel qualified enough to say much about healthy choices but I suppose it's okay to recommend to just stay physically active regularly. Having a healthy body capable of physical activity when needed and enough nutrition to keep your brain functioning well, will keep you happy in the long run. Than achieving or maintaining any particular body shape ever would.  Check out how happy she is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ic7RNS4Dfo)",False,False
