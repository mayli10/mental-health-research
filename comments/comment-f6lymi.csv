Supporting someone can be emotionally taxing so remember to take care of yourself and take breaks from the situation when you need to. Go for walks or do something to distract yourself if things get too much for you.,False,False

Thanks for the tip! I might try sharing one meal when we dine alone (normally we eat all together, me my sis my brother and his gf, or mom, but I don't want to bring attention to her eating in front of everyone). I'm going to try to talk to mom about this, maybe even suggest looking for a therapist that my sister's health insurance covers.",False,True

Explain that she is depressed, rapidly losing weight and eating very little. Perhaps they can do something for her.  I know breakups can be bad but usually after a few days you can eat fairly normally and function better. Maybe she's dealing with more than the breakup or maybe it's not the breakup it's self but her self esteem and self worth is suffering big time?  It will be hard for you but just do your best to get by. It might not be helpful but perhaps you could try sharing one meal instead of both eating a meal? It might not feel so challenging then. Or serve up one entree each so that it's more managable for you both to get through?",False,False
