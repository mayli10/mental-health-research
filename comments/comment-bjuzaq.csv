If I start doing negative self talk, I will try to say or read my main mantras which are:  - You deserve to eat. Yep, hello ED. - Slow down. I get really anxious and rush around even if I’m not late or have the ability to take my time. I also talk super fast or get ahead of myself. This helps me take a breath.  - There is nothing wrong with you. This is for when I get too deep into my failures or flaws. I usually also include “it’s okay” a lot into this one.  - You can do it.  Usually when I am struggling to do something because I feel worthless or like a failure. This one also has specific cadence when I say it in my head. I say it like I’m talking to my dog and it helps me that way.",False,False

It's on how to name your emotions and acknowledge your suffering--for example, when you're beating yourself up, you acknowledge how bad that makes you feel. Helps a ton. Definitely order the book if you're serious about getting better.",False,False

I’ve also got the mental inertia from decades of berating and invalidating myself, so it’s a slow process of building trust with myself (if that makes sense). The two things I find most helpful are:  - **validate how I’m feeling:** Invalidation from others is a huge trigger for me...and then I started to see how often I do it to myself. So I’m trying to say things like, “It’s understandable you’re feeling anxious.” “I’m sorry things are so difficult right now.” Basically, to try to be gentle with myself instead of judging. (When I catch myself judging, I try not to judge that either, lol.) By validating how I’m feeling, I have better luck getting my brain to accept some nugget of logic or hope.  - **Use questions instead of cracking the whip:** I struggle to accomplish daily goals, and my tendency is to get real mean with myself. But being harsh with myself just isn’t working (grrr). I heard an interesting talk by Dan Pink about how asking yourself “Can I do this?” is often more effective than saying “You can do this!” So I try to ask questions, and encourage myself to take small steps. “Can you study today? ... Even 15 minutes would be good! ... What is making studying feel overwhelming?” Stuff like that -  just getting a dialogue going between my logical and emotional mind (versus being trapped in my emotions).  (Can you tell I’ve been consigned to years of therapy, lol?)",False,False
