Not the way it looks, but what it's done. All the abuse and the yo-yoing between weights and she bounces back, still here to take me to work and protect me. I'm so grateful. My body is all I really have. All we really have with us until the end. I tell my body that I love her and I'm not going to abuse her anymore. I'm not even kidding. I set a limit, I try not to go below that limit because that would be hard on my body. Make sure to take your vitamins and have a nice bath every now and then as self care, maybe paint your nails. This is your struggle and the people around you might never understand, and they can't make it better, but that doesn't mean they don't care about you. Whatever you have to do, take care of yourself.  :)",False,False
