I don't trust my cooked pasta weight because I'm worried it will absorb more or less water than the 'average pasta' and my calorie count will be wrong if I weigh it cooked lol,False,False

Then I add a shit load of spices like paprika and cayenne. It makes quite a big bowl. I track it all on mfp and it's always about 400 cals and super great!",False,False
