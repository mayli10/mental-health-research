I live with 3 other randos who luckily don't have people over that often, but I've had to walk past them when they are in our living room/kitchen area to get to my room while carrying bags of binge food or get my delivery lol it's always so embarrassing and just the other day I ordered way too much pizza for one person to eat and not look like a lunatic and I almost had a heart attack because my roommates were getting ready to go out and I thought that I would have to answer the door for the pizza and they would see it as they were leaving. I got so lucky though because they left and like just a few minutes later the pizza guys shows up lol. Also, one time I really needed to microwave the pizza rolls I bought and my roommate had someone over and I heard them in the kitchen so I waited until it seemed like they were back in her room. When I went out to microwave them, I saw that they were cooking a frozen pizza in the oven, but there was only 4 minutes till it was done. I needed 5 and 1/2 minutes to microwave my pizza rolls and I didn't want them to come out at the same time as me coming back to get the pizza rolls so I upped the time on their pizza to 6 minutes and mission impossibled that shit in the 30 seconds I had to get my food and back to my room lol not my proudest moment. I have zero idea if they know what's up with my bulimia, the walls of our apartment are paper thin so it wouldn't be impossible that they have heard me although I try to be quiet. I also hardly ever keep any type of food in our fridge/freezer/pantry and always take ""groceries"" straight to my room never to be seen again. I do cook occasionally that they have seen although I try to avoid them as much as possible when I do decide to cook something since its usually a pot of pasta or stew that I literally take the whole pot back with me to my room. Most of the time they are not around to see what I'm doing with food but idk what it looks like from the outside perspective of someone without an eating disorder especially since I'm not skinny or anything.",False,False

I just have one roommate but she had friends over and they were in the kitchen for the last few hours so I didn't get to cook my meal tonight and I'm annoyed even though I shouldn't be! Like nothing is stopping me from going in the kitchen but ugh I do not want to socialize or have them see me eat food lol,False,False

We did kinda understand though it's not their fault we have eating issues, and they're entitled to linger around in their own home. I live alone now and it's much better, hang in there! I used to always make sure I had safe food snacks in my room for when situations like this would happen.",False,False
