You know what I did? I gave her some of my old Bronkaid and caffeine pills ""to start off with"" (you know, EC stacking). She got scared the next morning and didn't even take them lol",False,False

I am on it as well. Weight loss CAN be a side effect, but only because it can combat the loss of energy that your depression takes away and can be a mild appetite suppressant for some people. It has done nothing for me in terms of that.   As others have said, a potential side effect of going over your recommended dose include seizures. It should be used under the moderation of a physician. My doctor thought I should increase my dosage, but I immediately started having trouble breathing and had to go back down. It should absolutely not be messed with, and it is not a diet pill.  She should also not be stealing medication from you. I would report her, if you are in a position to do so.",False,False

And even if you don't get in, you can try again next year. Sometimes it's good to take some time off, you can work, travel, do hobbies or sports, or (if they exist in your country) take classes at a community college (or free classes online, if not!) if you wanna keep busy. If you have any kind of side project or personal interest you could pursue, you can do that, too!   Waiting definitely sucks though. Just know that you'll be okay no matter what happens. I'll be thinking of you and hoping you get in somewhere, or find something nice to do while you wait to retake the exams next year!  Back to mom: when you get the new prescription, can you not tell her about it? Or tell her you're not taking them anymore, and keep them somewhere she can't get to them? It's really not fair that she's using your meds when you need them, not to mention potentially dangerous and legally questionable. I'm really sorry she's being so selfish right now.",False,False

Those pills are for you and you only, and she can get in serious trouble if something happens to her as a result of taking that medication not prescribed for her, and maybe get you in trouble too. And I don't mean just physical reactions to the medication.   Please try to keep her from taking it, and try to take it back. Definitely tell your psychiatrist - you need those extra pills if she won't return them, and maybe they can help you keep them from her in the future.  Also, I know this wasn't the focus of your post, but I'm really sorry about your university results. That sucks so much, I can't even imagine how it feels. I don't know how the exams work, can you take them again in a few months or in a year? Is there another chance to still get accepted this year?   ",False,False
