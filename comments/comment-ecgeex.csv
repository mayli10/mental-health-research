I am happy you bring this up, because I have been putting on a crusade against the normalization of disordered eating which can lead to the development of eating disorders! Just two days ago, I was somewhat talking about this on EDAnonymous with someone that didn't believe me on the rising statistics of those affected by EDs and so I compiled a 12 page paper of research about, partially, the subject you are talking about. So, the main thing to think about if you are located in the U.S.A, Asian, or some parts of Europe is that diet culture is seen as a good thing, if not outright encouraged. Now, the reasoning behind this is varied. It could be a cultural or societal issue, it could be epigenetics and prenatal stress of the mother or stress of the father before conception, it could be a government-enforced (see Japanese Fat Tax). There are many reasons that people have deemed disordered eating as good.     Side note, disordered eating is defined as follows.  ""(1) negative body image; (2) unhealthy forms of weight management; (3) overvaluing the self in terms of perceived weight and shape in relation to unrealistic standards of beauty, fitness, and muscularity; (4) irrational fear and loathing of body fat and fat people, all feeding drives for thinness and leanness; (5) harsh self-surveillance and self-difficulties in self-regulation; and (6) binge eating. People who have eating attitudes and behaviors that generate mild-to-moderate problems...and who have moderate-to-high levels of (1), plus (2) or (6), and at least one of (3)-(5) fall into the broad category of disordered eating (Levine &amp; Smolak, 2006). Each of these continua, while unhealthy, is ordinary to the point of being normative and culturally syntonic""  ( Eating Disorders, Addictions and Substance Use Disorders: Research, Clinical and Treatment Perspectives by Timothy D. Brewerton, Amy Baker Dennis and Editors ).  &amp;#x200B;  So in that definition alone, it states that these behaviors are viewed as socially acceptable by most of society. Now, I am just scraping the surface on why disordered eating has become a norm, but to boil it down to one sentence, it is the societal acceptance of diet culture being healthy (hell, I got an email from corporate the other week encouraging intermittent fasting) and people accepting that putting a societal stigma on things like being overweight, eating a number of calories instead of enjoying food in a healthy way, if an individual is not pursuing being thin, that to be thin is to be seen as 'attractive', and soo many more. If we keep normalizing these thought processes, then it is no wonder we have a culture with such an unhealthy relationship with food on both extremes of the spectrum.",False,False
