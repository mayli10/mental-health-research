Dating is still really hard, but just know that nobody judges your body the way you do. If someone is with you, they find you attractive. It gets easier, but I know that it's one of the reasons I'm still alone. As for sex, I usually keep the lights off and only do positions that don't make my body look terrible. Sometimes I keep my shirt on. It's not ideal, but it's better than missing out on sex entirely.",False,False

It's really hard to make it not-a-contest to see who can be the sickest. I feel like she's more entitled to one because she's a girl but I'm 'better' at it because I've been hospitalised.   I don't think we're toxic for eachother though because I was the one who noticed she was disordered and encouraged her to get help.   Part of me kept thinking, am I projecting onto her?  But then I'd realise that all we ever talk about is food, and that she can't eat without forcing down a laxative tea right after, and can only eat a packet of smarties a day, constantly wears a corset, and admitted to me that she binges.   I feel very guilty because I wasn't sure if I triggered it by being so ill myself. Mine presents very differently though. I can actually make myself throw up so I don't abuse laxatives and I don't have body dysmorphia like she does.    I'm constantly wanting to be thinner than her, to have her eat more than me. It's fucked up. I want her to recover though",False,False

I'm also not into sex at all which I told her from the get go. Knowing we both struggle helps us to be considerate with each other, encourage each other, and understand when we have bad days. My only concern is that I trigger her unintentionally, but we try to be open about all of it",False,False

Even after marriage I didn't feel comfortable completely spilling my heart out about my ED. I'm grey ace so intimacy wasn't something I was concerned with, but I definitely shriek like a goat when she opens the door while I'm changing.  Now, I'm fully transparent about what I eat, what I do, and how I feel. Shes definitely my rock and I'm forever grateful to her.",False,False

I don't allow myself to get into relationships anymore, it's been like 8 years lmao.  I'm terrified of the fact that they would want physical contact, like, I dislike hugs and stuff because I feel so fat and I feel like other people would feel how fat I am. The thought of other people seeing my body is crazy, like...if I'm so repulsed by it I don't see why anyone would remotely love it? I'm also terrified of the idea that they may want to get food and stuff, I don't want to get into a relationship and it makes me gain loads of weight or something because I already hate myself SO much, I don't really want to get even closer to the point of wanting to actually commit... ü§°ü§°",False,False
