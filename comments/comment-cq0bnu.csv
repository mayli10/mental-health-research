Like, a therapist is worthless too if you don't do their homework.   I say, follow your dietitian's advice as much as possible, and when you can't, that's what your therapist is for. To figure out why you can't and how to get to the point where you can.",False,False

Keep in mind that I'm 120 lbs now, so you may be able to eat a lot more.  Using the 2200/0 method as an example: I still intermittent fast on my eating days so that I can feel like I'm eating a lot in a short amount of time.  \- I eat one healthy, low calorie, filling meal for my first meal that day before I start going into ""binge"" more. This is usually a gigantic salad with Olive Garden Italian dressing sprinkled with some salt and pepper. This works really well for me because  \- It's no more than 200 calories(leaving me 2000 calories to eat whatever I want)  \- It's filling so I don't want to/can't binge as much  \- I'm still getting some nutrients that day no matter what I eat later  Now, I don't know about you but my problem is sweets. So, what I've done is found a few recipes that are delicious but much lower calorie compared to the ""regular"" versions and I eat those instead. That way I can have so much more food but still satisfy my sweet tooth. I honestly don't even miss the higher calorie options because the recipes I've found are really tasty.  Now as for making it through my fasting days:  I drink a shit ton of seltzer water, flavored tea, water, and coffee. I probably end up eating closer to 50 calories those days because I do eat pickles if I'm really hungry and I do put almond milk in my coffee, and I'll chew some sugar-free gum if I need something sweet. Mentally I tell myself that it's just one day and it'll be worth it because I'll be able to put out tomorrow.  If you want to know how my 1700/500 calorie days to, let me know :)  I hope this helps.  As sort of an aside, I log how many calories I'm eating for each day of that week in my calendar app. Sounds silly but it makes me feel like I'm in control of my eating.",False,False

What has been really helpful, aside from not buying binge food and having a meal plan (I’m going to ask my dietitian to do it for me, because managing my calorie input every day is actually making me feel worse), and there’s a book called “Brain Over Binge” by Kathryn Hansen, I read the bulk of it. I didn’t care about the author’s memoir sections, so I skipped them. But the actually theory was really great. It talks about neuroplasticity and the idea that if you do something, you create a pathway, neurologically, and if you keep doing that thing, you make the pathway stronger. So the idea is to weaken those links around bingeing and purging using neuroplasticity. I’m going to read it again, because after this little crisis I’ve been through, I need a bit of a reset, as it were.  Like you, IE/HAES were useless to me because I spent so long ignoring my urges around food that I couldn’t really trust them anyway and I think that’s why IE, particularly fails for me. I tried IF for a while too, but I think it just made my ED and my binges far worse. IF made fasting a norm for me, which it never was before that. So I’ve gone back to eating regularly, and keeping myself to two to three meals a day. Most often, it’s just keeping myself busy at night to avoid bingeing that I need to do. So I do the bulk of my video gaming then, or I do some creative writing. Something to keep myself mentally busy, which is the biggest part of overcoming/ignoring binge urges.  Hopefully you’ve found some of my ramble helpful :)",False,False

I've done two ways:  eating everyday in a 4-6 hr eating window and  Eating every other day(e.g., 2200 calories one day, 0 the next) or, eating 500 calories one day and around 1700 calories the next.
