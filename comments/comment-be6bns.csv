There are vegan versions/substitutes of virtually any animal product and vegan options aren't necessarily lower in calories. Veganism doesn't have to be only salads and fruit. So maybe if you can demonstrate that you're eating the same kinds of ""normal food"", just veganized versions, maybe that would help your supporters feel more comfortable? You can tell them that you're still on board with eating vegan mac and cheese, vegan burgers, vegan pizza, vegan ice cream, etc., but that it's important to you to support animal and environmental justice. Meeting with a dietitian who is familiar with veganism and can give you a recommended meal plan to readjust to veganism without restricting again could help you stay on track and provide a safety net if things do get more difficult again. Best of luck!",False,False

Like a lot of yoghurts and cottage cheese",False,False

Also, I recently got diagnosed with ME and she thought that stopping the veganism would possibly help alleviate the symptoms of that. Thing is, it’s been a good while and noting has changed. I would like to just start being vegan and healthy instead of feeling like I have permission to binge my face off.",False,True

Because it's easier to get the same amount of nutrients from animal products than plan it out on a vegan diet.",False,False
