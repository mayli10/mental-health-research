It's basically you have to go through a mental ""detox"" to break the habit.   I guess its important to know because it's never going to be ""just this one time"" or ""I'll only use it when I NEED it.""   Because ^^^ is exactly how the spiral started.   Right now I can't phrase it as ""never again"" though because then it's going to be, ""I need one last binge.""   This is what I suspected was true- the longer you go without it the less severe the urges will be. I'm trying hard to break the cycle. Again, I really appreciate your comment because it's nice to see someone on the other side and know that it does get easier.",False,False

It‚Äôs amazing you can recognize this moment and acknowledge that you‚Äôre moving forward, even WHILE you‚Äôre doing it!  Two pieces of advice from a recovered (not yet capital r Recovered) 27 y/o with similar patterns: 1. The longer you go without using the behavior (purging), the less likely you ever are going to do it again. My therapist told me this and I think of it like my brain DEwiring itself. I don‚Äôt want to rewire back by going through the old motions.  2. Pay attention to the bingeing. I didn‚Äôt purge for 17 months but continued to binge, which maintained a really stressful dynamic w food, but also made it wayyy more likely I‚Äôd relapse when other life stressors crept in. Which I did, bc I was still bingeing to the point of discomfort anyway. You surprised yourself with your ability to resist urges, make a change, and see the benefits! Maybe you‚Äôll surprise yourself again and see positive results by eating regularly in smaller amounts, and with others a few times a week.  It‚Äôll only feel weird to not binge the first few times bc it‚Äôs different, then it won‚Äôt be so different so it won‚Äôt feel so weird! If that helps/makes sense",False,False
