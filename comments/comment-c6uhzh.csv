Yeah, I always use them to add bulk to veggie dishes, usually something with a homemade peanut sauce. Can't imagine using pasta sauce on them. I'll def try that second recipe.  As a weird side note, one of my most specific binge cravings is entire jars of pasta sauce. Like, I can just pour a full room temp jar into a bowl and eat it straight with a spoon.
