Forcing yourself to be sick is not part of a healthy eating pattern. Next time you feel very nauseous you might consider laying down for a bit and relaxing. I personally like having a heating pad on my stomach and taking a short nap (15 min). Don’t let this one set back lose hope. Just pick yourself up and keep going one day you’ll feel happy and healthy!,False,False
