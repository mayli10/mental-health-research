My dad had a borderline ED in my tween/teen years and my mom used to have an ED (that's now like...""disordered eating""), and they both triggered the hell out of me when I was a kid. And they STILL trigger me bc they are never not trying to lose weight (although they rarely do anymore, which somehow triggers me even more), and like your dad/stepmom, they're always in some competition about it.   So I understand how stressful this kind of environment is, and I know it's really hard to let go of that kind of family influence. It's impressive that you're able to recognize you can't fix them or control what they do - that's a great foundation for starting to move past this. Be kind to yourself &lt;3",False,False

I would even try to avoid starting the meal in the same room. If they insist on meals together, say, ""okay I'll eat at the same time as you but I'm going to sit in the next room because I've asked you to stop commenting on how much/what I'm eating and you havent, so this is how I'm taking care of that problem,""  I'm sorry they arent respecting your wishes.",False,False

I have asked this multiple times and it hasnâ€™t happened.  Would it be too much for me to just... walk out of the room when they start? When I was deep in my ED, I would have thrown the food away and gone home. I donâ€™t want to have that same vibe,  but I want to be firm in my boundary.",False,True

I understand its exciting for you to lose weight but it would be appreciated if you kept comments to your food and body at the very least, rather than making it also about me. Thanks,"" even if you didnt have an ED it would be reasonable to not want someone constantly commenting on your intake. If you're not comfy saying that, it's understandable, but I'm sure your dad and stepmom would rather have to watch what they say than not see you at all for the next few months!",False,False
