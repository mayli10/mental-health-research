I‚Äôm sure plenty of people have tips on stopping the binge cycle rather than how to restrict under a certain number.   Ps I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a terrible question I just think nobody wants to look ‚Äúpro ana‚Äù cause we don‚Äôt wanna risk our sub getting removed again ya know? ,False,False

This sub doesnt encourage tips, because it would then become a Pro ana problem. We want people to get better, of course we wont push recovery on people, but giving out tips is a no no. This definitely isnt the place to ask, and this post might be removed by mods.",False,False

Sorry if this is triggering to anyone. Just trying to make my bingeing a temporary thing, and lose a bit of the extra lbs that I put on. Obviously cico, but I want some advice that works psychologically to limit cravings. ",False,True
