Maybe your barista was annoyed, but probably not. It's okay for you to take your time. Don't be ashamed to ask questions, it's their job. You're not doing anything wrong.  ❤",False,False

I have severe social anxiety so I almost never order food or buy anything if it means looking at or talking to another person. Sometimes in restaurants I write notes to my servers to convey things. You don't have to feel bad about taking a few moments to decide whether or not you will get something. It's more than okay to ask questions. I bet you were more polite than most other people that barista interacted with that day. I give you props. ,False,False
