It makes everything a lot easier for when I either don‚Äôt get paid or get paid very little. I try to get enough to last 2 weeks, maybe 3 if I have enough money. Here I have a grocery outlet which specializes in foods that are close or past the sell-by date so frozen foods are *super* cheap and still fine.   Then I‚Äôll estimate how much it‚Äôs going to cost me for my Red Bull addiction. I‚Äôll look online to get an idea of which store might have them cheapest, or I‚Äôll just check them out in person because I love grocery stores and will find any excuse to wander around them.   Worst case, I just over estimate. A single can of a 12oz sugar free Red Bull is generally $3 before tax. So I just round up to $4 for a worst case scenario. I like to get at least 1 for every day of the week, so I plan on grabbing 7-8 of them (most sales are like 2/$5, 3/$7, etc). Just do a quick 4 x 7, that‚Äôs $28, so Red Bull‚Äôs are going to soak up nearly $30. Some weeks that‚Äôs my entire budget, others I‚Äôll have $10-20 extra for foods. Which isn‚Äôt terrible since generally all I need are staples like bread, fruits/veggies, and almond milk. And since I over estimate, usually I have a bonus couple of bucks.   ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I just settle. It‚Äôs an expensive habit but it‚Äôs better than when I smoked. Lol. Investing in food that lasts a long time is my main and most effective strategy. That or fasting. Lol. Worst case I go to coffee, even though I kind of hate it.",False,False
