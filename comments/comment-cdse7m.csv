The body can only absorb what it is built to absorb.  Plus, it produces waste on its own, so there is always going to be waste.  Constipation occurs when there isn‚Äôt enough waste volume going into the large intestine to trigger it to contract.  Also, the body deprioritizes ‚Äúless important‚Äù functions like colon (and, for example, reproductive) function when it‚Äôs malnourished.  When waste remains in the colon for too long, the colon reabsorbs its water content, creating hard stool that is even more difficult to pass.  It‚Äôs a nasty, vicious cycle.",False,False
