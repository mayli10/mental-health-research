My best friend who went away for college told me she wouldn't have time to hang out with me because she'd be prioritizing her family after so long away...and then had a big Thanksgiving party with a group of friends I no longer seem to be a part of. None of them asked me to go.  I'm not coping with it well either so I'm sorry I don't have any advice, but I just wanted to say that you're so not alone and it's really okay to feel this way. It sucks so bad, so try to be a little softer on yourself for the next few days. You'll be okay.",False,False

It fucking sucks seeing them together on social media, especially one time when they came an hour away from where they live to the mall right by my apartment without letting me know. I know how much it hurts.   The good news is there's always tomorrow, and there's always better friends out there who don't treat you like dirt. Hope you feel better soon!! ♥",False,False
