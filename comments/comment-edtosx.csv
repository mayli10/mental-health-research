I always have to remind myself that people canâ€™t give you what they donâ€™t have.   That doctor couldnâ€™t give you what you needed, they just donâ€™t have it. They didnâ€™t mean anything bad by it but it did have a negative effect. It sounds like they did do the best they could. Telling someone with an ED who is only 20 pounds overweight WHO IS ALREADY TRYING TO LOSE WEIGHT that they need to lose weight is pretty embarrassing (for them).   I would maybe write them a letter explaining what happened and the effect it had on you. Donâ€™t make it sound angry, but just factual- an educational tool for them to understand the situation outside of their own experience.   I hope you find a counsellor soon, I know itâ€™s so hard. ðŸ’•",False,False

Iâ€™ve been looking for a new counselor now that Iâ€™m out of school but itâ€™s been difficult. I do hope I can crawl out of the rut eventually.  Thank you so much ðŸ’•,False,True

Itâ€™s supposed to be a space where you are safe, physically and mentally.   Does your doctor know about your history ?   Also, Iâ€™m so sorry youâ€™ve been having such a tough time. Birth control, antidepressants and stress can be really triggering and make it quite challenging to lose weight and your doctor should be aware of that and offer some ways to help you cope instead of just telling you what you already know. Do you have a therapist or counsellor you can call to help you regain some stability?",False,False
