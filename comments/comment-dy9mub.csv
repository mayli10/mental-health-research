I think I'll wait until I'm feeling a bit more positive about my weight before I try any other scale.  Totally get what you mean about mirrors, why is it we only accept the most negative conclusion?",False,True

Or at least thats true for the one my roommate has. actually my brother weighed himself on that scale and said it listed him as 4 lbs more so I feel better about it being inaccurate.  On a side note..: i have mirror trust issues. I’ll see myself as slightly thinner that my mind perceives me in 90% of mirrors, and I’m like “this is definitely a skinny mirror” and then one random mirror in a shitty bathroom is distorted and makes me look 30% heavier and I’m like “this is the real me i guess” even though I’m pretty sure logically that mirror is probably not accurate. Def doesn’t help that my room’s mirror is a fat mirror so thats the image i see the most. 😂",False,False
