I wouldn’t say my job is *particularly* physically demanding - as I mentioned, I’m on my feet and rushing around, but my shifts are typically pretty short so I don’t burn too much more.  I try to eat consistently so I’m usually eating around the same amount as you, but I find that even on days I have off where I’m sedentary, I’m easily emotional, exhausted and drained. Even if you’re not particularly physical I think maintaining a decent deficit is going to take its toll eventually. I struggle a lot with work, and certainly the emotional/mental aspects of it are included in that. I imagine I wouldn’t be so easily upset if I wasn’t restricting.   You are valid, and I’m glad you’ve made that connection because it definitely sounds like we’ve both been there!",False,False

So my job wasn't physically demanding or customer facing like yours. It was mentally demanding though, and I would have meltdowns thinking about how I was gonna get fired because I wasn't solving problems or learning fast enough.  I became completely unable to work when I got so stressed I was low restricting which made sense to me but I never realized high restricting also impacted my work. Thanks ED",False,False

How would you cope at all not eating? I always make sure I eat “enough” (ie not low restrict) just bc I’m so scared of losing my jobs,False,False
