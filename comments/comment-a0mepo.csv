Honestly this is why I don't really bring it up to my husband or tell anyone... Like why bother if I'm not ready to deal with it or try recovery? But honestly I think you are so lucky to have someone who loves and cares for you so much. If you're not ready yet just be honest with her and maybe she can help you make small steps... And maybe one day who knows. You deserve to be free from this hell.,False,False

You're going to be okay. Put your head between your knees and take three deep breaths. Somebody loves you enough to care about your existence which involves fueling your body enough to be here. I know it sucks and it's terrifying and anxiety inducing but it's a Good thing even if you can't believe in it yet. ❤  Accept the love until you believe you deserve it ❤ cause we all know you do. ,False,False
