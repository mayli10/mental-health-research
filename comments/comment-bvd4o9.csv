Maybe at a pharmacy or on amazon.   I just tend to go by how awful my breath gets ðŸ˜‚ but if youâ€™re worried or planning to do keto for a while it might be worth it!,False,False

Especially if you have a lot of ketones in your blood.  Now, if it's binge level carb intake, yeah. No more ketosis.",False,False
