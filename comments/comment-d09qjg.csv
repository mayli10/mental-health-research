It can really fuck up your sleep. Good normal restful sleep will help with managing ED and other related disorders we might have like depression and anxiety.  It’s ok for us to admit we desperately wish we looked like something else or weighed differently but it’s not ok to encourage taking supplements that could be harmful on an individual basis. Even if you’re not saying “take x for y result,” this is borderline.  And yes I know there are people who take melatonin as sleep aid but I also know abusing what could sound like a cure all is not out of the ordinary.",False,False
