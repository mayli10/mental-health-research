My weight increases when I'm busy getting shit done.  At my highest weights I've: graduated, started a career, found love, advanced my career, traveled, made incredible friends. But my ED brain: yOU arE a FaiLUre if YOu'rE nOt THIN!!! Like c'mon, theres so much proof my worth as a person is independent from my weight, why do I still think this?!? -___-   Pleeassee don't listen to your ED. Your worth is so much more than your weight, and you're out here proving it too!!",False,False

Soo true about only feeling secure in weight omg.  I'm having an objectively good life rn but I still want to kms some days just bc I'm heavier than I'd like to be. -___-  Currently have been going to sleep hungry for a month straight sigh.  Gl in grad school!! it's stressful but you'll figure out a good routine for yourself!!,False,False
