I was so disgustingly happy to be empty. But after making it a habit, it didnâ€™t feel good anymore. It was an impulsive decision, or just autopilot kicking in even tho I intensely did not want to purge. My mouth kept getting sores, my skin got terrible, my nails are brittle and cracked, I constantly had a sore throat, I felt sick and exhausted afterwards. Itâ€™s a terrible, demeaning path to go down.  Please try to stay far far away from it. Even now, I have to fight the strongest impulses to purge every single time I eat. Stay safe &lt;3",False,False

Pls try to not let purging become a habit, itâ€™s really hard to come out of, itâ€™s been years for me n I still struggle. Sending love ðŸ’™",False,False

Tried doing it two more times but stopped myself mid-way. I know your struggle. But we won't go there, won't we? We really don't need one more problematic behavior in our lives.",False,False
