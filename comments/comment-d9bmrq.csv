When i asked her about the song she said that she did not like it. Honestly i have to agree with the previous submissions: this song oversimplifies an eating disorder kinda even glorifies it as in ""turning oranges to orange juice"". Pretty sure that binging and purging is more messier than this clean image presented. Also it kinda glosses over the emotional part of an eating disorder a.k.a the actual disorder itself and acts like if you tell a person that they are pretty you will cure them, which is not the case for any eating disorder. Anyways, Melanie gets brownie points for trying to adress a difficult to talk about issue but thats as far as it gets tbh.",False,False

I'm sick of this ""easy"" controversial songs: ""trump bad"", or "" bulimia this, ana that"",  etc---&gt; profit She hypersimplified it and I'm not happy. Also, people's response is ""that's so sad you're beautiful pls don't starve hahah"", kinda of what she said to fleur.",False,False

I get that she's trying to maintain that 'cutesy' image/vibe she has by using oranges as an example, but the idea that she's making binging and purging (something that is inherently fucking gross and dark) into something that sounds kind of clean is gross to me. A bulimic is not a pretty girl demurely spitting out orange pulp into a toilet bowl - it's thick saliva and undigested wads of food and swollen eyes and broken vessels in your face. I really dislike the way she makes bulimia palatable for the purpose of a song while totally ignoring what it actually is like.  Also, the implication in the song is that it's all about being 'beautiful' and that the cure is accepting your appearance for what it is. Which, as most people with any kind of eating disorder will tell you, is not the fucking point at all. It's so much more complicated than the way you look.",False,False

But it has a nice sound i guess,False,False
