I know my therapist even seemed to sense I was getting bad w food again before I did, since she had me tracking what I eat (not cals but just the food) to monitor me. I never even talked to her about my messed up body image, so maybe the fact EDs and personality disorders (or maybe mood disorders) cross over occasionally had something to do with it. I’ll ask when I see her again in a few months for sure ",False,True

I’m hoping to fix that with the psychiatrist. otherwise,  they typically last months at a time (anywhere from 3-6) ",False,True
