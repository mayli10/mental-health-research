And yeah I actually didn’t even know she grew up and randomly decided to look her up a few days ago and realized she was like a young adult, shes so pretty and her style is so classy too! But as with all things it definitely helps to have wealthy parents with connections, who can pay for stylists and consulting for makeup.",False,False

I honestly think they are way too forgiving.  I wouldn't even worry about it because traditional modelling is becoming less and less popular. People are much preferring the 'slim thicc' look.,False,False

Ive always wanted to do it but all the opportunities near me were musical theater and I cant sing :( im looking into it now in college but I live in such an oversaturated area (NYC), so im trying to find student films  to help out with for fun.  Anyway I so feel you on the modeling thing. I was told I would be 5’8 when I was younger but that didnt happen :( but its important to remember that different people carry weight differently, and also dysmorphia can make you focus on other peoples good parts but you might have areas of your body others are jealous of. Also large framed people have things like collarbones showing more easily which is something other people envy :) ps is the model lily rose depp?",False,False
