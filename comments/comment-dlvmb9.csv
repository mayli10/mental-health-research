I've only ever done internships, though, so take the following observations with a grain of salt.  CS requires some focus and mental energy because you learn on the job, but the amount of energy required increases with how MUCH learning you do. Once you've learned theory in school and have a good grasp of programming, most developer roles at the average company (think Fidelity not Amazon) are not that bad. At most you'll be learning a new technology similar to others you've learned. Doing CS research (60-80 hours a week) or specializing in a field like cybersecurity that requires you to complete many certificates in addition to your work will be more difficult.  Also, it depends on the company and team you're on but you will probably be trained and then left mostly alone to finish your work at your own pace. Towards a deadline though you might have to work quickly and with others but not for long.  I think it would be best for you to try doing a CS class or even an internship (if you can, I know finding internships as a freshman is so hard) to figure out what your limit on learning is - and whether you like the workflow of programming (Googling, Googling, drink coffee, ask a coworker, Googling...). A minor in CS might be useful to you in your job search as a math or some other major like finance or writing.  As for me? I'm a trainwreck for multiple reasons so I gave up on doing cybersecurity because I know I won't have energy and focus to do certificates in addition to my job. But I think as long as my ED / etc. doesn't get any worse I can make a living as a developer. And honestly you sound more focused than I am considering a dual major. But only you know you.  And of course, it would be best for my performance if I could recover fully but \*clown shoes squeaking\*",False,False

Last semester I did computer science courses (e.g. machine learning and R). Personally for me, I actually found my semester with programming to be easier with an eating disorder, than the courses that require a lot more text analysis and writing. I think itâ€™s because it was easier for me to work towards practical solutions, than having to read so incredible much. That being said, programming does require a lot of mental energy! But it worked better for me than all my other classes....",False,False

Itâ€™s hard, easier said than done, but try to have a more positive outlook. Your passions come first. As does your mental health.",False,False
