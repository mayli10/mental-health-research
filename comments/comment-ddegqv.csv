To them women are just fuck toys who need to be thin and fuckable their entire life. They are poisoned by porn and all of the macho shit they've been fed their whole lives.   OP you may not have the same outlook on me, but I find that knowing this is pivotal to my recovery. Male scorn is so fucking pathetic, they know that we are conditioned to seek their validation. They know that to be fat and a woman is a socially painful combination, and they leech off the pain we get from that  Fuck that.   And then these men end up being 60, 70 years old, hating their wives because she might have normal issues that women face as we get older  Most of these dudes don't even wash their ass properly. Men spend like 5 minutes total on their total appearance ad hygiene because they know they can get away with it.  Just think about how pitiful and miserable this man must be. Think about how unfortunate the women in their lives are to have him as a father, brother, partner, etc.  Sorry I keep revisiting this post and keep commenting, it's just that it hits home and I hate this so fucking much",False,False

I could, as he's the CEO end the company. But that would jeopardise a lot of jobs and I have friends in there including my boyfriend.  I could also count on never working in this field again as he is a very respected and established post house CEO.   I'm looking for another job and I'm hoping when I'm secure somewhere else with a less toxic senior team I can get some kind of justice.",False,True

We're a post production house in London.   I've known for a while that he doesn't like me but my boyfriend is one of the managers and the company would collapse without him which is probably why I'm still there.  I was meant to go out for a walk with my boyfriend today as we're both trying to lose weight but I'm too embarrassed to leave my house right now. I can't even tell my boyfriend because it was a very priavte email and I shouldn't have been looking at it. But i saw my bfs name and couldn't help it. Especially as our company has had issues with bitching in emails before and i have access to everyone's emails, although i shouldn't really look through.  I just hope I'll be sad for a couple of days and get back on my feet. I'm already looking for another job but it's tough in this field.",False,True

I can only imagine the emotional pain you are in.  I too had anorexia as a teen, developed BED as an adult .... it sucks   Even if you don't have HR, maybe you could send it to his boss?Just make sure to document everything. If you are in the States you could at least take it to the EEOC - this is gender based harassment imo. Plain and simply misogyny, because not only is it a man in power commenting about your appearance, but ""heffa"" is a schoolyard attack directed as women as you know.  I'm so so sorry. I wish I could hug you. Fuck.",False,False

You don't have to explain yourself. It'll fall on deaf ears.   In professional environments they're uneducated when it comes to mental health and careless about what they say and influenced by fat phobic culture, impossible standards of beauty and the belief that eating disorders are superficial first world problems.   Leave them to rot in that ignorance and seek out employers and a workplace that is mental health friendly. Out of sight out of mind. You don't have to prove yourself to him or anyone else and seek approval from them.  Your boss probably is good at his job but he likely has no idea what you're going through and how you feel. Nor does he understand refeeding, anorexia recovery, over-shooting your set point, binge urges etc.   There's Political correctness with everything else, strangely enough. I've been in similar situations through my life. I understand how you feel. Like you were in the wrong place at the wrong time :/",False,False
