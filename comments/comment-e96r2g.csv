I get better, I'm doing okay, I'm maintaining weight and I'm not freaking out over food and I'm not binging... and then I get sick and remember what it's like to restrict and lose and it's like ""fuck why did I ever stop"" and then next thing I know I'm binging and purging and body checking and pouring laundry detergent on fear foods.",False,False
