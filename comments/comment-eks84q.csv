Take in a lava lamp and have it make reflections off the mirror so that I can see enough to dress myself but not enough to see myself. Then I pretend I'm in a gritty foreign film where I'm the main character that's just saved someone from drowning (or something else equally ego stroking) and am trying to fight off hypothermia by showering lol lol it kinda helps, I have a very active imagination",False,False

I still do it even if I don‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù to simply because it‚Äôs so relaxing and comforting to me. I leave the light over my bathroom mirror on so it‚Äôs not pitch black. Candles also work so you can make sure you don‚Äôt fall haha! After a stressful day now, I take a body shower with the lights off to settle my mind and relax. So underrated! I tell everyone to try it even people who don‚Äôt have food or body issues necessarily.",False,False

Sometimes I need to avoid the mirror, turn off the lights and put some music on to distract myself from my body. Upbeat music that gets me in a better mood.  It‚Äôs a catch because I feel better when I do shower but it‚Äôs just so hard to get past my thoughts about my body and do it. I find that having a thick robe to put on, immediately after getting out, helps a bit. As does something to wear that‚Äôs a bit oversized and baggy once I‚Äôve dried off. I know how hard this feels. Sending a hug. üñ§",False,False

I get in the shower there, and she just sits on the loo behind the curtain and I pass her my clothes as I take them off. It kinda helps that there's someone there to stop The Bad Things happening, and she can't see anything anyway. I use all her gorgeous smellies and it really helps me feel better. But yeah, I can go for a loooong time being scared of the shower.   Showering in the dark can help. It's easier than getting in with your clothes on and then taking them off once they're wet.",False,False
