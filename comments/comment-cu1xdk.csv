It’s even worse cause I’m like 5 feet. I had to ditch my vans and converse and stick to black platforms,False,False

Or sleep under the bed just bc I can fit under there. Sometimes I’ll sleep in the gap between the wall and the mattress caused by the bed frame. I sometimes don’t bring sweaters even when I know I’ll be cold to burn extra calories and feel skinnier.  I microwave sugar free jello that way it turns into liquid and then I’m “allowed” to have it. I also do this with pb. I bounce both my legs instead of just one. Uh I’m sure there’s more but that’s off the top of my head,False,False

Almost every time I'm at the grocery store I'll grab, like, two grapes from the green grapes and pretend I am ""sampling"" them to decide if I want to buy them or not. Then I do 2 black grapes and 2 red grapes. Same w the bulk bins; the signs definitely say you can ask for a sample and I'm always like hmmm will just use the scoop and grab a piece of licorice and a handful of jelly beans. On the upside of things, I shopped tonight and did NOT do this. I live in a small town and don't want to run into anyone I know while I'm walking around with a handful of jellybeans... I suspect with the candy the ED-logic behind it is sugar is ok as long as I'm not buying it (???). Another weird one would be sort of hoarding free candy - I'm a college prof and there are always booths out for various things, usually they entice you to come see their activity/club w a candy bowl. I am all about grabbing a piece of candy at every point possible, with the idea that I can throw it in my office ""candy bowl."" News flash: candy in said bowl usually lasts about 24 hrs before I eat it. Which is fine, but I just don't know anyone else that basically trick-or-treats as an adult",False,False
