I gained similar weight (105-ish to 135-ish) and went from XS/0 to now wearing S/M and 4/6. It took me months to try on pants in a size 6, but once I did, I felt so much better. Honestly wearing clothes that don’t fit well feels much worse than the initial shock of wearing a “bigger size”.  If it helps, I cut all my clothing tags off and go shopping with my husband, where he grabs sizes so I don’t have to look at them.",False,False
