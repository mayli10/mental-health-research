It was a cold brew with cold foam, only 40 calories. And my boss instantly goes “yuck do you know how many calories are in those things!!!” I guess he assumed it was a latte with whipped cream or something but omfg it made me not even wanna finish it.. and it was so awkward trying to be like “....no it only has 40...”",False,False

So it’s like no, I don’t want to know how many calories. It’s a damn muffin and it’s the only tasty thing I ever eat without feeling bad/purging. We deserve special treats too and I will straight up fight anyone who tries to create guilt, shame, or fear around anyone’s one “safe” treat yourself moment.",False,False
