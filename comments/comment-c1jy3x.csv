I am not sure how I can help or if I even can help, but remember that your ED is an illness and it's normal that it self sustains. It will make you feel bad. It will make you suicidal. It will isolate you. It will make you irrational and having breakdowns.  Give recovery a chance. Recovery exists to try to regain control over your life. Your mom probably freaked out too and that's why she had her own breakdown. She is scared to lose you. Try to go to recovery. You need to realize that it's not going to make your life worse. For all I know, it will probably make it better. You'll have better relationships with your mom and loved ones. You'll have more energy and less breakdowns. You might learn to love food (or not, it's not mandatory).  Except the possible weight change, can you see any negative aspect to a recovery attempt?",False,False

It sounds like you're still living at home/under some sort of parental control, and from your description it doesn't sound like it's a very healthy place to be.  I always feel ancient on this sub bc I'm in my 30s now, and I'm not going to use that to give you some ""it gets better"" speech, because that's really cliche and not even totally true. But what I do think is true is that as you get older, everything makes a little more sense.  You will almost certainly feel things in the future that you feel now, but I promise you will not feel them with the same intensity every single day until you get there. And I think it'd be a real shame for you you to leave before you find out what life is like when you're running the show.",False,False

I'm sorry to hear that you're in so much pain. Please don't kill yourself.   Are you in a program at all, or have access to a psychiatrist/psychologist? They should know how you're feeling and how difficult this is for you.   It sounds like you're a minor and don't have much say in the medical decisions, but any good ed team will listen to you. They can help you sort out your relationship with food and (by the sounds of it) your mother.   Good luck",False,False
