I  would spot the eating disorder in myself from a mile away haha.""   Same... I am always a bit confused when I say or do ED-things and think: ""oh shit, this is so obvious"" but noone seems to notice... not my mom, not my friends, not my boyfriend... They just think I am a bit weird about a few things but don't think much of it. And I don't know if this should make me happy, because I can live my ED to the fullest, or if I should be concerned, that they don't care so much about me to realize that there's something wrong.   &amp;#x200B;  I always plan my meals out before I eat in a restaurant or junk food. Like I am scrolling through the McDonald's Homepage and create a perfect binge meal, where I feel like I am going to die, but that doesn't have TOOO many calories. And I always eat the exact same at other restaurants. I just told everyone I do intermittend fasting, and noone even cares that I am already slightly underweight, since everyone's doing it right now.   I always complain about being hungry, wanting to eat A TON, but that everything has too many calories - noone suspects anything. Like my boyfriend started to count calories when we eat out or when we're choosing a snack for a movie, because I always do it, and he thinks it's healthy, since I look healthy. He always says that he wants me to always be as healthy and normal as I am right now... but holy hell. This always hits me hard.",False,False

When I was at my lower weights any time I'd mention dieting or fasting among trusted friends and family they would be concerned. I'd be encouraged to eat even if only a small bit of veggies. When my weight goes up those same comments are met with praise for my dieting or ""fasting"". Nobodies trying to coerce me into eating a small amount of veggies now! It can be damaging because that praise on not eating sticks with you all the way down to your very lowest weight and the sudden care and concern serves to reinforce the idea that now that you're thin your worthy of that care. No, I've been sick since my higher weights and needed the support just as much then as I do at my lowest.   My weight fluctuates and the approach to my weight on both ends keeps me in a never ending loop.",False,False

I was overweight and got nothing but praise as the pounds came off alarmingly fast. Instead of making me feel good about myself, it made me hate myself that much more because I was still the ""fat girl"" on the inside. It felt like they were talking down to me when they praised me for being ""half my old size"" after I lost 65lbs. How much better I looked and how I did such a great thing. Yet no one connected the dots that my deep, purple eye circles or fainting spells might be somehow related because I wasn't fat so I must be healthier. In the end I gained back all the weight. Plus an extra 30lbs and it's been a similar rollercoaster since. At least when I'm overweight I know that the people in my life are there because they love who I am on the inside.",False,False
