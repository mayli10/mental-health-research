Your uterus sits behind the pubic bone. The only time it is going to be at the point it creates a bulge is if you are preggers or have some mass like fibroids or cysts. (Or if you have hella endometriosis which can cause inflammation and bloating)  Having your uterus removed isn't gonna ruin your hormones straight up. However often your ovaries can be removed for hesth reasons along with it...and that will fuck up your hormones. Insta menopause basically. And then it would be that much more difficult to lose weight.   Not trying to call anyone out or anything. I've just been dealing with lady issues for so long and learning so much about how it all works....I'm hella passionate about proper education my dudes. ‚ù§,False,False
