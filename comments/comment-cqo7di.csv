I felt complimented when he asked my for my number. I knew he wasn't my type but considered friendship.   I really liked the attention and it turned out that we had similar views on life and relationships. It blew our mind so we tried a relationship. In the beginning it was heaven: he was so sweet and said all the things I needed to hear. In spite of this he lacked tactfulness in some situations which is very important to me. Later, when we got physically I felt that something was wrong. I didn't feel any physical attraction towards him. Eventually, we talked about it and ended it.",False,True

Could you briefly explain why someone would enter a relationship with someone they don't ""really like""?  I feel like this happened to me.",False,False
