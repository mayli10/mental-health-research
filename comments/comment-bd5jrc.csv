Weigh my self before and after ( obviously you loose a lot of water when purging so this isn’t accurate but helps settle the worrying thoughts of not purging it all) 2. (Gross) but inspecting vomit like you have to see what I’m throwing up. Eating something like grapes a good 20 minutes before binging can help because if you do it right before the grapes come up first as they are less dense. 3.(gross) purging into a measuring jug and calculating the estimated about of binge food you have eaten ( wow I’m insane lol ) 4. ( most dangerous pleas don’t) but flushing.... as a last resort   But pleas take precautions like replenishing electorates and wait 30 min before brushing teeth. Not restricting the next day because you know that sets us all up for doing it again. And it would be amazing if you stopped all together or reached out for help but it feels like there is no point in me telling you, just as there was no point people telling me the same. ❤️",False,False
