Like if you're gonna drink sodas anyways then I really don't see the point on getting on a person going about their own business just because they would rather not drink calories.  Everything is gonna give you cancer if you look hard enough into it probably.,False,False

Just that itâ€™s not worse for you than any of the other things most people eat or do on a regular basis. My life wonâ€™t be cut short because I drank a few cans of Coke Zero each week.,False,True

Like mcdonalds and milkshakes and $1 hashbrowns dipped in heavy heavy ranch. All things I eat rarely bc I have a sensitive stomach.   Some research also shows that itâ€™s bad because the chemical its self isnt bad but it raises ur insulin because its fake sugar so that still triggers a high insulin reaction from ur body so even though ur not consuming sugar calories ur body takes harm like it is,False,False

So far there isn't much to point to the fact it's conculsively bad for you.  I know it's not good for my teeth, the acid is not good for my stomach lining and throat, but fuck there's no calories.... Like, who can argue with that?",False,False
