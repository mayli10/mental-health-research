Even the skinny jeans with stretch don’t feel good sometimes.   In general, these days I can’t wear anything tight. I feel like I can’t breathe in them even if they’re not constricting. I just get anxiety thinking about it.",False,False

The only time I ever let myself wear them is if they're loose. Like...obviously. Lol. Wow. That's a headtrip. I wonder how many other thoughts do I have that are so obviously disordered but I don't even know it. Are ALL of my thoughts fucked up?   And how many licks *did* it take to get to the center of that tootsiepop?   I feel talkative today, apparently.",False,False
