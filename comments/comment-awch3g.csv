My OBGYN told me they should be getting lighter, which they are (they were light to begin with), but they last longer and I hate it because it is so uncomfortable.  I'll take some painkillers right now to help myself fight off any cramping!",False,True

I had a really long period when I got mine, too. This isn't because of your weight or your intake or anything you've done wrong. It's not your fault.  My ob-gyn told me to try to stay ahead of the pain and take preemptive painkillers regularly, even when I  wasn't cramping. That and my heating pad helped a lot. Hang in there! I promise it will be better soon.",False,False

That is why I decided to go with the IUD.  Thank you for the advice though!!",False,True
