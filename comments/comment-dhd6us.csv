I’ve always been naturally strong and a bit athletic despite putting very little actual effort into it. I guess I’m lucky but I have the misfortune of carrying all of my body fat in my arms, torso, and face and having comparatively very thin legs so I’m very disproportionate.",False,False

Well, usually anyway. I had mine measured when my bmi was 23/24, and THIS B SAID 40%. FORTY.  I didn’t really believe it. I lost maybe 10, 15lbs only, and now its 27-29. (I have always had little muscle mass since starving it off myself when I was 14 and never doing anything to gain muscle back until this year) so even with the small weight loss my bf% is a lot lower.   Idk. I feel like bmi is a load of shit, I’m definitely overweight.",False,True

My body fat percentage says I’m at the high end of “healthy” or “normal.” I’m literally always called small, cute, petite. My doctor says I’m generally fine but deficient in a few nutrients. My sister and best friend on the opposite coast saw me for the first time in months last week and both exclaimed some variation of “OMG you are so slim now.”  I look at myself and think, “there is literally nobody on the entire planet fatter than me.”",False,False
