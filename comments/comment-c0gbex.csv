Sure, it‚Äôs not pills or cutting or jumping off a bridge, which are more ‚Äúwell known‚Äù but you still engaged in a behavior that you hoped would kill you.   This is super serious and I bet it was scary to experience. I really encourage you to tell a therapist or go to the hospital/doctor to have them check your heart. You deserve food, you deserve to live, and you deserve help. üíõ  One of my best friends almost died this way, so maybe this just strikes a special cord in me.   üíõ Stay safe üíõ",False,False
