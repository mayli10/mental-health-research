I lose 30lbs with omad and fasting in the summer, because it gave me ""permission"" to say no to food but still gave me a giant meal to look forward to.    I'd love to fast once a month, maybe for 5 days, and do omad the rest of the time.   I know you're supposed to do IF with keto, but ice cream is my favorite food and I'll buy and eat a whole gallon if I deprive myself for too long, so smoothies are my compromise (halfway between ice cream and salad) but they usually aren't keto.   Keto worked well for me for satiation and energy levels, but I was eating a ton of high fat keto foods and it made me feel icky to have everything so heavy, and it made me so sad that I wasn't ""allowed"" to have fruits or some veg. I think lower carb is doable for me, but I don't want to be afraid of a banana or carrot or plain Greek yogurt. ",False,False

No calorie counts. No measurements.   I still restrict because, well, I'm not in recovery. But I *do* force myself to eat more intuitively rather than according to a ""plan"". If I start to feel faint or sick or really uncomfortable, I eat something. And then I wait until I feel that way again. Then eat. Rinse,wash,repeat. I know I tend to avoid higher calorie foods because I don't like the anxiety I feel eating them. And I try to choose things that are nutrient dense rather than satisfying, though I will take cravings into account (meat? need iron. chocolate? missing magnesium. etc.).  Eliminating a ""meal plan"" and restriction/calorie calendar has given me so much more freedom to give myself nourishment when I need it that I don't find myself in binge cycles anymore, because I'm naturally heading them off. Forcing myself to restrict by calorie/date just put me in spots where I'd feel so uncomfortable and deprived that I'd inevitably end up breaking my restriction rules. Then I'd panic and feel overwhelmed with self-loathing which would result in my ""punishing"" myself with an uncontrolled binge (like to the point of distended, bloated discomfort). I've never been a ""bring it up"" purger, and I don't want to mess up my medications bringing them up, so I'd either just sit in that discomfort or I'd feel compelled to purge with laxatives so I could start fasting the next day feeling ""empty"" again. The cycle was a nightmare. So I stopped allowing myself to focus on data and instead started focusing on how I *felt*. I still have body dysmorphia. I still have an eating disorder. I'm still losing weight. But living this way is much more sustainable for me. And I'm not quite so miserable all the time because I stopped looking at information that made me miserable. I'm comfortable restricting and I don't see that changing anytime in the forseeable future. But at least this way the weight loss is slower and more manageable, I don't pass out in public anymore, and I don't feel the need to binge because I satisfy my cravings when I have to.

I started to have chest pains a few weeks ago so I bumped it up to 1200 calories and haven't lost a pound since. Merp.   Eating an entire pizza every other week has been invaluable to me, whether it is healthy or not. I think a cheat day or meal is a lot easier to stick to when you plan it before hand. Every time I've thought, hey, I'm starving, today should be a cheat day, I've kept right on cheating for days because it felt like a mistake, but when its on the calender it doesn't feel like a mistake. Its more like the controlled burn thing firefighters do to prevent a wildfire from spreading, or at least that's how I try to look at it.",False,False

It broke my unbelievable binge cycle, and helps me actually feel full and satiated whereas before I had constant hunger/unable to read hunger cues. It also helps my other neuro issues.
