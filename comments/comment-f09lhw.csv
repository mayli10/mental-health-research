Feelings are not facts is actually something I often tell myself regarding my anxiety, I think I'm just finding it hard to apply to this situation.",False,True

When you are a teenager it feels like it was super easy to put your life on hold for treatment, but now being an adult there's actual responsibilities. I hope you're able to work out a way to get the support you need.",False,True

I feel that after gaining weight I'm worse than ever. I want to go back to the time where I was feeling like I was doing okay and maintaining my low weight but still doing life.,False,True

I’ve been weight restored for 1 year and I only feel worse and worse mentally each month that goes by since gaining the weight. I assumed it’d get easier. Now I just regret gaining and want to restrict again. It’s like I’m physically healthy now but the mental part of things is way worse than when I was underweight and it’s ridiculous.,False,False

I really don't see how things are going to get better for me. This is my life. This has always been my life. Things, for me, did not get better.   Try to get help now before things get even more complicated. I feel like I'm really fucked right now bc I have so many responsibilities (kid, husband, work full time and we need my insurance and $$, my parents are falling apart and have no idea wtf is going on). In some way things are easier bc I actually have enough money to see a psychiatrist and and actual therapist, but the reality is i think (and the psych and therapist think) that I need a higher level of care and idk how TF that is going to really happen. I also have not been able to ""get better"" with therapy even 2x a week, although it is holding me together, and my insurance is already wants me to scale back to weekly which is super upsetting.",False,False

I absolutely could not see a way out. I couldn't imagine ever feeling ok, couldn't remember what feeling happy or even contented had been like, and couldn't visualize any future that I'd be ok sticking around for. Talk about fuel for hopelessness, right?  At my first residential program (for mood disorders) they told me ""feelings are not facts"". (Pretty sure I gave them a look worthy of Grumpy Cat.) I still think it's an obnoxiously glib phrase, but it does capture an important truth for me. My inability to see or feel a way out *did not mean there was no way out*. It just meant I needed help to find my way. I needed people and a process I was willing to trust enough to walk blind for awhile. I needed to give my body and mind time to heal, time to change, time for tiny tiny daily positive actions to start adding up into a global change I could actually start feel and then derive hope from.",False,False
