After watching someone down enough food to feed a family of 8 I feel so sick and full that the last thing I want is food.,False,False

The way she tells her stories is so unique and her+fianc√© dynamic is entertaining by itself. She is also quite creative with food and sometimes I can‚Äôt help but laugh at her ideas (this woman put ramen on a ‚Äúnoodle rack‚Äù lol).  But yes Nikocado is entertaining, just way too chaotic for my taste. I love a bit of a train wreck, but him and Trisha just don‚Äôt sit well with me, they come off very artificial at times. I love watching Amberlynn though - perhaps because she is an actual wreck and has a genuinely horrid personality.",False,False

I need to check out Stephanie Soo she sounds interesting! And yeah I think more than anything I can watch nikocado because of the shock factor of the things he says. He doesn't hold back at all lol,False,True

I like Stephanie Soo, but I usually watch her for her storytelling skills more than food.  But ASMR is another thing - I put in my AirPods and just lay on the bed while watching and listening. My favourite are chocolate/ice cream sounds or crunchy sounds, and they give me extreme tingles while also making my need for food go away.",False,False

Especially not extreme ones like his videos. He used to be soo healthy, vegan and at a normal/skinny weight, and then just decides to destroy himself like that for money, it‚Äôs just a lot.   I also hate the chewing sounds, grossed me out. But yeah if I want to be grossed out about eating it works üëç",False,False
