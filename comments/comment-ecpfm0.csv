Is it possible that this (ignorant, but possibly well intention) individual was just trying (and failing miserably) to flirt with you? When people think critically of strangers, they (hopefully) keep their malicious thoughts to themselves. I'm just saying, I doubt this guy would have been comfortable making these comments to you if you were overtly obese.   Regardless, I'm sorry this stranger made you feel this way. Perhaps he's at home right now, kicking himself at being a complete and utter failure of a ""Casanova.""",False,False

One time an old-wealthy-retiree kinda man passed me eating a breakfast at a cafe, he said, “woah, she must have a big appetite!” So I looked him dead in the eye and said “yeah it’s crazy, when you’re on your period, your uterus contracts so hard it cuts off it’s own blood flow, you need extra calories during that time of the month!”  As soon as I said period he got a “what the fuck” look on his face and started out the door. He went “okay, thank you, you have a nice day now...” and left. Like. Yeah mother fucker. You see my first meal in days and have the nerve to shame me? Here’s some info about my body since it’s a municipal entity with a regularly scheduled public forum, apparently. &gt;:(",False,False
