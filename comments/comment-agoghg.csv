To most thats how the issues began. There are tons of articles about how unhealthy sugary cereals are even for a healthy diet and we know it because we research it. We will eat the bread but dont slather butter all over it. Give me a glass of low calorie juice but not a mountain dew.,False,False

Have you tried talking with her?  I'm not sure what kind of relationship you have with her, but that's what I did.  I mentioned to her that when she says those things it makes me feel guilty for eating and then I will avoid said thing like the plague.  She got it, but still slips even now (years later!).  I just have to give her *the eye* and she is like - oh shit, I'm sorry!  FYI - for me it's peanut butter.   I never have it at my house, so I get to my moms and I'm like a pb monster.  ",False,False

Currently dealing with restring related relapse, and invited my friends out for pizza... which they turned down, so... that day becomes so easy for me to not eat. On the inside I'm like Ah! Help! You're making it too easy for me to make it worse!   &amp;#x200B;  But ya know, people can't help it!! My mom (who is unaware of relapse atm) was telling me how nice I looked because I'd lost weight - you just have to kinda ignore people a bit sometimes because well... they just don't know. Every mind is a whole universe. Im sure they think the same about us!",False,False

Sorry that you’re going through an especially stressful time right now, I’m right there with you (I’ve cried in public twice this week and it’s only Tuesday).
