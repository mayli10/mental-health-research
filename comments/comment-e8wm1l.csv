He's seen my weight fluctuate within a 60+ lb range, and his interest in hooking up is SO DIRECTLY RELATED TO MY WEIGHT that's it's not even funny. He doesn't make the slightest fucking attempt to hide it.  I've shared a number of really heavy, personal things with him. Depression, suicide plans, eating disorder, chronic illness diagnosis. Dude knows I'm having a hard time and knows that my recent dramatic weight loss is not healthy.   We were catching up at lunch one day and he's kind of flirting with me. I know I'm skinny enough for him right now. He says something like ""You know, you could regain some weight and it would be okay. You would still be a hot bitch and guys would still want to crawl around after you.""  Except no! Not him! Other guys maybe, but not my friend. I appreciate the sentiment but if I regained weight, my friend wouldn't find me attractive. And that wouldn't be the end of the world - this guy's approval isn't everything to me - but don't feed me bullshit lines about how weight doesn't affect people's attraction to me.",False,False

It might be that om much more confident though",False,False
