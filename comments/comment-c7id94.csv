When I was at my LW I didn’t have curves at all, and I was literally stick thin. I’m also super tall, so I felt like supermodel status. I’m about halfway between my LW and my HW, and I’m starting to get to the point where I am losing my curves and IDK I almost like being thin better, but then I keep looking in the mirror and getting angry that I have no hips, no ass, and almost no tits and somehow I’m still overweight… I’m definitely getting scammed lol.",False,False

It’s literally a daily struggle and more often then not I seem to restrict and then end up binging or eating more than I intended to,False,False
