(...also... maybe think of it as a little extra weight loss ;))",False,False

And he cut it all off at once in the back so I couldn’t even see what was going on so there was no turning back as it was all gone as once. I literally said what the fuck !! Then the other hairdresser berated me for telling him that it’s really short and told me that my previous hair style was disgusting . (It was just long and curly ... but in my opinion quite cool, like surfer hair . ) Obviously my hair is going to feel short if I cut 8 inches off. Sorry for the rant and I feel your pain",False,False
