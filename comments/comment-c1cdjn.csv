I have this compulsive urge to buy and store ALL THE FOOD, even if I end up either purging or throwing or destroying it in some way (which I then feel awful guilt for), or just not eating it. Partly I think it's because I've been poor to the point that I couldn't afford ""good"" food and I'm scared to run out of food again, partly it's just my family's fairly fucked up eating patterns, partly it's my own ED and inability to make decisions. I totally do that though. I found some soup packets in the cupboard the other day and was like fucking SCORE, don't remember buying this but as I'm back to restricting, thank you, past self, for the soupy gift? I dunno.",False,False

My friend (who also has AN) was telling me that all the restriction that we do puts us in like, a constant fight or flight because food seems scarce, so we do shit like hide it all over the place and just keep walking around just because maybe we'll find food. And we never want to eat food that we have because what if the next time there's no food.  I have some (Probably fermented) mango baby food in the center console of my car so that's probably my weirdest.",False,False

My dad always eats everything and I'd get yelled at by my mom for asking for seconds. I only hid bread because we didn't have anything else and my mom doesn't cook.,False,False

When I used to live with my dad I had a box in my room with junk food and breakfast food, stuff that I didn't eat mostly. Now I live alone and still end up stashing food in a high cabinet I can't reach. I don't know if I'll ever eat it but I feel guilty getting rid of it.",False,False

It's already heavy as hell with cereal bars, more apples, crackers and rye crackers.    In the past I hoarded cans of soup and those used to end up in the trash because they'd expired.  I don't know if this is weird, but when I was really ill I was stashing sugar free gum in a box under my bed.  When I started eating more and relying on gum less I forgot about it because another box of random crap pushed it further back.  Last time I had a really good clean of my bedroom I found the gum and it'd expired 9 years ago.   We're talking trays of Big Red which I ordered online.  I didn't try a stick to see what happens but it wasn't bendy any more.  They were like shards of glass.  I'm not even sure why I do it.  Maybe I think if there's a nuclear war at least I'll have some safe foods.",False,False
