I usually donâ€™t do omad but when I have tried it Iâ€™ve found it really nice as a way to actually eat something delicious once in a while because otherwise my meals are like 400 or less and that gets lame.,False,True

If days: I donâ€™t really have a set how many days a week I do this (particularly because this is one of my â€˜newerâ€™ strategies ðŸ™„), but like I mentioned, I hate myself significantly less if I do this rather than binge everything   If cal: Iâ€™m 5â€™1 lol so a shorty, but calculated my bmr off a lower weight so I could calc my absolute max (1200) but usually end up around ~800-1000 mark. I do IF OMAd (and PT 2x a week while fasted)  mostly so eating this much feels like a binge and then Iâ€™m usually set for a good 20 hours or so",False,False

I was hoping to only do one of these every 4 days or so but itâ€™s been every other day. Normally I restrict about 800 calories a day (so 1,200 when I maintain at about 2,000) and then workout on top of that but itâ€™s been really hard.",False,True
