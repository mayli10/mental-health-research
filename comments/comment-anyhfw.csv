Afterwards is sit down to eat and I'm like SHIT I probably ate like half a serving at least just testing and trying. Sometimes I don't eat the actual meal because I think I are too much while I was cooking.  Also breakfast? I wake up in a sleep hazed food craze and just stuff anything in my mouth. It's normally fairly healthy bi Ut way more than I would and just... Not mindfully or carefully. Sometimes I can't remember what I even ate. That sticks around for ages when I'm out of a restriction faze too :( it's the bane of my life.,False,False
