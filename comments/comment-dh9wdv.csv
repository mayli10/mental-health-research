Hell, a lot of the time I don't even know who I am. We are humans, we change, we're random and that's okay. It sounds like  you might need to find comfort and support from another source, maybe a counselor? Your husband is limited in his capacity to understand because he does not have your disorder. He just can't get it... but good for you for being open with him and at least trying. That could not have been easy.",False,False

He should be concerned about your wellbeing and comforting you. Instead heâ€™s making it about himself and being mean to you. Iâ€™m sorry :(,False,False
