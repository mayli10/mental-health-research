I used to be known among family and friends for exerting myself in the kitchen, using the best ingredients, striving for gorgeous presentation. I had plenty of failures, but I loved to bake, and my parents still ask sometimes if I'll make desserts or pastries for special occasions. I haven't touched bread in several years, let alone made anything with flour myself. I won't even decorate cookies at Christmas if my mom or sister has baked them. It's pretty sad, but it feels like unnecessary torture to be around food I can't eat, and pointless drudgery to produce it.",False,False

I wish I could just knock something out for the hell of it and not worry about how much it is. I want to enjoy what I make. ",False,False

So when I find a meal I wanna cook, I just do it and I can’t actually fit much in lol.  Especially if it’s fatty and filling which I usually love.  Then I freeze the rest or share it and it saves money. Probably not helpful (Sorry :() but restricting meals during the day to small amounts stops me being able to stomach much at dinner time.",False,False

I had a huge passion for powerlifting/bodybuilding and getting super strong and being able to cut a little calories here and there to get lean.  It became a binge and restrict cycle and the gym and food and everything I loved cause huge anxiety rather than the high of 'eating carbs and having a PR' or fat loss and feeling really good in a swimsuit. Now I'm just soft and trying to find me 'self-love'.   It's all such a battle and I'm exhausted. ,False,False

I have to be very careful because I will eat everything if I let myself. Cookies are almost impossible for me to make. Muffins and cupcakes also. I’m pretty safe with cakes and bread, but how often do you make a whole cake? And frosting is a whole different animal. I make myself sick eating homemade frosting.  Most of the stuff I bring to work and people there eat it. But it’s still at my house for 12 hours between when I make it and when work starts. Lots of time to stuff it in. I’ve never mastered having “just one”.",False,True

It ruins everything now that I know the homemade molasses wheat bread and honey butter was at least 200 calories for a small slice. Or that my mini espresso cupcakes were probably 150 each. Or my cinnamon rolls were definitely 500, minimum. I’ve tried baking and not eating it, but it’s never quite the same. I’ve tried replacing it with other hobbies but I still miss it. ",False,False
