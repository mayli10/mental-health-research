So much so that I think I suppressed my ability to do it?   Like when I got to the point a few years ago of finally attempting to purge, I couldn't. I think I have like an iron stomach that won't give anything up because of how I held it back for so many years from fear. I keep trying though because I hope I can weaken my stomach as I've heard it's possible to eventually regain the ability to vomit.   I've thrown up 3 times in my life: age 4, age 8, on my 20th birthday.  I know how bad purging is and how addictive it would be for me but I just want the option to be in control. ",False,False

I have a legit fear of throwing up-- haven't thrown up since I was a little kid because I'm so scared of it. I'm thankful because if I wasn't afraid I'd be purging like crazy.,False,False

Its the absolute worst for ur health. And i hate myself for ever starting bc it feels like a trap I cant leave. Please just don't start. It makes nothing better. Its a temporary solution to a problem that makes u feel so bad afterwards. Like dopamine rush or not I literally hate myself each time. Just please don't start :((( ,False,False

It's not worth it, and it will wreck your shit, and it will get out of hand way faster than you anticipated. You will be confused af about your weight 90% of the time because purging (at least for me, and even with adequate hydration) = you eventually retain water like a motherfucker and it is miserable. Also, golf ball glands. Also, gross face. And these things are aside from if you never actually develop the technical skill to purge efficiently, which a lot of people despite purging often and conpulsively seem to never do -- after all, there are plenty of ED people who purge regularly and just maintain or even gain. Chances could be you're one of those people, and all you'd get from your trouble was a whole bunch of bullshit! Like, not even weight loss! Worst deal in the history of deals.   I LOVED purging. At first you feel like you won't develop any of the bad shit, and then you do, and then it makes you miserable, and it's super fucking hard to stop. I lost like a motherfucker but also my AN-R developed into full-blown bulimia, and I am just trying to get a handle on it because it's incredibly disruptive to my life in literally every way. I'm two days purge-free right now, after trying and failing HELLA. I get the allure and shit, I really do, and the honeymoon period is WILD if you have one, but the aftermath is a total dumpster fire, basically.   Also, just remember that your ED often suggests the most ridiculous shit and that trying to take a second to run it through logically might help you be less miserable in the long run, or stay alive longer, in the 50/50 case you're fortunate enough for your bad brains not to win out. Which, you know, but it's worth a try, right??   Example: your ED seems to be suggesting right now that purging will be like exposure therapy for your phobia of vomiting, which is ??? not actually useful in any way you feel me ??? Like you're probably not gonna be in a situation where you NEED pressingly to puke in your life. You probably don't NEED to get over this phobia, esp if you have an ED and this phobia is keeping you from purging.   Sorry that this was lots of words. I don't know if this is helpful-- it probably won't be, but I felt compelled to respond. Hope you're doing okay tonight. &lt;3 ",False,False

When I started getting urges to purge I couldn’t really at first, I was too afraid to throw up. And then one day I finally got it. It’s been kind of out of control lately. Obviously I wouldn’t condone it and I’m currently in treatment. I really really REALLY suggest seeing someone before you give into these urges. It will be so much easier before you start. Please please take care of yourself, sending love xx",False,False

Everyone is also different so my experience may not be anywhere close to others.  For me, it was something I did very rarely at first. Every time I did I was like, “wow that was absolutely horrible I never want to do that again.” And then a few weeks or months later I’d find myself trying again. It took a solid year for it to really pick up to its worst, (~3x a day).   I think I got to the point that I just stopped giving a shit about if it hurt. I just hated myself so much.  The first few months even regularly purging was awful. (Chocolate and bread are still horrible to puke to this day. I remember anytime I’d eat rice it would come out of my nose and I would just be sitting there crying trying to get all the rice out of my nose.  And then soon enough I had perfected it and gone from taking 15+ min to purge to just 5min. And it didn’t hurt anymore.  Honestly my throat is just so fucked. It bleeds anytime I purge and I’m really not bout to give myself throat cancer, so I’m really trying hard to stop.  So yeah, it gets ‘easier’ over time but it just really feels horrible for awhile. (Now it gives me a sort of sick euphoria and I’m fucking disgusted with myself)",False,False
