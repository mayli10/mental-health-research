I added the disclaimer because it really wasn’t my intention to get people to go over there and comment. I made this post to discuss the topic here in order to talk about it without the whirlwind of negativity that would follow if I had expressed myself directly on r/fasting if that makes sense.

Being obese does not mean fasting is any safer for you than anyone else and idk why your entire comment is centered around the idea that we should encourage overweight people to lose weight by fasting.   I do think it’s reasonable to say that some people CAN fast in a way which is both safe and not disordered. But being overweight has nothing to do with that concept and I’m perplexed as to why your entire argument here centers around the person being fat.  Actually, I would argue that for someone who struggles with binge eating, fasting is an opposite extreme which can be just as addicting and create dangerous cycles. An obese person is likely to already suffer from an eating disorder,  so it is just as dangerous for them to dabble in fasting as it is for other EDs.   Extreme diets are literally the least effective way to lose weight and keep it off. An obese person would be statistically better off to make reasonable and sustainable dietary and lifestyle changes. The idea that they can safely/effectively fast just because they weigh more is NOT supported by science and it’s a really harmful idea for you to be spreading.",False,False
