It's very rough haha because I'm trying to ease up a little bit, but every time he starts talking about it it makes me SPIRAL so bad. I'm considering telling him it's just very scary, he knows my mom well, it's just uncharted waters haha. You're so kind, thank you so so much ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§",False,True

The idea of just saying I'm self conscious, I think he'll understand without getting suspicious, thank you üíïüíï",False,True

I ended just coming clean about my ED, honestly.  Not exactly the same, but it may help to at least explain that you've been stressing a lot about food/calories/etc recently and that his constant talk about it is really hurting you, and that it would really help if he could avoid doing that around you, or at least avoid being vocal about it around you. That doesn't necessarily point straight to an ED, but it also imparts the seriousness. I know you don't want to make your ED obvious, but it may end up being necessary because unfortunately there's only so many excuses. :/  Good luck, lots of love to you. ",False,False

Perhaps you can tell him you are on a diet to lose weight, if it isn‚Äôt too suspicious, and it makes you feel bad when he talks about eating. If you don‚Äôt want him to think you are trying to lose weight you can say it makes you feel self conscious about yourself. I believe he will be totally understanding however way you tell him, you guys are close after all and I‚Äôm sure he doesn‚Äôt realize the harm he‚Äôs doing!",False,False
