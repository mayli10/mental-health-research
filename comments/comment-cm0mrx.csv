You've explained it to them and they don't care what you're going through. They don't deserve your continued care if they refuse to care for you.",False,False

Unbelievable. Were I in your shoes I would just stop doing anything until both of them apologize. It's petty, but it would get the point across that how they acted was not acceptable. Mom wants you to care for her? Tell her to get your brother to do it for once. Brother complains? Tell him you would care how he feels if he weren't so inconsiderate of your feelings.",False,False

I can't really say much in terms of advice, but I hope that you'll feel better soon, sending hugs! ðŸ’ž you felt the strength to recover and I'm proud of you, if you felt it once, you can feel it again! &lt;3",False,False
