Tbh mine's thinned out so much from restriction that I might sort of need to go for a pixie cut even though I love having it long but I just think about Beyoncé in the music video for Haunted and I'm like... that is a powercut and she looks amazing. I think it does feel like a sort of unburdening to have it cut, and defs so much easier to maintain, looks so refreshed, and power to you for stepping out of your comfort zone!",False,False

Half of me wants to cut my hair to force me to restrict higher bc I’ll have nothing to hide my face with, and the other half is scared of looking fat with nothing to cover it up...",False,False

ANOTHER reason I should cut my hair. Yeah mine is thick and straight too so yay that makes me really excited  I think I’d look way better with short hair. I was in the mirror just now like trying to create an image of me with short hair and omg it would look so cute. Can’t wait,False,True

I'll only straighten it if I want my hair to look sleek for an event. Also it dries super fast obviously which is a big plus for me bc I hate wet hair.,False,False

I think what I’ll do is cut it after prom, I have my prom in July. I just want long hair for pics during that then I want to chop it all off  Short hair pros: - no split ends, hair will be so soft and silky  - more volume in hair  - can finally do cute hairstyles i can’t do with long hair  - get out of comfort zone  And even if I don’t like it, it’ll grow back. My hair grows back quick so I could just grow it long again and it’d be way healthier",False,True
