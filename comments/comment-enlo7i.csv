My go-to is always either Nikocado or Amberlynn Reid reaction videos. I used to watch Trisha Paytas but her constant finger licking and excessive smacking triggered my misophonia a little too much.  I don't watch Veronica Wang often but I can totally see that now that I think about it. The main reason I don't watch her is because of how much she does that almost choking thing since it's just uncomfortable to watch. It's secondhand painful.",False,False

I also used to think Veronica Wang might have bulimia/binge eating disorder (still quite a popular theory I believe) because of how she would gag/choke on her food from eating so fast, like she might be binging. I used to watch compilations of her to help me purge/to make me feel sick when I felt like binging lol.",False,False

I used to think Stephanie Soo was either purging or c/sing because her jaws seem a little swollen sometimes but I think that's just her faical structure and the camera angles. The ones that I think are legit non-disordered are people like Quang Tran, Zach Choi, Keemi and etc.   Although I do think Peggie Neo has an ED. She often looks uncomfortable as she eats and I just get vibes about it. Lexi Babe, a slightly lesser known mukbanger, gives me the same vibes but it's possible she's just very thin in general.",False,False

Those who are skinny fast the day/a few days before they do the mukbang and exercise regularly (like running 5 miles/day). Metabolism probably also plays a role for some of them, although I'm sure some do purge.",False,False

It's the exact same sounds that trigger neuro pleasure for ASMR folks that make me want to peel off my skin/murder someone.  Whispering, chewing, dripping water, soft clicking. Kill me.",False,False

I live in Sweden and our one grocery store had an unskippable ad that would pop up on YouTube that was all ASMR and it was horrible like just getting assaulted with it out of nowhere ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜­,False,False
