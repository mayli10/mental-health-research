Look up Stephanie Buttermore's cheat day aftermath videos. She ate like 10k calories though. If I recall you might gain water weight, etc, but you will also burn quite a few calories just from digestion.

I'm not sure how many calories you ate but yeah, a few days or so won't make a difference in the long term, only if you keep it up.
