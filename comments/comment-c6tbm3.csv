One day, you put on that red top and you send me a photo so I can tell you how unbelievably beautiful you look in it, and to walk out and STRUT with that outfit. Hopefully it will work :) and I will do the same - you'll get a photo and you'll tell me to get the hell out into the world in that outfit, and I'll do it",False,False

And logically, logically, I know I can pull it off, and look hot as all hell.  But, but, whenever I put it on, that self hatred sinks in and I see all the imperfections.   So, I've not worn that outfit out the house. Not even once",False,False
