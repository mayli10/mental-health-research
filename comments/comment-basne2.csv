IMO, the podcasts are helpful for reminders about certain things after reading the books, but the books are much more comprehnesive and worked way better for me.   I stopped binging for over a year after reading and using the recovery guide, cold turkey just like she talks about.  When I started binging again, I listened to the podcast, thinking I just needed a little ""nudge"" and it did nothing for me, so I re-read the book.  I'm now 3 months without binging.",False,False

Compared to how many days youâ€™ve been alive (thousands), that whole first day can be reframed as a moment.   And it will suck. Like an addict being denied their drug of choice.  You may feel sad. May cry, may get angry, may not be able to think or concentrate on LITERALLY anything but the urge that day.    So, pick a relatively low-stress day to have that worst wave. Because   The second wave will be shorter if you get through the first.   Itâ€™s a process. Trust it.   Iâ€™m trying to, for my own demons, too.  And the third, fourth, and fifth moment have not been anywhere as bad as the first two.   I sometimes look at it, and think, I COULD. I HAVE IT RIGHT HERE AND I HAVE TIME TO DO X Y AND Z.   And then I think of my first withdrawal. And I think about how much my head hurt, my stomach was upset, my whole body was SCREAMING for me to get more in my system. And I didnâ€™t.   So now I donâ€™t smoke anymore (8 days free?) not because I donâ€™t want to feel the smoke in me and the effects.   But because I donâ€™t want to go through that first wave all over again.",False,False

It just didn't work for me and I'd end up EXHAUSTED (mentally, but also in a weird way physically) so that when the next wave came, I had nothing left and it swept me away.  Instead, I found that if I paid attention to where the wave (the urge) was coming from, I could just dismiss it.  The urges stem from the ""lower brain"" or the ""animal brain"" and that part of the brain has to convince our REAL brains to act.  When you understand that and believe that you can actually just say no, the urge fades really fast, and without a constant fight/struggle.   This isn't my idea - this is what Brain over Binge is all about.  10/10 recommend if you haven't read it yet.",False,False
