My forearms+wrists and calves are absurdly skinnyyyyyy but my upper arms and thighs are yikes. And same exact torso situation - I felt like I was a circus tent with stick legs.  Other than dressing different (belts, flattering jeans styles etc.,) I don't really know what can help. But I have noticed as my weight has gone down (after the period where you just lose from your face/extremes) my belly fat, thighs, arms and back definitely have slimmed down and my boobs have stayed put. For the bum situation, I guess we'll just have to work out ðŸ˜­",False,False

If you're unhappy with your proportions, losing weight isn't the only thing that can help! I know for one when I get hyperfocused on specific body parts I find it helpful to look into how I could improve them with appropriate exercise, because it just feels a lot more proactive and even faster than losing weight, and the results are a lot more predictable.  You have to be careful cause it's really easy for exercise to get tied up in ed behavior, but if you're really agonizing over specific areas (especially something where it takes so little muscle gain to make a real difference, like calves) it might help you feel a little more in control.",False,False
