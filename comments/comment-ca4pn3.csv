Sometimes I hate drinking water because it makes it look soooo bloated... But water is good and necessary for your body, therefore I drink it and tell my ED voice to shut up at least for that.",False,False

If o hard fast I’ll look  ok from the side but somehow flabby from the front and it I’m eating kind of normally but exercising I’ll look normal from the front but bloated (to me) from the side. Personally I don’t know if I can win but you aren’t alone!,False,False
