[Here's the nutritional info for the meal plan.](https://imgur.com/hzXN3zA) You can mostly ignore the percentages for carbs, fat, and protein because I have custom macronutrient ratios set up to better suit my needs. Also ignore the calories burned measure. Everything else should be relevant to you however. I tried to keep the ingredients organized, so you'll notice that bananas are listed there twice. This meal plan involves a lot of bananas (*but they're necessary for potassium and also a main ingredient in both smoothies*).  Here are the recipes:  # Peanut Butter Cup Smoothie  **Ingredients:**  2 Banana (Sliced, Frozen)  2 Cup Unsweetened Vanilla Almond Milk  1 Cup Spinach  3 Tbsp Cocoa Powder  2 Tbsp Peanut Butter  1 Pinch Salt  4 Ice Cubes  &amp;#x200B;  **Directions:**  1. Blend 1 banana, peanut butter, salt, 1 cup of almond milk, and the ice together. Pour into a bowl.  2. Blend the other banana, the cocoa powder, the spinach, and the remaining almond milk together. Pour into the bowl.  3. Swirl the two mixtures together so that each ""layer"" is present in every bite, but not completely indistinguishable.  # Carrot Cake Smoothie  **Ingredients:**  1 Cup Carrots  1/2 Banana (Sliced, Frozen)  1/4 Cup Pineapple (Diced, Frozen)  2 Tbsp Walnut Halves  1/2 Cup Vanilla Cashew Milk  1/2 Cup Plain Nonfat Greek Yogurt  1/4 Tsp Cinnamon  1 Pinch Nutmeg  &amp;#x200B;  **Directions:**  1. Blend all ingredients together until desired consistency.  &amp;#x200B;  Note the supplements. I listed potassium citrate powder, a specific meal replacement shake, and a specific multivitamin. Other meal replacement shakes and multivitamins will have different micronutrient amounts and may disrupt the careful planning of this meal plan. I find it very difficult to make meal plans which don't go over the maximum recommended amounts of B3, folate, and calcium, so if you decide to start eating more in the future I would recommend swapping the multivitamin for some vitamin D. 400 IUs is a pretty common size for vitamin D supplements and should be more than enough.  Remember that the purpose of this meal plan is harm reduction. I specifically designed it to help improve health for somebody who felt that she couldn't bring herself to eat enough. You will likely still lose weight if you eat like this. I can't say that it's a healthy meal plan because it provides so little energy, but it will at least keep you from getting any nutrient deficiencies. Maintaining optimal nutrition should also help you feel healthier and less lethargic despite everything that being underweight causes to happen to your body.  I do have some other meal plans, but this is my best one out of the ones that don't provide enough energy. I also adapted this one for my own use and brought the energy intake up to around 1650 calories. I made some tweaks recently to make it a bit more realistic for me, so it's not quite as perfect anymore, but it's still my best meal plan and provides me with enough calories to maintain my weight while allowing for exercise. I imagine eating like this every day would get boring after a while, so I can send you some other stuff if you want. The other meal plans tend to be suboptimal, however.",False,False

I don't recommend it, but it's at least better than restricting and not eating healthy.

OP said   &gt;How do you guys keep on track towards healthy eating when you're struggling?  Implying that they are trying to be healthy and the ED thoughts (feeling the need to be skeletal) are winning.  Please don't shame OP because they are ruminating on an ED thought.  Let's try to uplift them and help them see why keeping on track/eating healthy is better.  Just because someone's ED makes them focus on their aesthetic does not mean they are trying to romanticize anything or only have an ed because they are after a certain look.,False,False
