The first month is going to be hard, you're going to want to run back to what is comfortable to you, especially when times get tough. Remember that it leads to you being where you are today. Talk to you therapist openly, even if there's things you'd rather she didn't hear. ",False,False

But in my case my mouth stops working, it makes it worse cos I can't ask for help. Altho it was a crazy moment you got to tell your mom and she was amazingly supportive. So bad moment, good outcome? (idk if it is related but when I for any reason don't eat well I am more prone to a panic attack, something I keep in mind)  I hope it is an isolated incident but if it is not I think you should ask your therapist a way to go through the episode and be able to recover from it, to me stimming works, specially if its tactile.I wish you the best  and a great recovery.
