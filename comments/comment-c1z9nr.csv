It helps me realize that I'm the one in control and not the voice in my head telling me that I need to binge. I also find it really helpful to remember how I won't even actually enjoy the food I'll be stuffing my face with.",False,False

How much emotional pain I was in afterwards, how physically uncomfortable I felt, how anxious I felt about the weight I had gained and all the bloating, and how much money and time I had just wasted. Basically saying like listen bitch your brain is telling you this is what you want but this is a letter from yourself on the other side of the urge. I am currently experiencing all the regret and let me tell you in detail how terrible everything is right now. And then it ended with me pleading to myself not to do it lol  I haven’t really had to fight binge urges since then because that was only a few days ago, but I’m hoping next time I do, reading it will keep me from following through.  For now, maybe try keeping yourself out of any environments you’d feel comfortable bingeing in. Like if you only binge alone, put yourself around people, or if you only binge at home, hang out somewhere in public. If you can put it off long enough, hopefully the urges will pass. Stay strong!!",False,False

I still get urges and still slip up, but the urges aren't all-consuming and the enjoyment from the binges isn't as high (even if I include carbs in the binge). I know it probably isn't for everyone; it's just what has helped me the most. Best of luck to you.",False,False
