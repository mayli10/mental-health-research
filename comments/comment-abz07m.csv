Seriously, I have so many bras. Most of my tops and jumpers are baggy anyway, so i just wear the same ones at most sizes, but for jeans I have from a 31 inch waist down to a 26 inch I believe (I have no clue what those are in dress sizes).   Bras vary from 38 F (UK size) to a 32 A/B (UK size also but can't remember cup size lol).",False,False

Nope, just  fluctuate size every few months and like not having to buy a new wardrobe everytime. Professional clothes are the worst, absolutely no give so I literally have everything from a 0-12 and still looks ill fitted. ",False,False
