What she does with her life is her decision, and random people on the internet cant change that. I think her most recent video with the therapist outlined that idea quite well. They talked about how people can’t force others to recover, and sometimes the person just isn’t ready or willing yet. Forcing them to do something (unless it is truly a life or death situation) will only push them farther from recovery. The best thing to do is just be there and be supportive, and as viewers since we don’t know her the best thing to do is just show support for her in her recovery process, not talking about how “big” she’s gotten, or how far along she’s come. Questioning her recovery also doesn’t help, as that make her question it too, and be less inclined to keep preserving. Recovery comes at different paces for everyone, and I think people who don’t struggle with these issues don’t quite understand it.   Sorry for the mini rant!",False,False

She's obviously fallen right back into her old habits. Look at her tiny arms. She's going to die if she doesn't help herself.""",False,False

Not everything is an Oprah interview or an inspirational memoir. Stories, *real* stories are long and messy. Virtue *doesn’t* always triumph, or maybe it triumphs on the ninth try instead of the first. Sometimes love *isn’t* enough. Progress is not a 40-second montage. There is no slow-clap-moment with swelling orchestral score.   And stopping a behavior or appearing externally healthier (while amazing things, worthy of celebration) does not mean everything is ‘fixed’ or hunky-dory. Recovery can be an iceberg. Outsiders are watching for the external bit that is new behavior, but miss the buried monolith of internal strife and conflicted emotions and slow slow healing. But the whole messy process and the entirety of the person walking through it deserve compassion and respect.",False,False
