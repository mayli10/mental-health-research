Then I ran out of marshmallows and instead of eating the nutella with a spoon I made more marshmallows and started eating them before they set. I must have gotten at least 3 of my cavities from that binge alone.  When I was still in school I had to get free lunch which was only a small serving of mashed potatoes, steamed veggies, and milk. I would puree it all together with my fork and then mix in strawberry milk. I never intended to eat that but at some point someone offered me money to eat it, so I did, and that was the beginning of a very strange lunch time business venture. Now it's a bit of a habit to mix everything on my plate.",False,False

I pick at my food and take forever to eat it. A simple peanut butter sandwich is a whole ordeal. I have to slowly peel the crust off and nibble on that. Then tear off chunks and lick off any extra peanut butter that’s oozing? out the sides.   I’ll also dry sautee my veg then season it but the seasoning doesn’t really stick to the veggies and then it all sticks to the pan so it’s just this gross veggie powder mix that fucks up all my pots and pans.   Everything is dipped in hot sauce or made really spicy even if it’s something that shouldn’t really need to be spicy.  Makes me eat slower so I feel like I’m eating a bigger meal lol.,False,False
