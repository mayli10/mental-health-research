This is the blood sugar spike then crash, and your body thinking it's going to have to digest a ton of food and prepping to do so, then not having to. It's what usually causes the binge-purge cycle to perpetuate.  Your best bet to break this cycle is to eat a little something with balanced protein, carbs, and fat for slow digestion, take a tums and drink something with electrolytes, and force yourself to ride out the wave.   Supposedly cinnamon and apple cider vinegar can help stabalize blood sugar too, so if you're into natural remedies you might consider sprinkling a bit of cinnamon on whatever you eat or doing a small shot of diluted ACV.

Its the cycle and part of what keeps you stuck. When you eat, your body starts the process of digesting the food and releases the enzymes and whatnot needed for digestion into your stomach. Purging gets rid of the food but your body still thinks you've eaten so it basically starts digesting nothing. Extreme hunger is the result and for me, that would lead to bingeing then more purging then the hunger and repeat. ",False,False

Then I binge again and the cycle starts all over lmao. Usually I just feel a little hungry afterwards, not super bad hunger pains. But occasionally.",False,False
