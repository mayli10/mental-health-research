Stop now while you can, before you're purging every single thing. Maybe try eating half and throwing the other half out? Or offer to share? At the worst try chew and spit rather than purging. I have friends who are dealing with the awful consequences of bulimia. I hope you're okay baby x",False,False

At one point our bodies literally scream for nurishment and that's when the binge cycle starts. That's for me, at least. But I can't imagine highly restricting (under 1000 cals for me) for months with no binges, I literally need them in order to function.",False,False

Currently I’m getting really good at restricting again. So I guess it depends on how motivated you are, however if I’m walking past a food place and I haven’t eaten something all day, I cannot get the food out of my head and I think about it forever",False,False
