Nobody is saying that everyone who diets must have disordered eating, or that wanting to follow a certain diet is the same as having an ED, they're saying that there are lots and lots of people within dieting communities for whom the only difference between their eating habits and an eating disorder is a formal diagnosis.  In short, yes, of course there is a difference between having an eating disorder, having disordered eating, and merely following a diet (even if the diet is extreme), but people can still have eating disorders/disordered eating without identifying it as such.",False,False

I know actual people that have 2-12 drinks a month. A beer here or there, and then one night of going out drinking. In a night we might consume the same number of drinks, but it's a different behavior.  In the same way, fasters may fast for a month and then switch to 16:8 to maintain. That month was extreme, but might not be disordered.   The thing is, it's not my place to worry or judge. I think ""normal"" eaters are just as bad. At some point we need to be taught about calories and portion control, but the obsession some people have with food on the 1200 subs rivals me at my absolute worst with my ED. So it sucks we are self aware and call a spade a spade whereas other groups can't do the same, but I guess it doesn't bother me at all anymore. I don't worry about them I try to be encouraging when there aren't huge ED-thought red flags.

I mean to be honest I think I get swept up in that same wave of ideas. I would joke that I'm anorexic adjacent. Which is awful and I shouldn't say that. I follow extreme thinspo, pro-ana stuff, I am obsessed with ultra thin looks, I have major issues with food, binges, disordered eating, self hate and harm. I fast. Idk if I'm allowed to say how many calories I eat but it's below what u should. And I panic if I go above. I fast 22-24hours and working my way up to extended fasts. But I'm not yet thin.

People in fasting circles engage in dangerous behavior with different levels of disorder, but until and unless there's as much of a focus on the dangers of too much as too little...not inherently healthy.

Of course, every slippery slope has a peak, and for those reasons, they might as well try veganism. Or anything else that boils down to the simple benefit of ""cut out some food, lose some weight"".  Of course, EDs have an increasingly documented genetic link that can theoretically be trigger by a catalyst like purposeful restriction in a non-disordered person.  And let's not even start with the people who know they have disorders but still step into those groups....and don't stick out much.
