Got so bad I had to go to the ER at one point, it was really embarrassing.    When I went to res they had me quit cold turkey and switched me to a combination of Miralax + Colase, with Miralax 4x/day and the Colase 2x/day. For the first three days it just bloated me and I felt bad, but after that the bloating went away and it started working. After that as long as I took the meds regularly I was fine.    My doctor said that those meds don't have the same problems as laxatives (she explained why but I wasn't listening dkdnnsndh) so essentially you can keep taking them for the rest of your life with no issues.",False,False
