I was underweight for nearly two years before that point so Idk why she said that üò∂. Also went on a tinder date when I was single and got ""is this the biggest you've ever been111!!111"" haha i was a size 10 and im 5'8........nope it sure wasn't! I've received so many comments. ""You are SO beautiful. I think that is why you can get away with being plus sized."" From a grown man to me, ""well you are a bigger girl. We are bigger people"" (he's buff and muscular so.....uh....LOL?) there's been so many others. when i was underweight i did not receive nearly as many rude comments as when I was heavier. I did get the occasional eat something and how I have no butt, and one girl said how it must not make a sound when my boyfriend has sex with me because \~bag of bones\~ I guess? Or flat ass at the time. idk. I think that girl was jealous and this isn't me being vain but she had a real complex against other women. any girl who was very pretty but didn't have a body like hers she would comment on like this. also apart from my body image issues I know I am considered facially pretty by others and my weight is often a target from other people who may be resentful of this.",False,False
