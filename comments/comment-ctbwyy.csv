If you eat really small amounts of food, your stomach is going to slow down processes of digestion (and may shrink too) so food will take longer to go through your system. If you start eating more, it takes your body a while to adjust to increased intake and catch up with it, so feeling really sick and nauseous is unfortunately gonna happen :/ I'm sorry you're going through this but you're not alone",False,False

I felt too uncomfortable so I'm back to restricting. But I guess it's probably because your stomach is just not used to the volume and being a bit stretched when you eat so it will probably be uncomfortable for a little while until you get used to eating normal amounts of food again. I think that's the sucky part that you have to push through in order to recover.,False,False
