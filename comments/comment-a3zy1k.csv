I usually upload the recipe into mfp just incase I have to make any changes (like I never in my life have felt the need to buy fat free chicken broth and we buy 2% milk so I generally use that) and my alterations don't usually make a huge difference anyway in the grand scheme.  Also I make that recipe you linked too a lot. It is so good and easy. ,False,False

I haven’t purchased any of them yet but i was able to check out the first book (the skinny taste cookbook) &amp; the new one (one and done). They both had really good recipes. The One and Done is separated by way of cooking (air frier, instant pot, sheet pan, skillet, Dutch oven, etc.)  I don’t have an instant pot or air frier but most of the recipes have alternate instructions on how to cook (like stove top or oven)",False,False

I don’t have a slow cooker (though I should probably get one given my track record for following through with meal plans lol) but would you recommend any of her cook books over the others? I actually didn’t know she had physical cookbooks :o",False,True

It’ll depend on products you use (calories in certain things between brands will vary)  The chicken enchiladas w the red sauce are my favorite. Mission carb balance tortillas are only 45 cal each  The chicken pot pie soup is good, coconut honey chicken tenders (I think it’s a salad but we just ate the chicken), General tso Chicken, chicken broccoli stir fry, stuffed pepper soup, chicken and white bean enchiladas, cheddar garlic biscuits, garlic knots, grilled corn salad  There might be more that I’ve made but all of that is really good",False,False
