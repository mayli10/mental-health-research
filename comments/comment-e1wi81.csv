He wanted to refer me to the mental health team at the following appointment, but due to previous experiences, I was reluctant. In my third appointment, I eventually agreed. He monitors my weight and due to my vulnerability, sees me frequently.   They can't make you do anything unless you're medically compromised. They may want to do a blood test, I had recently had one done which is why my doctor didn't bother. It's natural to be scared, I'm still terrified going through this, but it's all for the best. If your doctor doesn't take you seriously, do seek a second opinion.  It's going to be okay. This is a really encouraging step you're taking towards recovery.",False,False
