I wrote a post about it. I think it was called something like ""FML. I hate myself so much"" if you want to read it.",False,False

It's hypocritical for me to say it but I really do hope you look towards getting help. Sending you all my love!,False,True

I'm really hoping you'll seek medical attention since it's not too late; it's much easier for your doctors to treat and prevent your issues from getting worse now before things get worse.  Last year I said the same thing nonstop to myself, was in denial over how severe it was getting, and kept adjusting to further and further new ""normals"" of chest pain and issues. I ended up in hospitals, even on a Europe trip, throughout the entire summer and fall from cardiac arrest issues, hypokalemia. I couldn't stand or walk for longer than a few minutes without collapsing, becoming unconscious and/or having a seizure, either. Another long term issue from not getting help is my epilepsy is back, likely permanently, as I previously only had seizures as a child.  I guess what I'm trying to say is it's worth seeing a doctor over. It doesn't have to be an ED specialist but someone who's able to help with diagnosing the underlying issues causing your symptoms then treating them. It could be as easy as prescribed high dosed vitamins to asking you to drink more electrolytes. But you won't know until you go.",False,False

Had one GW, then it eventually changed to lower, because ""those tights/belly/whatever don't look like I thought they would at that weight"" then of course it got even lower, because ""It looks kinda okay now, but I want to have room for water/food weight"" and so on. So no, if you let it be, it won't stop. It would be excuses after excuses and fake reasons.",False,False

It never stops. I want it to stop. Today I'm not feeling well. My chest hurts. I worry. Every day I get up and vow to eat more--to at least eat at maintenance--but I never do. I'm starting to get scared, to be really honest.",False,False
