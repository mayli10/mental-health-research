It is definitely lower than other people’s.  My stomach is multiple rolls? instead of one continuous piece. I naively hoped that my belly button would start showing as I lost the weight, but of course that didn’t happen. I often wonder if I’ll ever truly feel skinny until I can afford skin removal surgery. In the next thought I can acknowledge how ridiculous it is to hold my self worth on a stupid belly button. I can’t let it go though, I’ve  been obsessed with its abnormality since childhood.

But “kinda in the middle between underweight and overweight” is just *accurate*,False,False

Sadly, for me it’s definitely there, although my boyfriend says that I’m imagining it. But I can definitely see it, all gross and flabby and disgusting. My BMI is 22 so not even *that* high - kinda in the middle between underweight and overweight. But my bellybutton is as gross as those of severely obese people :(",False,False
