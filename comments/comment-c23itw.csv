If you can, just try to eat what he picks out and stop when you feel genuinely full. Just remind yourself, as many times as you need to, that 2 or 3 days of larger amounts of eating wont hurt. You can always drop the weight later, if you even gain any from it. If you try to restrict you will most likely always look back on that night and feel so sad and angry that you let your eating disorder take away that night and memory with your brother.  If you find you cant do it that's okay, but you really should try as hard as you can.  Good luck",False,False

If I was you, I'd try to be super excited for the food and pick out the item that's the least calorie dense (god knows lol), make that first impression so he isn't worried and then start eating slowly, taking part of the burger or dough with you, etc. I think it's all about initially not worrying him, then he'll give you some space :3",False,False
