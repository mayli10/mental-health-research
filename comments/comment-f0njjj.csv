There are a couple things you can do though that might help. Lots of water, primarily. I've *heard* lemon water helps a lot too but I've never tried it. Peppermint tea and dandelion tea can also help relieve bloating a bit.  But the most important thing is to try not to stress. Nobody will notice if you're a little bloated! Try to do something that will bring up your mood, if you can, so you can go to your conference with a confident mood :)",False,False

Make sure to drink a lot of water now and donâ€™t be too hard on yourself. The other day, I binged after months of successful dieting and it felt like I had undone all the progress.Iâ€™ve had to remind myself all the time that itâ€™s just water weight and that nobody is gonna notice if I look bloated or not, let alone care if I do :)",False,False
