I still would not risk it though as once the damage is done it‚Äôs irreparable. I hope you get through this and stop purging. Please seek help. I‚Äôm sure your family want what‚Äôs best for you xxx,False,False

I was being pretty quiet and had the water on so if they heard chances are my sister who‚Äôs room is outside the bathroom has been hearing for a while now and told my mum. If not my mum has no reason to even go to the side of the house that bathroom is in. Plus I‚Äôve used the food poisoning excuse too many times before,False,True

I just don‚Äôt know how I can look at my family anymore knowing that they know. I don‚Äôt want to leave my room and face them today. And what I hate the most is that I didn‚Äôt even purge this past week until last night so now I‚Äôve gained weight and I‚Äôm completely bloated but can‚Äôt even throw up to make it better.,False,True

The funny thing is I was actually going to go to my doctor to get help soon anyway but now I feel like getting better is going to be so much harder now that they know. They‚Äôll be constantly watching what I eat and making me sit with them after meals. Knowing my family they‚Äôre going to shame me and make me feel even more stupid. My mum said to me last night ‚Äúwhy would you do such a stupid diet trend to loose weight‚Äù which just shows how they view bulimia as a diet when I didn‚Äôt even loose weight for the first 4 years.  But seriously thank you. Just knowing this sub is here to support me is one of the only things keeping me going right now.,False,True

I go to the doctor every 6 months and he‚Äôs never suspected anything. I guess I just have naturally good teeth. I‚Äôve also been told I have extremely white teeth by my family when the purging started to get bad which I never really understood how that was possible.,False,True

Mum kept telling me about how stupid I am and that I was gonna kill myself (as if I don‚Äôt already know that lol). I couldn‚Äôt say anything the whole time. I just froze. She asked me if I had just thrown up and of course I lied and said no then she just got really angry at me. She kept asking me how long this had been going on and I physically couldn‚Äôt speak... she thinks it‚Äôs only been a few months and I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs better or worse than her knowing the truth. Anyways my dad then forced me to eat in front of him which pissed me off bc they made me eat chicken even though I‚Äôve been a vegetarian for 5 months now and didn‚Äôt let me leave for 2 hours üò¨,False,True
