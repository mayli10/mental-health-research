Any chance you could have exposure to STDs? Non-uterine causes of spotting also include vaginal atrophy from lack of estrogen, so that you're more likely to have vaginal bleeding from intercourse. Or you could have something like endometriosis, cervical polyps, etc. If you're on the mini-pill (progesterone only) you can get breakthrough bleeding if you're just a few hours late in taking it. You really need a pelvic exam for diagnosis.",False,False

Restricting (still in normal weight range though), and my period used to start on my placebo week and last 3 days, but now it starts in the middle of the month and lasts 2 weeks (and I retain a TON of water.

I've been on the same birth control for like five or six years too so it was freaking me out. Middle week of the pack I got a pseudo-period, bled here and there for 4 days. When it was time for my regular period though, it still came. I'm on the lower end of healthy weight for context! It had never happened to me before either, but I'm just rolling with it. hope you're doing alright and hope the cramping feels better soon! hugs ðŸ’–",False,False
