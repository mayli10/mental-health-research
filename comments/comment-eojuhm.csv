Parents assuming things about you because of something truly unrelated really sucks. Especially when she didn't even text you in between these calls she was really overreacting. I understand where she's coming from but this is the wrong way to handle this issue (that isn't even there). Can you talk to her that this assumption is very triggering?   I hope you don't relapse because of this but even if you do take a few steps back, try to remember that making progress is possible and relapsing is part of recovery :)",False,False

They're human. I wouldnt internalize her anxiety.. just look at the meta here. She cares about you, and doesnt know when to keep her thoughts to hetself.  Whatever virtues or ideals brought you this far are super important and should be your primary focus. Not this drama.",False,False

Last year I was going to paris and it was an evening flight so that morning I was shaving my legs, cut that part by my ankle and I got blood all over the floor. I thought I had cleaned it all up.  But alas while waiting for my flight to Disneyland of all places my mom texts me basically assuming I had self harmed and how I should have cleaned it up and that I was obviously doing it again ect. It seriously ruined me. So no you're not overreacting. The worst is when youre doing well and someone just assumes you're doing poorly. Assumptions suck.",False,False
