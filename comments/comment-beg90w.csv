I too gained 15 pounds then.  I went through a mini phase just now as well. Gaining 5 pounds in a week after b/p'ing for almost a month.  I hate bulimia lmao. I'm just going to restrict now and try not to binge :') There's no point to losing weight through bulimia if we just binge it back due to extreme hunger",False,False

Then one day I'd wake up and have zero interest in food and I could go a full day without thinking of food or feeling hungry. I'd like to know.",False,False
