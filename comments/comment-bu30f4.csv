When the doctor told me about my situation, my first concern was the fact that i felt invalidated for it. (my weight wasnt even underweight yet at that time, but i was nearly like 2 pounds on the way)   he said and I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH that an eating disorder isnt just about the body, its about the MINDSET too. If you already think or behave like someone with anorexia/bulimia/BED/EDNOS,  youre valid enough and should seek help asap before it could start affecting the rest of you as well.   I told him that i needed some time to accept all this before allowing them to send me to psychiatrist and a dietician. They did help me recover at first by monitoring all my meals and weight and i had to visit my psychiatrist at least  3 times a week,   but the moment i become alone id relapse and every relapse was twice as worse as the last one. (sidenote: ive been switching from anorexia to bulimia for the past few years to escape either one of them and it was heavily ingrained in my head that eating was like an all or nothing deal for me)   It even came to a point where i had to go inpatient for a while, but i cant thank my doctors and psychiatrist enough because they never gave up on me and tried all methods to find out which worked best for me. Ive been recovering well so far, im at a normal weight now and i even recently got my period back!   Tbh, the recovery from the ED at first felt worse than the ED itself. It took a lot of patience, breakdowns, (some attempts for suicide in my case), and money, but i promise, your health (whether it be mental, emotional, spiritual, physical or all) SHOULD NOT be compromised in ANY CASE. Okay i feel like this comment was really long so im gonna end it here but if anyone wants to ask for advice/experiences/stories from me, im more than happy to share if it means helping anyone from this amazing community. Best of luck of to you!! Feel free to talk to me anytime ^^",False,False

That must have been so stressful. I’m glad you sought help too! Yeah, I just have to accept it as well; it completely feels like a joke, like you said.  I’m so glad this community exists; so many people to relate to. I hope your journey goes well too!!   If you don’t mind me asking, how did the doctor’s appointment go? What did they do? It’s okay if you prefer not to answer :)",False,True

I understand exactly how you feel. I felt too fat to be anorexic and i was first diagnosed on my birthday, right after eating, the doctor called me and told me to go to him asap. I felt uncomfortable with it and a part of me wanted to believe that it was some big joke but the best choice was to accept. I hope your journey will go on well!!",False,False
