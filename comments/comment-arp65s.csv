The temptation to just quit all treatment is also strong but I wouldn't be able to get away with that as it's very noticeable ,False,False

Gallstones can be created when you have high cholesterol which can happen as a result of frequent changes in intake like going from fasting to binging often. It also can be caused by rapid weight loss. None of my doctors were very aware of this despite the fact that there is quite a good amount of info available to explain random spikes in cholesterol in otherwise normal people. ,False,False

And yet I restrict anyway. I mean, way less often these days than I used to, but it's not I'm 100% better. Maybe like 93% better. It doesn't help so much if I'm always eating junk food, but when I'm not feeling good I don't typically push myself to make something healthy even though I know healthy foods would make me feel better. Sometimes I'll just skip breakfast and lunch, most often if I'm busy and don't feel like spending any of the time I have eating (sometimes just because I don't feel like eating), and then by around 2 in the afternoon I'll feel so awful I'll know I just need to eat whatever is available with the least effort or time required so I can at least have something in me. That usually means McDonald's.",False,False

I have it with raw fruits and vegetables and also with unprocessed nuts (not with salted nuts, mainly nuts right out of their shells). I usually steam my veggies, but it kills me that I can't just snack on raw cauliflower or something. It makes social eating difficult too, because I can't eat from the raw veggie platter and I have to go for something much higher in calories. This only popped up in the last five years for me. It's especially not fun when I eat something raw that I used to like, haven't had since the allergy appeared, and then it's awful and I'm running to scrape out my mouth",False,False

I'm constantly in and out of the bathroom even with treatment.   most people who have it are naturally underweight, but i used to binge so bad my BMI had managed to hit overweight before i developed an ED. IF has actually been shown to be great for people with this issue (less chronic pain) but mine obviously kind of spiraled out of control ðŸ˜…   I have just gotten back to an average BMI.
