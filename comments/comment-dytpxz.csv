Now I'm unhealthier than ever, living on whatever sticks to the bottom of my stomach after I purge my shitty OMAD",False,False

It sucks to be obsessed with losing weight but then not actually being able to lose weight.  I used to have ednos where I restricted  under 700 calories per day, after birth control and mood stabilizers I started binging (or maybe just overeating?) and am now the fattest I’ve ever been. I still go through phases of heavy restriction or compulsive exercise but not enough to lose more than 15 lbs and then I just gain it back",False,False

I was anorexic for a while and switched to bulimia because I was trying to eat normally but didn't know how to control myself. And it became a cycle of ""maybe I should eat something today"" to overeating to purging until I couldn't control it anymore. I kept wishing i could go back to anorexia, but it was so hard. And eventually I found a way to control my eating habits by binging less and reminding myself how much the guilt hurts after a purge. Believe me, it takes time. But you'll be in a healthier mindset if you stop wishing for one eating disorder over another.",False,False

(Tbh I was probably “healthier” while I was anorexic as well cause bulimia sucks ass),False,False
