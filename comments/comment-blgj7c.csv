I think this is kind of what you’re getting at with your wife in this situation, when it come to ways she can help you and both of you having the same goals for that. Obviously you guys will need to come up with your own ways of addressing this, but if you want some examples:  1) I don’t weigh myself, ever. I get on the scale backwards and my husband checks the number. He’s technical, so he likes to keep a spreadsheet of my weight and compare it to my guesses. He’s also a sort of gatekeeper in this sense; if I want to know my weight, he tells me, if I don’t, he doesn’t. This gives him a sense of control over my disorder that he wouldn’t have otherwise.   2) I report all of the things I eat to him. Sometimes if I feel ashamed or guilty this takes a little longer, (sometimes I’m in a panic and tell him straight away) but eventually I will tell him. He doesn’t need to know and it really only makes me feel better, but I *hate* feeling like I’ve been sneaking around with my disorder behind his back, so telling him lifts that feeling of shadiness.   3) I talk to him about where I am with my disorder, how it’s making me feel, and why I think I feel that way. I discuss what I feel like I should do going forward and what changes I think I can make to make my disorder a less central part of our lives. He weighs in and offers his analysis, which we both find helpful.   4) I hate eating alone, and I hate eating around other people, except for him. He sits with me and reads to me while I’m eating so I both get to concentrate on/enjoy the food, and am sufficiently distracted from any negative feelings I might have about eating.   These are just some things we hammered out together over time. Basically I guess what I’m saying is that it could help both you and your wife to feel like she has some control in this situation. Taking control by confiscating your things obviously is not the right approach, but there are healthier ways she can feel less helpless.",False,False
