If you don't want the sugar, they make a zero calorie version. Don't go overboard on them -- my brother ended up in the hospital drinking too many of those combined with energy drinks -- but I have a similar issue and while i'm not underweight, I've found powerade to be pretty helpful managing it in myself.",False,False

Technically since Dec 2018, but since I turned 22 in Feb, I had to be put in a different waiting list and start waiting again üò≠üò≠ Because the therapists' age groups, since I turned older than 21, I got changed from adolescent to adult.  I've seen professionals about my ED before and I'm just worried I'm going to ONLY be refed and none of my trauma addressed, which is what happened last time. It made me worse.",False,True

I usually like to stick to 600-800 but I know I need more.   Some days I can force down 1200 but idk  It's the worst when I'm walking outside and suddenly have to sit down or grab onto something and pant for a while and thinking my hearts gonna give out. I know my body is probably shutting down but it doesn't hit me until I can't ignore it anymore.   I'm gonna try to get 900 in me today. Sauces and stuff even if I can't eat it in actual food. Cause I reallyyy don't wanna fucking collapse in the street.",False,True

Perhaps you could do what my therapist is having me do- have AT LEAST one meal a day, no matter how much BS the ED voice gives you for it. That way your body has at least a little something to keep it going. Plus, if you have a little money for it, you could pick up some iron, vit. c, and a multivitamin just to give your body some of the crucial stuff it's missing. I'd encourage you to talk to a therapist- if you find the right one they won't make you ""give up"" your ED unless they genuinely think you won't make it till the next time you see them- they'll go you address deeper issues and find healthier coping mechanisms and eventually you'll have healed enough that you'll be ready to let the ED go. It sounds fake and dumb, but that's the approach my therapist is taking- she's no nonsense and has worked with severely mentally ill people, so I trust her completely.   Anyways, I'm sorry you're struggling. I understand not wanting to let it go. I'm there too. This community is here for you",False,False
