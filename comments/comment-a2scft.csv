Second the salmon poké bowl. Only 240 and it includes a lot of rice. Dolmas are amazing (only 35 cals each and delicious). Their boxed soups are really good. A lot are only 80-100 calories per serving (and there are 4 servings per box). Riced cauliflower is also great. Also a lot of their salsas/spreads are delish and pretty low cal.,False,False

I always buy loads of those microwaveable veggie bags, but those aren't TJ exclusive. Vanilla meringues -- I've heard there's a holiday flavor but the name is escaping me.
