Like nobody has ever tried to “help” my trichotillomania by saying, “You know if you keep pulling your hair out it will actually grow back twice as fast,” because even if people can’t understand the compulsion or a coping mechanism for the anxiety I feel they intuitively know I’m not doing it because I actually just want the hair to not grow back again. It’s clearly more complex than that and I don’t know why people then tend to believe that someone with an ED is so one dimensional that their only driving reason is some innate vanity that needs to preyed on to break them of it.
