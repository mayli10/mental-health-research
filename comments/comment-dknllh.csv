I’m literally chilling in my apartment with a torrent of suicidal thoughts as I’m trying to come to grips with the fact that I just binged for three days straight. I probably ate 4000-7000 calories each day. I don’t know how to do it either. It’s like once I start eating it’s game over. For the past year and a half I’ve either been binging, fasting, purging, or eating boiled eggs/drinking monster. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I’m telling myself right now that I’m just gonna fast, straight up, until I reach my gw. After that, I’ll try to be somewhat normal around food. But I tell myself that all the time, every time.   You’re definitely not alone, OP.",False,False

I would give anything to feel skinny again. But as much as I miss the happiness I used to get every time I reached a new LW and how strong/in control I felt when restricting, now I would settle just to eat a normal amount and not deal with this immense guilt and physical discomfort. It sucks so much and you're not alone, I hope this ends for both of us soon",False,False

I cannot do any type of dieting anymore but I will try giving fasting a chance, haha. Fasting is also like the fastest way to burn fat too..",False,False

It just sucks how I'd love to have this over and done with, be so skinny I look sick and recover back instead of this yoyo-ing. But apparently life has other plans for me",False,True

I went into self recovery about 4 years ago and kept telling myself that the weight gain was normal, healthy, good. Now I'm overweight and all I want to do is fast all day and have a glass or 2 of wine at night to sleep at night. But I'm always telling myself not to eat, staving off food all day, and then eating something and eating something leads to me wanting to eat more. So i end up eating a day's worth of food in an hour.",False,False

I've always had the thought of ""I'd do anything to be REALLY anorexic"" and it's so fucked up but true to my thoughts. I was restricting down to 500kcal a day last fall but now I can't stop eating for the life of me. At this point I most likely have BED but I refuse to get a diagnosis/help because I would literally rather be dead than officially have BED.",False,True

Sometimes all I can think of to get me out of this mess is suicide. I used to be an A-type anorexic with orthorexic subtype and at my lowest I was 105lbs with a 5’11” frame... Let’s say that couldn’t and didn’t last long(I am male).. And after attempting self-recovery which  unleashed something in me, I just could not stop eating for months and months.   After a year now, I am almost 190lbs despite having shoved at least 6-7k calories of food almost daily into my face and can’t restrict for the life of me. It’s almost like I lost my anorexia which I so desperately need to be skinny again. I would kill to be anorexic again. Being thin and having low-energy is preferable to this b/f nightmare that leaves me a fat mess.   I am still holding onto the clothes I had bought when I was at my skinniest though just as a “maybe”.. Suicide definitely seems like the way out most of the times.",False,False
