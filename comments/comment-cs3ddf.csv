I actually am chronically anemic due to a genetic blood disorder, but it has never affected my period before. I've also noticed that I'm always way below the recommended daily iron value on MY, so I'll try upping my iron intake and see if it helps! Thanks",False,True

I feel better hearing that yours came back the following month. Hopefully it is just the initial shock of everything, as you said. At least I KNOW I'm not pregnant, so I don't have to worry too much about that in addition to everything else! Lol",False,True

When this last relapse started and I started heavily restricting and over exercising again, I skipped that first month. But I got it back the next month (despite doing the same thing and losing weight). I think it's just that initial shock, then it gets along with its business. It was a bit worrisome though! Husband and I super thought I was pregnant and FREAKED. We already have 2 kids, and a third wasn't in the plan, haha.  Yeah, I'd wait a bit (you know the shtick, literally any change in exercise, mood, MH, etc and suddenly our periods are moodier than we are üôÑü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è). If it still doesn't come, you can always call your Dr and ask!",False,False

I hope you get it soooon and it's super non-problematic.",False,False

Today is my first day back on the regular pills, so maybe it will just trickle in later this week?   It's weird because I've never had an irregular period while on the pill. I will try and wait before panicking too much though, thank you",False,True

Today is my first day back on the regular pills, so maybe it will just trickle in later this week?   It's weird because I had all the old symptoms the week prior (cramps, headaches,cravings, mood), but then no blood... so now my brain is weirded out by the thought of old uterine lining jsit.. sitting in there waiting to be released? Idk. I will be patient and wait another week before freaking out too much I suppose. Thank you",False,True

When I was restricting to under 900-1000 cals a day I was late for a while too (and freaked out because I wasn't malnourished and had plenty of fat and have never been late before) but it eventually showed up.  My period has always been light-ish (and lasted 3 days max) but it's definitely gotten lighter since then too. And I was due yesterday/today but surprise absolutely no signs yet (my tits get suuuuper sore the week before and that hasn't happened yet). So really I don't know if it's my lack of eating or my hormones.   I'd definitely recommend visiting your doctor if you've missed two or more.,False,False
