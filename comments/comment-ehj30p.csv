It’s not going to make it to their home.   I know that’s not the best way to think about everything in life (“oh, well it doesn’t matter anyway”) but I think it’s kind of a good point with food and it made me feel better. It’s true, the dish I don’t finish I’ll either stuff into my body and it’ll just go to the toilet or it can go to the trash can now.  The best thing I can think of is if you can ever give food away or share it that can help. But otherwise don’t feel bad :c remember that you’re suffering from something very difficult, doing your best, and it’s not your fault 💕",False,False
