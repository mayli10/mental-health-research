Maybe she was going to make a joke, then realized it wouldn't go over well, or she couldn't land it correctly.

I can't even imagine saying that to someone, I wouldn't be able to sleep at night. One of my female friends wanted to borrow a dress for a night out last year, we hadn't seen each other in a long while so she didn't realise I had lost weight and we were no longer the same size. I let her try on everything and gave her privacy until she found something she felt okay in but I could see it brought her down that she couldn't fit into most of the clothes and she looked uncomfortable with herself. I made sure to compliment the hell out of her and build her up that night because she deserves to be happy and confident. I don't want her to hold herself to my unhealthy ideals.  Your friends sounds really bitter, angry or jealous about something, that's the only reason I can imagine she'd feel the need to say that. ",False,False

She knows about my ED, and we were getting ready to go nightclubbing one evening, and I asked to borrow one of her tops and got a response of ‚Äúmy clothes would never fit you! You‚Äôre way too big for them!‚Äù   Prior to my ED (when my body was healthy) I had always been a few sizes bigger than her, as she stands at around 4‚Äù8, and I‚Äôm just over 5‚Äù9. But as my ED has worsened, we‚Äôre now the same size (which she knew as she had previously asked me what size I took now).  I stopped talking to her for a while after that hurtful comment she made, but eventually decided to address it and ask her why she would say something like that. I‚Äôm paraphrasing a little here, but her answer was basically along the lines of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm unhappy with my body, and I know how much you struggle with your eating, but I‚Äôm jealous that you‚Äôve lost so much weight‚Äù.   The reason why I decided to share all of that^, is because in that moment I realised; nobody is fucking perfect. Everybody struggles with something, and sometimes the way they choose to address those struggles may be by deflecting their shit onto others, which is a terrible thing to do, don‚Äôt get me wrong.

Clearly I‚Äôm in the minority based on the other comments, but I think it is SUPER OBVIOUS that she said that as a jealousy jab because you are smaller than her (in both height and width and actual size).
