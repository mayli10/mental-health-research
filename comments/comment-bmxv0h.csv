I know how it feels and it's awful.  I don't really know what to suggest other than recognizing that the thought process is harmful to you (causes WAY more stress and anxiety than it's worth) and fighting it when you can. It sucks ass and the guilt is awful, but you know cognitively that it's what you have to do.  Other things I have done is research ways to preserve foods (you can freeze and refrigerate avocados! if you feel that an avo is getting ripe, you can put it in the fridge and it'll stay like that longer than it would at room temp), I have also forcibly desensitized myself by throwing away large quantities of food on occasion. I have destroyed food to justify throwing it away before.  None of it's fun and I know if you're as bad as I was about wasting food, these suggestions probably sound awful... but seriously... I know that feeling",False,False

Othertimes I follow a few zero-waste blogs and they usually have tips about reusing food scraps and stuff so they can last longer. So like if a vegetable is about to go off, i can cook it up into a side dish that will last a bit longer. If I can cook it into something that I can then portion and freeze indefinitely, even better. The suggestion to give away the stuff you make with it is also a good one.  Having a compost bin also helps me. Sometimes food just goes bad before I can eat it all and I feel awful but thinking that the food will turn into compost to use on someone's garden rather than just going into landfill somewhere helps a lot.",False,False

Catch me staggering through the grocery store parking lot with my arms overflowing with loose cans because I didn't bring enough reusable bags, lol  But when I have to waste food, which happens a lot with the ED which I'm sure you understand, composting helps. We have a bin at work, so I smuggle in my wasted food from home because somehow that feels better than chucking it in a landfill where it will be surrounded by plastics and never return to the ecosystem properly.
