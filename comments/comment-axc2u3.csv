I was on the pill for 3 years but my period started to get really fucked up (not sure if ed related) so I wanted to see if this would fix it. I have no side effects except for some spotting but tbh I wasn't expecting mood/appetite increases because I never had that on the pill,False,False

The first 5 was great, no problems. I lost my periods but I didn't care, less stress. However when I got the new one the lady who did it messed it up so bad I have nerve damage down there. I've been on depo for almost a year now and my periods have not come back, the damage has not recovered, and no doctor can fix the damage. I have no idea if I'm fertile or not since the periods haven't returned, and the damage down there has killed any self esteem I had left. It's literally a contraption stuck in your body, and when it's put in wrong or it goes wrong MAN DOES IT GO WRONG. If you're specifically asking more about the possibility of weight gain and cravings, your body needs a few months to adjust to the hormones and it may cause it. However for the first one I adjusted within the 6 months and actually hit my lowest weight on the IUD within the first two years. It was my reckless eating with my boyfriend that caused my weight gain. Mood wise, I don't think it affected me. Skin wise, I've never been good at skin care so I don't know. ",False,False

Periods are a little heavier than they used to be and I supplement with iron occasionally to compensate, but being hormone free is a dream. I will add one caveat though- when I switched to Paraguard I was coming off of ~8 years on some form of hormonal bc or another (did the implanon, the pill, the ring, you name it) and when I finally went hormone free, my skin FREAKED out for about 4 or 5 months before finally clearing again. I did tons of research on skincare and tried really hard to get a grip on it, but eventually it just finally resolved on its own after my hormones settled down. ",False,False

It works because of copper rather than because of hormones, so there's no reason it should have an effect on weight or appetite or really anything except the uterus, and for me, it doesn't.  It can make periods heavier, and I got a little bit anemic at first, but it went back to normal after a few months. In contrast to expectations my cramps actually got better - probably because inserting it stretches the cervix slightly. The uterus measurement and insertion of the IUD itself were a special kind of horrible, but a few seconds of that is perfectly well worth it for 10 years of protection.",False,False

I bled for about a week after it was fitted but my periods more or less stopped after (I occasionally get spotting or bleed a little for a day tops and then not at all for months). I havenâ€™t noticed any effect on my appetite or with weight gain. I would recommend it.   I was previously on the pill (Cilest) which was more reliable bleeding-wise (I ran the packs back to back so I didnâ€™t bleed at all for years) but annoying because I occasionally forgot to take them.

Birth control is scary and I hate that it takes months for your body to adjust/for you to find out if itâ€™s the right fit for you.   I went from an arm implant to a hormonal IUD and so far so good! Honestly Iâ€™m so grateful for how much my appetite decreased so Iâ€™m  little biased. There was cramping when they put it in and for about a week after. It sucked but it was something super manageable. The cramping was bad and then was spotty here and there for a few months. My only complaint is that I canâ€™t handle certain sexual positions that allow my partner to go deeper, because he bumps into my cervix and it mushes everything. It doesnâ€™t necessarily hurt but itâ€™s super uncomfortable and I need him to stop.   The hormones are light and my period is pretty much non existent now. I had the option of doing the one that starts with a K, but it was a lower hormone and I was worried I would still get my period. Since Iâ€™ve lost weight Iâ€™m a happier sexual partner, so I guess that balances out the discomfort with certain positions.   Iâ€™ve been on a number of pills, the patch, and had the arm implant twice. So far the iud is my favorite even with its flaws.   I became significantly less hungry after switching birth control to the iud. Iâ€™ve lost a TON of weight and itâ€™s contributed to a bit of a relapse. Whoops. I canâ€™t say much about my skin because since Iâ€™m eating less and with more anxiety I donâ€™t really eat dairy or wheat or red meat which I assume makes my skin look bad. ",False,False
