It is such an amazing joy to know that we are so in each moment figuring it out together. It‚Äôs also been really healing (as my therapist pointed out) for me to put so much of my energy into fine tuning my phrasing, materials, family education information/presentations, and guidelines for my assistant so that we can all model how to love ourselves, talk through challenges together, hold space for big emotions, accept when we‚Äôre wrong, learn, and commit to doing better next time, and accept ourselves and others for who we really are.   Also, I selfishly just love a sweet hug, or hearing the parents say how much their children love being with me. Young children are so pure and open with their emotions! It‚Äôs so refreshing for me to not have to wonder if they like me, or are okay with a decision I‚Äôm making, or what they‚Äôre thinking of me.   I hope you get to spend more time with them, and soak up all of that joy!",False,False
