I think it might be Season 2, Episode 2 on Hulu. There's a weird disagreement with seasons. Anyways, the title is ""The American Dad After School Special"". It cannot be recommended enough here.  Otherwise, I agree that *To The Bone* is pretty good, except Lucas. But, ya know, Hollywood has to force romance into everything. The book, *Wintergirls* by Laurie Halse Anderson handles that way better. The normal guy &gt;!keeps getting caught up in the girls' lives. After the first one dies from drinking/purging in his apartment, he pushes the other girl away because he doesn't want to deal with anyone's discorded shit.!&lt;",False,False
