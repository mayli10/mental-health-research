It's so invalidating when you tell people and they don't react the way you hope. Maybe with time she'll come to understand what you're going through. Either way, you should be proud of yourself for opening up about it - that's not an easy thing to do &lt;3",False,False

Like, you can't blame them for not knowing, but you can blame them for refusing to learn. It takes time, and it can be hard in the meantime, but if she really cares about you, she'll come to a better understanding eventually.",False,False
