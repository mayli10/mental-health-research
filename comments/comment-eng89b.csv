I went through this phase were I was worried I had an ED and at one point I tried to “recover” from it. It worked, but it felt exactly the way you described, like I’d ruined my ability to lose weight and restrict. I eventually went back to that kind of behaviour later and it was much harder, but I managed it unfortunately.

I was average sized in high school until I went to inpatient treatment where I blew up 60 lbs and was considered extremely overweight for my height but I didn't even know it or really care until much later when I looked back at old pictures. I got down to an average size again and then lost 20 lbs after my bf dumped me and was considered underweight but I was the skinniest I'd ever been. I am now in the process of gaining back all that lost weight and I feel utterly disgusting every time I look in the mirror and fantasize constantly about how great my life would be if I just got back to my old underweight size (even tho when I was that size I was up to my ears with mental health issues and depression). It's irrational and sucks but I totally understand what you're going through and seeing that weight gain after you've also seen yourself with a completely different and smaller body shape is a hard pill to swallow without slipping back into old habits. stay strong xx,False,False

Even though it was 8 years ago and had to go to rehab. But it was the only time in my life where I didn’t think about the way I looked. Pictures didn’t bother me.

I can see now that I still had many unhelpful beliefs and ways of dealing with emotions, but at the time felt like 'I got this'.

On the other hand, bouncing from rigid restriction and physical hyperawareness to totally shutting down that control and body-awareness...that sort of living-in-the-extremes is *very* me.  When I hit 'obese', I had an ""I gotta fix this"" crisis. I decided to try keto since junk carbs were my nemesis, and it took all of 48 hours for that to fire up my old ED behaviors and mindset. And a year later my brain is a tangled mess. I love this. *(I hate my body even more.)* I'm nowhere near danger. *(You keep goin to the barbershop, eventually you gonna get a haircut.)*  It's a freakin' convention in my head.
