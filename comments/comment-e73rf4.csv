I agree and feel very similarly about positive affirmations. If a certain affirmation is so sweet it starts to feel saccharine, it's hard to connect with. For people who are in active self-hatred, I usually start with focusing on self-acceptance rather than self-love because self-love can seem downright impossible when you're in that feeling-state.",False,True

I think it’s a bit much to ask someone who is afraid of eating food to immediately let go of any negative associations and start thinking of food as a joyful thing. “Food is fuel” is a value-neutral statement — food isn’t good or bad, it’s just energy for your body. This objective fact is very useful for combating the negative thoughts surrounding food which are very subjective feelings. It ties in with the important mantra of “focus on facts not feelings” used to combat cognitive distortions. Eventually the person will probably want to work up to actually enjoying food, but it’s easier to go from food is bad -&gt; food is not bad it’s just fuel -&gt; food isn’t just fuel, it’s also a source of pleasure  than it is to go immediately from food is bad -&gt; food is good. Changes in thinking are more likely to stick when you take baby steps.   I feel the same way about body positivity. It felt absolutely impossible to think about loving my body. Was very annoyed when suggested to go from loathing my body to loving it. Then I learned about body neutrality, learning to just accept my body and think of it as the vehicle that allows me to experience the world, it’s just a body and it’s not beautiful or ugly it just is. I thought: I could do that. Now that I’m in body neutral territory, the idea of loving my body doesn’t seem that completely foreign to me anymore. It feels achievable because I already let go of the hatred. Still working on it but I appreciate neutral statements as a stepping stone.",False,False
