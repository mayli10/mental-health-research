Although I can't see the difference a lot of the time when I think back to how I was 5 years ago its amazing to see how much happier I am now. A little bit of progress slowly adds up and is better than nothing. I'm nowhere near recovered but it's nice to feel like I'm closer to living my life the way I want to and should be able to. Good luck to you ðŸ’›,False,False
