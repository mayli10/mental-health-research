To prevent it, keep sodium intake up and I also supplement potassium through ‚Äúno-salt‚Äù salt substitutes. It‚Äôs pure potassium, closest mineral taste wise to salt. Cheapest way to supplement too. Just add it to stuff. It will help keep your electrolytes balanced in the future. ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False

I usually drink about 500mL every time after going to the toilet. I also had 2 teas. I drank more than usual the previous days too, the infection has been here since Saturday.

I'm scared of taking the car and fainting so my last resort is calling for an ambulance.  I peed a lot thanks to the UTI and apparently that helps. I also ate a while ago (and didn't purge!) and I guess this is getting absorbed because the difficulty breathing seems to get slightly away. At least I hope!  Thanks for your comment. ,False,True
