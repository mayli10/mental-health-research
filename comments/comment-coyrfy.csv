It started in high school. Went on for a good while. I stopped in college. Roommates made it difficult for me. I stopped, and food was okay. I ate when I was hungry and had, for the most part, whatever. I had a small stomach, so I got full easy. I maintained and fluctuated the same 5lbs but it was okay. I wasn't purging. It was a hard transition but it happened.   Fast forward a few years. My friend mentions a weight loss contest at his work. I become oddly competitive of people I don't know--don't work with.   I always joked I maintained my weight through the 1-3 cans of coke I drank a day. I cut out drinking my calories. I lost weight. I started eating less. Once a day. I cut out meals. I would have an apple and a fiber one. Sometimes I'd have one or the other. I lost more. What if nothing was in me? I lost more. I hit my UGW. I gained lbs back.   I'm stuck in a cycle I haven't been able to break in months. What happened? Time has passed me by. It never went away. It got so much worse.  Take care, love. This sucks.",False,False
