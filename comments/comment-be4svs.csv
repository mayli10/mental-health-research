My ultimate binge temptress that always has to make an appearance at holiday dinners. I just need to remind myself hey, you know you can literally buy scalloped potatoes and make them whenever you want, right! There’s no shortage of cheesy scalloped potatoes, you don’t need to eat the entire container. Don’t even get me started on the pistachio pudding torte 😭  My grandma died last summer so my mom has been redirecting that holiday grief towards cooking an obscene amount of food for three people every holiday. I come home from work and the first thing I see on holidays is our kitchen table turned into a buffet fit for a party. 😭 I appreciate my mom and her food so much but I’m a fatass who has a very short binge fuse right now.",False,False
