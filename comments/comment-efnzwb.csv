I spent about 4 months since April in 24 hour care between inpatient and residential because I was orthostatic, meaning that my heart rate jumped considerably from when I was sitting to when I was standing (At its worst my heart rate was 45 BPM sitting and 165 standing), which is caused by dehydration. I've also passed out many times, and when I was seventeen I had a heart attack.",False,False

Like, that causes the heart failure. There's also the potential of getting a wound in your esophagus and it becoming septic. I have binge purge anorexia and I think, to the bottom of my heart, that if I didn't purge I wouldn't have had the severe health problems that I've had with my eating disorder, and that was all related to my hydration and electrolytes.",False,False
