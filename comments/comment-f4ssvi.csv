It felt like I had so far to go, and that made me feel like I was helpless to do anything about it. I tried to be body positive, but I just felt like I was trapped in a body I hated. I couldn't maintain my recovery from AN in the end because I felt like I just had another ED: BED (which I think I did have).",False,False

When I first developed an ed it was purely restrictive and I became sort of a bitch towards the idea of people being overweight/obese. Then I went through a binge phase that was basically a year long, and tbh it made me a lot more mature/understanding. The great contradiction of a lot of eds is the search for control leading you to be controlled by your disorder, and I’ve been all over the map in terms of disordered behaviors I’m not able to easily overcome. And obviously not every overweight/obese person is that way because of disordered behavior, but who am I to judge?",False,False
