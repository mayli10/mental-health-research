Apples and oats for lunch or breakfast. Tea with almond milk throughout the day. I literally have to eat ""clean"" food, no spices or combinations of foods. I hate stews and food that i can't identify. This is probably to do with something other than an ed but yeah.",False,False

It's such a habit now that sometimes I forget to stop when it starts upsetting my stomach and I wonder why I'm so nauseated lol,False,False

It NEEDS to take me at least 20minutes to eat it. Same with lunch, but sometimes 15minutes is ok if it's quite a small amount. No mouthfuls of food, half a mouthful is the limit. Chewing needs to be a conscious act, absolutely no mindless eating. Snacks are avoided. Everything is weighed and organised. Meals are generally planned and sorted the night before, spontaneity makes me nervous.",False,False

Even stuff that usually requires a spoon, like yogurt or cereal. It takes so much longer to eat, and I eventually get tired of trying before I can finish.",False,False

Like I have to leave some of it on the plate/bowl/whatever.  It’s like if I finish something, my ED says “look you ate it all you disgusting pig”.

On non school days I try to do 2 meals a day and won't eat until i feel hungry but try to wait until the afternoon before I do. I definitely feel like I'm a volume eater because I can eat a lot of food and still feel hungry or like I have room for more.  I will get up multiple times during a meal to reheat my food if it's not hot like microwave vegetables might get reheated 2-3 times at dinner before I actually finish them because I might have a large quantity of food. I always try and end my meal on bulky things so toast is something that would get gone first but I would have broccoli or cucumbers be the last thing I eat for example.",False,False

Whereas on workout days I spread it evenly between 4 meals: breakfast, pre workout, post workout, dinner.  I have to eat at these times or I like mentally give up and am more prone to a binge.   -Dinner always is a high veggie meal, usually with a grain as the side.   -I never skip meals and never let myself be more than 200 calories below my daily allowance (so to prevent binges and excessive malnutrition).   -No junk food allowed ever. Though it happens sometimes.",False,False
