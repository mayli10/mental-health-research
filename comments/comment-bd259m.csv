Now I vehemently push my food preferences into meals. I buy or bring vegetables/salad to prepare for meals and openly say things that are true, like ‘if I eat that much pasta it messes up my digestion.’ My family used to act like I was weird, but now they are used to it. I mean even if I wasn’t totally neurotic if I ate heavy meals in their style of cooking I would feel super sick because my body is so used to the diet I’m on.",False,False

Give yourself smaller portions. Take smaller bites. Hold food on your tongue or chew each mouthful until it’s as smooth as it’s going to get. After all, you don’t taste food once it’s swallowed so what’s the point of eating quick just to eat more of the same thing you just had in your mouth moments before? May as well have just kept the first mouthful in longer, that’s how I see it anyway, savor each morsel and you’ll naturally eat less. You’ll digest food better when it’s been properly chewed as well",False,False

Kind of a compromise, but it's worth it to enjoy the time with your family.",False,False
