If I'm staying at some place on a break they usually have one and I manage to cover it somehow with a sheet or whatever's going to do the job.  I only have mirrors to apply makeup.  I started to do this because the trigger for my second relapse was staying at a b&amp;b and the room had a ""fat mirror"" (you know the kind that make you look wider as opposed to ""thin mirrors"").  I hate when I see my reflection in full length windows because I just don't want to see myself so I can let my BD pick apart what I see.  It definitely helps.  I still never can break the other way of body checking (touching bones, measuring arms and legs with my hands, etc.) but that gives me a more ""real"" impression of how I look.  At this point I really don't ever want to own another mirror apart from the cosmetics one.  Thinking back to all the hours I wasted looking at myself and despising what I saw makes me feel really bad for others who still feel the need to do it.  It's torture.  It's really fantastic to read about your epiphany!!!  You don't need a mirror (they're not accurate anyway, hence ""fat"" and ""thin"" mirrors).  Another helpful thing I've found is not having my photo taken.  In the age where instagram and selfies are massively a thing, I only have perhaps a dozen full length photos of me over a 15 year period.  I can live without it.  It's great that you had a carefree time and I hope many more follow.  X",False,False

I'm several months into recovery and doing really well overall (eating well, feeling happy and confident, my brain is slowly starting to stop being fixated with food and is calming down)...until I look in the mirror.  Honestly, I just try really hard to avoid looking in the mirror or body checking because I know that it only sends me backwards. ",False,False
