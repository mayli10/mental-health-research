She was sooo tiny; arms like sticks, legs like sticks and bony chest. Nowadays she seems to fluctuate a lot, I think (and I'm getting dangerously close to gossiping now) it's dependant on her drug benders and emotional swings. Sometimes she eats a lot of junk and it shows on her, sometimes she becomes very skinny very quickly again.  I kind of think that she has a borderline ED, sometimes starving (or forgetting to eat bc drugs), sometimes binging a lot, sometimes in combination with purging. She gets that puffy face look from time to time and tbh, I think her 'normal' body type is somewhat chubby. This is all immense speculation of course but I don't mean this maliciously, more like that I can sympathise like crazy, because my ED follows the same ups and downs. And besides she's very androgynous and tomboy-ish which I'm always a fan of.  Aside from that, you've already mentioned one of my fave thinspos, Mila in Black Swan. Elaborating on that, Natalie Portman in the same film. She's somewhat less obvious than Mila, because her dance training was far more intense and as a result she got the bulky dancer's legs, but her torso was actually *much* tinier than Mila's.  A fairly unknown one: Stav Strashko, Israeli model. Her body is incredible, I have an entire thinspo folder dedicated to her on my phone.
