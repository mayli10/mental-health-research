I mostly share your definition, but losing control with a bag of low cal popcorn (about 500 calories total) like I did today is not going to fuck me up for the rest of the week like losing control and driving to 5 different bakeries has in the past. I'm not thinking ""fml I binged, I hate myself and my life"". So in my mind, I probably won't really call it one.",False,False

The therapist was a student and didn't take me seriously because my binges didn't meet the ""definition"" of a binge.

But I would eat so much at once that it was uncomfortable. And that was enough to make me feel like crap.,False,False

I just keep seeing posts and comments where people say things like “anything over x calories is a binge for me”. But a binge has never been about calories too me. I would literally binge then not be able to even remember what I ate sometimes. I agree that it’s like a trance. I just find it strange that people are putting calorie limits on binges, I guess.",False,True

I identify with Bingeing behavior, mindset, etc... but I have never been the type to eat a whole pizza, tub of ice cream, etc...  I had somebody tell me that I didn't suffer from binges, since I wasn't eating insanely large amount of food. My friend was like ""well when I binge, I do x"" then proceeded to talk about eating a whole pizza, dominos dessert, and bread sticks. Sure, I get it, but that doesn't negate the fact that my version of bingeing is still a mental hell regardless of calories.   Anything unplanned and out of control is a binge to me. Like I was in a trance. I would go to the pantry, get a bowl of unflavored cheerios (eww), almond milk, and some maple syrup (literally all I had in the house). As soon as I was done, I walked myself over for another bowl and another. I wasn't enjoying the food, I was just eating it. It may not have even put me at a dangerously high calorie intake, but I had no control over it and I felt really terrible both during and after.  For me, that's a binge.",False,False
