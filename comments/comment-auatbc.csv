Part of me understands that I have an ED, but another part thinks I'm just vain,  weak and running back to my coping mechanisms so I can have something to hold onto. I feel like I used it as a weapon too, a weapon of defense, but also protection and comfort. I realized that the way you feel is apart of this disorder though, and you're not fake for having your illness manifest in a different way than others. There's so much to EDs. You, me, and everyone else struggling is just as real as any other sufferer and that's why we can come together and relate to these posts, and this beautiful poem. üíï",False,False

You know, what gets me about this is the fact that it makes me feel this nervous, apprehensive excitement.

I think we all know the feeling you describe. I only realised that other ED sufferers feel it too after I came on this subreddit, and it is a great comfort to me. It thought even though I was diagnosed that proper ED sufferers always restricted. And that for some reason I was not real because I would ‚Äòpoke‚Äô the monster when I felt like I needed control and something to grab onto. I felt like a failure and a poser because surely people who actually suffer from it wouldn‚Äôt use their illness as a weapon whenever they wanted.
