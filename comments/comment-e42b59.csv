My ED is so numbers driven and sadly my degree was all data based so my brain is like ""DON'T SKIP A DAY OF TRACKING. MAKE ALLLL THE PRETTY SPREADSHEETS DON'T FUCK IT UP BY MISSING A DAY!"" and it's exhausting.   The best thing I've thought of doing at this point is taking the batteries out of my scale and throwing them out. I don't have the money to replace them, and I'm not quite at a place where I feel like I could completely destroy or throw out my scales - so it's a compromise by throwing out the batteries somewhere I couldn't frantically dig them out (I took them to a battery recycling container at my local supermarket)",False,False
