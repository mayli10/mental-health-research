It becomes a goal. Most people eith Ed's want to see health consequence because tangibly seeing the disorder physically effect them is validation. I have been bulimic for almost 15 years now. Nothing physically bad has ever happened to me. You wanna keep waiting for something bad to maybe happen to your bf?   Look, the health stuff is small fry to how this impacts your life forever. Hes going to struggle with this for the rest of his life. This is the first thing he thinks about when he wakes up and the last thing he thinks about when he goes to bed. If he was bipolar, depressed, schizophrenic etc would you not be  concerned if it wasnt physically affecting his health? Why focus on that with the ED? It's not a physical illness and it doesnt even always hurt people physically. You can be a health nut and have an ed. People think we are better when we eat extremely healthy and exercise but this is just another phase of the disorder. His head is sick. Hes consumed and obsessed with this if you keep telling him shit about how he can get sick and he never does you both will be like ""oh well"" eventually.   You cant really help him, just dont comment on his food or body, encourage him to get some help. Its gonna be in his head his entire life. We want someone to care, we want someone to notice, but when they do they usually stick their feet in their mouths. His life isnt necessarily in danger but hes still struggling. If he eats healthy hes struggling. If he eats a lot and doesnt purge hes struggling. Food will be really hard for the rest of his life. All you can do is tell him you're willing to listen. DO NOT SUGGEST DIETS! Dont suggest ways to eat dont suggest exercise dont focus on the food and health symptom.",False,False

Just like it would be unhelpful to tell a depressed person ‚Äúit‚Äôs unhealthy to lay in bed staring at the wall all day, why don‚Äôt you just get up?‚Äù It‚Äôs typically just as unhelpful to tell a bulimic person ‚Äústomach acid ruins your teeth- you should stop‚Äù   In both cases what you can see on the outside- throwing up or laying in bed all day- are just symptoms of a much deeper rooted issue that needs to be addressed by a professional. And in both cases people can be supported and cared for and still not have the mental or emotional energy to start the process of getting healthier and need time and patience before deciding to get help for themselves.   My best advice moving forward is to love him where he is now. You‚Äôve let him know already that you want him to be healthy and not suffer from this and that is good. But continuing to push and push the issue if he isn‚Äôt ready yet is going to become a wedge between you. Knowing that he is worthy of being loved just how he is is going to be a step in the right direction mental health wise and may give him enough to realize he‚Äôs worth recovering and motivate him to seek health for himself.   There are things you can do now to help him reduce the stress his body is under- like making sure he rinses out his mouth with water after vomiting, or keeping zero calorie water flavor packets that have electrolytes in them in your purse in case he starts to feel sick, helping him figure out what his triggers are and avoiding them. But overall, just caring about him through this, viewing it as a disorder and not a choice, and being there for him and supportive of him are all really big things",False,False

I recently came clean to my partner of 5 years and just him knowing has been enough for me to do it much much less from the shame alone.   I‚Äôm not a mental health professional but if I were you that‚Äôs where I would start. Find one for him, if you‚Äôre in the financial place to pay for the consultation then that‚Äôd be a wonderful gift to him.   He‚Äôs very very lucky to have you to support him, but please be sure to take care of yourself as well. Eating disorders drain everyone involved. I hope he gets better soon üíô",False,False
