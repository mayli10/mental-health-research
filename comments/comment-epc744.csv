We both grew up in really financially irresponsible households and we donâ€™t have a groundwork for living within our means. Doesnâ€™t excuse where weâ€™re at but it explains it. You know what does help when planning a budget for the quadrillionth time? Knowing that youâ€™re at least going to save on food costs ðŸ˜…ðŸ¤¡,False,True

Even though I feel huge some days, I can feel that Iâ€™m losing and that helps. No one would call me anything. But wow when I think about how big a part anxiety and need for control plays in this disorder, and how completely and utterly out of control my finances feel most of the time...bye bye hunger cues!",False,True

If it makes you feel better, once I accidentally double paid our mortgage and the mortgage company wouldnâ€™t refund, only would apply it to the next month. We had to borrow money from my FIL and convince the bank my mortgage company did this and not us to reverse the overdraft fees. We also owe a ton of money to a school my husband attended for one year about 100 years ago and apparently never paid for. That was a fun one to find out when we were expecting a sizable tax return and instead we got a letter saying it went to the state school.  I feel your pain. Good luck to you and I hope you get everything sorted out!",False,False
