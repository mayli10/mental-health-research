I’d cramp craaazy hard for ten seconds, twenty second break, then another painful cramp. Turned out to be a lack of potassium and “Enteritis” which is acute inflammation of the small intestines. Was given three medicines via IV and told to only drink lots of water and eat nothing too fibrous (so basically soups, crackers, pretzels, nothing fried or greasy) for a few days so the inflammation can fully settle.   Obviously idk if you have the same so definitely see a doctor.",False,False
