I only drink super strong (also gross) black coffee and I would be dead without salt. Just a pinch makes all the difference.  And if I'm feeling reaaaally ugh and need to drink a *lot* of coffee I'll add a spoon of organic honey and some crushed ginger pieces.  Idk if it was just my body cooperating or placebo, but the ginger really helped with me not getting acid refluxy when I was consuming nothing but bottles of black coffee. Also - cinnamon, vanilla essence/extract, orange peel.",False,False

I know itâ€™s not on your listed ingredients but I use sugar free French vanilla coffee mate which is 15 calories and it tastes great! Maybe a very small amount of milk or some type of creamer would improve it as well!,False,False

Also icing it may help",False,False
