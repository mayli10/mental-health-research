I cant pretend to imagine the pain you are in. Nothing I can say will make it better. I wish I could help but all I can do is be here for you. Please reach out to me if you ever need someone to listen. You have a whole community of people here for you. ‚ù§Ô∏è,False,False

You absolutely can check out for a bit. Your husband should be stepping up to take care of you right now. You need him. If you have someone that can watch the toddler for a day or two, take that time to process without worrying. It‚Äôs heartbreaking, but it‚Äôs not your fault.  It‚Äôs not your fault.",False,False

Having the numbers and when having to explain what happened (my boss ugh and my mother) focusing on the clinical terms and numbers and timelines help keep it non-emotional.,False,True

I don't want to trigger you more but maybe seeing raw cold hard data might have this a little more bearable.,False,False

I lost a pregnancy at 20 weeks but mine was 100% because of my AN. It‚Äôs been 12 years and I still haven‚Äôt gotten past the guilt. But it sounds like you did everything right. I know you know that these things happen, but hearing that doesn‚Äôt make it any easier. Just know that you are an amazing mom for doing everything you could to be healthy for your babies, and I‚Äôm proud of you for that, because I know how hard that is. If you ever need to talk, I‚Äôm happy to listen. Again, I‚Äôm so terribly sorry.",False,False

But you're going to keep hearing that, so I'm just gonna say this- IT. IS. **NOT!!!!**. YOUR. FAULT.  Never was, never will be. Please, *please,* don't blame yourself. Give yourself time to grieve. Be gentle to yourself. Right now, it's okay to be ""selfish"", and let yourself be alone. Just please, please, take care. You will get through this. It's terrible. But it will get easier after some time.  Please stay safe. Gentle hugs ‚ô•",False,False

With such a big heartbreak, you cant carry on like it didnt happen. A lot of society wont understand but there are support groups.   But when something like that happens, honestly, just feel all the emotions. Let them hit you as hard as they will. If you deny the feelings they stay longer and hurt more. I've learned that from my own trauma.  I'm really really sorry this happened to you. If you need people to talk to we are here",False,False

I understand the grief of a miscarriage, it‚Äôs truly hell. It absolutely is not your fault, and you sound like a wonderful mom who was/is doing everything correctly.   I think you are allowed to check out. You have the right to process this in a way that feels right for you. Ultimately, your toddler needs a healthy and sound mom...so allow yourself to do what it takes to heal from this. Don‚Äôt feel guilty for taking time for yourself. Do you have a therapist who can work with you through this?",False,False

You are not alone. I had a miscarriage 2 years ago. We've been trying for a baby for 4 years. That was the only pregnancy. I only made it to 7 weeks before I lost it. I had gotten so healthy. I worked so hard. I too, did everything right. The loss turned my soul into a black hole. I spiraled down. Stopped eating. I figured if my body couldn't keep a baby alive, why even bother eating? I lost a lot of weight and haven't been able to gain it back. The fertility doctor told me to get to a bmi of 21 and I couldn't do it. We stopped going. We decided to not have children. We agreed to not think about it anymore. I still think about it all the time.   Snuggle with your toddler. Take it slow. Remember your husband is grieving too. Grieve together. Don't shut your family out. They need you and you need them.",False,False

Maybe just a couple days or even a week to yourself. You can be alone, gather your thoughts, let all these emotions out and heal yourself.  Trying to hide your sorrows is like a child trying to hide all the candy wrappers so his mom won‚Äôt find out, meanwhile his mouth is all covered in sugar. It shows.  It‚Äôs okay to think it‚Äôs because of your ED that this happened. Let out all the possibilities that somehow it was your fault. Then you can realize, they are wrong. You need to purge all thoughts, good and bad, so your not stuck in the past, hoping to change what‚Äôs already happened.  With regards to smoking.. You have a healthy child, so in return your child deserves a healthy mom.  I encourage you to continue to post your thoughts and how everything has been going, and your ED. However way we can support you and prevent a relapse through words, is what we‚Äôre here for.",False,False

You did everything you could. Most pregnancy loss is caused by genetics or developmental complications. You were doing everything right. It‚Äôs not your fault. Try to be strong for your toddler, I know it‚Äôs easier said than done, I‚Äôve been there, I know what it‚Äôs like. Reach out for support.  My heart goes out to you during this difficult time.
