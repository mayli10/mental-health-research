Not allowing your child to meet their needs (not feeding them enough, not letting them drink enough water) is child abuse and also neglect.   I'm not being dramatic, I promise. By restricting your water intake (why would you? It's not like water is damaging or expensive) you are being abused. This is not okay. You deserve to have your needs - ALL of your needs, both physical and emotional  - met.  The fact that you're taxing laxatives just compounds the situation, if you don't get enough water, you very well could go into an electrolyte imbalance and could die.  Drink all of the water you need. Ignore your mother. Remember, the best way to get rid of be water weight is to drink plenty of water. The more dehydrated you are, the more water your body will try to hang on to.",False,False

I really hope you are safe. Is there anyone you trust enough to disclose this to? Have you ever called a child welfare line, or think you might be willing to do so?   You don't deserve to be treated like this and I am scared for you. Dehydration is dangerous, *especially* if you're also taking laxatives. Please keep drinking.",False,False
