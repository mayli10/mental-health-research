Not trying to be an insensitive jerk from my last comment, I just really can‚Äôt wrap my head around someone who seems to be claiming they have all these very crippling symptoms of depression but also livestreams their own makeup routine..?   That‚Äôs just coming from someone who‚Äôs depression is strongly rooted in a LOT of self loathing/very low self esteem though. It‚Äôs different for everyone, didn‚Äôt mean to straight up diagnose her as a narc üòÖ  The real issue here is the romanticization as you said! Depression isn‚Äôt pretty or cute or endearing in the least.

If my boyfriend always let me mope around watching Netflix in my stinky pajamas, I'd just end up feeling worse and worse. On the other hand, I wouldn't be able to deal if he was putting so much pressure on me to live up to the same standards as a healthy person. He helps push me to do the things that need to be done, like paying bills, showering, getting to doctor's appointments, etc. and on the days when I'm feeling well enough to, he'll encourage me to get out of the house, socialize, get some exercise, and so on. But he doesn't force me to do these things or make me feel shitty about not being able to do them. He's gotten pretty good at distinguishing between the ""I don't want to get up and go out, but if I do, I'll feel better"" days and the ""laying on the shower floor crying for three hours because I don't have the energy to stand up and wash myself"" days and pushing me only as hard as I need to be pushed.

""If you're dating someone with depression, she's going to be tired, constantly. Don't harass her to get out of bed, she'll only feel more worthless for being depressed. She might not want to eat or may eat too much. Don't force her to conform to your standards of healthy eating, you may trigger an eating disorder. She's going to want to cancel plans to stay home and watch netflix. Don't force her into social interaction, she may resent it and it may make her feel unsafe. She may not look like she's in the mood to be silly. Crack a joke anyway. If she doesn't want to laugh, don't be offended. She might want to cry over spilled coffee. Don't judge her for it, she's overwhelmed. She may be happy and sad at the same time and not understand why. She may want constant reassurance that she's beautiful. She may want you to leave her alone. She may need reassurance you're not going to leave. She may try to make you break up with her because she feels like a burden. She doesn't doubt your love, depression comes with anxiety. Anxiety is selfish. It tells her that everything is her fault. It reads deep, destructive meaning into the most casual of words and interactions. Depression means no appetite, binge eating, sleeping for 10 hours and still being tired. It doesn't make any sense. It's impossible to understand. People with depression fight a constant internal battle where the littlest things like showering or returning a text seem like insurmountable tasks. Depression does not manifest the same for everyone. Be a support. Be available. Ask what will help. Listen. Encourage.""  If you upvote please upvote the OP. ",False,False
