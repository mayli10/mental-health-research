I've struggled with very severe bulimia for years now and even though I wouldn't dare talk about it in front of her or anything, seeing me getting thinner from adding restriction on top of it was enough to ""trigger"" the person who I thought was my best friend into telling me that I'm ""toxic"" by virtue of my very existence as a person with this disease and prompt her to ghost me after years of friendship.  Moral of the story/my unsolicited advice as someone who has learned this lesson the very hard way: *do not* talk about ED, calories, food restriction, purging, etc. with the *vast* majority of people you know. As people with ED, thoughts that sound normal to us, frequency of talking about food that seems normal to us, and habits that are part of our daily lives can be very shocking and upsetting to a lot of people, even if they won't tell you outright. Aside from close family members and maybe a friend or two, it really is worth it to make a big effort to not mention anything involving eating/calories/food in front of others. It's hard because you want and deserve a support system, but hurting others is a big risk, as is getting hurt when non-disordered people sense the negative effect your disorder may be having on them.",False,False

He hasn't quite hit puberty yet, so he's at that awkward box-y shape right before guys hit a growth spurt. He was a lanky kid and this is really affected his sense of self.

Thankfully my brother trusts me more and our family doctor has said he's normal.   But all of this makes me hyper-aware of how I eat around him. I'll eat more vegetables with him, but also go out for frozen yogurt to show balance. If I had some junk earlier, I'll pass on dessert because I had too much sugar. I try to emphasize health and balance because the idea of him hating himself as much as I hated myself makes me feel ill.
