(except i have noone to send nudes to, so i wanted to post them on reddit instead) (but my body is not even near sexy, being all saggy and jellyish, so i freaked out and gave up the whole idea)  It's awesome that you've got a boyfriend! Maybe you can try to cope with his affection rather than starving? I mean, it's possible if you tell him that you want to be praised by your looks, he will do as told and it'll make you feel better. (and he can also reminder you that appearance isn't everything, even if it's hard for us to believe)  Anyway, hope you'll be able to calm down soon and will feel less bad about yourself!ðŸŒ¸ðŸ‘€ ",False,False
