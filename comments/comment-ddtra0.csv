I didn‚Äôt mention I had ongoing issues, but I said I did several years ago when I went to treatment. I didn‚Äôt mention anything food or weight related when we hung out we just talked about his job and our majors and random stuff like that.   I agree it wasn‚Äôt a good excuse. Even if he tries to contact me I‚Äôm not sure I would talk to him unless he gives a better explanation. I asked him to elaborate and he just said ‚Äúdo you ever feel like everything happens all at once?‚Äù And just cryptic stuff like that so who knows.",False,True
