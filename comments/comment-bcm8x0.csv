People say dumb triggering things all the time like ""This drink has no carbs I'm watching my figure!"" and always follow it up by telling me that I don't have to worry about that stuff yet. Like lady, if only you knew what I worry about.  I feel you. That shit is awful",False,False

I swear my chemistry teacher was once drinking green tea, and she just burst out asking if I drink green tea out of the blue. And I say yes, and then she says that I‚Äôm so healthy and she wishes to be like me. Apparently she listened once to me talking to my mom (stalker??) and I mentioned eating oats in the morning. And she was like ‚Äúyou drink green tea and eat oats in the morning‚Äù  I just told her that I usually eat healthy in the morning but not much at night. And seas still like ‚Äúwell, at least you eat a lot and never get fat‚Äù   I have BED, Karen. I try restricting in the morning and end up binging at night. I keep trying to purge after binging and fail. I do weird fucking stuff like drinking too much green tea until my stomach can‚Äôt function, watching too many weight losssubliminals that I know won‚Äôt work that much, and I reached the point that I even whisper to my water that I‚Äôm going to lose weight so it magically does something to my body.   I‚Äôm going crazy and she wants to be like me",False,False

At that time I was nearly underweight (recovering from anorexia) and the mother was very overweight. Every time we ate together she would constantly comment on how I was able to eat a lot and still stay skinny. Guess what, I was actually falling back into bulimia... I hated her comments so much and it definitely triggered me a lot. All those comments are not only annoying but freaking triggering to me and everytime I get so mad but contain all my anger to report it on food later.. All that to say I feel you and I'm sorry you have to endure this üíñ",False,False
