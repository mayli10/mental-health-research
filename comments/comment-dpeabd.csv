I understand the compulsion though. Different bodies react badly to certain bacteria in expired foods and what someone can just vomit up and eventually be ok, another person can be unable to get out of their body and die. Please take this into account &lt;3",False,False

During flu season I don't shy away from any germs hoping that I'll get some stomach virus that will make me bed ridden for a week. But eating that food or catching the flu just isn't worth it, not only because you deserve better but because it's a vicious cycle that's hard to get out of. Once you allow yourself to do something like that it isn't difficult to do it again, and throwing up all the time because of self induced food poisoning isn't the path to go. Please look after yourself",False,False
