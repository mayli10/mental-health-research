I honestly didn’t dig deeper than the article and I appreciate you doing so!   I think, according to the link you shared, the DSM-5 still identifies atypical anorexia as an eating disorder (likely the point of changing the term EDNOS to OSFED now that they are specifying different types). I agree, it’s weird to call it “atypical anorexia,” but the DSM-5 has made weirder calls.  Either way, I hope someone sees our exchange and reads the links before rolling their eyes and ignoring the post entirely—which was my temptation.",False,False

However in the new DSM , after the bullet point criteria for AN they talk about this a little more. If the clinician feels it is warranted based on developmental trajectory and/or or other signs of severity/malnutrition they can diagnose AN even if BMI is above 17.5. Which I think is a smart move given the issues other posters have talked about.   I do see your point about medical severity with emaciation and I think that was the original thinking behind this distinction. However people can suffer from some of the same ailments like low bone density, electrolyte issues, etc at any weight.   I am close to underweight right now and I kind of just want to lose those last few pounds so I can go from BN to AN And be taken more seriously.

Anorexia gets the most attention from both ED and non-ED people as it’s the most visible due to the low BMI criteria. Bulimics tend to be normal to overweight and other eating disorders range from normal to severely overweight so people don’t take it that seriously as you’re “not starving”. For people overweight and more, people also tend to see it as a moral failing (“why don’t you just eat less?”) and so many people in a lot of developed nations are so big that class 1 obesity isn’t seen as all that big in a lot of places, so no one ever considers any possible psychological issues with food or body.",False,False

Is it that someone starts out very overweight and then develops behaviors to lose weight and does but is still in the overweight category? Because I am not able to get my mind around it. The definition of AN is being significantly underweight. So I suppose these people would meet the criteria at some point if they continued losing but wouldnt it be EDNOS otherwise? I dont understand this push to be classified as AN and I only hear this online. I have never heard of this anywhere else.

I ask as someone with a high BMI who has gotten these kinds of comments when I was at my (fairly high) lowest.  This is kind of derailing but I thought a low (and/or a healthy range BMI) was pivotal to the anorexia diagnosis.  I think it's moreso a medical ""alarm"", that someones habits have been so chronic and longlasting that they have been malnourished long enough to maintain a low BMI. Because if I have anorexic symptoms as an overweight person, my body can go into ketosis and help me survive.
