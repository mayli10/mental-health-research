I work a physically and mentally challenging job and find I do better with some sort of ‘release’ (other than of course controlling everything and starving myself lol)   Getting a bit of exercise, CBD pills, happy lamp + d3 (I’m PNW) has helped me tremendously. I know journaling is a great outlet too.  Being that high on the scale though is rough. Def do some extra self care and be gentle with yourself. Check electrolytes and vitamins— so important when very low on calories.",False,False
