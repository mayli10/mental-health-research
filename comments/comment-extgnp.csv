I actively practice looking like a normal human being while eating. I have an entire script playing in my head when I eat in front of people. *""Bite. Chew. Keep chewing. Swallow. Blink. Nod like you're listening. Move food around the plate. Are people laughing? Laugh too. Another bite in 3..2..1..bite. Chew. Sip. Swallow.""*",False,False

I guess Iâ€™m just a point where eating and food, especially processed food like snacks, is so outside of my regular routine that I forget that it exists. Until I saw this post I forgot that I have an entire tin box full of all types of candy and snacks in my room thatâ€™s been there for like 2 months because I just donâ€™t eat that type of stuff.  Itâ€™s the same if Iâ€™m somewhere that has like crisps or something, itâ€™s pretty easy for me to just have 2 (I have to eat everything in even numbers, so I couldnâ€™t just have one) because Iâ€™m not usually eating it so I will forget that itâ€™s an option for me to have it. That and the flavor of crisps is so intense Iâ€™d suffer sensory overload from a bite alone lmao",False,False

Only the first bites were truly the best. A lot of the time I will read while eating and that helps with distraction as well as making myself chew slowly and be in the moment vs my preferred inhaling of my food.,False,False

If Iâ€™m eating and have a bad thought, Iâ€™ll stop mid-chew to wait it out before continuing. Itâ€™s a really bad compulsive behavior that keeps me really restrictive with what Iâ€™m eating.   That plus my anorexia means I have no idea how any of you actually manage to eat anything like snacks? Sometimes I cry if I allow myself an extra teaspoon of honey because I feel bad about the sugar. I sucked on a chip the other day and had to spit it out because I couldnâ€™t deal.  Just goes to show eating disorders are often very different but all equally messed up!",False,False

Like how do you decide how to do this? I can do it if I'm concentrating on not looking like a hungry pig, or otherwise concentrating on savouring. But other people appear to do it without thinking about it.    I asked my friend (who knows about my ED) and she got super defensive about it. She basically said she eats because she likes the taste so she takes another bite when she wants the taste again.   Thinking about it, this makes sense because if you take another bite right away, it doesn't taste as good, right?   Hmmm. But tell that to my lizard brain.",False,False
