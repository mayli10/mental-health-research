Even though I said not to go in my room, she did so she could 'wash my blankets' which I washed the day I left anyway.  I won't find out if she read it until she's upset with me and brings something up.",False,True

That was bad enough, but then she told my ENTIRE FAMILY, like literally 20 people - aunts, uncles, cousins, FUCKING GRANDPA - at a party.    I was FURIOUS.  I'm still furious.  I'm 39.  Twenty years and that anger is still there.  I hope she doesn't read it.  But if she does, I hope she offers whatever help, love, and support you need and DESERVE.",False,False

Even worse since you’re in your mid twenties and capable of running your own life.    It’s poor parenting to read a kids journal, but a whole new level of boundary crossing to read a grown daughter’s journal.   I hope your mom respects your privacy, and I also hope that you bring yourself to get the help you know you need. ",False,False

My mother is a bit snoop too and she won’t keep secrets to herself. My mom found out I cut myself and didn’t say anything for months. And when she did say something it was after I had been crying in the dressing room while clothes shopping and she just said “so are you going to kill yourself? I know you cut your legs”. ,False,False

This was at a pretty bad time so there was a lot of dark and personal stuff in there. She never admitted to reading it, but she would drop hints about it. It was terrible knowing that she read it, but it was worse knowing she didn't care enough to ask me if I was okay. Hopefully, if your mom does read it, she'll be understanding and want to help you. I wish you luck! ",False,False
