I developed ED at age 11 before any of my other mental health issues manifested, and prior to ED I was happy. Then while in the grips of ED, I started to show symptoms of bipolar and anxiety and addiction/alcoholism and then later PTSD. Now when I fall back into ED, it's as a coping mechanism to deal with my other mental health issues. But I definitely think when I first developed the ED, it came before unhappiness and then made me unhappy and then I got a little older and all my other mental health issues came into play.",False,False

I was happy as a kid. I also binged (like full-blown ""my mom put a lock on the pantry door to stop my binging and I would sneak down with a screw driver and take it off so that I could eat a whole jar of peanut butter and box of rice krispies despite being a perfectly well-fed child"" sort of binging.)   I think when I started to get unhappy, because I already had elements of ED behaviors and beliefs, my unhappiness very easily channeled into full-blown disordered eating. ""If you drink anything but skim milk you'll get fat!"" happy young me parroted matter-of-factly, having heard it from my mom, as I drank whole chocolate milk without fear or shame. ""If you drink anything but skim milk you'll get fat"" unhappy me thought bitterly, sipping only half the skim milk carton through a coffee stirrer and still feeling revolted with myself.  And then I think they sort of melded. Engaging in ED behaviors when I was unhappy made me ""happy"" (gave me a sense of control, purpose, success, etc.), so unhappiness fueled my ED. But my ED made it impossible for me to be truly happy, so my ED fueled my unhappiness.  I think disordered eating came before unhappiness for me, but unhappiness was the catalyst for disordered eating becoming an eating disorder, and they're really inextricable.",False,False

Circle of mental health problems, you're depressed so you don't do anything and then you become even more depressed because you don't do anything and feel useless. Eating disorders are a coping mechanism, so we use them to cope with whatever shit is going down in our life and then end up using them to cope with the stress of having it in the first place.",False,False
