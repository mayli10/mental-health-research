(you can check out my post history for my food logs) I started out eating &lt;600 a day and now I’m eating almost 800. It’s boosted my energy level, my satiety level... so many things are so much better  But I still lost weight throughout the whole process, and that’s because 800 calories still isn’t fundamentally enough for a human, despite what ED brain might tell you",False,False

I just did that 5 min ago :/ Yeah the body loses at weird places that we don't notice at first, it's really difficult to see your own weightloss since you see your body every day.

I know positively that I could add hundreds of cals to what I’m currently eating and I would still lose weight. I’d maintain for a week probably and then it would just be slower. I’ve done it before.   You can try adding extra and see how you go. I expect you’ll be fine in terms of weight, and your body will hopefully feel a little better.",False,False

Anyone will lose/maintain a low weight at anything under ~1000. It’s just time that’s the factor here. At 300 you can’t do anything so I really suggest you up your calories, because you’ll lose anyway, just not as (dangerously) fast",False,False

If you are uw you’ll most likely never be able to eat a satisfactory amount of food to maintain, since your body will always try to get healthy.   If you add 100 cals your equilibrium will start to shift, but not a lot at all. If you’re already maintaining a low weight you’ll start to gain a tiny amount, and if you’re losing right now you’ll just start losing a little slower, until reaching maintenance a tiny bit over what you would have reached at a lower cal routine.",False,False
