Frequently I read r/psychotherapy, and it's extremely troubling to read the many therapist's posts on their lack of education on so many issues.  Many of them w/flair of years in their profession.  Def I'd look for an ED specialist.    I'm sorry this was said to you.",False,False

It goes way beyond body image - its about control among other things, and other involves some sort of trauma.

I‚Äôve just been to two different psychologist visits, honestly everything they said was a trigger for me. Esp when I ask will the meds make me gain weight, they laughed at me.

Like I would be so floored if I heard my therapist say that. Like wtf. Go retake some psych classes my dude because you are bad. You should seriously tell him why everything he said was so wrong, even if it's just in an email.  And then promptly go and find someone else. Maybe he'll be better for the next person, maybe not, but everyone should call out shitty therapists.",False,False

Try another one (if you can) and see if he/she‚Äôs someone you can connect to.
