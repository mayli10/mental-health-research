I got through it by gradually adding instead of going all out at once. This helped me get used to eating more and because i was gradually increasing half the time my brain didn't even see a difference in the amount i was eating (visually, still knew through counting) . I also found doing this helped my stomach adjust to eating more.",False,False

Thatâ€™s my goal at least. ,False,False
