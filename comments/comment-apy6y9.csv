Also, if you're willing to endure a little discomfort there's a certain way you might be able to move your thumb that should allow you to get out of pretty much anything but zip ties. I was bored in the ER once and swapped the hand that little info bracelet they give you was on. It was a lot of effort to do it without ripping it since it's only made of paper, but it was worth it when a doctor checked my right arm first because that's where it's supposed to be. I mean, he did immediately check my left arm because that's just the logical thing to do, but it would have been really fun if he had to leave the room for a bit then come back and noticed it on my right arm after. I'm sure a doctor would be smart enough to realize I was moving it around to mess with him, but there definitely would have been that brief moment of confusion which I totally would have been looking out for and I would just live for such a moment.",False,False
