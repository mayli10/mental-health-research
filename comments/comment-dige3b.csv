I still get a bit of it irl (based on presumptions) because I'm ripped and lean, but when I was underweight, it was fucking CONSTANT, and it make me feel like shit.   The implication that I thought I was better than people who didn't struggle with restriction (lol, no). The implication that I didn't know I had a problem. The implication that I was basically a cult member looking to recruit young girls (FUCK no).   It also most often comes from the people who talk not about labeling people as per their mental health issues... those people always seem to be the first to say, ""an anorexic"" or ""a bulimic"" etc. And work themselves into a righteous rage, like it is ED sufferers who are personally trying to perpetuate the societal conditions that perpetuate EDs.",False,False

They're not mental health professionals and they dont understand EDs. Our brains dont view food and eating the same way so their advice is from the wrong angle. At what point does it go from naiive concern to condescending? People can say ""eat when hungry and stop full"" and pat themselves on the back for helping some 'broken'‚Äã people but it doesnt do anyone any good.",False,False

In real life, when I talk about this shit, I have to preface every statement with ""I know it's unhealthy but...."" Or ""I'm try to recover but...."" Or ""I know all bodies are beautiful but...""  This place has been soooooo healing because I can just talk about what I'm going through with no judgement. An eating disorder is my reality right now. I'm working on this, but it's not gonna change by tomorrow.

What if a person cares for you, worried about you, and asking questions like this, or telling you that what you are doing is unhealthy? what should they do?   You know what you are doing is unhealthy and destructive, but you don't want anyone to do anything about it. You don't want anyone to acknowlege it, you don't want anyone to care. You don't want people to talk to you about unless it is on your very specific terms.    How is that fair? If someone came up to you and said ""I want you to watch me hurt myself willingly, and I will destroy you if you try to stop me."" how is that a good thing? Wouldn;t you want to try and help them even if you haven't had the exact same experience?   I understand that you don't want to be a zoo animal, no one does. But people legitimately care about you, and asking these questions is often how people are showing concern for your wellbeing.   Look. I get it, I am Anorexic. I am very sensitive when people notice when I am eating, not eating, being disordered, being ordered. Whatever. But I also know that this is my ED brain, and that I think WAY more than a non-ED person does. I also do not read minds, I cannot know what other people are thinking, or their backgrounds. Especially online.   I get that this is a rant, but at the same time, I think it is dangerous to just blow off anyone who asks questions out of concern.   &amp;#x200B;  take care.",False,False
