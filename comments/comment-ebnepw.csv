I do think I need to educate myself a bit more on how the body actually works and develops so thank you.          As for the timings though.... do you find it difficult then because the distance youâ€™ve run will then go into 4. (However much further youâ€™ve run in the additional 6 minutes).  That must be really hard ðŸ™ƒ,False,True

If you exercise everyday, you arenâ€™t giving your body proper time to recover (I.e build muscle). This is why people must have rest days if they want to get bigger. also the bigger steps you take, the more resistance you have which forces your body to keep up with the strength and again.. build muscle.  I eat high carb, low protein (opposite of Keto) when Iâ€™m weight training because I am exercising to get physically stronger BUT also to stay smaller. I also must end exercise on an aesthetically pleasing number. If I run for 4 miles but the time says 34 minutes, Iâ€™m going stay on the treadmill until 40 minutes.",False,False

The only time I will is after Iâ€™ve binged (after doing 90 minutes of cardio to burn it off ofc) because Iâ€™m convinced I can convert the fat to muscle in one 20 minute weight session kms,False,False
