Even just having the pressure taken off yourself. Plus the safety of medical monitoring,False,False

My family is calling the impatient center tomorrow to get any info they can for me to up my calories on my own and that is what they finally agreed on letting me do since they can't force me into impatient because of my age. Thank you so much for this comment and your kindness i appreciate it so much. All this info is so helpful,False,True

If youâ€™re not currently open to inpatient, having the outpatient supervision of a doctor and dietitian would be extremely valuable, and possibly lifesaving. Though finding a provider amenable to outpatient treatment with a BMI that low might take a little work. There are very real reasons hospital stabilization is recommended when severely underweight.    I recovered at home as a teenager when my BMI was â€˜onlyâ€™ 16 and my doctor was not thrilled even at that much lower level of risk than what youâ€™re facing. I was so grateful at the time that my parents argued on my behalf to let me try at home, but looking back I wish I had gone a more supported route. Doing it on my own was still traumatic in some ways...and while I managed to gain weight back it was done in mentally unhealthy ways. I also learned no tools for dealing with the thoughts and emotions that fueled my ED. Iâ€™ve spent most of my adult life in agony because of that lack. Only now in my 30s am I finally learning how to live in a more effective way, and only after pretty much burning my life to the ground.   I know seeking professional support probably is not an appealing answer. But itâ€™s going to be a pretty challenging period of time no matter what, and having some good providers supporting you could potentially dramatically improve the outcome. I hope youâ€™ll find a safe path forward and I hope your family will provide love and support along the way &lt;3",False,False

If we were stable, then after a week they increased our meals to full size.   I really suggest that you at least consider doing this in consultation with a doctor and/or dietitian. It could be very dangerous for you.",False,False

Especially in your case. I think you should slowly warm up to going inpatient so you can do right by you. I know you want to get better and you deserve to. If you had a broken leg, youâ€™d go see a doctor for it. This is no different. I wish you all the luck with recovery and am sending so much love for you.",False,False

You wouldnâ€™t want to get refeeding syndrome.   Start with increasing your caloric intake by 200-300.  Avoid refined carbs and load up on proteins and fats.    Then once you have gained a bit and you start feeling your hunger come back, you can usually up it to around 2,000 calories, which is the standard for weight gain.  Then you can incorporate more carbs back in as your body will safely switch from fat metabolism to carb metabolism.  I am just pulling from medical guidelines I have seen used. Hope this helps.",False,False
