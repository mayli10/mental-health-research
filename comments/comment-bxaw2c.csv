I am hoping I didn’t encourage these thoughts for her. I don’t know why she would have said those things. I will talk to her about it in depth later.",False,True

I brought her a croissant at work once and she was so happy and devoured it comfortably, she eats dessert almost every night. She is very skinny though. I don’t think she has an eating disorder but she definitely has dysmorphia. That didn’t really present itself till now, we’ve been dating for 4 months now. I’m praying that my weird behaviors didn’t influence her.....",False,True

If you feel that you have it in you it might be helpful to try to remain supportive and to keep reminding her that her body dysmorphia is lying to her and that she actually looks amazing. I just got back to a healthy weight for the first time in years myself, so I know how stressful this can be. I think it's important to support loved ones when you can though. If it's too much for you than by all means step away because you can't help others when you're not well yourself, but if you think you can manage it's always good to help the people you care about through their struggles.",False,False
