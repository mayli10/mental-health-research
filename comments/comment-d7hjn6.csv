Its getting bad. To the point where today I realized i hadnt drank any water AT ALL instead i drank diet coke and dr.pepper and then bought a Rockstar at the store in the middle of the night.

Helps it last a bit longer.   I try to only stack once a day and make sure I take a break from it for a few days to a week so I don‚Äôt build a tolerance from the ephedrine or rely on it to the point that not having it magnifies hunger like withdrawals.   I build tolerances hella fast, personally. Even meds like vyvanse and adderall I‚Äôd have to up pretty quickly to keep effective.

Before puberty, one sip of coffee buzzed me to the point of physical discomfort, which I think is unusual. But by 13 my tolerance shifted, and then when I started drinking coffee regularly, I built up a tolerance quite quickly. tbh I only drink coffee for the taste; the caffeine doesn't do much anymore. It helps my ADHD slightly, but that's about it.   If you do want to build up a tolerance, you might want to titrate the dose. Like, definitely don't drink a whole energy drink at once! Have a sip or two and then stop and put it in the fridge. Come back to it later, or even the next day.",False,False
