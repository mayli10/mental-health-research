I donâ€™t know the ratios theyâ€™ll use, but Iâ€™d recommend looking for these ingredients on MFP and guess based on that: dark soy sauce (maybe 1-2 tbsp), light soy sauce (ditto), fish sauce/oyster sauce (not a lot - these arenâ€™t too hi cal either) sesame oil (small amount - maybe 1 or 2 tsp?), chili (just a touch), a bit of veg oil (for frying, maybe a tbsp?).  Again Iâ€™m not rock solid on ratios but itâ€™s within the ballpark and those will be the major players in the sauce for sure.   When I do this at home itâ€™s not bad! I can fill a plate with brown rice and a bunch of veggies &amp; chicken for ~400.   Ask for the rice on the side, and if you eyeball the veg, meat, and rice you can get pretty close. Itâ€™s a safe bet. ",False,False
