I'm also struggling with relapse after a traumatic breakup (he was an alcoholic who was starting to mix alcohol and amphetamines together, culminating in him becoming verbally abusive to me in a room full of our friends and having to be physically restrained). Your story is incredibly inspiring and I hope I can soon reach the point where you're at today. Sending you much love and strength ❤",False,False
