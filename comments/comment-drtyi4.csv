I usually have a container of bone broth in my fridge made from chicken bones and leftover veg scraps. If you put a little time into it just the plain broth can be super tasty and full of protein and collagen. If you refrigerate it the fat will rise to the top and you can scoop it out no problem.   Blended carrot soups are supper tastey. Or pumpkin soups. All you have to do is roast up the veg blend and add hot water with bullion or stock, some salt and pepper and maybe some green onions on top. You said you like ginger which is awesome in both.",False,False

Just take some onions and garlic and sauté them lightly in a pot. Then add like 1 small-ish Head of chopped up cauliflower, broth, seasonings you like (and maybe a handful of spinach if you like it) put a lid on it and let it cook until the veggies are soft. Then throw it in a blender/ mix it with an immersion blender and you’re done.  If you can spare some more cals you could also add 1 or 2 small chopped potatoes to make it a little more filling, but it’s good without as well",False,False

I just made an Asian ginger broth and threw a few pieces of tofu in it with some green onion. Miso is definitely next on my list!,False,True
