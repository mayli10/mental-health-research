Things like water retention when you're restricting can prevent the scale from moving. I dont believe in ""starvation mode"" as broscience explains it but day to day weight fluctuations and stalls come from somewhere. That's just physics.  Because it takes patience no matter what speed you try to lose at, think about adding some more calories, especially from healthy things like protein, veggies (fiber), and healthy fats so that your body has the resources it needs to relax and let you lose the weight you want to.  Are you talking to a therapist, or anyone else in your life that you trust, about your weight loss goals?",False,False
