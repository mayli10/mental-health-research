It is kind of rude to judge someone who tries to gain weight but still does cardio/moves around a lot. Not everyone moves around to lose weight only - some people actually ***love*** to exercise and move around a lot, they absolutely ***need it***, and might feel lethargic if they don't. This person was a good example of that! They were just trying to shed light on this issue and told us how they personally struggle with this. It's PERFECTLY acceptable to want to lose weight but still want to be extremely active, and therefore struggle with gaining weight.  For many of us who struggle with EDs, it is very hard and stressful to eat large amounts of foods. So for me, it's 100% understandable that the commenter and other people like them struggle with gaining - of course, when they're active but find it hard to eat due to their ED they won't gain weight. They might actually lose it because they're always on a deficit. It's not THEIR fault though - they might want to gain weight from the bottom of their heart but cannot because of their disorder. It's actually kind of shitty of you to judge them this way and hint that they're being toxic by telling us about their struggle (which is 100% real).   Just because we are so obsessed with losing weight, do we have to be so blind and judging towards those that want to gain it? I know that some people say things like ""aw I find it SO hard to gain weight :((( I eat SOOOOO MUCH but I have fast metabolism I guess :((((((( oh no:(("" on purpose and to hurt others or make them jealous, but OP wasn't even doing that, they were genuinely trying to explain why some people might want to gain weight but still remain very active. Some (few) people on this sub can be so mean sometimes.",False,False
