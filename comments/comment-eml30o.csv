The first time I did it, I let the negative diet mindset take over and I would binge on both ends of a fast. I ended up putting on 10kgs after my first foray into IF. So I gave up for a while.  Now I'm into my second go at it and I'm doing it properly. And I'm losing weight now. I'm controlling my cravings better and I feel better. So far I've lost a small amount of weight. I find I'm not hungry in the mornings, so IF is good fit for me.",False,False

I did IF for a few months two years ago. It started as “I’ll only eat a decently sized lunch”. That quickly turned into “I’ll only eat a 1200 calorie lunch”, which then turned into a sub 1000 calorie lunch. Before I knew it, I was eating less than 1000 calories every two or three days, while also walking for four hours a day",False,False

For me it helped when I was in recovery mode sometimes because feeling full triggers my binges so I was able to sort of reset my body and listen to my hunger cues, but I was in recovery mode. But when I did it to try to lose weight it triggered some of my worst binges and then I totally regretted it every single time. I tried tricking myself sometime and it failed. So again it helped me in recovery (trying to eat a normal amount) and fucked me over hard if I tried to do it to restrict",False,False
