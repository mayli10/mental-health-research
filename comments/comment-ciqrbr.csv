I dislike when people force that body positivity stuff by posting unflattering pictures and shoving their body love in my face. It just feels like they’re trying to convince themselves and I when in reality none of that is necessary. You don’t have to love how you look but you do have to treat that body and mind right so you can have a better quality of life.,False,False

I'm aiming more for body neutrality than body acceptance though I think.  One exercise that my psychologist has me do is look in the mirror and mentally take a step back and look at my body as a whole rather than individual parts and this has been so helpful.,False,False

I avoid and block all What I Eat In A Day/DayIn My Life/Self Care or any body conscious related videos because I know I will compare myself and that hasn’t helped me one bit.,False,False

There are some really great body-positive activists, singers, actors, etc, too!",False,False

Not with my ""ideal"", but exactly like me or thicker than me, but with the same proportions. Because if she can be beautiful, maybe I can too.",False,False
