I felt so self conscious with the shorts, but they are pretty comfortable. I might ask him to buy me another pair before summer is over. The ones he got me are very lightweight material. I’m thinking something heavier will help.   He’s actually very responsible in his drinking. I wouldn’t have taken any if I thought otherwise or felt unsafe with him. He made sure I had eaten and drank enough water, and he took care of some stuff that I normally do. He’ll even play my stupid phone games for me to make sure I get my daily rewards, haha. He doesn’t always get things, but he tries really hard and it’s evident by his actions that he cares.",False,True
