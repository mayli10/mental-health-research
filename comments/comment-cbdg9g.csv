I'm sure your mum speaks from a place of concern but she lacks the unawareness of how it triggers you. maybe bridging this gap will ease things out a bit  recovery can seem really daunting and its hard. there's no sugar coating that. but I will say is that I hope that you can start recovery as soon as possible, whether it be living at home or when you're independent. because regardless of what the disorder tells you, you deserve it 💜",False,False

She’s only concerned about my b/ping because it destroys your “insides” as she puts it, meaning the esophagus, gums, and teeth. She’s seen my gums when I had some pretty bad acid burns from aggressively using baking soda to try and combat the acid and I think that scared her.   I’m hoping to take control of my life once I move out (control that I feel like I’ve never had and will never have under my parents’ roof because they told me as much). But I’m scared that being independent will make my ED get worse. I’ll be able to eat as much or little when I want. But I could also choose recovery. It’s all so much to think about and it’s exhausting tbh but what else can you do?",False,True

I swear we must have the same Asian mums. my parents always subtlety trigger me too, whether it be praise for how little I eat or how much weight I've lost. but in your case it seems that your mum is aware of your disorder yet still makes those comments, and that's absolutely awful. Asian culture's fixation on thinness is so toxic  personally when I first recovered (I'm in a relapse rn unfortunately) it happened when I we at university and completely out of that environment. maybe looking into moving out would help?",False,False
