It's okay, sometimes we get stuck in despair with our EDs.  Sometimes I can't tell up from down.  You're going to be okay.",False,False

Sometimes we lose it when we drop below certain thresholds, sometimes we don't.  I'm a fair bit below what's normal and mine was just last week.  Just remember that period or not, your feelings are valid, you're still struggling, and the cyclical bleed makes everyone feel yucky and gross.  You should treat yourself to a hot water bottle, blankets, comfy clothes and a warm drink.  What about some fruit tea?   Feel better soon and remember that having your period doesn't mean you aren't struggling.",False,False
