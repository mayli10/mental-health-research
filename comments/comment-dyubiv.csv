Do you mean you tried doing what you dreamed of doing, but because of the disorder and never being where you want weight-wise during the duration, you still ended up miserable, correct?",False,True

I decided to force myself to live, and gather cool stories I can tell people when I’m old.  The tragedy was, I had no idea this whole time I was being a fucking clown and just making rules lol.  Now I feel like I wasted my adventures feeling sick, couldn’t drink cause I can’t hold down any alcohol anymore, traveling has a huge food focus, it’s really taken a toll on me.   I spent 7 years unemployed and with no reliable source of income, finally having enough to live out my dream when I thought I would never be able to, and then still not being happy? Doing this made me suicidal, cause now I’m terrified of the idea that I will never be happy.",False,False

If anything, it proved to me that I must get to my goal weight asap because I always felt gross. Always felt ""I'd feel better and be able to take pics for memories if I was really thin"". Feeling self-conscious, out of shape, awkward.... all of it caused people to react to me how I'd suspect them to. People treated me so different when I was thin- like tiny underweight bmi thin :( getting bigger ruined literally everything, and it's not all in my head.  I'm so sorry",False,True

I can't live when I'm this size. I cant get the hairstyle I want till I've lost weight. I cant wear the clothes I want.. I cant enjoy moments and capture them on video. I cant upload pictures. I cant be excited to see old friends In fear of them seeing the weight gain. I cant enjoy holidays for not being able to chuck on a swim suit and chill out. I cant stand still with out worrying at what angle people will see me at. All of this hinders my live and I can live, truly live when I've lost weight",False,False
