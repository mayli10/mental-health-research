For what it's worth, it's one of the safest surgeries you can get.  I know they inevitably already told you that, though.  **I chose this because hospitals are my worst PTSD trigger, ignored sound medical advice, and you really should get the surgery:** but for what it's worth, I fixed the issue, without surgery, by stabilizing my weight and avoiding foods with fat for a while.  It's an alternative that worked for me and eliminated the need for surgery, so I do want to throw it out. I've heard about enough complications from other people that I don't regret my choice, but I don't presume my situation goes for everyone either.",False,False

My first surgery was getting my gallbladder removed and it was minimally invasive. I did actually wake up part way through because I have a genetic tolerance to anesthesia.   It really is just like u/DelicateBones said. You come to a fuzzy awareness, realize you're not done yet and fall back asleep. This is because you have an anesthesiologist behind your head measuring and giving more meds based off of your heart rate readings. You have nothing to fear.",False,False

And remember that people have to get their gallbladder removed for tooonnns of reasons. It‚Äôs almost as common as appendectomies! So don‚Äôt be embarrassed. I know it‚Äôs scary, but you‚Äôre going to be just fine. And hopefully they give you the good drugs for recovery. üòâ  Also, if it makes you feel any better at all. I once woke up in the middle of a surgery, and I know another girl who did as well. I saw people hovering above me, didn‚Äôt feel a damn thing, and just thought to myself, ‚Äúwhoops, they‚Äôre not done yet, better go back to sleep.‚Äù And I was out again. Didn‚Äôt see anything traumatic, everything was relatively fuzzy, and I was able to just be back under in half a second. The other girl had the same experience with waking up mid procedure.  You‚Äôll do great. üòò‚ô•Ô∏è",False,False
