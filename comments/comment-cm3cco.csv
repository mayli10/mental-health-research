If you don't really pay any attention to what you're eating at all, then they're fine, because you don't need them to taste amazing if you don't care about the calories. They can just be a plain, crunchy plate that you top with tastier things, use to eat dip, or just enjoy for the texture when mindlessly snacking, etc.  Then if you start caring about calories, as a non-disordered person, rice cakes often aren't worth it as much because they don't have much of a taste to them, so when you're budgeting all your calories, you'd rather have something that was maybe a bit higher in calories but was more satisfying, more flavourful, etc. In short, you're not going to eat something that isn't worth the calories.  Then you get to the restrictive end of the bell curve and you're suddenly on board with corn thins again, because you're prioritising calories over taste. Suddenly they are the lowest-calorie per volume alternative to things like bread, wraps, or crackers, so they become your base for sandwiches, dips, spreads, etc. and now they're your best friend again, lmao.  In any case, I encourage people who have a 10cal leeway to look into corn thins instead of rice cakes/rice thins. Corn thins are my go-to base for PB powder and sugar-free jelly.",False,False
