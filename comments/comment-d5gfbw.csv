We’re obviously hyper aware of our appearance and minor fluctuations in how we look, but most people are not paying that close of attention to how you look and most still wouldn’t be able to tell specifically that you are more that day even if they were paying attention to you. I remember going to hang out with a friend who also has an ED and she admitted to me that she had binged (and not purged) right before I picked her up and I would never have guessed had she not said anything because I couldn’t tell at all. She really didn’t look any different than usual. This definitely helped me feel more assured that it’s not as noticeable to others as it feels to us in the moment.",False,False

Sometimes just not being hungry for whatever reason makes me feel like I’m gaining because to be losing I ‘have’ to be hungry,False,False
