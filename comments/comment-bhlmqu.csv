Those meds messed me up. Zoloft nearly made me hemorrhage to death on one of my periods, Abilify made me have 3 times the normal amount of prolactin a regular 16 year old should have. I went from size B to D in a month (With deep, red, tiger stripe stretch marks), and lactated a cheese like substance. I have to take birth control because the meds permanently messed up my hormones. Abilify made me suicidal.",False,False
