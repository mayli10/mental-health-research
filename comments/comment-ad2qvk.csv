It’s a tool to help you achieve weight loss.  If your psyche towards food doesn’t change, your food choices do not change and you don’t exercise the surgery will be for nothing.  It is life changing.  The way you can drink changes.  Small sips of liquids very frequently, no drinking at least 1/2 hour before eating, no drinking during eating and no drinking at least 1/2 hour after eating. Food tolerance can be an issue.  I’m not just talking junk food I’m talking meat, dairy, carbs. And vomiting after surgery is actually gut wrenching.  Hurts more than anything I felt before. And is a life altering decision ",False,False

Over 25 years my ED brain conditioned me to regard „40% full“ with „completely full“ and conditioned „hungry“ to a a baseline i should be experiencing six times a day.

I've watched 600 lb life many times and wished I could have them give me the surgery. Similar to how stimulants can make weight loss less stressful by taking away your appetite, but it would be cool to not have to take a pill every day and just naturally stop feeling hungry sooner. I've also thought about other fantasy ways of not gaining weight:  If there were calorie free versions of every food like Diet Coke v Regular Coke but like Diet Pizza Hut v Regular Pizza Hut. If weight correlated to something other than eating, like the amount you slept. If all the fatty, greasy, sugary, salty foods were the low cal healthy foods and broccoli and cauliflower (my least favorite veggies) were what made you fat. If just in general you could eat until you were full and satisfied and everyone was the same weight. If everyone could choose their weight like choosing a hairstyle. ",False,False
