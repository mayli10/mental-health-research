I might apply to more. I'm kind of hesitant because I think I'm not getting a response from the first one because I'd have to go off seizure medication and be able to transport myself to their clinic, which I can't do if I'm unmedicated. I don't know how I'd afford travel to a clinical trial or where you stay during them either.   I've tried Marijuana and CBD oil. I received the CBD oil as a gift. It helps with physical pain. It does not help with appetite or obsessive thoughts. I use marijuana at night to help increase intake/decrease obsessive thoughts if it's offered to me by my partner, but I'm not able to afford it. It does slow me down and isn't something I would use during the day because it isn't mine and I wouldn't be doing anything productive.   I know I have conditions that qualify for medical Marijuana in my state. I can't afford the cost of the examination needed to get a medical card or the cost of the card, both of which have to be renewed annually in addition to purchasing the MMJ product that you need.",False,False

Cannabis has helped me through a lot of my deepest depressions. It helps curb any obsessive thoughts, helps my self esteem and self compassion, and it helps my appetite. I hesitate to just suggest cannabis for everyone but I think where other medications have failed it can be useful. When used medicinally it would be better to do so under the supervision of a medical professional in the field.",False,False

I've been depressed for 20 years now and tried 45 different medications. Some of them I've tried up to 3 different times at different ages with worsening responses like suicidality. I had a partial positive response to Prozac the first time, the second time it pooped put and led to suicidality. The third time a dose of 20mg blocked all positive and neutral feelings. I felt zombie like except that I still experienced depression and all negative feelings very intensely. Reduced to 10mg I am still very depressed, can feel neutral and negative. Experiencing a positive feeling is very rare. I don't know that I would feel different not taking the 10mg.   I have no idea how to get out of depression. I tried different therapies like CBT and DBT also.",False,False
