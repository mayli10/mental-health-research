She said that it was probably a tear and that if it happened again to go the hospital. As others here have said, try to go as long as you can to let your body heal - I know it can be so hard to practice harm reduction sometimes ðŸ’•",False,False

The tear could reopen and if you don't die from it rupturing and blood loss you could get an infection that could lead to sepsis. I think you should see a doctor asap.,False,False

I shoot for three days, and it's always been good after that for me but my plan in place is if it bleeds again then I'd give it a week. But I'm no doctor and have no science behind it, three days just felt like a reasonable time.",False,False
