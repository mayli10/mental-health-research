I generally try to get 15-25 reps of each movement but the breakdown of reps and sets depends on the exercise and goal.   Example lower body: 1. Sumo deadlift 5x5xheavy weight 2. BB hip thrust 3x8xmoderate weight 3. KB stiff leg deadlift 2x12xlight weight 4. Walking lunges 1x25xlight weight  Example upper body: 1. Push-ups/pullups 4x6xbw 2. Bench press 5x5 heavy 3. Row 3x8xmoderate  4. Shoulder press 2x12xmoderate 5. Lat pull down 2x12xlight  I keep the same structure but change up the exercises throughout the week (ie sumo deadlift can be replaced by conventional deadlift, bench press can be replaced by db or machine press etc)  Rep schemes also depend on your goal, I'm trying to maintain muscle and strength. If your goals are different your workouts should be too. Basic guidelines are reps under 5 are for strength, 8-12 are for muscle building, and over 12 is endurance.",False,False

Im also thinking of stopping the low restricting so I can have enough energy to exercise even on my (high-ish) restricting days.

Honestly it took me only 2 months to be really happy with my plan :) but it‚Äôs always a work in progress.   If I had a day where I could eat anything I wanted with no caloric consequences I still think it would be hard to hit 100 g. of protein! That‚Äôs hard! So don‚Äôt worry I never get that high ;) a high day for me would be 70 g. probably and that would be a non restricting day.   I have heard lots of mixed information about protein intake but I feel like 45 is what I have gathered personally for my height (5‚Äô3) and age (21 F) to be best. :)   Awe, thank you!

It has a list of days and what I do on each day. Then I have below that, a list of what each workout actually consists of for it. I have an iphone it lets you do this open circle in the notes that you can click on to check mark and as I‚Äôm working out I do that. Next to all my exercises I have the date I added them or increased them and how much weight.   It sounds like a lot but it seriously helped me get organized and serious about the gym   Sample:  Monday: Legs Legs:  ‚Ä¢Goblet squats,  30 pounds (upped Oct. 12) ‚Ä¢Lunges.... etc.   It is extremely difficult to eat 100 g. of protein a day. Especially if you are restrictive about calories and also want to maintain micronutrition. I aim for 45 g. a day and I have been building muscle and strength with this. Don‚Äôt worry about nut too much, they have a lot of fat for the protein ratio. I use them as a fat source. Also, I understand with fruit! Berries are a safe food for me because they‚Äôre 100 calories per little box. I know apples and other fruit are pretty close too but berries feel especially worth it.   Best luck with whatever you do. :) this is just what I do not me trying to correct your plan at all. I think what you‚Äôre doing sounds great! Everyone‚Äôs body is different and different things cause is to binge or feel bad so you should continue developing your plan. :)   I find what helps me most with maintaining my plan is being flexible. Sometimes I go to the gym 3 times a week. Sometimes I eat more processed and frozen meals. It‚Äôs cyclical really. Right now I am sharing my current plan and it‚Äôs probably at it‚Äôs ideal atm but it isn‚Äôt always here.   I also utilize having a tier of safe foods. I have my forever safe foods and then I have foods that I consider kind of safe like lattes. I will have stuff from that category when I am getting strained by my restriction. I‚Äôll also allow myself to skip gym days because sometimes it‚Äôs too forced.",False,False

You don't need much protein to build muscle and when you're a noob you don't need a surplus either. Muscle building is just about damaging the muscle and rebuilding it. If you're getting stronger you're building muscle. Don't need more than 100cals extra a day if you're female.,False,False

After all the comments tho ill def make a detailed plan for what I want to do.  I dont think I get enough protein yet. Not even 100g a day when I don't work out. Mostly from. Tuna, protein powder, protein yogurt and chicken/meat. I never eat nuts and am picky with fruits sometimes too.  A lot of my safae foods are high in calorie and low in nutrition ironically. I sont mind eating higher calories if it' s something im used too but I think it's stopping me from really living up to my potential.  My meals mostly consist of 1(or 2) big big meals., and then just snacks, protein powder, coffee or protein yoghurts.   I had some very good days diet and exercise wise but I find it hard to keep up the routine after a while. Especially when im feeling really down or particularly anxious.

I used to run a lot but I hurt my illiotibial band so I switched to weightlifting.   I restrict but eat the same amount on days I lift and days I don‚Äôt. However, I break up my meals differently. I will eat 3 meals that are slightly larger on non lifting days and 4 on lifting days (so I can do one before and one after. I lift 4-6 days a week right now.   Normally I try to lift heavy sets of 10 reps. So 3x10 of each exercise, about 6 types of exercises per lower body day and about 8 per upper body day. I do the following days: -Chest/Shoulders -Legs -Back/Biceps -Glutes (And stretching each time I go to the gym)  Right now I am doing a lower body and an upper body together each time I go to the gym and I go 2-3 times a week. It‚Äôs not too much harder (physically) to combine them into one day than to spread them out. I used to do them in a cycle of arms, legs, rest, repeat but I haven‚Äôt had as much time lately.   Nutritionally, I try to eat only healthy food. To me that‚Äôs high protein, fresh veggies and fruit (or cooked veggies), and I also don‚Äôt mind including fat and that and spices are my main forms of flavor enhancement. I don‚Äôt often use protein powders (maybe 3 times a week) because I try to focus on beans, veggie meat, yogurt or tofu so I can incorporate a bit more variety and hopefully some micronutrients format the beans.  I pretty much always have yogurt for breakfast for the protein and before the gym I‚Äôll usually have an apple as part of my snack for the carbs.   Go for carbs before a workout! It will fuel you. Protein you can consume at any point in the day to reap muscle building benefits from. It doesn‚Äôt have to be directly after a workout. If you workout in the evening and don‚Äôt want to eat after, you even can get that protein earlier in the day or the next morning.   I can give you more details if you are curious about anything. I am really interested in this post and will be checking back later to see what other have said because I am really interested as well!",False,False
