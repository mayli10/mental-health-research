I've known diabetic people that use it as well, since a large soda from the movies that isn't actually diet could literally kill them.",False,False

Maybe I'm paranoid but I don't trust that I'm getting the right soda or that the machines are clean. Gimme all the cans/bottles of diet Coke tho,False,False

I‚Äôm still overweight so the cunt behind the counter basically looked me up and down was like ‚Äúwhy do you care?‚Äù. So I freaked out and started screaming about how she was trying to kill me. In the end, an old lady ended up comforting me and I lied and said I was diabetic when really I‚Äôm just insane and have ED brain. Not my proudest moment.   Those machines freak me out too though. I think I read somewhere that the flavoring adds 10 calories per serving? I adore the diet orange cream soda but sometimes it tastes so sweet/syrup-y that it scares me.",False,False

I got freaked out recently because the lady at the pub I go to sometimes was talking to my friend (a regular, it's next to his work) and saying sorry that she accidentally gave him regular coke instead of diet yesterday in his rum and coke....that was just her mistake so I am still comfortable getting my own, but I get worried now when someone else pours it for me.",False,False

If it's non-diet it will be VERY sticky. Hopefully that can help you enjoy the next movie more :)",False,False

Even worse, it's by the drive-thru window facing away from me so I can't see which button they're pressing.
