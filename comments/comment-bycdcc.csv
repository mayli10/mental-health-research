I feel like every time I talk to my bf it’s me crying about how he doesn’t understand what I’m going through and him with a permanently confused face,False,False

My boyfriend is a sweetheart and tries to be supportive but whenever I try bringing up my crippling depression or eating issues, he's like ""you gotta do something about it, you can't just sit there and let it happen and keep suffering without doing anything about it""  I'm between therapists and meds because I've been dealing with all this for 15 years and nothing has changed and I'm just feeling sort of existential, like maybe I need to figure something else out that at doesn't have to do with therapy or antidepressants because in 15 years I've been on at least 20 different medications and even found great therapists I visited weekly for months or years on end, and it still didn't help.   I'm at a loss, so I'm trying to regain my footing and occasionally try to go to him to vent and I think hes okay with it, he just thinks I'm stagnant and don't want to fix anything.   People who don't have mental illness don't seem to really understand how difficult it all is. They don't understand that if you're getting help, it doesn't magically get fixed,  or if you aren't getting help, it isn't because you want to be fucked up forever, you just don't know how to process or handle it or whatever else.   It is very hard being in a relationship when you're suffering.   I don't know your boyfriend but I would suggest maybe talking to him about it, and seeing what he has to say and how he is feeling. Sometimes the annoyance and exasperation stems from fear and a feeling of helplessness.",False,False
