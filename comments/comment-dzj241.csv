Only when I'm wearing pants or tights do I not mind my legs.",False,True

I have thick ankles as well, or at least they look very big to me just like my calves and thighs.   I also don't gain weight on my midsection, it's always been on the flat side. So at least there's that. But that comes with a flat chest as well :'o  As someone who's already less, even though it's just by a minisucle amount, than 17.5 on the bmi scale I'm afraid my legs will always look this big.",False,True

I see girls who are the same weight as me but they have really nice legs.. I perpetually have fat around my knees and my legs are not toned at all although I still have a fair amount of muscle from lifting weights. It’s weird because I also have thick bone structure on my lower body, like big feet, thick ankles, thick knees, and wide hips for my height. I can’t change those parts of my but at least I know I can lose the fat. But I feel like I have to be really underweight to have a nice body, like I can’t be lean like other girls at a higher weight. I just get bulkier and fatter looking. My only consolation is I don’t gain weight on my midsection easily. So right now I’m trying to get to a BMI of 17.5ish.",False,False
