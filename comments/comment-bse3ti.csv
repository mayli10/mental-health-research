Omfg, especially to the last bit. I run varsity xc and track for my school, but Iâ€™m not skinny and honestly probably look the same as I did pre-ED. I worked out with my friend the other day, and she said that I was fit and I felt like a joke.",False,False

I think about food constantly and have so much self hatred but people think I'm just trying to get that 'bikini body' by exercising and I just like cookies too much.  I'm a normal weight despite all the calorie counting, fasting, binging, purging, exercising etc. And I'm wasting so much mental energy on this.   I feel like that meme ' Body type: Not terrible but definitely enjoys pasta'   I run 40km a week...I should not be this weight. Most people would lose weight running this far. I feel like a joke when my friends call me 'healthy'.",False,False
