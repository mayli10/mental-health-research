I was a competitive powerlifter and now I do crossfit. Lifting is what essentially helped me ""recover"" from disordered eating in undergrad. However, now I live in this bizarro world where I kill myself at the gym and then continue to repeat a squirrely cycle of fasting because I want to be thin again, binging because my workouts leave me starving, eating only protein shakes because GAINS, eating only junk food because I can, etc. Nothing makes sense. Also, I firmly believe that the whole bodybuilding/lifting culture is hugely disordered.",False,False

I try to be as consistent in the gym as possible to keep the fitness goal stronger then the ED one. But any external force moves the balance.   Also I think very often I approach the goal of a fit body with a same ill mentality that consumes my energy and makes me feel guilty of eating something and guilt of skip the gym even when I am dead sick.

I'd fast or have 500 kcal if I were training/going to class, but my endurance was garbage. That led me to switch to binge/purge cycles which have thankfully stopped after therapy. Racking up $250 on grubhub in a month and having my mom read off each item was a humiliating and sobering experience.  Now I'm faced with the struggle of accepting a strong body with big lats instead of the light, frail, feathery body I had and not too long ago suffered to try and maintain. Some days are better than others, but when I'm stressed out my dysmorphia kicks up and I have to learn to trust what my fiance and loved ones say instead of the mirror. I'm starting to believe them, but a lot of the time I cry about it instead while thinking they're crazy for saying nice things about this big triangular body and then keep busy so I can stop thinking about it or watch professional aerialists videos on youtube to remember why I chose to look like she-hulk.",False,False
