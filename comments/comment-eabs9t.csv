But I made meatballs with beef and some bacon and stock from some chicken my girlfriend made. And it was fucking wonderful. I had company over and made my friends have a bowl. I for sure will make again and make some lazy pasta. I love cooking and making the meatballs and the stock and the chopping  was very relaxing  a evening. I’ve been in kinda a bad place and making good heathyish food for my friends makes me so happy.   Idk I got drunk with said friends because all I ate was soup today (another advertisement for it?) and I really enjoyed it. The vegan/ vegetarian/GF versions of it do seem really good too. Although pasta is iffy",False,False
