After I got home from work he took me to our bed to cuddle in the dark and asked if I wanted to talk more about it, and I didn’t, but he just assured me I was doing great and he was proud of me. It really made me feel so much better. Being so upfront and open about my issues is terrifying but I’m glad I could do it and I definitely am better today❤️",False,True

I’m doing a lot better today, and I appreciate this :)",False,True
