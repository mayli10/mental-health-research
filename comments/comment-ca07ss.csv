I had my other one for years and wanted a fresh start.   I'm not sure why you're so intent on invalidating me and doing digging, it's not that deep, a personal post on a subreddit is not ""right or wrong"", there is nothing to debunk, there is no 'thesis' lol just me talking.   I gave examples. I don't think they are gravely unrealistic - it makes sense why a thin person with an ED would get upset at a bigger person with an ED saying her life/recovery would be easier if she were thin. Because maybe the reader would feel invalidated as a thin person who felt like his/her life sucked.   This post isn't really about fatphobia. If you read my post, it was not so much about blatant fatphobia, it was about not feeling like I have a community in ED-related spaces, online or IRL.   Also, there is a strict no fatphobia rule on this sub so it's not like anyone is going to blatantly say fatphobic things.  I think you aren't really listening or trying to understand how people with different experiences are feeling, and you are kind of validating the point of my post.",False,True

Sure there are people who are overweight because of normal reasons (Heath things, just enjoying lots of food. Etc) but I’m talking about those (myself included in the past) who binge and restrict or have a really messed up relationship with food or developed abnormal eating problems from childhood.

I've struggled with disordered eating throughout my life, mostly binge eating without purging because I started using eating as a maladaptive coping mechanism as a child after traumatic experiences which led me to being morbidly obese for most of my life, but I've also struggled with purging and extreme restriction at many points in my life as well. But because of my very high weight, no one ever seemed to notice or care.  I remember a few summers ago I lost an extreme amount of weight in the span of a couple of months, like at a rate that was only possible to achieve through a horrifically low caloric intake. However, because I was obese when I started and still obese after losing that amount of weight that fast, no one noticed that I would've had to have been barely eating to achieve those kinds of results. It was so triggering because on one hand I loved the encouragement and praise I was receiving from others for my weight loss, but on the other hand I felt like I was dying inside because no one could recognize the absolute hell I was living through day in and day out. (And of course I ended up gaining all of the weight back and more, anyway.)  It's hard because this year I've been trying to lose weight healthily. I've been trying to shift my perspective this time around by having my weight loss be motivated by wanting to care for my body and be compassionate to myself for the first time in my life instead of trying to punish myself out of shame and disgust since the shame and disgust are what always lead me to super low restriction, purging, general food anxiety, etc. Although I've been mostly succeeding in being healthier and more sustainable about my weight loss this time, I still have a lot of disordered thoughts and habits that I've been having to fight through. I feel like I can't discuss these things openly and honestly in regular weight loss communities, but then I also feel like a black sheep in communities that are centered around disordered eating, so I usually end up lurking because I feel like I don't belong. It's just a very isolating experience.",False,False

The one thing I really like about Internet communities is the obvious anonymity that comes with being just a name on a screen. I've personally always felt (and communities like this one reinforce this for me) that EDs are much more similar than they are dissimilar. Whatever your behaviours, the core feelings underlying them are the same/similar.   I foolishly thought that meant that folks who have ""higher"" BMIs (sorry I use that in quotes because I think BMI is such bullshit) would be able to feel welcomed/find support on a community like this. It really fucking sucks that you have not experienced this though :( I recognize that I have thin privilege as I've never been overweight, and my ED usually presents as ""stereotypical"" anorexia, so I have never experienced the things that you talked about. So I can only really truly sympathize, not empathize.  I""m trying to think of ways we could make this community more inclusive.
