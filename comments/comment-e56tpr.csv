Maybe someone would be willing to share healthy measurements with you! Not sure how tall you are but I’m 5’5 and when I’m around 115/120 I get lots of compliments while still being in the healthy weight range and feeling great! My waist is usually about 26 inches :) hope that helps!,False,False

If you want to look good.. this is the wrong sub! If you want to be tight and toned and glowing with health! Eat good and lift heavy and take care of yourself! Most people who really take care of their health have a really nice shape! Good luck :),False,False
