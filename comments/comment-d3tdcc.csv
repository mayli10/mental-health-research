Iâ€™ve had similar thoughts and been in similar horrible situations and have tried to make sense of them.   We have eating disorders for a reason. Weâ€™re coping even if itâ€™s maladaptively and harmful. Drug addicts donâ€™t become drug addicts for no reason. I suppose some do- try for party reasons and get addicted. Just like some people develop EDs because at the beginning, just like partying, they just want to look like x celeb or fit into a dress.   We donâ€™t ever expect to lose control. Addicts donâ€™t either. I often think of myself as an addict- I block emotions and feelings and make myself feel good by starving or purging or over exercising. If I donâ€™t do those things I feel horrible and like Iâ€™m in withdrawal. I have to get my fix.   Itâ€™s a horrible nasty illness. I hope you can reach a better place. But know Iâ€™m right there with you, in the filthy nyc toilet.",False,False
