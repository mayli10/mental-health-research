Isnâ€™t this site meant to connect you to people who share not only interests but struggles and experiences?? Reddit has no idea what they took away from so many people who are already clearly struggling, wanted support love n validation and finally found it. Reddit is supposed to be a place where new ideas, taboo topics, and stigmatized population are welcome. Just like people on here donâ€™t kink shame, donâ€™t fucking shame us for dealing with something we never wanted to deal with. ",False,False

The fact that it was deleted proves the need for it in the first place! These are such stigmatized and alienating illnesses ffs. Itâ€™s hard enough to have to deal with having an ED, but itâ€™s that much harder for the fact that itâ€™s not something you can really talk to people about. That sub was the most refreshing and supportive place Iâ€™ve come across for people struggling with this stuff and itâ€™s hurtful that the reddit overlords just said fuck it",False,False

Voat is a reddit clone that we can use but that site is kinda gross cause it contains a bunch of people who migrated from subreddits that were rightfully banned imo.
