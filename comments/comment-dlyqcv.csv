I think I will tell her even though it is hard.   I fear being told to put my weight loss on hold but at the same time I would understand if it is needed to focus on my mental health first.,False,True

Maybe you can ask her if she could help you come up with a safe and effective way to lose weight *if she agrees you need to for your health*. I dont want to make you feel bad, but it is likely that your body would feel healthier within a typically normal BMI range. If your doctor agrees with that, I'm sure you two could work together on finding a healthy diet and lifestyle change to lose the weight. But you could also work with her on combating disordered thoughts that would make you want to restrict lower than you should or binge eat. It may even be in the best interest of your health to put weight loss on hold and sort through the mental aspect of everything until you are sure you could implement healthy lifestyle and dietary changes that wouldnt spiral back into an eating disorder.   If your doctor is good they will recognize that any disordered eating habits you have cannot continue even if they are helping you lose weight.  Good luck &lt;3",False,False
