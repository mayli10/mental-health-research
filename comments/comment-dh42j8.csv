There are spreadsheets or apps that allows you enter your datas and I think it uses the 3500 kcal = 1 lb rule to know how much your TDEE actually is.   You just need to have 3 weeks of data at least for it to be accurate.   If you don't track (which is good too, people usually don't track), you can always check your online TDEE, try it and if you're still losing weight (because you underestimated your activity level like me lol), increase your daily calorie goal.
