I wouldn’t rely on electrolyte waters because they usually just add electrolytes for taste and it’s not generally enough if you’re working out. ,False,False

If you’re drinking a lot of water but not including electrolytes, that could be part of it too. With calorie counts that low, you might not be getting all the electrolytes you need from your food. Stay safe and grab some Propel or Nuun ",False,False

And keep in mind that any workout more strenuous than usual will cause the same response. I had a really hard workout yesterday and was up 3 pounds on the scale this morning. ,False,False

Your body is probably so used to eating so little now that it’ll bloat on anything. Eating more for a day or so will basically help it release it’s okay and after that it help.

After a particularly hard workout or period of dehydration, you’ll be up like 5 pounds on a scale.   Don’t let water weight fuck with your head too much. Keep drinking water and electrolytes while you work out to avoid that dehydration rebound, and wait for the whoosh. Make sure and get some protein, too, to help your muscles recover. ",False,False
