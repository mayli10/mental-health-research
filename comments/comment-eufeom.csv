See? don‚Äôt you feel better (ik you don‚Äôt but still). It could be sooo much worse. And they can‚Äôt force you to eat. Say you already ate or yeah you fucking hate pizza. Just say you never really liked it. Most important thing my mom ever taught me was that ‚Äúno‚Äù is a sentence. you don‚Äôt ever owe someone an explanation.,False,False

I never really liked it as much as everyone else did but as a kid I would eat it lots because everyone else at school would (pizza day was a thing every month) and sometimes when my parent ordered it after I had a swimming lesson I'd be hungry enough to wayy overeat.

That pizza fear is valid as fuck, and I‚Äôm screaming at your description.  It‚Äôs such a universal fear food/binge food too. Low carb? Fuck pizza. Low fat? Fuck pizza.
