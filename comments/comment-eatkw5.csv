I did actually have a job for a while, and it was everything i'd been working towards, the last big thing i'd been chasing, and it didn't turn out anything like i'd hoped. 2019 was probably the worst year of my life, and now i've moved back home and feel like i'm right back where I started, with nothing to show for it but two lost years. I have no idea what to do now, I feel so stagnant and paralyzed with indecision, and like i've regressed in every aspect of my life. I wanna share this relevant tumblr post:  &gt; [**raiseheaven**](https://raiseheaven.tumblr.com/post/187450413652)**:**   &gt;   &gt; it can be tempting to live your life like a prequel. to live as if you’re setting up your own story.and once you lose the weight, once you have the money, once you graduate school, once you’re in a real relationship, once, once, once. then finally, you’ll begin to live, and everything you do up until that point is some kind of half-life, some unimportant foreword you can skip. don’t do this. inhabit your life completely. sink fully into the wealth of your existence. the power to manifest is in the fearless owning of who you are, so that you can shape where you’re going.   I think happiness for me right now would be improving myself into someone I feel is worthy of loving relationships and connecting with others, and then cultivating that shit. Instead, I spend all my time alone, completely isolated in my room obsessing over my ED. What can ya do lmao  Idk what happiness is for you but I hope you find it (or make it!) dude",False,False

(So mea culpa for my effusions.)  I had a massive crisis after I finished school and started work. I had pushed myself onward on the basis of ""It'll be better when..."" And then suddenly I was, ostensibly, \*there\* but I still felt hollow and lost, and now there was no obvious next step. In desperation I managed to create some. Better with a promotion. Better in grad school. Better with another job in another town. Better with the right boy. The right dog. The right interior decor.  I love a line from early in *The Magicians* (the book)  &gt;""Quentin knew he wasn't happy. Why not? He had painstakingly assembled all the ingredients of happiness. He had performed all the necessary rituals, spoken the words, lit the candles, made the sacrifices. But happiness, like a disobedient spirit, refused to come.""  Eventually I've come to see that I built my life on a deeply flawed foundation. If I believe I'm a bad wrong person who doesn't deserve to have their needs met...well, I'm gonna have a rough time. It's requiring a total re-making of my internal world. I don't aim for happiness really. My goal is to feel contented. To feel useful. I don't know yet what that path will look like. It may well deviate from the job/promotion/$$/house/family that society pushes. I'm learning to be ok with that. To be solid in myself.  And ultimately I'm not sure how to really articulate anything of use so I'll leave a link to a poem by Stephen Dunn that I really like.
