I remember when I was struggeling and didn't want any help and believed that I was healthy. I hated my parents for interveining and our relationship became bad for a while, but thanks to them I am now, many years later, healthy, free from my ED.   I know it must be extremely challenging to try to help your child who suffers from ED. It must be exhausting, terrifying and there will be a lot of frustration. However, I don't understand why her parents doesn't help her, even though it's hard? Maybe they are trying, but I don't understand why they let her keep her social medias the way they are. Often it seems like Cooney likes to show off her body and she has probably a huge following of young girls giving her compliments and people commenting that she is too skinny, which feeds her disorder. Even though she's an adult, she's sick and someone should intervene, not only nutrition wise but also when it comes to social media which probably reinforces her ED. I think it's irresponsible of her parents, even though I know too little about her and her family. She should be in the hospital, and I do believe her social medias should be monitored, even though she's an adult because she's not well. ",False,False

It's so scary. I have a friend who's close to that skinny due to an auto immune disease and poverty and I legit bought all get groceries one month because I was so terrified of how tiny she was getting üôÅ.   I feel so bad for this Eugenia girl. She's got it so bad she's basically in denial that leads to death. I feel like the ones who deny it exists are the ones who are the most at danger of this disorder stealing their lives. ,False,False

I think over the past few months, she has gotten gradually skinnier. Right now is the absolute lowest she has been if comparing to her videos from even like 4 to 5 months ago. Her bones were sticking out but not like right now. I'm guessing she probably is just taking multivitamins and just eating less and less until she...dies I guess.",False,False

She's claimed several times now over the last weeks that she has ""upload video issues"" and that it's the reason she can't upload her video that day. But honestly? I think that's just a cover up because she is probably not strong enough to film and cut a video at that time. There is no way in hell she could work like a normal Youtuber on her content with a fully depleted energy reserve. Seems to me like bluntly lying to her followers tbh.",False,False

From what I've seen, she seems to flaunt her physique a lot in her videos. Either she's in denial (which I doubt) or is being deceitful. I don't watch her videos, but I do know of her, she's been a source of controversy for a while now.   I think it's very toxic. She is obviously suffering, but the fact that she lies and consistently passes it off as normal to her young and impressionable audience is what I have a problem with.",False,False

It started out that people were concerned and now it‚Äôs full out harassment.  I think people should just leave her alone.  She‚Äôs made it clear that she doesn‚Äôt want to discuss it online and nobody is being forced to watch her videos.  If someone is offended by her body or the thought that she may not be eating then they can just walk away from the situation and that‚Äôs what I think more people need to be doing.   In my mind no body is inherently offensive and you cannot know someone else‚Äôs story unless they tell you.  If she says she‚Äôs okay people need to leave her alone until she wants and asks for help.,False,False
