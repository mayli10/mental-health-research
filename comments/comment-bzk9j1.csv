Yes, they may be important, but at the end of the day? It’s just an exam. Your mental health is worth much, much, more than getting a good grade on a piece of paper.   As for your binge, everyone slips up every once and a while. I know binges make everyone feel like shit, but please remember that one slip up does NOT make you a “failure.”   I know it sucks not being able to see your brother, or have a “good summer”, but I’m sort of in the same boat here. Please feel free to message me if you ever need it, I always relate to your posts and you seem like you are way too hard on yourself sometimes!   I know I’m just an internet stranger, but I hope I helped you a little bit, and I hope you feel better soon. Much love 💕",False,False
