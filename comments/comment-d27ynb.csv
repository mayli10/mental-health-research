I've been taking laxatives for about 5 years and I've gotten to the point where I literally can't shit without them. I've literally gone 2 weeks without shitting because I was trying to stop lol. I don't know how long you've been using them, but if you're still able to poop regularly get out before it's too late!! Instant gratification is never worth the lifelong consequences you'll be facing getting dependent on them!!!",False,False
