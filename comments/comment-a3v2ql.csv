If I remember correctly, you have to hold a paper saying Skinnygossip or something?? But I may be wrong. And I heard the creator's creepy boyfriend/husband or whatever also sees the pictures and has a say about who gets accepted. I read that a girl was denied and called fat by the site's creator. But I also read another account where someone was denied for having an eating disorder. So apparently you can't have an ED but you also have to be super skinny? It's so strange. On myproana, there are some threads that spill the tea about that site.   I'll admit I totally wanted to be a member (and still kinda do), just out of a morbid curiosity and to get some dirt on the modeling industry. But with a 21.5 bmi I might as well be morbidly obese to that community lol. It also seems suuuper judgy and bitchy. I read their threads open to the public and it seems like people will pounce on you for the smallest mistake or difference in opinion. I've heard there's a huuuge hierarchy there. And they judge literally every celeb's body. They're mean in their regular threads so I can't even imagine what they say in the members only ""take-down"" and ""waste of a face"" threads essentially designed to bash celebs that they deem fat or wasting their potential because they're not underweight. I really don't get it because they don't condone eating disorders apparently but then also harshly criticize anyone with a bmi of over 18?? I dunno, I just feel like it's probably a real catty place, not supportive like proed was. ",False,False

I applied to this place in some kind of stupor like 2 years ago but never activated my membership or whatever. I don't think I ever visited. Jesus I wonder what photo I sent it XD  At the time, I think I was getting curious about what kind of thinspo was there because I would often get directed there when looking for celebrity photos. I found that for a while tumblr had decent thinspo for a while but then  tumblrs got harder and harder to find. annnyyyway.  ",False,False

I remember seeing a post when I was on there, where the ‚ÄúVIP‚Äù members were discussing how at times they get a lot of requests for membership and sometimes they stop accepting ANY new members for long periods of time, so I wouldn‚Äôt take it personally at least :) The way they explained it, they were worried about having articles written about them. There was already an article written, sort of ‚Äúexposing‚Äù them about shit they said about Kate Upton I think? and negative publicity in general. So they are paranoid about adding people, and ban you if you don‚Äôt post, as I learned. Definitely not worth being a part of - it‚Äôs a pretty brutal place! ",False,False

I joined this site at one point, a little over a year ago. I was mostly just interested in reading insider gossip about the modelling industry, which can‚Äôt be accessed unless you join.   I had to ‚Äúapply‚Äù to be a member, and I was nervous about submitting my height, weight, BMI, links to all of my real life social media (Instagram FB, etc) and a current photo of me holding a sign that said ‚Äúskinny gossip‚Äù (as proof that it was really me in the photos) to be judged, but I was so curious, so I thought, ‚Äúwhy not! No one I know in real life will ever see my photo or know if I do get rejected‚Äù.   To my surprise, I got accepted, and for a minute I felt some excitement, as if this was validation that was thin enough? Obviously disordered thinking on my behalf. I don‚Äôt even know who runs the website, or on what criteria they judged me. For all I know, it could be based on the mood they‚Äôre in that day or how many members they want to accept at a time, whatever! So it‚Äôs not that big of a deal and I‚Äôm not even comparable to anyone they worship on that site, but here I was.   Now, I don‚Äôt mean any offence to anyone in this forum who may be a member of Skinny Gossip with what I‚Äôm about to say next. I know I can‚Äôt paint all members with the same brush, I don‚Äôt personally know any of them, and I was a member for only a short time before getting kicked off (!!!! Eek! Will explain after, lol) But I must say, the tone of the forum was NOTHING like the supportive environment of ProEd. I guess I didn‚Äôt expect it to be, I was literally joining to get gossip! But still, a lot of the comments on there rubbed me the wrong way. They all seemed mean-spirited, gatekeeping, super judgemental, snobby and would attack other members opinions. Even though I (secretly and not proudly) sort of agree with most of their opinions on celebs and stuff, I feel like it was just so harsh, triggering, and unkind. They just generally seemed like mean girls and I had no desire to participate in the conversation.   Hence, why I ended up getting kicked out of Skinny Gossip after only a few short weeks for not contributing üòÇ Got an email from the mod, saying I had been a member for however long and not posted, so I‚Äôd be banned. Damn!  To be honest, I‚Äôve never been an ACTIVE member of any online community until r/ProEd got shut down and I just recently, finally came out of my shell and began posting to you guys on EDAnonymous :) I just find motivation in reading any and everything ED Related (although Skinny Gossip claims to be made up of thin but not disordered girls üôÑ mmmhmmm), so I‚Äôve been a lurker forever. I kinda wish I was still on skinny gossip for pure entertainment, but it‚Äôs definitely a toxic environment that I would never want to actively engage in, if that makes any sense.   Sorry for the long post! I‚Äôve never told anyone about this before, so I guess I‚Äôm just ranting to get it off my chest üòÇ ",False,False
