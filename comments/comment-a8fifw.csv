My little sister and I are both triggers for each other I think. She’s a healthy weight now bc she’s trying for a baby. I know she isn’t getting pregnant bc she still purges but she denies it. I’m too fragile to help her and my feeling helpless is a trigger for me. I must trigger her too bc I’m tiny now, and I already have children. It would be good if we could support each other but there’s a gulf between us :( sometimes I think it’s for the best though, as if we sealed it then our Eds could feed off of each other (pun not intended). I miss my sister. When I’m with her she’s not there iykwim :(",False,False
