I hope your life takes you everywhere you want it to.   I try to enjoy it. I know I’m lucky to have a job that sends me on lavish trips and to nice places with interesting people. It can be hard to walk into a party and perform well when I’m not happy with how I look, but someone told me once that “a princess never has a bad day” and as silly as it sounds, it (sort of) helps. It also (sort of) helps to know that, even on days where I feel like the least attractive person in the room, there are at least 20 other women who feel the same way and showed up anyway.",False,False

As ridiculous as it may sound, I still enjoy cooking and being a waiteress, I even work part-time as a waiteress (I really like having coversations with guests and providing everything they need while also solving issues they may have), but oh boy, BULIMIA IS A BITCH. We provide breakfast every morning (buffet tables) and the cakes are my worst enemy there. Today I almost binged on them as I get to choose breakfast myself after all of the guests have left. I like this job, because it somehow satisfies my lonely, depressed inner-self and my ED, but the food will never be my friend again",False,False

People dont understand how physically demanding that job is. Lifting 30 lb flour and sugar sacks, carrying enormous, extremely hot trays loaded with like 6 cheesecakes all the way across the kitchen as fast as you can, literally running all the time because 4 times are going off and it's easy to burn stuff in commercial grade ovens. The shaky hands thing took me right back. At least with decorating you're probably not doing it in front of the customers. I miss not working directly with the public because nothing's more embarrassing than trying to give back change and you literally can not keep your hands from shaking. People dont understand how badly not getting proper nutrition messes up your life.",False,False

You have to be up really early. I know most bakeries open at 5am or around that time. If you’re kneading the doughs by hand? Forget it. I’m not sure if you do decorating but shaky hands from low blood sugar isn’t doing any favours :(,False,True

Right now I’m still cooking and doing what I like but on a smaller scale. My other career choice would be going into IT management.   I think if anything I’d be even more nervous!

I hate that this has impacted your career choices. I hope you’re still able to build a life doing things you love.   My situation is sort of the opposite because I feel like I do better at work because of my ED. That’s probably my ED brain speaking, but it’s how I feel. I work in a corporate job with very high end clients and there’s a lot of pressure to look nice when I’m around them. Being competent doesn’t really feel like enough. I have to be beautiful and entertaining in a room full of chic and cultured people. The only really ironic thing is that many of our interactions take place over meals. That sucks sometimes, but honestly, they probably feel as much pressure to be thin and elegant as I do, so I’m hardly ever the only one not finishing my plate.",False,False

I worked at a pizza place for a couple of months and the people who would get a pizza with like:  -triple cheese -double bacon -double pepperoni  -triple sausage  -triple beef  I cry a little because all I can think is calories   I now work at a nursing home and when we got a shipment of “boost with extra calories!!” I audibly let out a shriek,False,True

I always find myself restricting/binging more when I’m working here vs. the library at my university during the year. But then again other things trigger me during the school year and not in the summer so it probably all evens out.",False,False
