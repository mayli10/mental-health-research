I'm putting my entire life on hold simply because I'm not skinny enough. My mentality that once I'm skinny, I'll magically have my life figured out!   Skinny = Decent wardrobe Skinny = Decent makeup Skinny = Doing my hair everyday Skinny = Focus on skincare Skinny = Good grades Skinny = Social Skinny = All my mental problems resolve itself  In the meantime, I've just been putting everything on hold. Can't buy this nice dress because I'm not skinny enough. My wardrobe right now is baggy lounge wear. I put no effort into my appearance or my future. Or my grades for that matter. It's like I'm cemented in a puddle of apathy, and somehow that's all gonna go away when I'm at my UGW. ",False,False

Buuttt a hot-confident-fit thin.. not a self-hating-meek-loser. Anyway face masks, long showers, and generally just pampering has helped a lot! I figure.. if I'm ever gonna be that fantasy girl it starts here and now. I wont magically be a new person when I'm thinner. I hear people say that allllllll the time on this sub!

Well, my ""UGW"" was pounds ago, so I guess my big treat I got to give myself was organ failure and a and painful slow death.   Enjoy life now. Shoes, makeup, pretty clothes, talents, trips, those were all nice back before my hair started falling out and I could still leave the house.  I always thought my life would be perfect way down here, but good god after well over a decade of this hell I'm hoping I have a chance to give myself ""my dream life"" ... my actual dream life, the one where I'm happy.

I decided that I would dress to my CW, get a really great self care routine down and learn to treat myself with respect.   After 10 years in the ED mindset- this wasnâ€™t easy at all. But now I have dewy clear skin, my legs are often shaved and exfoliated, I cherish my clothes because I get compliments on them.   Iâ€™ve learned that happiness comes from my inner self so I know it probably feels impossible to you right now- but your friend is probably right.   Maybe start with washing your face.

When I got to my ugw I had an existential crisis because I had also been pushing aside all my mental health problems, most of my goals, and my fantasies for the future until I got there and finally realized I had to put in more effort to my life than just spending hours on end crunching calorie numbers.  All I can say is definitely start woking on other goals. For example, I'm happy that I began focusing hard on school at the same time as I really delved into my ED, so at least when I got to my ugw I had something else to show for the long period of anti-social, sweatpants-clad, library-dwelling, depression-embroiled wallowing (wallowing in ""being fat"" because of course, I was ""fat"" my entire life until the moment I saw that one arbitrary number on the scale and I will probably be ""fat"" again soon once the novelty of it wears off lol).   Pretty much the only thing you *may* want to actually hold off on is clothing. Everything else, go for it now! Even small goals like maintaining a skincare routine will seriously boost your confidence and give you that same feeling of accomplishment. I totally relate to the comfort of making GW an excuse to be stagnant at CW, but the hardest part of accomplishing anything is usually deciding to start :)",False,False
