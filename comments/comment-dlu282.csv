I mean there are so many valid reasons why purging is terrible for you professionals should have plenty of scare tactics to go with. Yet people go with “you are just wasting your time” lol. Tell me about the teeth damage or something honest at least. People with eating disorders are not stupid.   You do absorb some calories before, but most digestion occurs in the intestines. I go with 20% absorption for calorie tracking, but even that might be high.",False,False

In my experience, though, I’ve both gained and lost weight from purging at different periods. Sometimes I gain weight despite it, sometimes it helps me lose weight (when I was younger I tended to lose weight more, these days I feel like I gain weight more). I think it depends on the body and how fast it digests, how much/what you’ve eaten, how long ago it was, how much you purged, method of purging, etc.  basically it’s all circumstantial and there’s no way to really be sure. Yet I do it anyway from time to time when I binge, just to be “safe”.",False,False
