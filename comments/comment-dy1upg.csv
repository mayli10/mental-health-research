Second: I'm sorry you're feeling this way.   No, an apple will not make you fat. I like to small dice an apple and cook it for a few minutes with some cinnamon and some sugar free maple syrup to add on top of my oatmeal or yogurt.   Thankfully my mom doesn't touch my safe foods. She'll ask me before she grabs something if it's something I can eat or not. (She doesn't know about my ED. She just thinks I'm on a diet)",False,False

My dietitian had me read Health At Any Size, which cites a study where the group that was eating an apple a day or something was overall slimmer— it was in the chapter on fiber and why fiber is so great to hve in your diet. My dumb brain turned that into “only apples and berries are safe, no other fruits.”   Also, small dice the apples and toss with cinnamon and a splash of lemon juice (or just the cinnamon). It’s amazing on top of oatmeal, yogurt, etc.",False,False
