I was not healthy when I was overweight, and while I obsess over food now, at least I'm not filling my body with trash and I actually exercise. People love to make comments when you're skinny, but when you're overweight or worse no one tries to help because you can't tell someone they're fat.",False,False

Remember these:  * you *will* grow lots of fine hair all over. literally. like, as we speak i'm caressing the peach fuzz on my cheek. i'm lucky it's nearly translucent or i'd be rocking a full-on bears like nobody's business * you'll be cold. ALL. THE TIME. it's a wonderful, hot and humid day and you want to go to the beach? WE-HE-HEEEELL, not only will you be too ashamed to show your body (and trust me, it never goes away), but the moment you touch the water you'll get so incredibly frozen that you'll probably give up on swimming altogether. trust me. i've tried. 5 years and counting of going with my family to a seaside vacation, and taking a swim approx. 6 times altogether. I've also got permanent burn marks on my legs from hugging a piping hot water bottle due to how cold I get at night. * *amenorrhoea.* ok, no period??? FUCK YES???? I know. it's terrific. i'm loving it. no pads, no bleeding, no pms pimples, all clear and pure all month. BUT. consider this- your body now thinks you've entered the menopause. like, it thinks you're like. 60y/o. it thinks you've reached and passed your peak health years and that now it's allowed to *slowly* deteriorate. dangers include but are not limited to: hot flashes at night (i literally can't sleep because of these, they're terrible), frequent fatigue, moodiness (like a little child. legit like a child), osteoporosis, you may even gain weight (!!!) bc the metabolism just fucks off. no hormones, no sex drive whatsoever, you're basically slowly losing all your woman-bits. I've started this hell at 14, and now at 21 I literally have the body of a 10 y/o boy. Tits? Dont know them * everything about your body gets *so weak.* you'll wake up bruised like crazy, and you won't even know why. your bleeding papercuts will take longer to stop bleeding, and your scars will fade slower. someone coughs in the same room as you?? Hoo boy, prepare that Tylenol for tomorrow, you'll need it. Like. The whole you gets so weak, it's tiring af. * while we're there- YOUR HAIR, NAILS, SKIN AND TEETH JUST YEET THE FUCK OFF. It takes 10000 times more energy and care to just keep yourself looking presentable. I'm so fucking tired of it. * prepare for the gossip. My mom literally told me people stop her on the street and ask if I'm a) sick, b) doing drugs, c) dying. I mean. A sick, sick part of me loves it, but it's really not very nice to have the most prominent thing about you be percieved in such a negative way. People will look at you and think negative things. Find negative reasons for your skinniness. It's not pretty. People stare. But they don't stare in admiration, don't expect that from healthy-minded people. People will stare with fright, disgust, repulsion. Honestly, that dragged my self-esteem even lower. It validated my self-hate. It's terrible.  There's a bunch more points, but I just made myself sad writing this.  I guess I don't really have a point, you're already set on what you want, and it'd be terribly hypocritical of me to talk all saccharine about not doing it, but please. Please, just take care of yourself. Be gentle. Ultimately, this is the only body you'll get, so shape it however you like, but keep in mind that it needs to keep functioning as well.  Take care!!

I'm 5'6 and was 140 at my lowest so totally in a normal BMI range. But I was 250 at my highest and I know that there is a big difference between my highest and lowest.

My sister has been 140 or less her whole life and no one bats an eye when she goes on a diet!
