Typical result seems to be in a Loft trouser &amp; dress size that is the true (same as) most brands or is only vanity sized by one size. For blouses it seems that they admittedly run large/vanity size since it kept resulting in a size recommendation that was one to two sizes smaller than other brands.  So I wouldn’t consider them to be a notably “vanity sized brand” from this information alone, but I’d infer these results mean they do have some tendency to sometimes vanity size certain styles &amp; types of clothing and/or add more stretch than they probably should. This of course, all assumes their size chart actually matches how they cut their clothes to fit.   **Worst Case Scenario **: *Everything is two sizes too big.* — This worst case scenario is possible but probably not the most likely.   I tend to try to decide if a brand is likely vanity sized by looking at the measurements for the smallest size and assuming their isn’t a ridiculous size change *’interval’*. I don’t know if it’s standard across brands to start clothing at 00 these days, but size charter does say that Loft starts at 00 not 0. So *in a way*, no matter how accurate their size chart is, their clothes are vanity sized to a mild degree(by one size). My reasoning is that size 0 was introduced to markets to become the “starting point”, or in other words the smallest misses&amp;juniors size. 00 was only introduced to compensate for vanity sizing the size 0 to fit a size 2. I’m not 100% certain but I think a “true” double zero is supposed to fit a 22.0-22.5 waist for juniors sizes and for misses sizes its either the same or 22.5-23.0. The hip shouldn’t be over +10 of the waist measurement and the bust is supposed to be somewhere between 29.0 to &lt;31 for a 00. So according to the size charts their petite clothing *may* start as true to size but their other clothes seems to start at a size 0.5-1.0 inch bigger than it should to be warranting a double zero label.",False,False

So this may come off as frenetic.  People without EDs mainly do this (***ex*** “slimmers”, *crash dieters*) as so do self-proclaimed “Pro-Anas”, but  I do really feel like a fair share of people with other EDs do it to.   It really doesn’t help make staying recovered/fighting relapses any easier because it messes with my head in a way I can’t describe perfectly. It’s kinda like seeing people treat it like an accomplishment instead of a different shitty coping mechanism and way to avoid confronting trauma/dealing with distress. That gets my mind going to **that place** where I have denial that my ED is even a problem to be fought against, and its just a part of my personality and a way of motivating myself.   People with other EDs don’t even realize they do it when they do things like:  •say they wish they had anorexia instead of the ED they have, or say they “tried to be” anorexic, in the context of referring to mental state and ED behavior. (*so not the context of wanting to be skinny  or wanting people to take their ED more seriously— that’s not glorifying AN imo*)  •express upset when they’re diagnosed with an ED that matches their symptoms better because they want AN to be part of their identity   •proclaim that any other diagnosis is wrong because they feel like they subjectively restrict and apparently thats all that having anorexia is. (***ex.*** *i feel like this is the same as restrictive anorexics proclaiming they have binge eating disorder “aswell” because they subjectively binged on 800calories over a period of 2 hours*)  •are resistant to one of the specific long established attributes of anorexia. The one in which the person’s— weight loss desire/fear of weight gain/fear of becoming fat/disturbed self image/restriction behaviors, isn’t alleviated or resolved by reaching underweight or a weight that is significantly low for their height/age/sex etc. But at the same time don’t realize being resistant to this also invalidates OSFED as real &amp; valid ED that people suffer from, can damage people’s physical health, but has some different psychological attributes/implications and thus needs to be treated/addressed a little differently to ensure best outcome.    I feel like all these days things are notions all us ED sufferers get upset with when people without EDs perpetuate them, but it’s excused when people with EDs do it to themselves *and* others with EDs. What really need to do is get other EDs more attention because Anorexia isn’t more or less valid than other EDs. AN doesn’t mean you’re sicker or suffering more — it means you’re sick in a specific way, just like all established EDs.  Imo being sick with an established ED doesn’t even mean someone is suffering *more* than a distressed person suffering with UFED/EDNOS or a proposed but unestablished ED. {***Eg.*** *Ortho, Hypegymnasia, Food/eating addiction, Exercise Addiction*} It just really gets to me because **years** before my AN-R onset it really seems I definitely suffered with EDNOS/UFED. I feel like if I got a diagnosis &amp; treatment maybe my AN wouldn’t of developed, and I really really doubt that therapy/treatment tactics used for AN would of been if significant help.",False,False

I stopped myself from cutting again though - I want my scars to heal more so I can get more tattoos, and I don't wanna ruin the tattoos I already have.  I'm so unhappy right now and it's like I'm not allowed to be though. I'm not allowed to have feelings or get stressed and if I feel unhappy it's because ""I don't want to get help"", even though I have improved SO MUCH since last year when I was hearing things and not sleeping and not eating and taken to hospital several times for suicide attempts. I got SO much better, but certain people didn't know me then, they don't see the change, they just see how I am now and assume this is as bad as it gets - it's not, of course I'm not gonna be perfect all the fucking time, but I AM better than I was and I DON'T need to be told to ""see a shrink or something"" every time I'm unhappy, some fucking empathy would be nice.
