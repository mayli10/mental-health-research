If I don’t eat all day I rarely feel hunger. I’ve been totally shocked at how much a 500 calorie omad dinner satisfies me know. Whenever I’ve tried to diet in a healthy range, a dinner that size would feel very unsatisfying. Now I’m worried I can’t do math or my food labels/mfp are lying but I think it’s just my body getting used to not eating much.",False,False

Usually the more water I drink the truer that is. But I’ve never thought of food as something to crave and enjoy, but more as a means of trying to get myself healthy. Also, some foods are generally just more filling but not calorie heavy.",False,False
