Believe me, I started working as a porter at a casino in January weighing nearly 200 lbs. I wasn't really fat, but I had gotten heavier in my mid section than I cared for, but after working there for four months, I'm somewhere in the 184-88 range, dropped 3 belt loops, and built up a fair bit of muscle. Granted, I wouldn't really recommend my job given you saw me mention I hated it...  Really any job that gets you on your feet will make you shed the pounds quickly, especially if you're a teen or young adult. Just make sure to drink water or gatorade instead of sodas.",False,False
