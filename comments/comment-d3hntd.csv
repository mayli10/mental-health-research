So I really dont feel like I can have more than 1200-1400 without gaining weight in a day. Every calculator says I should have more. Even when set to sedentary. but my own experience is different. Because I watch the scale every day. At the same time, with the same clothing on. If I go for a long walk, 1400 maintains. Otherwise it has to be 1200 or less. Today was 1000. And always tons of water. Im not sure what else to do :(",False,False

Keep in mind due to water retention and other food choices (mainly pertaining to macro nutrients) that a maintenance weight is usually within a range of 5-8lbs+/- so some days you’ll be a bit more and some days you’ll be a bit under and that’s all good!   You’re a lovely person w a lovely soul Nd ur trying! Good luck w eating at maintenance,False,False
