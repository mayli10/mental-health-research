I've had to be firm in some instances and I hope that doesn't come across as anger. It can be hard sometimes  I give that a read and again thank you very much, it means the world",False,True

Sometimes having that person who will listen without trying to fix is really valuable. It does sound like accessing professional sources of help could be valuable for her, but really only when she’s ready to explore those options.   It can be frustrating as a supporter to see a very intelligent person acting in dangerous ways, but try to remember that there’s often a disconnect and intense conflict between intellect and emotion. Try to avoid expressing anger/frustration/disappointment - we already feel plenty of that on our own. I often understand things with my head but not with my heart, and the emotional turmoil can be so strong that it overrides my intellect. Fighting emotions with logic is seldom effective, and it’s usually hard for outsiders to understand the emotional space of EDs.   Also, it’s ok to safeguard your own mental and emotional health. You are not responsible for saving someone. Offering love and support is so valuable and such a gift, but at times love is not enough. And that doesn’t mean you did something wrong. Wishing the very best to both of you.
