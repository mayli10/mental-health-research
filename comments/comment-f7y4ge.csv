My mum either freaks the fuck out or joins in. I know I'm not easy to deal with tho so I try and not take it personally. Was supposed to get public housing this week but quarantine has put it off, It's so draining and I feel like it's fucked up my independence massively, hope you're doing ok ðŸ’œ",False,False
