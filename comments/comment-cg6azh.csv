At all.  What worked for me was being consistent with my techniques and coping skills, even when it felt like nothing was working (which was most of the time). Anytime my ED voice says something stupid, I argue back. I point out the complete irrationality in those thoughts. Sometimes I say it out loud, which makes me feel fucking crazy but it helps. For awhile this technique doesn’t really work because your ED voice is just like “yeah well ur fat and making excuses lol”, but if you keep doing it you slowly become more able to listen to yourself and shut down the ED. Being in therapy and using healthy ways of coping also helps.",False,False
