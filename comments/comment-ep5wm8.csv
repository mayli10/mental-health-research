I‘m also trying more mindfulness practice because that really seems to help me divest myself from my brain’s incessant unhelpful commentary. Music therapy and neurofeedback also interest me, but I haven’t tried them.   I think sometimes rather than fighting the darkness directly, it’s better to work on bringing in more light. After all, it’s hard to keep trying when we struggle to imagine a future that we’d want to live. I hope you will find some things that help you conceive of a future you want to be part of. &lt;3",False,False
