I grew up drinking it because my mom and I have horrible insomnia and my mom's a bit of a hippie. I brew it less strong in the day for anxiety, and it actually quells my thoughts any time I start panicking too much about food. I've never smoked weed, but a kava ""high"" for me means my muscles get loose, my heartrate slows, and I feel a lil giddy. In the U.S. you can buy the strong stuff off Amazon, but I'm lazy and just buy pre-made teabags from the natural grocery store nearby, and it's the perfect ""weak"" cup + they flavor it with cinnamon and other spices so it doesnt taste like youre drinking a literal cup of dirt. If you're in Europe or Canada it might be tough since I think kava might be banned from market, there.",False,True
