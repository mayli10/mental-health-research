Are you a perfectionist at all? Do you never feel complete or accomplished, no matter what goals you reach?   Maybe you are focusing on your body as you see it’s the only thing that can be improved. Maybe instead of going in all ED(sorry I’m tired, words and I are not working well together) you can find a new activity that will get you in better shape.  Also you might be looking at your life and wondering if you “deserve” it. Of course you do! So enjoy it. Find new hobbies to quell that voice in your head that tells you you need to do something. Do something positive, don’t let your ED try to wriggle it’s way back in!",False,False
