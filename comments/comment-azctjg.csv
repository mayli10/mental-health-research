First things first, try to be kinder to yourself in your self-talk. Don’t speak about yourself in a way that you wouldn’t dare use with a friend (I have to remind myself of this constantly... I’m always calling myself a fat, dumb bitch, stupid fatass, etc). You are working on getting better, you ARE seeking help, and those are major positive steps. Recovery and healing is not linear, as much as we wish it could be. Sleeping it off is a great first step— life should seem brighter in the morning. Try to be gentle with yourself and move on. I’m here for you❤️  (Also I lol’d hard at “eating and yeeting”, you’re funny af) ",False,False
