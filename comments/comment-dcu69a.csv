I usually allow myself one single pint of halo top whenever I get high (the little pockets of caramel syrup in the sea salt caramel flavor will blow your stoned mind), and between that and about 2-3 refills of the liter water bottle that I never don't have, I can manage it",False,False

Whatever is left in our tissues is a result of THC being processed by the body if it made us high we would be stoned 24/7. My tolerance is probably just too high!,False,True

It kinda wrecks you physically as well as mentally because your body is like wtf how do I digest this - even so I kinda miss being able to eat more bc now even if I let myself have a treat I can hardly eat enough to enjoy it.,False,True

I think part of the  ‚Äúfeel like you can never stop eating‚Äù is bc we are already at such a deficit our bodies are like OH MY GOD FOOD and our hunger never feels satiated. Even though I don‚Äôt munch out as hard I still use weed to help me feel okay about eating dinner (at least it tastes GOOD when you‚Äôre stoned!). And lol let me know about that strain!,False,True

I enjoy going for a walk, skating, practicing music or whatever more when I‚Äôm high so I gravitate less towards food.
