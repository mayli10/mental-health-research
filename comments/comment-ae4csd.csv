And huge respect to you for trying to weight-restore - this is all such a mind-warp so it's heartening to know that insight like yours can win out. Best of luck to you too.",False,True

I’m flat out TRYING to weight restore and I’m astonished by how much i can overeat without gaining much, if anything at all. Since I started I’ve even seen dips in my weight after huge calorie surpluses and though my weight fluctuates on a day-to-day basis I’ve been at a plateau since Christmas. Not one single day have I under-eaten and some days I’ve without a doubt over-eaten, by a lot (500+ cals).   Just like weight loss is not linear and has random unexplained plateaus and gains, weight gain is the same, it’s not as simple as “overeat=instant big gains”.  So don’t panic.  However, as you’re underweight you should aim for maintenance at the very least. Weight restoration doesn’t have to be drastic but if even a tiny bit of gain is freaking you out then you need to acknowledge a problem and if it’s something you’re ready to work on get all the support you can. Good luck!",False,False
