Something along the lines of itchiness being a clinical feature with low weight. I remember the only way people in the study got over it was returning to a normal weight.   I would try different creams/lotions first. Try drinking that 0cal drink of H2O to hydrate yourself.   If the itchiness continues, might want to see a dermatologist. Since they only focus on skin treatment, you'll be okay.   Take care of yourself.",False,False
