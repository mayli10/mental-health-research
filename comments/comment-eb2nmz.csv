Every time I open my phone I got that little timer ticking ""Fast complete! 1786 hours 55 minutes"". Yeah I fucking wish.   I think it's too unhealthy to track the fasts because sometimes you just have to eat, your body screams for it and at that point it's best to just eat something. When I'm not timing it's easier for me to not lose my shit when I do break fast.",False,False
