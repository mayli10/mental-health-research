I don’t regret letting him know but I realize that the “I have to prove that I’m sick” feeling has worsened terribly since then and has led to me over analyzing things he says in regards to food/eating. especially since I’m skinny but not underweight yet and legitimately can’t tell him how I’ve been purging every time I eat/starving otherwise, like he knows but he doesn’t KNOW KNOW. :( tbh I should have waited until after recovery (whenever that happens) and told him what I used to struggle with instead of letting it hurt me more now. I wish it was easier for us all. and I’m so so sorry you’ve had to deal with that",False,False

However. My mom is the one who got be diagnosed (thanks :\\ ) and also who told half of the fucking planet within a week. She told my extended family, everybody in our ethnic community, all of her (many many) friends, every body, ev-er-y-bo-dy. When she dragged me to the beach, to my grandparents, to her friends house (tugging me along to monitor me), she would ask her friends what they thought of my body, if i was too thin, and report back to me how ugly skinny looked on me. I genuinely think that my disordered eating only got worse with her ""help"" and the program I was put into. I think I might've even just recovered on my own, because it was just somewhat disordered and misguided. I was even raising my own cal intake ON MY OWN before she came in with all of this, and so I began binge eating, then restricting, exercise purging, and doing short fasts, on top of overanalyzing everything everyone ate to try to figure out why i was being punished.",False,False

I’ve regretted basically telling every single person I’ve ever told.   1. Mom. Told her because I wanted help. Her solution was “Let’s pray for you.”  2. Doctor (mind you this was like 100 year ago), yelled across the office to my mom, “SHE WEIGHS XXX SHE DOESN’T HAVE AN EATING DISORDER.” That was the end of that story.  3. Therapist? “Just way right and exercise!” 4. My sister. She told everyone she possibly could. Not that they cared. They just wanted to gossip and then talk shit about/to me.   All I wanted was help. Didn’t really work out that way.",False,False

I tell them about my ED and it triggers me to be worse to ""prove myself""  I tell them about my ED, and out of the blue start getting sent ""thinspo"" or they start reposting ProED content when they never had before  I hate talking about it with anyone outside of this sub and it sucks, I feel so lonely and it's ruining my life and probably going to kill me in one way or another eventually but I have to pretend I'm fine :(   I'm sorry that someone you thought you could trust betrayed that trust &lt;3 I hope that over time you can settle back into recovery (with no pressure here of course) or at least that you can let go of some of the anger towards yourself for telling someone - you couldn't have known that he'd go and tell everyone and it's definitely not on you either way!!",False,False

God, I’m so sorry that you had to experience that. It really does hurt when you confide in someone and they break your trust. It’s almost harder because their hearts are in the right place and they had good intentions, but man. Man I wish they didn’t tell anyone, or that I never told them.   I really, really appreciate you typing out this reply. It means a lot. It’s horrible that that happened, but it’s also nice to know that I’m not alone in this.",False,True

Confided in a trusted friend, who had good intentions- went about it horrifically. They told my entire immediate family, who in turn monitered me heavily- forcing me to eat, sit with them- they became millitant which only made my disorder worse as they weren't educated or aware to any real degree what it actually meant to have a restrictive eating disorder. They played into all the stereotypes.. and it hurt. A lot.  People don't understand, it's not something people have enough exposure to where they would actually understand that what they know to be true.. isn't true at all. You know, in media there's always the use of shock tactics- Marketting for an eating disorder organisation will nearly always use an emaciated woman, because that's what people associate with anorexia. It makes the sufferers who don't look like what's portrayed in the media to feel like they're not truly sick and it makes those who aren't disordered feel like we're not sick because we don't ""look"" disordered.  My family reacted in ways that triggered me a lot more, they restricted exercise and time I was allowed to be active- making me feel that because I wasn't overly active before that I was somehow not sick, nor deserving of this care now. They made me higher fat meals, even though before I may not have been restricting macros- again, making me feel like I didn't do enough when I could. I didn't deserve the care.  It's fucking stupid and i'm sorry your family have reacted such poorly. Feel free to PM me if you want to rant about it some more; though don't feel pressured to.",False,False
