It might not be ideal because you still want to be in top shape for work (so you aren't feeling sick), but maybe this will help deter you from making on the spot decisions? Good luck!",False,False

I used to be so embarrassed but it was so good but I just canâ€™t even imagine doing it anymore.  I feel so gross having people watch me eat, or like stuffing my face if people around.

Iâ€™m hoping that the process of making food will override my desire to eat because like 70% of the reason I eat is because I enjoy cooking. Itâ€™s basically like eating a meal if I stare at others consuming it, right?",False,True

I loved to order the pizza all the time, but Iâ€™ve recently been super restricting again.  The lowest point was when I thought a ham and cheese would be a safe option for a lunch instead of a personal pizza, and it turned out to have like 700 calories???
