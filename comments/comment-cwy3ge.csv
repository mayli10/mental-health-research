Granted, I swapped out restriction for straight up fasting.  I found when I went over my limit, even by a small margin, I'd be like ""I've fucked up, might as well go the full 10 yards and binge"" which meant I didn't really lose. It also became very mentally draining constantly needing to know the calories and whether things fitted in my limit.  I still have the numbers memorised and I still check the labels, and I will go for the lower calorie option available, but I don't meticulously track the numbers. Although it works out at the beginning and I drop some weight, over time it taxes me too much mentally to the point I sabotage any progress made.",False,False

I aim for 1000, but it could be as low as 700 when I'm restricting and around 1600-1800 when I binge lol. I was in a binge phase recently, so I've been eating around 1000-1200 cals. My work has catered lunch daily, so that's a thing :( and I tend to buy lunch if it's something unhealthy or saucy.  Typically I'll have a 0-30 cal breakfast (seaweed soup, miso soup, tea, etc) then a 200-300 lunch (usually lot of salad/greens and some protein), and a 300-500 dinner (whatever lunch was but no salad). And recently I have a snack as well 100-150, which puts me between 700 and 1100.  I also look at my weekly caloric goal (7000) since I may eat 500 cals one day then 1500 the next.
