It consumes your life and makea you feel guilty for everything you eat or don't eat.   Not being able to stop binging is also quite normal (at least it happens to me AS well)  because you'll think about food even more and feel fucking guily but it's okay.  This needs professional help to get a grip on it.   If your boyfriend knows and understands what you're going through, he shouldn't make you feel any more guilty..  Of course it's understandable that he's missing you in many ways since your ed takes over your life.  But that's why i think his job is to help you and not judge you for things like your sex drive.    You will be fine, please take care and look for professional help &lt;3",False,False

It’s okay to be disappointed and frustrated and feel all the feels. It’s hard to be in a disordered relationship with yourself and food and also have to maintain normal relationships with significant others and friends/family.  Eating disorders drive the food driven behavior so it’s not out of the ordinary to be so food focused while you’re having an episode.  There’s a book called brain over binge and it’s available on Amazon- very helpful for understanding why your mind works the way it does. I read it and then had my immediate family and partner read it. It really helped everyone understand why I react to certain things and certain foods the way I do.  If you’re ready to recover and just need help staying accountable it is extremely helpful to find a doctor or therapist in the area that is well versed in eating disorders. I have made a lot of progress simply because I know I have to answer to someone on a week to week basis.    Sending you hugs and peace ✌️,False,False
