I know that I will likely regret this when I am older, because I've always wanted to age well and look young for my age. But right now my ED is winning over the scary thought of potential future consequences.",False,False

The skin on my face just looks dull and especially around my eyes I look unhealthy. And the eyes themselves can scream â€˜my soul would prefer to inhabit this body no longerâ€™, which, ya know, doesnâ€™t convey â€˜youngâ€™. Using facial lotions and makeup compensates some I think.     I also feel that my face getting thinner makes me look older no matter how my skin looks. Not loving my current â€˜androgynous distance runnerâ€™ look...though the charming ED part of my brain feels excited...â€™keep going! Level up to androgynous cancer patient!â€™ Sigh.",False,False
