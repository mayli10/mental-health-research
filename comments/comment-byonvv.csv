Last time I weighed myself was in a controlled environment, with my therapist holding my hand. I didn’t like the number I saw, and ran out of the building with every intention of taking another overdose. My therapist chased me, and if he hadn’t, I may not be here now.   Knowing how badly I reacted, in what really *should* have been the *best possible* circumstances, leaves me terrified to try weighing myself again... so I don’t. I just let my clothes get looser and my bones protrude a little more, and ignore the doctor’s reminders that I need a check up... because unless I really get it RIGHT next time, I can’t put my husband through another attempt on my own life :/",False,False
