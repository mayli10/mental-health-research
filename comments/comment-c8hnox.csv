I just bought some flavored vape carts and I've been smoking a strawberry one.  They taste sooooo good and it can distract me from food thoughts because I get a candy flavor.  Even when I don't have flavored weed, I do smoke in place of eating though.  I know a lot of people get munchies, but as long as I have something to do (games, painting nails, playing with my dog) I don't get them.  If I get bored, then I start snacking haha",False,False
