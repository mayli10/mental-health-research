To add on to your post, it’s not that CICO isn’t true, but that the human body is a biological system which makes it vastly more complicated than the average person reduces it to. Best explanation I’ve heard is, “CICO is a flawed implementation of the law of thermodynamics.” I think Fung has used the example, “it’s like saying Bill Gates became rich by spending less than he makes.”",False,False

I have an ED , failed treatment twice, and felt at the end of my rope.  I didn't want to preach anything on this sub until I've experimented with myself first and see if I get results or this is just a dud in a long line at failed attempts to get healthy and lose weight.  I'll try to keep it short, but Dr. Jason Fung has a bunch of YouTube videos and is an award winning author of diet books. Obviously, if I'm raising your bullshit alarm you can just dismiss his videos if you think that's appropriate.   What he preaches is basically this:  - calories are not equal due to hormonal responses to different foods. He goes through the published science in his lectures. Oversimplification: carbs keep insulin high and fuck up your cravings due to various mechanisms.  -  you could do a high fat low carb diet (essentially keto)  - you could do intermittent fasting to deplete insulin   I'm trying a combo of keto + fasting and I've never had such low risks of being triggered.  The explanation he gave about why calorie restriction patients always gain weight back was life changing to me. He was describing my life: caloric restriction, weight loss, uncontrollable hunger (leading to binging), then weight gain and then some....What's better? It was in line with what my therapists and nutritionists were trying unsuccessfully to drill in my head at treatment (Set Point Theory, which I fucking hated as much as you probably do).  I haven't seen all his material online, but here's one lecture he gave with a PowerPoint presentation so you can see the studies he's talking about.  https://youtu.be/7nJgHBbEgsE   One thing I forgot to mention is I've been diagnosed with BED only - despite believing that I may be a bit EDNOS. Obviously promising someone a specific diet will cure their ED is a dumb idea, which is why I'm trying this on myself. Furthermore, I know y'all suffer from a lot more than just BED here, so I'm sorry if none of this is useful to you.   You know that feeling when you're so lost in your ED you hope one day you can snap out of it? Or one day you'll convince  yourself you don't actually have an ED and are just overweight and struggle with it? Well, I'm getting those vibes again myself, but I'm hopeful keto + moderate fasting will squash the cravings that have ruined my entire 20s. Treatment doesn't really want me back, and I've tried everything else but a healthy diet because I usually never  last 1-3 days to save my life. I've been having daily binges for 4 years now, but so far I'm feeling good on my regimen.  Just wanted to share. Sorry if this upset anyone. I feel for the suffering you are going through. I'm just a guy who wants his life back. I'll try anything, and this MD has given me a scientific strategy that he's seen work with his patients while I've flunked treatment several time.

Low carb and stuff like that is good if you want to lose some weight in a shorter period of time, but it should always be temporary... The WHO doesn't recommend a certain amount of carbs, protein and fat for nothing. When you actually know how your body works (on a biochemistry level) then you know that it's important to consume protein and carbs (and also fat) in a specific ratio (? is it the right term?) because otherwise it can become really unhealthy, especially if you're cutting out carbs almost completely, like some people do. It makes me so angry that they're trying to ""advertise"" it.   I mean, we're not the epitome of health, but we know what we're doing to our bodies due to our disorder. But they genuinely think they're SO HEALTHY and try to make everyone eat like they do.  Most people eat way too much fat. Like my sister was trying to eat healthier and cut out carbs and read about ""good and bad"" fatty acids and didn't reduce the bad ones, ""because fat isn't bad in general"" and instead drank 2 spoon full of the ""good oils"" per day... PURE OIL...      Holy hell... if you're healthy and not disordered in eating and want to lose weight, then fucking stick to the WHO recommendation, and just eat a little less from everything, but also reduce ""the bad fat"" (instead of DRINKING the good fat), and exercise, instead of falling into that rabbit hole of ""oh so healthy eating"".  &amp;#x200B;  I get so angry that people who study stuff like that actually believe this shit. -.-",False,False
