I've told him so many times it's a treat not real food and to think about all the sugar, but he's just doesn't listen. It's like would it be ok to replace a meal with cookies? No? Well cereal is the same shit adding milk doesn't make it ok. Ugh",False,False

I've never had the fear food thing which has made me feel like my ED is all just a big lie, it's more foods that aren't ""worth it"". Like I do OMAD and love pizza so I'll still eat pizza, same with small bits of chocolate and cheese (allbeit I'll restrict to compensate) but stuff like lattes, sandwiches, nuts, butter, cereal that I used to eat regularly I'll totally avoid because I don't like them enough for the calories to be worth it.  This also results in spending an obscene amount of time choosing food because I'm paralysed trying to figure out what's the most bang for my buck calorie wise (how tasty it is v portion size v macros etc etc till the end of time). I can't imagine just grabbing something because it's there anymore, it's all planned and obsessed over to infinity...",False,False

Two things I did all the time... But if it's not lean meat meat or protein powder, I'm not wasting calories on anything less than great chocolate.

It feels similar to me as when I get in orthorexic phases. Like everything I put in my body has to be amazing and bring me so much joy and be 100% perfect.

For the longest time this mentality made me feel like I didn't have an ED because of how I didn't have fear foods (in the traditional sense) but I definitely have foods I'd never touch because I deem them ""not worth eating"".  I actually listened to an interesting podcast on this very subject yesterday. Not sure if I truly believe everything that was said but it was definitely worth listening to:   https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/the-eating-disorder-recovery-podcast/id1138563928?i=1000451392280",False,False
