f2238aj,t3_dbeb52,t3_dbeb52,thestarxvii,1,2019-09-30 17:02:36,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/dbeb52/am_i_the_only_one_who_likes_sharing_food/f2238aj/,Small amounts yes. I budget my calories very strictly so I want to not be hungry when I eat it. If I share too much and I’m still hungry I have to count the calories of the whole thing and it just feels unfair.   But I’ll totally enjoy giving bits to my kids or my dog (if it’s safe for her). I figure it’s a calorie or two less and I seem fun and carefree and not like I’m meticulously counting everything that touches my lips.,False,False

A bit like the people who invite a bunch of people to their house and cook for them and spend the entire  evening walking around making sure everyone is gorged to the gills and getting tipsy. ""Come sit down, you're making us feel bad!"" they'll say. Eish.",False,False
