Just watch out for water weight once you get back. I refused to weigh myself for a week afterwards.   I’ve now lost that 1lb again. It won’t be as bas aa you think :)",False,False

Just water weight. I find I end up moving around so much more that it ends up canceling it out. Theres always huge nice gyms on cruises too if you feel the need but honestly just try and enjoy yourself. Youll want to be able and look back on the nice family memories and not the stress of food. Theres nothing that cant be fixed.,False,False

I did my typical black coffee for breakfast (expect 2-3 days where I went out to breakfast or my dad made me a special breakfast) and ordered stuff I really wanted to eat but mindfully.   Example:  I would get yummy chicken lettuce cups instead of a creamy pasta dish! I even went to a buffet and just picked healthier options!   I ended up gaining about 8 lbs but it is all gone now a week later! I assume a lot of it was bloat because I have been relapsing very badly and not eating at all.   Honestly I’m SO glad I did it. I enjoyed being home so much. I know how terrifying it can be- but I really hope that once you’re in that vacation environment with people who love you, you feel safe enough to let yourself have fun and eat! Cruises are so fun!!! The memories will be around the rest of your life, I hope they are happy ones and not clouded by ED thoughts!",False,False
