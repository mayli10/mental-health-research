It sucks when they donâ€™t understand things from the eating disorder perspective. I went to the doctor yesterday and he was not a bad person in anyway but later I was thinking the next time I bring up my eating disorder to a doctor it will need to be an eating disorder specialist because I was just so embarrassed with him. I can see why you didnâ€™t want to talk about it with her, thatâ€™s an awkward and hard spot to be put on.   Also thatâ€™s really disregarding she didnâ€™t consider your concerns about your medication effecting you :( can you see someone else? Sometimes it can be dangerous when antidepressants have negative side effects. I had a friend who committed suicide because of his antidepressants. Not trying to freak you out! Aha, just stay safe lovey thatâ€™s all ðŸ’•.",False,False
