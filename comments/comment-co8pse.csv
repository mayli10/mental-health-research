My mom also had that whole self-conscious attitude when I was growing up, but she got skinny real quick- the secret tip is to get divorced and binge drink alcohol. Reeeeeal classy.  Of course, I have BED too, and while my family tries to brush it off as I have a “high-metabolism” as soon as they have a bad day I’m suddenly “selfish” and “need to lose some weight :)”   It’s so hard, to not yell at them, to say anything about how they raised these behaviors into us. I don’t know, just stay strong. No one wants to feel this way by binging, it’s not ourselves being gluttonous, it’s an illness.",False,False

It's traumatic watching people you love get sick and slowly die because of obesity. Out of my entire family, everyone is in the obese/morbidly obese range other than me, my brother, and my aunt, and we're all anorexic! I've always been so scared to gain weight. My family tells me how ""healthy"" I am and what a fast metabolism and good genetics I must have constantly, even though you know, we have the same genetics, I just stopped eating sweets and processed foods and soda and juice when I was 7 out of sheer terror that I'd become like them.",False,False

My mother was obese before she died, but I try not to think about it much.   She died when I was ten—of cancer—but in retrospect, she definitely had an eating disorder. :/ She was fat as a child and then skinny as fuck before she had me! Which is not all that’s led me to this conclusion of course, but. :/  Anyway. My dad.   It’s a little different with my dad because I’m grown, and he’s aging. So it worries me more than it annoys me at this point...but it does honestly just get to me sometimes?!   Probably doesn’t help that we have a Complicated Relationship anyway and being around him at all is hard! Buut he very thoughtlessly eats a king size Reese’s pretty much every night, just for funsies...and pizza or white pasta or bagels or donuts multiple times per day, every day from what I can tell...and then has the fucking audacity to criticize my food choices!!! At every given opportunity! The fuck. He also actively refuses to understand my triggers or my eating disorder in general, lol, so that’s fun. :/",False,False

It’s just my dad but he eats soooo much and he wonders why the hell hes so obese. He has absolutely zero self awareness. He brings all this junk into the house and I’m like _whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy_ , if there isn’t junk in the house than I don’t crave as bad but when there is I literally can’t stop. It’s so frustrating when I’m trying to eat healthy and good portion sizes and he’s doing the complete opposite. I’ve let both my parents know that I want to eat better but they usually just ignore me. I can’t wait until I move out and have control over the groceries and can vegan meal prep to my heart’s content.",False,False

All the women in my family are (step mom/sisters included). I took after the men, thank fuck. But the portions. Jfc. My mom will eat 3 plates full of fucking food! Granted one is a salad, but still!! Last time I visited I couldn't even finish my plate and it had nothing to do with ED brain! It was because I was staring at the ridiculous amount of food, for one person, who was shoving it in her mouth by the fork full. Literally made me nauseous to watch.",False,False
