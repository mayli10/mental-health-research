I had to pull out the first week of the semester because I had gotten too sick. I feel like I missed out where people in college meet each other. I started taking a course or two at the time, but I was isolated from other students, obsessing over my schoolwork and feeling ashamed that I wasn't normal. I finally graduated with an undergraduate degree in 2011. I never made a group of friends from college. I didn't get to explore things and my identity. At the time I was so rigid and didn't want to change, but now in my 30's, I'm finally being open to different ideas.  Being able to enjoy some my favorite foods like pizza and pasta, not to mention desserts like cake and ice cream.",False,False
