But idk about these things I’m not a surgeon  I’m just thinking what if you hypothetically still have the same appetite or if you have a binge by accident and like rupture something inside you. I get that many of us will go to extremes and hurt ourselves because of our EDs. Like I’d really be worried about a stomach rupture or ulcers somewhere in your digestive system. Because idk what type of disordered habits but for me I would fear binging and needing emergency medical attention.  Please do A LOT of research if you’re thinking of going through with this and I sincerely hope you reconsider this Don’t make any rash decisions,False,False
