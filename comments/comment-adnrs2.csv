My favorite part about it is the appetite decrease lol. ðŸ¤“  When I first started restriction I still felt hunger pangs and pain, but I've fucked up my signals so hard that I can go days without eating and not feel anything (along with the Venla).",False,False

Wellbutrin can cause mania but not as bad as SSRIs, but regardless it's very likely you need a mood stabilizer because of the nature of bipolar. I'm using lamictal as my mood stabilizer and it doesn't raise my appetite, although being less depressed makes me more hungry and it sucks. Some other anticonvulsants can be used to treat bipolar but lithium and antipsychotics are more likely. Pretty sure lithium doesn't affect appetite. If you do need to be put on one that increases weight gain it's not impossible to fight the increased appetite but if you start gaining weight quickly and tell your doctor it shouldn't alarm them of your ED. Good luck with whatever is up happening! ",False,True
