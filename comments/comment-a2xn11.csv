I can wear all the tight clothes I want after I see the scale go down a few pounds, plus when I’m restricting I just FEEL so much thinner. But the second I have one bad day or gain .4 lbs, it’s back to baggy shirts and sweatshirts over jeans. And I hate it too. ",False,True

The ED mind is so confusing. Currently I’m isolating because I’ve gained. If I was at my low safe weight, I don’t think I’d be isolating. Although, I do sort of hate social media right now so I don’t think I’d be posting photos at all. I really hate social media but that’s for another post.",False,False

No one ever expects me of having an eating disorder because I’m at a normal weight but all I see is the hugest flabbiest stomach ever. I see all of my struggles and know all my pains and yet I know that until I lose a lot of weight in a short amount of time, this whole therapy/ recovery thing is not happening. I started at a barely overweight BMI so even I am able to convince myself that this is just a healthy life decision I’m making and that only thin or obese people have REAL problems. It sucks ",False,True

She’s always posting half nude or very revealing photos of herself on her insta. She seems like she really needs validation, but her body is beautiful and she can do whatever she wants! A while ago she posted a whole blog link about her history with her eating disorder and how badly she wanted to be thin and skipping meals and all that.   I felt so horrible because I felt like I didn’t believe her and it wasn’t fair. Like, my ED made me SO ashamed of my body and it was me constantly crying over pictures of myself or body checks in the mirror. I couldn’t enjoy my body and there she is enjoying how thin she is at every turn. I just couldn’t believe the universe. I felt like she couldn’t have really suffered if I spent so many years suffering because of my own body. I thought, maybe she had a cute little issue with refusing food, but there was no way she spent a decade puking her guts out, inhaling laxatives and having panic attacks over the calories in spinach. I didn’t believe it because it didn’t seem fair.   That made me feel the shittiest of all. I’ve spent my whole life not believing I have a problem with eating. I never felt validated enough because I wasn’t thin enough to have a problem. I take one look at another person that probably suffered with all the thoughts I had and completely turn my back on them. I’m just a jealous, shitty hypocrite. ",False,False
