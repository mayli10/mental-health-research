Nobody had spoken for me for a long time and I forgot how to talk to people. Something that really helped me was to Get a job. It's forced interaction and it will make you a lot better at small talk. That's the first big step.   Also, you're 17. You're going off to college next year or the year after. That will give you an opportunity to change everything. Have you thought about where you want to go?   Nobody knows what they want to be when they're your age (hell I still don't and I have 10 years on you). But picking where to go to school is a step in the right direction. ",False,False
