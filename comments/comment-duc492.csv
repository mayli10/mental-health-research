Whereas someone who has never experienced these things just doesn't get it,False,True

Tell an alcoholic to ""just""stop drinking. Tell someone to ""just"" take their damn medication. Society in general has no clue what having any kind of mental health illness is like. And they have no interest in learning either. It's hard to not be able to wrap up a mess in a neat little package and call it good. A lot of the maladaptive behaviors come about because people developed them to help cope with extremely difficult situations. And developing healthy coping behaviors while simultaneously stopping the maladaptive ones is an extremely tall order and not really feasible.",False,False
