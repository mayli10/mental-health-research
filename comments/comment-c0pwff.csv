Also, if you're on your feet and wandering the streets more often than you normally would be, your metabolism might increase a little.   Please please PLEASE enjoy yourself. Your ED is officially suspended for this trip. However, YOU have got a date with pizza, pasta, gelato and bruschetta!  Side-note:  Pasta is a slow-releasing carb so it will probably really help to balance out your sugar levels! As for the gelato, traditional Italian style gelato is likely much better  (and less processed) than any store-bought alternative at home and you deserve it! I hate to say it but YOLO! Italy is the home of some of the most delicious fresh food on the planet.",False,False

Also a week doesn't make that much of a difference. You may gain... 2-4 pounds of actual fat? The rest is just water weight. You can also look at it as an excuse to ""shock your metabolism"" and speed it up",False,False

I wish I had some better advice for you than that. Maybe you can tell yourself you can participate in your ED when you get home? I spent an entire trip to Spain worried about food and not eating anything I actually wanted. 0/10 do not recommend. I wish you better results than I had.,False,False
