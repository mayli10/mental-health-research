I can't imagine how hard it is with kids, but it sounds like you really care about them and are a great mom. I don't really have anything else to say than lots of strength to you &lt;3.",False,False

I just never saw this as something I would struggle with well into adulthood.  That’s interesting about the demographics though.  May I ask what country you’re in?",False,True

My son is also just a couple of years younger than I was when it all started, and that is hard to wrap my head around.   I wish you the best with your cancer treatment, I’m glad you’re doing well.  I’m an oncology/chemo nurse, so I may not know your fight firsthand, but I see it every day.  I hope you know how strong you are.  I couldn’t even imagine trying to quiet that voice during such a pivotal time.  Be good to yourself, you’re worth it, and you’re not alone either.",False,True

I'm 35, developed my ED 20 fucking years ago, was fully recovered for the longest time, then all of the sudden it was the ""oh shit, here we go again"" meme.   I have a son almost the age I was when I first got really sick, and it depresses the shit out of me to think of a kid that young being so fixated on their body -- and it's just as depressing to think just how long I've been struggling with this.  I'm in the middle of chemo and doing pretty well with keeping as much weight on as possible, but every time I eat I hear that ""do you reeeeeeally need this, can't you just restrict and enjoy having a chance to be as thin as you want?"" voice.  Not that it helps much, but I hope you know you're not alone.",False,False

The most rapidly growing group of women with eating disorders here are women in their 30s to 50s. Many of them also have children. I hate the idea that EDs are for teens. It sucks that we're struggling (I'm 30, no kids yet, want some, don't know if I'll be able to have them yet), and I hope you don't drag yourself too much for sliding back into it. It happens to the best of us, and there is a way back out again.",False,False
