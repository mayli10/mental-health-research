I’m severely underweight now and it makes me so sad I can’t wear any of them and now i can only wear kids clothes from hm. I know that’s my goal but I love thrifting and I see them stuffed on the top shelf of my closet staring at me saying “eat something you dumb ass”.",False,False

I like everything to be loose and roomy on me but I also have a need to buy everything in the smallest available size. Soooo instead of sizing up to achieve the loose-fitting effect I just tell myself that I need to lose more weight for the clothes to appear baggy on me. Its fucking dumb.,False,False

I tried it on a few days ago and it fit me, which felt good for a few hours but their skinny/tight fit eventually made me feel big in them. I kept restricting after that but saw myself somehow gaining weight. Panicking, I stepped on the scale (I really, really try not to weigh myself much, or preferably at all) and it said I'd lost 200 grams since the skinny-jeans day.  Reaching GWs or fitting into my ""skinny clothes"" is to me like... false advertisement, almost. You know that kind of ad that tries to tell you that buying some lotion or mascara is going to make you a happy person? I know that I'm probably still losing weight, but every time I catch a glimpse of my reflection I look bigger.",False,False
