I've been there. For me it started as vanity and turned into me thinking I wasn't worthy.   Pretend that you had a good friend who was doing what you're doing right now - who looked unhealthy and unhappy. If that friend told you that they didn't think they were good enough, you'd want to tell them they're crazy. And that they're very very good, and that you certainly hope they don't hurt themselves.   Even if you've tried to isolate yourself, and pushed away friends and family, I promise you they are thinking about you and worrying about you. And if they knew what you were thinking about, they'd tell you you're so wonderful and valuable and be devastated to know you didn't see yourself as being as great as they did.   Treat yourself the way you'd want to treat a sick friend. With care and nurturing.",False,False
