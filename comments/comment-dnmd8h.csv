Do you think you could compromise with your ed and start taking long acting insulin or something? Even just having a little bit of insulin in your body might help and it won’t make you gain weight, I promise. I’m not sure what your treatment plan is with your endo but it might be good to talk to them about this or even a therapist if you can manage it. Honestly I wouldn’t be surprised if your endo already suspects that you’re diabulimic if you’ve lost a lot of weight recently.   Please stay as safe as you can. I know that it’s terrifying to take insulin and that your ed will tell you that you’ll gain if you take it but I promise you that you won’t.",False,False

In my experience DKA = ICU.    The longer you delay treatment, the longer you’ll probably end up in the hospital.    The first time I was IP, there was a girl with diabulimia.  It’s a different struggle and I’m thoroughly convinced it’s much harder than my own 20 year experience with various EDs. I’m really sorry you’re going through this right now. My heart breaks for you and I wish I could personally get you to the hospital so you can stop hurting. You don’t deserve to hurt. Please take care of yourself.",False,False
