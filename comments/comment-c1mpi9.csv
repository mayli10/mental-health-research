If someone's attracted to you, it's the whole of what you are that they like.  I know some men are shallow dicks, and some women, but when I think about my bf and ex bfs none of them were conventionally ""good looking"" or had a ""perfect"" body.  The things seen as flaws are things that we consider cute when we really like/love someone.  I remember the first time sleeping with someone new and there's no denying everyone must have hang ups about their body, but it's been surprising when they've commented how such a thing about my body turned them on (at all weights I've been) when I've thought it was a really horrible feature.  The bf I've been with for years and years now has seen me be borderline overweight through to skinny THREE times.  He's only ever concerned about my health and he's said he's never stopped fancying me whatever weight I was at.  Now I'm trying to recover and slowly gaining weight, I don't like how my body looks because it really isn't looking good (I actually think too thin isn't a good look on anyone), but he makes me feel okay about it and doesn't say anything triggering ever about my weight.  We shouldn't worry, but we do.  I hope that if you're making this guy your regular boyfriend your relationship blossoms.  He's obviously very into you!",False,False

So I met my current boyfriend at a bar. He later told me that the reason he noticed me at the bar was my looks.   I mean, he knows about my ED issues, and knows how sometimes I'll get ED-triggered just because I'm lying in bed naked next to him.   I also think I've almost stopped shaving my legs since I started dating him. He doesn't give a fuck, and I wear pants at work.",False,False

I didn‚Äôt want to skip it since he got his and I know it gets awkward when only one person is eating.   So I got mine and started guesstimating what is ‚Äòsafe‚Äô to eat since there was no nutrition label. I ended up deeming the crackers and fruit worthy and we traded his fruit cup for my pasta dish. I was thinking whether to add the butter to my cracker and I guess I was thinking really hard because he said to me, ‚Äúyou know, guys don‚Äôt care that much for girls to worry so much‚Äù  This was when I was obsessed with looking perfect for guys... any guy .... any person actually so his words struck a chord with me. I don‚Äôt remember his face but I try to remind myself once a while what he said.",False,False
