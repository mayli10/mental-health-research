In previous attempts I allowed weight loss to be my only goal; every day I was just waiting till I could eat or waiting till I could weigh. But you can’t build a life around that, and it’s also not sustainable. It needs to be something I can do unconsciously and passively and it cannot be the focus of my goals.   So I’m trying to hang out with more people. That should count for something. ",False,False
