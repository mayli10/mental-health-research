I think it might be because I neglected brushing my teeth until I was around 11-12 and I found out about gum disease because my parents were worried they'd also get gum disease from smoking cigarettes. They also didn't give a shit about me brushing my teeth at the time and they also didn't know until this year that my teeth are sensitive apparently.  I remember being 6-7 years old and telling my mom about how I couldn't eat ice cream because it hurt my teeth and all I remember her saying was ""Me too. Our teeth are sensitive.""",False,False

Like, it’s never a battle worth fighting but just...sigh...it’s such a specious argument. Like, if you wanna chug sugar water go to town, but don’t be the jerk trying glorify your choice by slamming other people’s choices. No form of Coca-Cola is a health product! And in the scheme of ‘dangerous’ things we eat/drink/breathe/touch...the additives in Coca-Cola are background noise.   But I don’t say that stuff. Sigh. Maybe someday. I’ll make really solid eye contact, say “everything is chemicals,” and take a long slow sip of coke zero.",False,False
