The kind when you stand up too fast or the ""common faint"" kind?  The first kind happens to me a lot. You stand up too quickly and get dizzy and your vision kinda goes grey or black It's usually dehydration or low blood pressure.  The second kind only happened to me once in an enclosed space with that was kinda hot. I was already standing and suddenly I felt dizzy, my heart was racing, I felt like I couldn't get enough air, everything went hazy and I got confused and my knees buckled. My husband had practically had carry me out of there to some fresh air.  Neither were from calorie restriction but yeah 500 isn't healthy.",False,False

You might find that when your appetite is suppressed you can return to having a healthy appetite with food. I get really nauseous when I eat too much since I started taking an amphetamine for my ADHD. I had been endlessly hungry for weeks when I started taking it and I don't know why. Now I stop eating when I'm full. This has been really good for me overall I think. I saw online that amphetamines are also used to treat obesity, so if you make a case that you want to get ahead of this issue before it gets out of hand and that you think the change to your eating habits are related to your trauma and therefore a symptom of mental illness than you might be able to try something. I personally find that knowing I'm not going to overeat makes it easier for me to eat whatever I want. I bought a box of cookies the other day even though I have expressly avoid dessert foods for such a long time due to my anorexia. I just knew that I would only have one or two max in a day if I started feeling peckish and that it would safe for me to have a whole box on hand. My ravenous appetite wouldn't lead me to eat the whole dozen in one sitting. I actually ended up eating less than I expected even. I only ate them because I was hungry and I wanted to, not just because there was food nearby and it was tempting. I feel like that's the definition of having a healthy relationship with food. I'm not totally better just because of this medication, I still worry about eating too much, but I also have GI problems so I feel like worrying about calories is actually kind of important for me. Sometimes it can be counterproductive, but mostly it just keeps me from ended up in the condition I'm in tonight.",False,False

It was only triggered by being outside in the late summer sun during cheer practice. i felt my vision go fuzzy since i think i hadnt eaten since the night before.  On the other hand, i realized the power of eating. I think you can undo the damage a bit. My grades had a bit of a downward trend this semester but i was finally able to focus by eating to maintenance. I just started exam week now but i think ive done a bit better this time around . :)",False,False
