Not everyone gets all side effects from any meds. No medicine will force you to eat more. If you're underweight, stimulating your appetite could even be a healthy thing (I know, I know). But I agree the prescriber should have reviewed the possible side effects with you. But almost all antidepressants carry this risk to one extent or another, yet most people don't gain weight. I'd give the med a try before you decide no. You can always stop it later.",False,False

Usually anti depressants only cause about 10% body mass weight gain and it's easily avoidable if you just watch yourself. However Citalopram make me loose weight. I had no appetite after that. If you find an anti depressant that makes your brain feel more comfortable you will probably have a lot easier of a time loosing weight because you won't be comfort eating (that how I gained all my weight)!,False,False

I have refused anti depressants before because they have caused me to gain weight, however, there are some that may not trigger that side effect with you. It might be a lot of trial and error, but I’m sure your doctor will be willing to work with you. Your comfort and safety is the most important thing, and if finding a weight neutral antidepressant is important to you, then you don’t need to compromise :)     Good luck!!",False,False

Dr. Google will tell you that almost all the antidepressants cause weight gain...but low appetite to begin with is a side effect of depression and anxiety for many, so it's very hard to tease out what is significant for *actually* causing weight gain versus normalizing appetite in depressed and/or anxious folks. The energizing antidepressants have the lowest profile for weight gain, but those aren't good for sleep or anxiety...because they are energizing. It sounds like she is trying a mellowing antidepressant, and Remeron (mirtazapine) is good for that, and it is really great for sleep to boot.  I will say that any doc would rather you be upfront with fears that will cause you to be non-compliant with meds, because they would rather develop a new game plan than have you go untreated. You won't make them angry. And she may be able to assuage your fears about the weight gain and cravings. Theres a big dose range with this med, and she is likely starting you low...you may not notice any appetite changes, to be honest.   Please give your doc a call. You won't upset her. At the end of the day, she just wants you to feel better and you need to feel okay with the game plan for that to happen. Best wishes to you!",False,False

Your concerns are valid and it’s normal to be a bit phased by side effect profiles. Bear in mind that pretty much every side effect ever noted in the clinical trials gets reported, even if it was in a small % of people or a small effect. (Which is why weight gain is listed as a side effect in so many psych meds.) Your doctor will hopefully have more specific info for the particular antidepressant they’re suggesting for you.    Alternately, once they understand your concerns, they might suggest a different med. There’s a whole slew of antidepressants out there, quite a few of which are statistically weight-neutral. It’s unlikely they’re trying to trick or manipulate you - it would be pretty darn unethical for them to prescribe a med for an effect they don’t tell you about. If they actually did that...maybe time to consider a different doc. Best of luck! I hope whichever med you end up trying proves helpful.",False,False

Even with great doctors, you still have to speak up and advocate for yourself.  They’ll always put your mental health before weight issues.   What I would do personally is start the new med, closely monitor your weight and if you see it going up call your doc.  You can ask abt Topamax which is a great add-on drug to counteract weigh gain caused by other meds.  At least that’s what I was told.  It reduces appetite.  For me it has no other side effects. If you’re interested...my holy grail drugs now after much tweaking over the years are Effexor 150, topamax 50 (2x) gabapentin 400mg (2x) trazodone 50mg (to sleep).  I’ve been sober and panic attack free for 3 years &amp; my weight has been where I want it.  Congratulations on the weight loss!!",False,False

My doctor seems really keen on this one (Mirtazapine), especially as it’ll help my anxiety and sleeping, but there’s so much online about the weight gain it causes.
