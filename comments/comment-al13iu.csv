It sucks cause I feel like I’m really limiting myself, but I also feel like I can’t justify the cost or the extra calories. Then there are times when I buy something and it goes bad because I’m saving it for when I deserve it and obviously I never deserve food...",False,False

If you want to keep it low cal you can make amazing things with vegetables. The trick is spices. You really have to work a lot with them, I'd especially recommend looking into Thai cuisine. They do *a lot* with vegetables and spices and honestly one of the best meals I've ever had was an all vegetable stir-fry my Thai aunt threw together spontaneously in about ten minutes. They really know how to make vegetables taste like a gourmet meal.  Other than that, I've found that you can use psyllium husk fibre powder as a substitute for oatmeal. Make it with almond milk, throw in some fruits and you have yourself a warm, comfortable bowl of morning oatmeal. (which will make your next dump huuuuuuge). ",False,False
