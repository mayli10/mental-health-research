My grandma borrowed my scale and I never got it back, so I’m cutting my losses. I don’t care about the number on the scale, (I do but not right now &gt; &gt;) I normally measure myself every few weeks. You can do that if you’re looking for measures of losing fat + gaining muscle, but I’d recommend doing it every few weeks or you’d get frustrated when there’s little to no difference.",False,False

That would be easy for me because I have enough restraint to eat at what I think is a calorie deficit. My biggest goal now is to get that shredded, lean, striated, vascular bodybuilder dickskin level conditioning. Before my ED, I found I just naturally had that and could maintain it, but after all the binging it’s impossibly hard to lean out in that way. I think I actually am “sOmEwHaT” skinny, but my skin is super pudgy and flabby.",False,True

And I wouldn't trust skin-pinching as indicators of weight loss because so much can affect that- bloating, clothes, even just the position your body is in at any given moment. Photos might be more reliable, though that could also lead to obsession. In the end, try to remind yourself the cold hard facts: you are eating at a caloric deficit, so you cannot NOT be losing weight. It's physically impossible.",False,False
