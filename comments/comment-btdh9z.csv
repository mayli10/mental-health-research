I ate 300 to 900 cal/day for the last month and in over this weekend I managed to eat about 4000 cal/day. Freaking road trip. Trapped in a car with granola bars sweet cakes and candy, stopping places to eat. I want to surgically remove my stomach. I am too afraid to step on the scale.",False,False

Amazing how terrifying that food was to me even the day before I ordered it. It scared me and now I feel ruined and I’ll be hungry for the rest of the day even though I know I’d still be in a deficit if I ate. Don’t really have any tips, just want to say I understand and am in the same boat.",False,False
