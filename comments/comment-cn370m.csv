I'm trying to recover from AN/BP and have gained around 5kg. I go to the dentist and the first thing the nurse says as she sees me is ""you got fatter!"".   What I notice though is that these comments only come from overweight strangers (that nurse was overweight herself as well). Maybe you gaining weight made them feel better about themselves when before, they had been jealous of the way you looked.",False,False

Second of all, I prefer to fight underhanded assholery with more underhanded assholery. These people are banking on you getting upset and it sounds like they like it.  “Oh, you’re getting nice and fat, eh?”  *Yep! Hoping to be as big as you soon.*",False,False

Someone told me my husband would leave me if I don't lose weight. My mom said I should be a ""plus-sized"" model as some sort of backhanded compliment? Idk. I just responded that I'm not plus-sized and ended that conversation.   I'm sorry, I feel your frustration, and next time we'll both just tell them to fuck off.",False,False

I’d suggest moving elsewhere, but every culture is kinda rude one way or another.  In the US, it’s passive-aggressive body commentary:  strangers commenting on your food choices, telling you to eat more because you look sick/too skinny, casually asking if you’re pregnant, or recoding body-shaming in positive language by calling you “brave” and “curvy”.  My boyfriend’s Indian grandmother will greet people by announcing whether they’ve gained or lost weight since she last saw them. One of her grandkids was sitting on the same couch as her and she loudly sighed that it was a pity the girl was getting too big because she could be beautiful otherwise.   This is all a long way of saying there really are assholes everywhere.",False,False
