I kind of actually stopped chewing gum because I was spending way too much money on it, but I think I still have a pack somewhere in my bedroom.",False,False

It's what I used to do when I was heavy into B/P",False,False

The bacteria produce acidic gasses as a by-product of using sugars as fuel. These acidic by-products then lower the pH level of your enamel, causing it to temporarily weaken. Eventually the enamel will corrode through in weak spots where bacteria can hide and duplicate easily, causing a cavity.  It doesn't matter whether you swallow the food you chew or not, the bacteria living on your teeth will still get their fuel to thrive and eventually cause cavities. C/s is almost as harmful as b/p in terms of cavities, because cavities that people get from b/p still come from bacteria multiplying and feeding off of binge food, not directly from stomach acid. Stomach acid from purging does damage teeth in the long term and makes them more prone to sensitivity and cavities, but any short term cavity problems are always a result of tooth bacteria using binge food as fuel.  The body's natural protection against cavities and enamel damage is saliva. You can chew sugarless gum after c/s to stimulate saliva production, which helps neutralize acidity, mechanically grinds away bacteria from tooth surfaces and flushes away sugars that bacteria would otherwise use as fuel.",False,False

I'm not sure if that's correct, but that's what I understood about the harms of C/S. ",False,False
