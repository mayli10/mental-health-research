When I went in I needed to weight restore pretty significantly, so that truly was the most difficult part for me. At one point I was on 5,000 calories a day and I cried almost every meal just because of how hard it was. Everyone who works there is really amazing at what they do though, and itâ€™s a group therapy based treatment which I thought worked really well for me. ",False,False

I wish you all the love and support on your journey. Although even if you donâ€™t wish to recover yet, you could still benefit from aspects of a recovery program. And who knows? Maybe taking that step would be what you needed to start down that road. Ultimately, youâ€™re choice.  Even if an application asks you do not have to disclose. Thereâ€™s also usually an option that says you choose not to respond as well. Individuals with disabilities have a lot of laws protecting them. Usually those questions on apps are for the WOTC tax credit, employers can receive discounts and other tax breaks for hiring disabled individuals.  In both regards, it is ultimately your decision. If you do not wish to disclose, you have no legal obligation to do so. And if you choose not to disclose or decline to answer, you can still go to HR at a later date to disclose for accommodations if you wish.",False,False

The program is partial hospitalization, but I spent the night at the center every night. It didnâ€™t affect my progress on schoolwork, and my job saved my position for me when I came back.

I provided them proof of the facility I would be staying at, and the ADA requires that your professors make accommodations for you to complete your coursework.
