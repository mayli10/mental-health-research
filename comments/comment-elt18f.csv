This page is really supportive but sometimes I do feel like there are comments that are slight humble brags of whoâ€™s sicker. I wish that wasnâ€™t the case but  it happens. Regardless I completely understand your feelings and you shouldnâ€™t feel bad about feeling that way. ðŸ’• Also please rest up!! Your body is trying to tell you that it is unwell and that you need some rest. Sending good vibes and love!!!,False,False
