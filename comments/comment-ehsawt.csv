I either eat all of my food prepared in the form of a porridge or soup fashion in a bowl. I honestly don’t like sandwiches or wraps because they appear less filling since I’ve always been a super fast eater.  If you feel it’s necessary, then have some sandwiches, but don’t obligate yourself to eating everything for the sake of being “normal”  I’ve learned that eating what you “truly” want is the best option, don’t be afraid of sandwiches but don’t make it your mission to eat sandwiches for the sake of “breaking an Ed behavior”  Best of love to you!",False,False
