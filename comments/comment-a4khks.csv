My brain is in a state of “well if restricting isn’t doing anything might as well just binge” and it’s so confusing right now :/",False,True

It's so hard to see the same number every day, but just remember that if you're eating at a deficit you WILL lose weight. Sometimes it just takes time for things to settle.",False,False

If you ovulate immediately post period you can see an uptick on the scale or stay stagnant a few days longer. Everyone’s different.  But I’d say try a maintenance (or close to) day even if it’s just for self care / mental health. It can’t hurt. ,False,False

You may also want to cut carbs and increase protein (carbs cause water retention).  Sometimes a normal intake day shakes things lose. Not sure why, but it’s worked for me.  I’ve read it’s only really a plateau at 4+ weeks with no fluctuations.",False,False
