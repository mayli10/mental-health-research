You deserve to be with someone who loves you and is considerate enough to treat your ED with care and support. My boyfriend struggled a lot at first when I first started relapsing, he would get upset with me when I would express unhealthy thought patterns surrounding food. But he would never make me feel self conscious about my body. He took the time and effort on his own to research the ways in which he could best support me. Sometimes it almost feels enabling, but he‚Äôs created an environment where I can feel comfortable talking to him about it, and he gently urges me to seek out professional help at the same time. The only time I don‚Äôt feel ashamed over my body is when I‚Äôm with him. Only you can make the decision to remove yourself from a relationship that negatively effects your eating disorder and the way you view your body, but know that there are people out there who are capable and willing of being supportive, loving partners. You deserve to be with a supportive and loving partner.",False,False

Anyone that truly loves you would never say that because they‚Äôd never want to make you feel shitty. Please don‚Äôt let your self esteem be so low that you put up with behaviour like that.

Just saying but there's a pretty good chance he's shitty in a lot of other ways- call him out on it, and either have him change to not be a scumbag, or just leave him. You deserve better.   &amp;#x200B;     \* disclaimer you're also not bad if you choose to tough it out, but it's probably gonna be a lot tougher on your mental health.
