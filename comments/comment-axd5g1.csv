It's very context dependent.  Here are just 2 examples with some of the variables.     Case 1: you've been eating below your TDEE (""dieting"") and your body fat is lower than what would be considered optimal (most women physiologically function best around 20-25% bf) and you start eating above your new (lower, like you said) TDEE and you aren't lifting weights or doing any extra activity (which would increase your TDEE), then the extra calories will first go to fat stores, yes.  Case 2: You were dieting and and your body fat is lower than optimal, but not by much (say, around 18-20%) and you start eating above your new TDEE, but most of those additional calories are from lean protein AND you are now lifting weights several times a week in a way that is challenging to your muscles, then most of those extra calories will go to building muscles, but some will still go to fat, thogh much less.    Hope that makes sense!",False,False

I did notice a lower result on the first page about the National Eating Disorders Association. That does sound right. I also didn't know what a weight set point was, so I had to Google that. Despite the first result claiming it's ""legit"", the way they described it made it clear that it's obviously bullshit. It's always possible to lose more weight. If you plateau it's because you've reached a weight where you TDEE is your maintenance calories amount. Also that sounds like the opposite of something you should tell people with eating disorders. If you say that it will get harder to lose weight the more you diet people are just going to start trying even harder to lose weight.

But you seem to have deliberately let my point go in one ear and out the other, Mr. \[insert credentials\]. Of course the human body will obey the laws of thermodynamics, however the metabolism can adapt to make fat gain easier. Psychologically, dieting tends to cause changes that lead to overeating. The yo-yo dieters suffer from these combined effects and over time get fatter as they cycle between restricting and binging.

Not even possible.  This is a myth that has gotten passed along that started as something loosely rooted in actual science fact, but like in the game of telephone, slow changes to the wording result in something that not only doesn't resemble the original, but is completely false.  Dieting, restricting calories, eating a deficit, whatever you want to call it, simply CANNOT increase body fat over time, PERIOD.  Dieting etc CAN, however, make your body more likely to gain fat first, WHEN AND/OR IF you start eating more.   But that's just basic science.  If your body fat drops low enough, the first thing your body will do when it gets enough calories is store fat as opposed to muscle.
