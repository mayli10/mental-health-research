A few people I've met who have been diagnosed with eating disorders had literally no idea that's what they were doing to themselves - they just thought they were normal, or at least, normal for them. So it doesn't matter whether your friend considers herself to have an ED or not, I think you were in the right. I really hope she listens to you and can respect that this has been really stressful for you - if she doesn't reply then maybe try reaching out to her and asking her if she'd like to discuss it so that you can hear her side, so you can both explain what you need and what boundaries you want to set up.  If she doesn't reply then w/e she can go fish for sandwich-pushing somewhere else lol",False,False

What makes it worse is that my other friends also talk about it like like ‚Äúoh you know kate(fake name) she‚Äôs not gonna be hungry.‚Äù I know that I‚Äôm just jealous but I can‚Äôt stand it.,False,False

I know a few girls who act that way but they are very okay with food and are very thin. It‚Äôs really weird. She might just be inconsiderate and oblivious to EDs and she‚Äôs just bragging about not eating.  However, she might really have an ED and she‚Äôs either upset about it and doesn‚Äôt think anyone understands it so she‚Äôs expressing her frustration. Or she‚Äôs complaining about not eating but doesn‚Äôt realize that it‚Äôs a problem",False,False
