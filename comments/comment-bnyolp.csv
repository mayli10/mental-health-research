I'm a healthy weight and when I restrict I still eat 1500 calories (5'10 so yeah, that still gives me a 500 calorie deficit on active days).   On the other hand, all that says nothing. I don't actually need to lose anymore weight, but if I eat at maintenance I will lose my mind and spiral into endless anxiety and self-loathing.
