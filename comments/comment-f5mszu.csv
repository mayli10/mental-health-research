I was like “thanks I want to die now” in my head.",False,False

He was extremely uncomfortable and judgy about it, couldn’t tell the difference between anorexia and boulimia, and sent me to some psychologist that had no experience with eating disorders  But the one I have now (a young woman, coincidentally?) is so sweet and understanding and provided me te help I needed :)",False,False

I feel so bad because I wanted no part of recovery and I just kept showing up an absolute nightmare. They knew exactly what was going on and that I wasn’t ready to get better. They just tried to meet me where I was at. It’s so sad, I don’t know how they do it :( I hope the best for your sister and OP I hope the best for you too ❤️",False,False

I do know doctors who just won't address it unless the person actually indicates they want help because it's a lot of time and energy for them to try to help someone who doesn't want to recover. It sounds sad but my family doctor has been trying to help my sister for years now and he dreads seeing her because ultimately, he can't do anything other than stress himself out that she's so unwell. Anything he does for her, she won't comply with. I hope you're doing okay.",False,False
