I genuinely mourn sometimes that I canâ€™t eat it without being reminded of how afraid of it Iâ€™ve been and it tasting different and *bad* even though itâ€™s my fucking favorite. I hate myself for letting this happen.,False,False

But then I make myself eat them anyway and I re-adjust LOL. Other things seem to come and go without any reason - like I started off not really liking white Monster and preferred another one, then I fell in love with it and didn't like my other favourite any more, and now I'm back to thinking Monster is too fake/sweet and my old fav is the best. I mean maybe they simultaneously switched the recipes and then simultaneously switched them back but that seems a little too tinfoil to me ðŸ¤”  In short, yeah, I think going without certain foods for a period of time will change how you taste them when you do eat them again, just like eating a food more will change how you taste it. And then some foods just always hit the same no matter how long it's been, lmao.",False,False
