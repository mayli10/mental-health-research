There are certain foods that I can only eat if I’m outside. I can’t eat around other people except for my SO. If I eat something I have to report it to him as well as logging it, or else it feels sneaky. I can eat my calories but I can’t drink them, even if I’m binging. It’s a rollercoaster haha.",False,False

I just have these random rules around food. Is it in the fridge? Not safe. Is it in the freezer? Safe. Is it savory? Not safe. Is it sweet? Safe.,False,True

When I was first getting into this mess I had a deep aversion to eating anything the colour white because I thought if it was white, it was fattening: creamy sauces, bread, rice, etc. It was nonsensical, cauliflower is white ffs.   I’ve gone through periods of what you describe in your first couple of paragraphs as well, where it’s barely even about the weight, it just feels like eating anything at all is a Bad Idea (tm) and it would be safer to just not do that at all. Like there’s no safe way to eat so just to be on the safe side I won’t.",False,False

Does that sound similar to what you're describing? I don't know if it has a specific name but it definitely seems to be correlated with disordered eating, at least.",False,False
