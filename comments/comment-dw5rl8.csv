I always thought (tricked myself into thinking?) that I was in control, that I was choosing to eat like this because I couldn't lose ewight unless I heavily restricted, because all my other attempts at losing weight ""healthily"" took so long and nobody even noticed my glacial weightloss.  But I was at a restaurant the other day with my partner that's a date location for the two of us that I was really looking forward to and I saved all my calories for and I was looking at the menu and I felt my face go numb looking at the calorie counts. And in the end I panicked and couldn't even split a dessert with them bc it all seemed like too much even though I knew what I wanted and bc I'd saved my calories I knew I could ""afford"" it but it was all too much, too much...  The fucked up thing is that even though this feeling terrifies me and I can feel myself becoming more and more anxious around high-calorie foods, even though my brain was yelling at me in the restaurant ""This is bad, this is too far, don't lose your ability to just eat like a normal person sometimes, just order this thing and split it"" I don't want to stop. I don't want to gain weight or stop losing so I'm going to keep going",False,False

She doesn't know about my ED and would probably never suspect, since I binge on fast food with her every time we see each other (thankfully it's like once a month). We're about a similar size usually but she dropped like 20 pounds this year because of some health issues and now she keeps updating me when she gains, which just kills me because even with the gain she still weighs a LOT less than me. She doesn't do it maliciously or anything, she prefers how she looks at a higher weight and I guess she just wants to tell me the ""good news"" or something, but I still hate it and I just really don't want to know her numbers.  I usually just answer politely and change the subject but she keeps doing it. I don't want to ""show my weakness"" and let her know I have a problem with my weight. Is there any way I could stop her from doing it?",False,False
