The only person who knows is my best friend, we go through everything together, and it feels like this disorder is the only thing we don't have in common. I can't say I know the experience of someone who overeats, but just looking at my body and asking ""have you eaten?"" makes me really self-conscious. It feels like the equivalent of seeing someone has gained weight and saying, ""how much do you eat?"" Like, should I be thicker? I'm not even THAT skinny, I'm just underweight, which I guess typing out sounds stupid, maybe I am that skinny. Either way, if I say yes it gets her off my back but I'd probably be lying, and if I say no she'll be scared for me until I put something in my mouth which will make me just as nervous as her seeing me not eat. It's one of the only problems in our friendship, and it's entirely my fault. Wish I didn't have this sometimes.",False,False
