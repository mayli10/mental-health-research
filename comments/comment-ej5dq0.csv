Also I don't get the people here being like ""don't overthink sweatie"". Like of course you know that he probably didn't mean it like that, he was just awkwardly trying to make smalltalk. Doesn't change what he said or how tactless it was. You have a right to be annoyed and frustrated lmao  Still, what a total bellend. For what it's worth I think this was one of those ""It's safe for me to say it because it's so obviously untrue"" kind of things. But it still hurts.",False,False

It is what most people pick as one of their resolutions. Of course, there is the possibility that it was targeted to you ( I don't know in what manner they spoke to you as I wasn't there, but....:/). Try not to dig too deep and overanalyze tho.",False,False
