Yes I agree calling a treatment center would be something that could be beneficial? I just feel like I don’t want to do that unless my therapist suggested it, I feel like I’m being dramatic.  I guess I worded my post incorrectly, I just feel like she’s not going to be enough to fix this ED and idk what will be enough. When I’m left to my own devices I just literally do whatever I want. Idk how to get it out of my brain it’s so engraved",False,True

I think it’s relatively common to somehow hold the feelings of being hopeless and not-sick-enough. But they’re not true. and I don’t think your therapist will tell you she doesn’t know what to do with you anymore... maybe she’d say that *if* you’re refusing/incapable of making changes but then you can find someone else. New person, new approach, new experiences and ways of thinking, communicating etc. Its fairly common to meet more than one therapist before finding one that works for you.   Idk what country you live in but could you consider calling a treatment center (in the US) for a level of care assessment? Last I knew they are free and there’s no obligation to go to that program.   I believe there’s hope for you. :)",False,False
