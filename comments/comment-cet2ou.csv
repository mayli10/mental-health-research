Before I started recovering, I actually didnâ€™t do a ton of exercise besides being in dance class once a week and gym class in school. I think Iâ€™ve actually developed exercise addiction over the years as a coping mechanism. Iâ€™m now freaked out if I donâ€™t get at least 25K steps per day and Iâ€™m worried because I wonâ€™t be able to work out as much soon since Iâ€™m starting full time at my job. Anyway, taking rest days is a GOOD thing and it wonâ€™t really have an impact on your weight at all. It will actually put less stress on your body so you might not even experience weight gain just from cutting back on exercise. Logically I can say this, but itâ€™s a whole other thing convincing myself that Iâ€™ll be fine exercising less ðŸ™ƒ   As for the second part of your question, I really just wanted to prove to myself and my family that I could do it on my own, so I did. I lived on my own for 4 years (plus 4 years in college when I would go home on weekends occasionally and breaks) and only had minor relapses. I donâ€™t know if that helps you, but itâ€™s what motivated me.",False,False
