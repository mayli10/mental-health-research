I do the cooking though which makes me feel better even though I always overeat anyway.  I have a gluten allergy and can usually use it as an excuse to avoid eating lots of stuff at other holidays. I eat my parents’ food but am not comfortable with my husbands’ family’s food/cooking/catering and that gives me an out. If you don’t see your family really often you can say you are doing some kind of elimination diet for health reasons and can’t eat x things. If you live at home with your parents and this is clearly not something you can do, offer to help cook and/or suggest menu ideas. Like when I have to do something with MIL I bring a salad.  Edit: sorry I just saw from your flair that you’re 15. Offer to help cook/plan the menu—it can relieve a lot of food stress",False,False
