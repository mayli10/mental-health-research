Albeit it was 'just' for recovery and not to fight another illness. I found it so hard to gain. I hated my body. I hated myself. When I went a little over I hated myself more. But my body seemed to settle 2 kgs above the weight that was on paper. I tried to lose those 2 lke 10 times but gained it back every time. So one day I said fuck it I wanna be normal. And I could let go of my obsession with those kgs. I felt ok in my body. Not immediately but I grew to accept and love. Hope you will experience the same thing.,False,False

I feel better so I know it's a good thing, it's just the numbers trip me up. I wanted to try and stop weighing myself to move away from my number obsession, but now that my doctor has given me a goal weight I have to meet I have to weigh myself to check because there's pressure to reach 115 asap :/",False,True
