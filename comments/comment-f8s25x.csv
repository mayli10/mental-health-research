Theres so many foods i was never allowed to have and didnt eat at all growing up as an adult i could binge a whole thing of in one go. Sugary cereals and just good classic name brand snacks will always be my downfall because i remember im an adult and my mom isnt there to tell me its not allowed anymore. But i have to remind myself that im not a kid anymore and have to teach myself how to eat like a grown up,False,True

Not being allowed any junk food or sweets, being constantly told not to eat something because of the sugar content. I did a week long juice cleanse with my parents when I was only 14, and my dad did month long fasts and even all raw-food diets all throughout my teens.  When I went into treatment for anorexia my first year of college, the first thing my mom said when we sat down with my nutritionist was that she didn’t like me drinking the boost supplements because they had x grams of sugar in them. Not only did it contribute to me developing AN, but also my obsession with sugary food and junk food that I was never allowed to have growing up.",False,False

It literally was almost like my family just normalised bingeing. My parents, mainly my mum, would be really strict with what I ate because I was always a chubby kid, to the point that I was embarassed to show my lunch box to other kids. But if we went out to a buffet (which was a regular occurrence) we were expected to overeat to the point of discomfort, but still berate ourselves for overeating.",False,False

She would still make like cookies and date bars and things, but she always stressed that it was good to know everything that goes into your food.  I also had immune system problems as a kid and had constant impetigo and staph infections, cuts and scratches I would get would never heal, my nose would bleed, I had asthma, and I was just kind of sickly.  Because of this, she was always trying to boost my immune system, so she'd put these natural ointments on my skin along with my antibacterial creams, and I, too, had to take a daily regimen of disgusting supplements.  I remember the medicine-like smells of the supplements and ointments very vividly, and the texture of gel caps and the strange herbal burps I'd get after taking them.",False,False

My mum works out religiously -sometimes more than 5 hours a day- and barely eats anything because she is convinced that the female body can’t possibly need more than 1000 calories a day. Her diet is also almost limited to just vegetables and fruit. When I was a kid she would let us eat relatively normal but as soon as I hit my preteen years it got really crazy and she would sometimes yell at me for eating things like bread (I didn’t even eat a crazy amount of it).   Thinking about this really makes me wonder how I’m gonna teach my future children (if I’ll ever have any) to have a normal relationship with food and not obsess over it.,False,False
