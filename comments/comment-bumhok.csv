Of course she's gonna weigh the least being the shortest.  All three of those women probably have ED's tbh,False,False

She made everyone say their weight just so she could brag about herself and feel superior! What an arrogant and condescending person. She should be supporting her family members instead of feeling superior.  Do you think you would want to go low-contact or no-contact with your grandmother? And maybe other relatives if they also act like her. Also if you need to rant feel free to PM me &lt;3,False,False

Then she says she's below 90lbs like it's some fucking badge of honor. "" What the fuck? Honestly that seems like the kinda thing that would be in an artsy ED short film or like... Black Mirror, Jesus, that must be such a fucking surreal screwed-up ceremonial thing to sit and witness.",False,False

What a sad legacy.   If at all possible, I’d suggest keeping some distance while you are contemplating or starting recovery, until you’re in a more stable place. It’s hard(er) when the triggers are right in your face and so much of the disorder thoughts is reflected right back at you by people you’re supposed to be able to look up to. Their values don’t have to be your values though, remember that.",False,False

To be so focused on being underweight as a source of achievement/value that you’ll waylay a family gathering and put other people in an uncomfortable position all to try to feel ok about yourself? Maybe I’m projecting, but that seems like a hollow person invested in their own distorted reality.  To put it succinctly, screw their notions. You do you, in ways that you find to be healthy and sustainable for you.  And in 60 years, sit at a dining table surrounded by your own family, genuinely enjoying a meal and talking about something 1000x more interesting than scale numbers.",False,False
