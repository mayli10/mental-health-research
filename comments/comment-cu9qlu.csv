Telling me that I‚Äôve lost too much weight and I‚Äôm looking gaunt and sick is encouraging the sickness. (Never mind the fact that it‚Äôs complete bullshit, I am not underweight.) Telling me you can feel my bones is making me sicker. This cunt in my head WANTS me to starve to death. Telling me that I look skinny is fueling my obsession because it feels like it‚Äôs succeeding. Interrogating me about whether or not I just purged every time I go to the fucking toilet is just encouraging me to keep lying about it. Why don‚Äôt people get it??? No matter how many times I explain?   Just. Stop. Commenting. On. My. Body. And. My. Eating.   Fucks sake! I‚Äôm trying my best to do damage control and not get worse. I‚Äôm already hyper focused on my food intake and my body. I don‚Äôt need more attention drawn to it because I fucking KNOW.   And the most infuriating thing is that I am not skinny enough for them to be worrying like this, it‚Äôs only because they know I‚Äôm restricting, I bet if I was just a gym rat obsessed with healthy food people would be praising my body. In fact I know that, because I‚Äôve been there. No one cared that I was underweight because they saw me eating a few times a day, even though I was exercising it all off and more. I was ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù and ‚Äúdisciplined‚Äù. The double standards are doing my head in.    I wish I had never gotten honest with my mum and SO. I was suffering and I wanted help in a moment of weakness but all it‚Äôs done is make everything worse.",False,False

I feel so weird &amp; conflicted right now - recently I made the switch from 48-60hr fasts to OMAD &gt;!(limit 400/day)!&lt;, and was also attempting to kick my laxative addiction with the help of my SO (it's been 2-3 weeks since taking any, and I'd been abusing stimulant laxatives for months until then).  I don't exercise at all (want to start soon), and my net average for food intake is &gt;!~250 day!&lt; according to MFP. (I'm an alcoholic &amp; don't log my alcohol calories. Also I've been out of work for a while due to a whole host of reasons, and generally am completely sedentary/in bed most of the day so i've been maintaining).  Someone helped me out with cash recently, since I'm finally starting a new job &amp; it's my dream job, but it involves being on my feet/being active all day so 1) i'm scared (one flight of stairs makes my heart race. Hell, just standing up makes me almost topple over most days), and 2) the first thing I did with the money was buy laxatives. Also, I wanted to treat my SO to dinner tonight for my OMAD, and although the food we're getting should be safe enough (i.e. i can get away with mostly eating veggies), I'm scared about not having the exact calorie count.  Idk, sorry, this is super lame &amp; all over the place, but I'm having anxiety/racing thoughts about this dinner and like....how to progress from here and start losing again, and I'm just kind of freaking out.
