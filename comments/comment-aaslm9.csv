If nothing is mentioned I will usually just drop hints about my mental issues, be it ED, anxiety, suicidal ideation, etc.   I have really lucked out when people notice it, they are shocked at first (scarring is very severe) but in the end they just want to understand. But I know that there are folks who are more callous out there. ",False,False

He was diagnosed with schizophrenia, but that's a very broad term of a disease and I don't think it's very descriptive of what he goes through. From what I understand of it when going through puberty something about it caused his brain to change. It just sounds very similar to what you have going on. He's always been the type to not eat when he's upset too, but his primary coping mechanism is drinking. They got worse for a while and peaked when he was 21 and has been slowing since then. He's 26 now and it will only happen to him now if he gets extremely stressed out.
