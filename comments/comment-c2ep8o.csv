But it sounds like he's a super sweet and caring guy who's worried about your health in general :( I know that things like this are a bitch to talk about and you don't have to be ready now, but perhaps in future you can tell him about it? External support can honestly work wonders and I'm sure that he cares about you and is willing to help however he can.   Sending love ❤️",False,False
