I sometimes chat with this guy online, he has an ED fetish so he always compliments me and encourages me when I lose weight. It's the only time my anorexia gets validated and praised and it really likes it.   When I think about it too much it weirds/grosses me out, but the anorexia loves to be told she's pretty and doing well. And honestly the fetishists are the only people who would celebrate my weight loss. Even other ED people don't praise my weight loss, I just get concern for my low weight from everyone.   My anorexia is a vain bitch.",False,False

But I can help but notice his sexual appetite soaring when Ive lost more weight.. the way he grabs my hip bones and grabs my ribs.. just omg getting horny thinking about it.. hes such a sex machine I love it. But hes the only one who knows so he lets me talk about my issues, suggests foods he knows wont make me purge, sends me food pics daily and lets me watch him eat lots of food without judging me. Fucking love it and hate it cause the ED compliment machine is a bitch to let go of.",False,False
