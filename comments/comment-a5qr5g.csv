It's a graphic novel... if you happen to come across one that mentions anorexia, there's a slight chance it's mine, but probably not. It's not the main tenant of the book, just an attribute.",False,False

I have a gifriend right now, and when we're together I tend to eat a lot more. I sometimes I dread days where we're spending the night together because my brain is like ""man, now we gotta eat normal meals"" but I do it anyways?? She makes food feel a bit safer for a bit. But when I'm alone I barely eat at all.  I get what you're saying. And then I end up convincing myself I'm faking my ED ü§∑üèΩ",False,False

But that isn't necessarily for you to have to describe in your post. Like when I'm social I'll eat but panic a lot internally.  Have you gotten checked out for EDNOS?  ,False,False

EDs take all different shapes. I am very influenced by people that I love. And when they say ‚Äúwe‚Äôre getting burgers and I really need you need to eat one,‚Äù I get a bit teary eyed and do it.

Don‚Äôt listen to this other douche in the thread. Troll with no life.  I want you to know that your post resonated a lot with me. The only time I feel secure in my eating is when I constantly have a boyfriend regulating for me. Whether you and I want to recover or not, seeing someone that we love, and loves us back, eat a lot makes it easy to mimic.  You and I are both single right now and losing a lot of weight... Wishing both of us better futures &lt;/3",False,False

Not every eating disorder is the same. Mine is psychological and stems from shit that happened in my childhood. My eating disorder is 'dormant' in a relationship but the shame/inner monologue of hating myself because I'm fat never stopped. It made me suicidal... that's still an eating disorder. Wanting to kill myself for eating normally qualifies as an eating disorder.  I guess part of your ED is gatekeeping what an ED is. Stop doing that.

I was just confused as to how an ed can be ‚Äúdormant‚Äù but yet per your words... you were able to eat 3 meals a day... I suppose I‚Äôm just jealous. I wish I could eat three meals a day especially when I‚Äôm in a relationship.
