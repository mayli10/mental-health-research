She probably didn’t put too much thought into what code she used. I think a mental health specialist would be the person to go to for a specific diagnosis ,False,False

Is she likely using anorexia as an umbrella-ish term? just confused why I wouldn’t be diagnosed with EDNOS instead. It’s trivial but I guess I never considered myself anorexic so it’s weird to grapple with. Thanks again!",False,True

An ICD code is a diagnostic code used for insurance and billing purposes, as well as other things. You don’t need to be underweight to have a diagnosis of anorexia. If you talked to her about your eating disorder, this is why she would put that in. Also, insurance usually requires that you have a diagnostic reason to have blood work done, so the doc would put in a code for that ",False,False
