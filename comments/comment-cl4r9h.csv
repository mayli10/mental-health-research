We would help my mom cook because my dad would come home late most nights and she would save him a plate. This is what inspired my passion for food and cooking.

For years it was the only meal I ate lol.     But I don't have any issue with the way we did it (eat what you want, save leftovers if you have them: get seconds if you want, eat a single noodle if you want... just be present with the family). Even now, eating dinner with my husband as often as possible is sacred. I have a weird mixture of food related beliefs thanks to a pervasive eating disorder and a food-centric upbringing lol. If I was single I could probably go days without eating, but in relationships I see it as a bonding thing. Not eating together is like not having sex almost.",False,False

I have always been relatively small and my family (extended) would try to get me to eat what they considered regular portions, but were genuinely too much for little me. When I couldn't eat everything on my plate, my mom and/or grandpa would make me sit there until I finished it all. Sometimes, my grandpa would even sit with me for hours, just lecturing me about how it's important to eat green vegetables and nutritional values of different foods.   And now I hate people watching me eat. I wonder why. Family dinner sucks.",False,False
