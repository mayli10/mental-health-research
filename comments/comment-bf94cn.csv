My arms bother me so much, it's like my biggest insecurity. It's really interesting I didn't know yoga could be that effective.   I hope it helps u out too! And it does feel nice to feel like having some control over this :)â™¡",False,True

I saw a post online from a woman who had had a C section quite a while ago and had a puffy droopy stomach from it that was hurting her confidence, and she heard yoga and moisturizing the skin would help so she tried it, and it made a huge difference. The before after was really striking. She did yoga 1-3 times a day (focusing on core strength I assume) and massaged lotion or oil into her skin daily. She didn't mention branded products at all so I choose to believe the post was real and so far I feel like I've had luck with moisturizing my skin, I feel like it's helping ""tighten things up"" as I go. It at least makes me feel like I have some control over it. Hope this helps ðŸ’•",False,False

This is one of the hardest feelings because itâ€™s like no matter what you do, it will never go away (and even if thatâ€™s not true, thatâ€™s the thought that kills me).   I donâ€™t have any advice, but wanted to say that I empathize.  Iâ€™ve lost over 100lbs and thank god Iâ€™m young, but I hate being able to see my ribs/chest bones and still having a tire of fat around my lower stomach.",False,False
