As of this morning, I'm feeling a lot better. And you're right, my boyfriend is awesome. Don't know where I'd be without him.  Anyway I wish you well and hope you find the strength to be kind to your body. Take care :) ",False,False

If anywhere’s the place to rant it’s here. It’s so hard fighting a mental illness because you’re not just fighting the problem, you’re also fighting yourself and your own lack of motivation and your own dumb ways of thinking, etc.. Your boyfriend sounds like a nice dude, and I hope you’re feeling better from your cold!",False,True

I usually high-restrict and overtrain, but I caught a bad cold and couldn't exercise in the last couple of days. I was feeling really crappy, my boyfriend made me soup, mashed potatoes, steamed veggies and boiled eggs, and I ended up eating the same amount of calories I usually have when I work out. And guess what? I haven't gained any weight. It looks like I might actually have lost some water retention. I'm OK. But I swear, my disordered ass can not comprehend that eating 1300 calories a day is NOT overeating. I ate an orange this morning and I felt guilty. Because of a FUCKING ORANGE. Rant over, sorry. I understand your struggle. ",False,False
