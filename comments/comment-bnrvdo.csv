Isn't it because of the lower fat and muscle percentage so your intake is lower or you have like no body fat and then your body clings onto the weight?,False,False

I can guarantee you burn more than 800 even if you are were in coma. People recovering from restricting actually experience increased metabolism because the body needs to heal and after that, it will stabilise to a normal rate. Your metabolismâ€‹ is not permanently damaged: humans are much more resilient than that.",False,False

When you don't eat at all or a lot, your metabolism slows down. If you've been starving or restricting for a long period of time (weeks-months), when you DO eat, your body is in a 911 mode and feels it has to hang on to any food you get because it's in preservation mode meaning it doesn't trust you to keep giving the nutrients (which means the metabolism won't be working as fast and in turn makes you gain weight). The more you are eating and exercising, the faster and more efficient your metabolism starts working.",False,False
