I can't control myself at all around free food. I just obsess over how there's so much uneaten food and I need to be the one to eat it.   I get comments a lot about how much I can eat, and I go along with it in a kinda jokey way, but I always worry it's so obvious, eating a ton then heading to the toilet. but maybe normal people just don't think that way. idk.   I actually really hate when people comment on what I'm eating tho, like I'm just trying to make it through the thing and get the heck outta here ok ty bye.",False,False

There’s no in between for me :( I also feel like crap when people try to cater for my eating habits too - like my team at work is going to have like an overnight teambuilding event in a few weeks and they wanna get keto/low carb food for me since I always use that as an excuse to not eat when there’s free food in the office. Like god I can’t explain how I just don’t wanna eat takeaways   ,False,False
