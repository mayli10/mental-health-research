eyyquyn,t3_czdk26,t3_czdk26,ImDemandingARefund,1,2019-09-04 07:11:14,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/czdk26/bruh_is_water_weight_real/eyyquyn/,&gt;actually SAW the fat on my body. Earlier this morning my thighs were jiggly as hell and my arms were like- bigger. I took a long ass nap and haven't been drinking any water or eating and a few hours later  My water weight is visible and if it’s worth more than 2lb then my measuring tape also agrees. I know for a fact because my scale measures my body water percentage and I know longer lotion my feet to avoid messing it up. My body water with a low normal amount of eating and 8-12 beverages a day floats between 50.(something) and 52.5% ish. If it’s 53% or higher and I obviously didn’t change my eating habits drastically the previous day then I know it’s water weight.    Note: my scale doesn’t measure my body fat or body water accurately BUT it does measure it consistently. So the number can’t be trusted completely but the loss/gain amount can be trusted,False,False
