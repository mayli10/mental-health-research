I'm in the same situation with almost the same weight gain. I stayed over at a friend's house and her plans always consisted of going out to eat somewhere, and no matter how many times I said ""i'm not that into food haha"" she would not take it. If at least it had been because of stuff I actually WANTED to eat and wasn't practically forced to pay for--- anyway, don't worry! it's only 1,5kg not 10, we can do thisss :')",False,False

I was at my lowest of 105 lbs before summer started but...I'm not sure if it was because of my ed but I developed an autoimmune disease. I had to stay in the hospital for a month and was put on steroids. I was forced to drink supplement drinks for weight gain and nutrition. fuck haha. It was mainly the steroids that caused it, but I went up to 140 lbs a month later and now summer's almost going to end... family members did notice and now I feel like total shit :/",False,False

I was away from home and staying in a host family, I had no control over my food because I had to eat what they cooked for me and moreover I binged like crazy, I was so overwhelmed with food, there were so many binge triggering foods in the house... I don't think people notice, but I do and it bothers me so much. I came back one week ago and yesterday I started restricting. I try to not be too hard on myself but I really don't like the way I look and I wish I didn't gain that much weight honestly.",False,False
