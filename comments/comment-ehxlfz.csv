Big TMI warning for the next line hahahahha  I didn't shit for 9 days once. I felt fucking TERRIBLE. I'm afraid of abusing lax so I didn't take any until i was having stomach cramps 24/7.  I took two around 4 pm, expecting them to kick in around 11 pm before I went to bed. They didn't kick in. I fell asleep. Woke up at 5 am convinced I was giving birth (which would be odd, considering my male-ness). I ran to the bathroom and proceeded to shit SO violently that i WOKE UP MY NEIGHBORING HOUSEMATE. This went on for thirty minutes till I thought it was over and went back to bed. I woke up again around 7 am, in the same amount of pain, and repeated the process, this time expelling shit so violently that I passed out on the toilet, fell forward, and bruised my cheekbone and jaw on the tile floor and shattered my phone screen by hucking it across the room.   But yeah, I lost like 8 pounds so,,  Worth it?",False,False
