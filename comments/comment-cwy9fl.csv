It sounds so cliché but you WILL NOT feel better after purging. Trust me, everyone here will tell you this. And btw we are not allowed to give this kind of tips on this community. I started purging on and off a couple of months ago and I wish I never started. It's disgusting, painful, not enjoyable at all, pretty nasty. I thought I was not physically able to do it too, until one day I pushed it too far and here I am. Please don't get into purging too. I beg you. It's not a quick fix because it won't fix shit. Everyone always says ""yeah I won't do it everyday.. "" but it starts little and then quickly gets worse and worse, and the thought of purging will always be in the back of your mind after every bite.",False,False

I can’t physically purge. I’ve tried with my fingers and a toothbrush and it never works. It has to be because I am doing it wrong. I don’t know when to do it or how and of course the internet doesn’t provide that on a google search.  I know this is really disgusting to ask but how do you do it? I know I would feel so much better. I only want to purge very rarely but I think it would help me feel better.  I know your reply will probably be telling me that I shouldn’t do it but not being able to do it is killing me. So please.,False,False
