I am living my life but my triggers act like precursors that cause me to be self-destructive and engage in dangerous behaviour. The anorexia is separate to me as a person.   I wouldnâ€™t agree though. I am responsible for at least the last ten years of my life. If I revert to type and live my life thinking its outward forces rather than my individual choices. I will die. I witnessed it September 23, 2012. I donâ€™t know if I am a result of learned behaviour, my environment or whether I was pre-programmed. Honestly I am scared to look at myself personally. Itâ€™s easier just to speak with other people and carry out little or no self-reflection. When it comes to the piece of me that is anorexia.",False,False
