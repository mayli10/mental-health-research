So I guess a question you would need to ask yourself is if food and eating or not eating or eating less preoccupies your mind, affects daily life, etc.   I want to be 100% clear, I am not trying to say your struggles and worries arent valid. However, I do think most people are occasionally unhappy with their body, so you need to kind of look inward and figure out if you are barely ever happy and constantly feel the need to change how your body looks, or if it's usually a passing thought, or somewhere inbetween. Since you dont identify with the type of food being what makes you uncomfortable, I dont think it would be ARFID, and either way, if you feel you are struggling, you should seek out a therapist who works with disordered eating and eating disorder patients. (I think everyone could use a little therapy anyways)",False,False

I have a mild case of that along with my other ED stuff, basically its ""avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder"" and it isnt necessarily about weight. Some people dont eat certain foods bc they are scared it will make them feel sick, or because they cant stand the texture. You mentioned something about not wanting to eat certain foods bc you think they may make you feel sick, so that's why I'd think maybe ARFID. Anyways, I am not adoctor, But even if you talk to one and they say, ""no, not an ED"", you are still free to hang out here on the sub (-: we'll be here for you every step of the way",False,False
