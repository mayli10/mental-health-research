I couldn't bring myself to eat enough to walk a short distance or do the classes. I was so far gone that it amazes me to look back on.

I unknowingly confined myself to 2 rooms, one that I'd just sit and watch youtube videos with the TV in the background because I had no energy and the other I'd pace around because I had a shred of energy thag needed to be put towards burning calories. That was my entire life for so long",False,False
