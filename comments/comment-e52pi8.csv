My family is white/ Hispanic. I grew up with predominantly my Hispanic family and their reactions are the exact opposite. Its more of a ""you did it to yourself"", ""that's what you get"" or ""get up/eat/do it"" situation. There is no coddling as a female. You just deal with it.",False,False

My sister once saw me reading a book about binge eating and bulimia and assumes I'm bulimic (I'm not. I only binge but don't purge) and would even joke about it every time she sees me bingeing. Idk I'm not offended or anything it's just how we talk tbh. I'd feel awkward if she starts caring, I'd rather just joke around about it with her",False,False

As if I choose to cry over food and be scared of eating. Luckily I have my sister who also has an ed and my fiance is supportive.",False,False

I’ve had an ED for literally over half of my life and it’s never been brought up really.  When I first started all of this I just stopped eating, I was in 8th grade, my mom did freak out and they made me eat but then I just started throwing up and haven’t heard much since then lol.  I told my aunt years ago when I was working w this therapist but once again it hasn’t been brought up since. We’re not a close family. I’ve never posted a social media post for someone’s birthday or anything. That being said I am 27 now so idk it’s not like I’m a teen anymore. But yeah, even though I’m working w a dietician and therapist I talk to no one in my family about it, don’t even think they know I see anyone. And that’s fine, I prefer it this way because I’m left to my own devices. So yeah all that shit in movies and tv, can’t relate and never will.",False,False

I honestly feel that if they ever did find out, I'd resort to laughing too.  Like I'd rather be met with anger and humour than with concern.",False,True

And I couldn’t help but laugh cause it felt so fake even though it was real and serious.  It was weird.",False,False
