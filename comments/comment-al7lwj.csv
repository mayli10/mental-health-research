I keeptrying to think of ways (and trying ways) to diet like a normal person but it never works and things get out of control. That part of crazy brain just doesn't operate properly. Hopefully in the future it will though with more work and therapy (or whatever). ,False,False

I spent days agonizing over someone thin who looked at me funny on the street when I dropped a wrapper because I thought she was internally mocking me for being fat. I was underweight.  Literally I can never actually be happy with my body. I look at pictures at my LW and I think I looked perfect but I didn't feel that way then. I romanticize when I was in the depths of AN but it's like I completely overlook the health issues, mental and physical.   I suppose if I'll never be happy with my body I might as well be average weight but healthy and stable but I keep trying to convince myself that next time i get thin it'll be better.  But it WONT... will it?",False,True

So much of our mental health depends on how we fuel our body. After the hospital I lost more 20lbs (ouch) and hit another bottom, then then kind of evened out and started really trying to help myself. It's like the high of seeing the numbers on the scale go down and feeling yourself get so much thinner and the control you have over your body keeps trying to take over. But it's hard weighing the whole ""do I want to feel totally batshit crazy or not"" thing. Some days these extra pounds don't feel worth it and I want them gone no matter what, but other days it feels worth it to be more mentally stable. ",False,False
