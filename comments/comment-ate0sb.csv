I used to love flying, but I'm terrified to get on another plane again.   A few years ago I had a 4 hour flight, was nothing to me, I was a pro. I had movies to watch, and crosswords to. Would be over in no time...  When I boarded the plane I quickly found out that when a seatbelt frays or is damaged, instead of replacing it, they just cut the belt and restitch the buckle. I was just overweight at the time  (bmi was 25.3 and I carry weight around my waist/hips) and with a bright red face, had to ask for an extender. The flight attendant tried to reassure me that it was because the belt had been shortened when fixed. I only needed less than an inch more belt for it to clip. I held in tears the entire flight and felt so huge that I lent into the aisle so my fat didn't have to touch anyone and had a sore back for days.  I refused to eat or drink anything for the entire flight and the next day. I would cry myself to sleep for a while after that.  I already had disordered eating habits from my teenage years, this just pushed me off the edge.",False,False
