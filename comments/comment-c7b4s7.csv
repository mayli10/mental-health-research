(1) you're letting yourself get so hungry by midday that you lose all control and (2) bingeing has become a habit. ... can you try going out for lunch or something, like get Subway and eat in a park, before going home? And make a plan for what you'll do when you get home (e.g. read or watch netflix or something)? It sounds like breaking the habit might help... and/or eating something for breakfast so you don't get so hungry.",False,False

Well I donâ€™t bake but Iâ€™m around food Iâ€™m not allowed all the time. Iâ€™ve learned that if I keep safe snacks on me when Iâ€™m around it and I have a few bites of that during the day Iâ€™m less likely to binge later. It doesnâ€™t stop all of them but I have seen like a 30% reduction.   Better to have 200-400 extra calories during the day than 2000 calories that night.,False,False

My grandparents have their own bakery with tons of nice things and i used to binge everyyyy weekend when i visited them. Since i started following a keto diet, i don't feel tempted (as much) anymore!   If it's not an option for you then..... i wish you all the best ha, i am a baked goods lover too. ðŸ’©",False,False
