Esp my best friend who has his own mental and physical health issues and my mom, because I feel so guilty for worrying them. I hate lying and dont do it at all... unless it concerns my ED. So I'll lie because I dont want people to worry, but then theres the guilt for lying and the guilt for letting those people down.",False,False

I have basically every type of eating disorder there is. Binging/purging/restricting/body dismorsphia just add to the fucking list.   Yet the only reason I hate that I let him in on it is because I can't go to the fucking restroom without me, NOT HIM, questioning whether he thinks I'm just using the restroom or purging.   Like I did this to myself and in a sense I know he knows, but like YOU TOLD HIM DUMB BUTT YOU  UGH why can't I just be normal with food",False,False

I told my ex and another friend that I hate now and they could easily out me if they felt like it... and that ex friend makes fun of it -_- they sent my best friend that article some breathanarian(sp?) girl and said ""guess who this is in six years""  I don't regret telling my legit friends but at this point so many people know I feel like I should just wear it on my shirt lol",False,False

I'm losing weight, and 2. I am weird about food, including doing extended fasting and stuff, only one person besides my doctor knows I have an ED, and I absolutely regret telling her because she's taken it upon herself to be involved without really understanding my issues or what I would need in terms of support.  Whenever she thinks I'm not eating enough, she bakes food for me that she knows I won't turn down out of politeness. However, 1. just because I'm not eating around her doesn't meant I'm not eating, and 2. her doing this has triggered so many binges.  Or we:ll go grocery shopping together and she'll actively take my food out of my cart and shit. Like, I tried to buy the $3 12-pack of generic ding dongs from Walmart, admittedly so that I could binge on them. But she saw me grab them and just said ""no!"" and took them out of my cart and put them back. And when I tried to get them again and hide them from her under other stuff, she noticed and said ""no, you can't do that!"" and put them back again. And you know what? I didn't fucking binge, but I did fast for four days and actively avoid her and everyone else so that no one could tempt me with baked goods or something.  Like, I know her intention is to help, but her methods of doing that are fucked up, and I'm not comfortable enough talking about my ED to say anything (I told her while I was drunk, didn't even tell her what type of ED, I actually thought she hadn't heard/understood/remembered until she admitted the baked goods thing) and she doesn't ask, she just does what she thinks is good even though *it is not.*",False,False
