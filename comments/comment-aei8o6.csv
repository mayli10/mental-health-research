I was walking through the mall and caught a glimpse of this woman ahead walking toward me and thought ""Wow, she's really pretty/thin/has nice eybrows!"" all at once - you know what I mean. It wasn't like a stream of consciousness thought, just a cavewoman ""THAT PRETTY!"" kind of thought.  I kept walking and realized it was \*me.\* There was an angled window near a doorway (instead of the normal parallel-to-the-walkway store windows and it was my reflection...  It was all at once a huge boon to my self-esteem and a sobering realization of how much dysmorphia takes from me. I wanted to cry because I realized that I like my looks when they're independent from \*\*ME\*\* and damn, that's a shitty feeling. I can't see myself as thin or pretty when those ideas are attached to ME.   It was also super fun when the negative thoughts started creeping back in and I was like ""Well, your brain recognized yourself before your consciousness did... so of course it thought it was pretty. Your brain lies to you to give you some peace about your fat and hideous visage or else you'd go crazy!""",False,False

Before I was pregnant I used to get 10-15 seconds in the morning after I put on my underwear and for that brief moment my dysmorphia was quiet. I could see my collar bones and my abs and the tendons at my hip joints. For that 10-15 seconds I was a peace and I was beautiful. I‚Äôm so excited to be able to see it again. ,False,False
