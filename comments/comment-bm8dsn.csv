Telling a professional is super difficult, cause part of what comes with having an ED is shame for having one. One of the things that my therapist said which made me feel a tiny bit more comfortable talking about it is the most recent studies found that at least 10% of women have EDs, so 1 in 10. That a huge number! And likely lower than reality since that number only represents the people that have actually been diagnosed. You’re not alone in this struggle, your therapist has likely had other ED sufferers, and by telling her you’ll shed some of that stigma and may feel better from the release.   Good luck :)",False,False

When I have a hard time sharing something with my therapist I find writing and sharing that a lot easier and a better way to get things out. I can’t even read it out loud myself because every word turns into a choice and then I leave things out.  So I just hand it to her or text her a picture of my journal ahead of time.,False,False

She's seen it all. She's seen worse. Her job isn't to judge me.  If you can't say it, write it down on a note card before your session and hand it to them.",False,False
