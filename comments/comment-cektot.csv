And a lot of the times, weight gain can be temporary, and due to bloating, water retention from salt/sugar/carbs, and all sorts of other factor. Also, you can't gain any actual weight when on a deficit or eating at maintenance.   Basically: if something like this happens again, you probably don't need to do as many compensatory measures as you think!!  Also, I know that EDs make things like this really difficult but now that the whole thing is over perhaps you could apologise to your mom? I'm sure she was just trying to help, but maybe you can let her know that forcing you to eat things you aren't comfortable with isn't helpful?   Sending love, good luck &lt;3",False,False
