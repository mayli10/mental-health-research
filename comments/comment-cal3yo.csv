I'm, not sure about how I look like anymore, I feel amorphous!!!",False,False

Near sighted people the glasses will make objects appear farther away (smaller), far sighted will make objects appear closer (bigger). Contacts are so close to your eye that the effect disappears and you'll see a accurate perspective. You might notice that when you switch from contacts to glasses it has a dizzying effect, your perspective shifted. Truly it isn't usually much a difference but I am near sighted and contacts made me feel 10x fatter when I first started wearing them. (I'm guessing you are far sighted, that being why you had a opposite effect).",False,False

But i could also be horribly wrong, just know ur not alone with that lol",False,False
