I need to remember this and take a page out of your book and put in more effort to fight the urges.   Any update about your mom? I hope you find some good resources!!",False,False

I can't imagine a Mother unwilling to help her child during an illness. Maybe it's still very unexpected for her &amp; she is in denial &amp; it will just take a bit more time for her to accept it &amp; start to take more of an active support role in your recovery.   Nevertheless - good thing us ED sufferers tend to be very resilient &amp; very determined. Use that determination to aid your recovery, definitely have your friends keep you accountable, you could always look into an online service or charity as well for extra support. NEDA possibly if you're in the US? I'm UK so we have the B-eat eating disorders charity that can really help out &amp; you could probably still email them wherever you are. They are an excellent friendly ear if you need to talk :)  Also I tend to be about a fair amount so if you have any worries or concerns or need advice, I can't pretend to know everything (I'm only 7 months into recovery myself) but I'm always happy to share my experiences, what helped me &amp; reassure you that anything you experience is probably well within the realms of ""normal for recovery"".  Also Tabitha Farrar on YouTube helped me immensely as did her blogs &amp; podcasts. Check them out if you have time, her videos are super short &amp; she's very direct &amp; definitely doesn't mince her words.  I'm so sorry it didn't go down the way you'd hoped. It still may though, time moves forwards &amp; things change, including people's minds :)",False,False

It is frustrating for both of you. A good parent would go through fire and water to protect a child from any outside threat because it is something concrete, but when the threat comes from ""inside"" the child, they are at loss because they genuinely want to save you, but do not want to harm you.  They do not know what to do and project their insecurities because that is what an ordinary person would do... Deep inside, they know that telling you ""just eat"" doesn't solve anything, but they really hope so (in a ""fake/repeat it till you make it"" kind of fashion).   The best solution would be scheduling an appointment with a therapist specialized in EDs, they will teach your mom good coping mechanisms and constructive ways to help you recover, and will help you address the issues that made you develop an ED in the first place.  I am assuming yours is a good, ordinary mom (no abusive or dysfunctional family, forgive me if my comment oversteps any boundaries). You are both really stressed. She asked you what to do because she is panicking and desperate to fix the issue (which is NOT YOU, it is the ED parasyte in your head).",False,False

I blamed mine on my mom and don’t realize how highly heritable they are, and we never had a proposer conversation about it, full stop, just fought. But I know I love her and she loves me and she’s one of my best friends!  All this ^ is just to say that this stuff is HARD and communicating about it is even harder! I really love the advice you’ve already gotten here, I just wanted to add that from my perspective, it’s so cool that you’ve gone right to talking to your mom, that’s amazing!! Maybe you could point her at something fishy or NEDA, I think they both have primers for friends and family - if she knows somewhere to look for basic info, it might give her some of the vocabulary to discuss this and make it less scary for her. Good luck!!!!",False,False

This is possibly alien territory for her, unless she was an active participant is helping your Aunt she may have no idea what to do or how to react. It's terrifying as a parent to hear your child is unwell. You are supposed to be able to fix things for them. If she doesn't know how to help you she may need some time to come to terms with it, do some research, decide what to suggest &amp; figure out how she should be reacting to the news.  Good on you for reaching out to her. Could you perhaps give her a little time to think on it &amp; in a few days maybe broach the topic again? Maybe along the lines of ""Hey Mum, I know we talked the other day about my eating disorder &amp; I understand it made you frustrated &amp; uncomfortable but I'm wondering if you could take some time &amp; help me figure out my options &amp; how to get better from this"".  Good luck! You did a brave thing. Remember, it's not that your Mum doesn't care, she is probably just confused &amp; scared. As a Mum myself - we have feelings too &amp; we don't always say the right thing even if we mean to!",False,False
