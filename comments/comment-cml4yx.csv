Though it seemed to deal with some new topics. Seem like the old tired drawn out tropes. Characters seem to be social and racial stereotypes. I look a certain way so I will act a certain way. No consequences. No ramifications. Which I know can be none sometimes but a party that big and cops were not called. I don't want to shit all over it. The acting and production looked good. Steinbeck it wasn't.,False,False
