It's that the medical assistant or nurse will know my weight and record it. Basically, having other people know my exact weight is extremely triggering for me.",False,False

You DONT need to feel like death and you can get some people who really are all about those feelings you've got going on. It sucks not to feel heard, understood or like you aren't being authentic to who you are in the way you present yourself to the world. IT HARD sucks. But you don't have to not be better alone. There are people who can help you figure out how to get there and they won't give you the totally hyped excited stuff you seem to be pretty over at the moment. I have an excellent therapist who does video sessions. He is no nonsense, he cares but isn't overly joyful or celebratory, and you can tell him what sucks and why youre angry. He didn't promise to solve my problems but he helped me find my solutions. :) You can do it friend. Even if tomorrow is going to suck",False,False
