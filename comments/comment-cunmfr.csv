When my husband I got married we were young. I thought I’d be the cool wife since we hadn’t had a lot of experiences with other people! He didn’t do anything too crazy.. but I changed my mind! It was totally fine :) we did LDR for 3 years. He’s Aussie and I’m a southern girl! Hope it works out. Communication is key and if he’s not down with your decision then 🤷🏽‍♀️,False,False

How often do you see eachother? I am assuming you took time out of your schedule and routine to go over to his place and stay there, and he fucks off to sleep someplace else?! This is nonsense. It is ridiculous. Love you need to tell him to value the time and effort you put into that relationship and reciprocate it or you LEAVE. I can't believe e left you alone ¿¿in his place?? feeling so bad. i can't believe this men ain't shit.",False,False

It’s been 5 and a half years of sacrifices and doing stuff I don’t wanna do and it’s a lot to just be like “oh yeah by the way I hate all of these things I said I was totally fine with”. Plus I’m terrified he’s gonna leave me or threaten me (which he’s never done, but I’m still super fucked up by past toxic relationships which is why I try so hard to please him at my own expense). It’s just been recently that all of the lies I’ve told to make him happy have been fucking me over and making me feel like garbage but I can’t tell him and I don’t know what to do.",False,True

Reassurance is warranted here.",False,False
