The British government is in large part guilty of exacerbating the famine, by prohibiting citizens of their colony from hunting or fishing, and what few crops the Irish could yield were seized and sent to Britain as taxes.

I cant speak for your ancestors, be them Jewish, targeted by any other food rations, or attempted genocides, but I can tell you without doubt they will have had their own mental health struggles too- and would not think any less of you for your own.   Food related trauma(not sure of the word) is also being investigated for having genetic components. If your family had to starve, for whatever reason, unfortunately you are likely to share the same compulsion even for different reasons.
