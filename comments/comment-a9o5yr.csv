It'll take days for a bowel movement. I can end up pooping on the 4th day of a fast (looking that up, it's twice the average digestion time for women), and last night I could fucking SEE all the pieces of turkey in the toilet. 10 hours after the meal was had. It should have left my stomach by that time and entered my intestines, but nope. Same with the 17 hours after eating dough.  I've had stomach issues for at least 10 years, mostly having to do with acid reflux, extreme bloating, and diarrhea like 40% of the time, but this year was the first time I actually succeeded to fast for more than 24 hours. Maybe fasting for ~3 days a week has triggered more intense stomach problems. It'll suck if I can never eat like a normal person again because of this.",False,True

A few weeks ago I drank creamy/sweet coffee quickly on an empty stomach and ended up throwing it up. I genuinely wanted something in my stomach because I had a headache.   Idk it's so frustrating when you actually want to eat and your body fights you on it. ,False,False

I often get ""sick"" and much discomfort after eating normal meals. It happens so randomly and with my regular meals/foods. ",False,False

I'm sorry fou're feeling this low, hope it gets better soon. No matter the amount you eat, maybe you can distribute it over the day? That could help a bit. ",False,False
