Non-restricting me, she’s a doormat. She’s kinder but only because she hates herself and thinks she has to be everything to everyone in order to earn her existence. She’s a placid little cow, you could kick her in the shins and she’s probably apologize to you.  Restriction me, yeah she’s kind of a bitch sometimes, but only because she doesn’t have time for your bullshit. She has less patience, because she’s not trying to fuck around all day and get strung along. She’s not going to go out of her way to be mean, but she’s also not going to let someone walk all over like her alter ego has always done. She’s determined, she’s more confident, she will call you out if you cross her, but she’ll also take care of you if you show her that you’re worth taking care of. She also may sometimes have a little melt down if too many things go wrong all at once in a day, but she’s working on that in therapy. ",False,False

With hanger I may say something uncharacteristic or act a bit rash, but it's usually mild enough that I would apologize immediately or otherwise correct/(at the bare minimum) notice the behavior. The personality change from long-term restriction is more pervasive. Usually I won't even notice how strange I'm acting until several days worth of evidence has piled up against me. ",False,True
