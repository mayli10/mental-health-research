There are national suicide helplines in most countries, itâ€™s just like talking online itâ€™s not as hard as opening up to people you know. They will be able to provide you with information on how to get help and financial assistance for it.  Mental illness is not a defect of character. It is a symptom of ill health just like physical illness. Iâ€™m sorry you have not felt the support of people around you.  What you say about thinking your circumstances mean youâ€™re not meant to be alive is not true, itâ€™s a symptom of depressed thought process.  Youâ€™re stronger than you think. Make that call. If you already feel like you donâ€™t want to live then things can only get better, give it a go.",False,False

I have never spoken of it or admitted I had it anywhere but online. I have been told time and time again as a child that mental illness is a defect of character, a weakness of will, not something out of your control. As a result, I have kept my depression, my suicide attempts silent. No one knows.   I have no job and no money for treatment or medication. All of this has led me to believe I am not meant to be alive, that I exist only to remove myself, to die. I plan to kill myself this year. ",False,True

Do you think you have depression? Have you considered getting professional help?,False,False
