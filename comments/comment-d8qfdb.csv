I know its so fucking hard to break the 'I'm never eatiNG AGAIN!!!!1111!!!!' mindset when you see those numbers go up but quick fixes never last for the longterm, so try to go as easy on yourself as you can. you'll get back down, and you'll stay down if you do it the right way. always helps me post binge to sit and do a new meal plan and exercise plan that will challenge me but not make me go crazy and make myself stick to it for a week, and 9/10 I do and by the end of that week I feel so much more confident in my abilities! best of luck, xxx",False,False

Ever since raising my calories to 1800 after doing 1300-1500 a day for so long while being very active (walking an average of 14k steps a day and going to the gym 4 days a week for a little over an hour with a focus on strength training) I've had a binge about once a week. The extra food definitely has me more lenient with myself, which is a positive thing.  I've been good for a few weeks to not restrict after my binges and to hit my 1800 calorie goal, despite so desperately wanting to fast track my weight resetting. I'm 5'8.5 and before Saturday's binge around 125lbs. This morning I was just under 130 and I almost never get that high so I feel like the binges are catching up to me since I'm not restricting. I know my body needs food though ): being this skinny has been really hard on me, but it's so hard to accept weight gain. I don't want to lose my abs as shallow as it is üò≠",False,False
