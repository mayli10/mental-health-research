It's the sudden loss of control that's really got me worried.  It's comforting to know I'm not alone in this, I hope things turn around for you soon :)",False,True

I'm still at the stage (this time round) where I feel more like I've just got bad/ weird habits than ED but had a flip moment today. Have been restricting and had a 150kcal chocolate bar my friend had bought me at home. Allowed for it in my intake for today (eating it would still keep me well below my BMR) and have been looking forward to it for like two days but when it came to it I just... Could. Not. Eat. It. Sat and cried at the fridge instead, so much fun. It's quite disconcerting realising you might not be in control of it anymore I think",False,False

The constant wondering if I truly have an ED, accepting that I do, then retracting it and saying I don't because I'm not ""that bad"" or I'm ""not skinny"" really takes a toll. Why can't I just diet like a normal person goddamit. EDs are so fucking stupid, but I'd rather not have anything else too T\_T this sucks",False,False

Like either we‚Äôre not disordered enough, or we‚Äôre being over dramatic so it‚Äôs ~all for attention~.   In my experience, if you choose starving or purging over your health or relationships, you‚Äôve got an ED. Obsession over what you eat or don‚Äôt eat to the point of mental breakdown? ED.   It‚Äôs a spectrum.   So welcome! Hopefully you‚Äôre not here forever. üíï",False,False
