Her being combative and argumentative is not going to toughen you up it’s just going to make you resentful towards her and internalize everything.   If she really wants to be helpful she should just have you in therapy which would help you in so many ways. Also there is nothing wrong with being sensitive seems like she could use some therapy herself.,False,False

I know if I asked her to remove it she’d ask why and wouldn’t be satisfied with me saying it makes me uncomfortable and try to fight it with me. She just thinks I’m too emotional and that tough love is the only way to make me harden up.,False,True

I would bring it up and just let her know that you don’t feel comfortable w her posting candid photos of you on her FB. There shouldn’t be any objection or arguing from either side bc it is a simple request you are asking and your mother should respect it and understand.  Also sharing pics of people eating in general is so awkward for everyone. Not sure why she didn’t opt for taking a pic of both of you outside the restaurant or something.   My dad is a bit clueless and thinks every photo of my brother and I is precious even though we are well into our 30s. We told him that he picked the dumbest photos to display of us in his office and asked if we could remove them. He was fine with it and we did replace them w more flattering ones later though lol.  Edit: I did just notice you said it would start a fight. That is so bizarre that it would start a fight bc it is your image she is posting and YOU have every right to ask her if she could remove it. Try and ask her in a nice tone and if she gets argumentative just ask her why she can’t pause for a moment and see it from your perspective.,False,False
