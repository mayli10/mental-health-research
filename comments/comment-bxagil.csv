I have bipolar, and I’ve found that there is a small correlation between my highs and lows, but not a ton. Since college, I’ve always been somewhat “diet oriented”, but didn’t worry about it or my weight too much, since I lost ~30 lb since high school just by being away from home I guess. But in grad school, there was one point in my life where my bipolar got REALLY bad, I think both mania and depression, and I think that’s what finally triggered the extreme binge/restrict cycle I’ve now been in for 5 years.    Since then, there are periods where it’s a breeze to restrict, but then a month later I’m a bingeing monster. Even very recently, I went from bingeing all the time and now it’s so easy to restrict. I have noticed a slight “mania increase” from a couple of months ago, but part of that was bingeing as well. Right now, it was more like “I want to be X weight before X event” for months, but now it’s only a few weeks away and my mind is all omg we need to get crackin.    Just some food (lol) for thought.",False,False

I'm no doctor, but I think you might be at risk for extreme or dangerous behavior. If you have a trusted adult in your life, I think you should tell them what's going on. If you don't feel comfortable doing that, please tell your school counselor or call your local teen safety/mental health line.   The symptoms might pass, but they might also get worse. You don't have to wait for something extreme to happen to get help. If you feel like something is wrong then I think you should trust your intuition and get help.",False,False
