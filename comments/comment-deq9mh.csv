EDs don’t care about your BMIs. They’ll rip your body to shreds and tell you that you aren’t sick enough for help the whole time.  Please go to the doctor about chest pains. They can do quick tests to rule out heart damage or treat any problems they come across.",False,False

Seriously, it terrifies me.  I know confiding in people can be scary, because it means things will change, that YOU will change. And not knowing where that will bring you is unpleasant to think about, so we just avoid doing that altogether. Your mention of how you don’t think you are sick enough is wrong, anyone can be anorexic, you can have a BMI or 16 or 26 and be anorexic, the definition isn’t confined to dangerously underweight individuals.   Chest pain in itself is grounds for being checked out, because paired with your ED it means shit is going down inside you that needs to be treated. I strongly recommend you get seen, because people knowing about your ED is one thing, but what will happen if you keep it under wraps is much worse.",False,False
