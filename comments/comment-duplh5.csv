I'm really sorry to hear you're going through that... It sucks. I feel like people view me as sensitive or weak or something... But i'm probably just making that up.",False,False

I know someone who fainted once due to an allergy and honestly I didn’t even think about it the very next period and I don’t think anyone else did either. If it helps, I once was in a Uni class once and turned what I thought was my empty bag upside down to get something to fall out onto my desk and I forgot I kept tampons in my side pouch. They fucking fell all over the floor.   I was so embarrassed. I have had classes with people from then since and they seem to have forgotten about it.",False,False
