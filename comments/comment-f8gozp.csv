If you can get past the anxiety and tell yourself its a one time thing you may find yourself eating less. Enjoy what you want to enjoy too but don't let your dad push food on you either if you're full you're full... Be careful with fasting. Def drink a ton of water then too and have a plan for breaking it so you don't binge again after not eating for so long. Take care of yourself girl I feel for ya",False,False

The thing is, it's a national holiday where I am and me and my family always go to the beach and when we do so, the food is always in abundance here... my dad loves to cook and he does it a lot here so tomorrow he already said the lunch will be pasta a la carbonara and breakfast here usually is waffles, pancakes, a bunch of different breads.... the only good thing is that although I tend to binge on evetything because back home I never get to eat these stuff, we don't usually eat dinner when we are here... so I get to fast for like 12 hours  And I wish I had more control over what I eat here, but I'll try and keep a tight fist tomorrow... and drink lots of water tonight  :)",False,True

Dont have to take my advice but I find it helpful:  Idk what time it is where you are, but if its night time chug some water and try to sleep. The water will hopefully help you flush out the binge, and you'll sleep through most of the bloat. Don't purge! It'll only hurt you and feed the cycle.  Next day, you need to work on resetting. Eat a light breakfast. Doesn't have to be huge, just a couple of eggs or a piece of fruit. Drink coffee or tea, or pack a cup to take with you. If you can stand to be around/ think about food pack a quick lunch. Don't think about it too much, just grab something simple like yogurt or throw together a pb and j. Leave the kitchen and your house ASAP. You say you're at a beach? Go sit by the shore and read a book, go on a light walk, just something to keep you occupied. Try to be around others as much as possible.   Go home in the evening with some plan for dinner. Try to think up something healthy. Usually salmon, veggies, and rice are light and easy on my stomach the day after a binge. If you're going out to eat, try to pick a place with options you feel safe eating...  Basically: eat light meals frequently. If you have safe foods/ foods that trigger you less stick to those and try to stay out of the house as much as possible. Drink A LOT of water. like 2x as much as you think you need. Try to stay busy.  I find after. the first 2 or 3 days when I'm leaving a binge cycle, that I feel a lot better and calmer. I also drop most of the water weight from the cycle and can work on losing any actual lbs. gained w/o a full on relapse, Hopefully some of this helps you...",False,False

All we can do is try to do better tomorrow. Purging or exercising it away won’t help right now. Let’s just start anew tomorrow...eat some vegetables and whole grains and stuff.,False,False
