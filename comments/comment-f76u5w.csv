But yes i’m very self loathing i just am very uncomfortable with therapists i’ve been to probably a dozen.

I'm not 100% sure but I am fairly certain that for BED, you dont go to inpatient or get held at the hospital.   That's only if you have a dangerously low weight and are at risk of basically dying, or you voluntarily commit to inpatient otherwise.  If you are in college, and you are worried, see if there is free counseling. Lota of universities offer it, and talking about why you binge and finding out your triggers will help. That and seeing a dietician to try to help you normalize your food intake and improve your relationship with food.   You may or may not have an ED, we cant decide that, but dont be scared, you can seek help for your problems with food no matter what, and it wont fuck up your life.",False,False
