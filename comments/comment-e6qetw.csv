I think it's cause my body suddenly has energy to devout to feeling pain. Like idk normally when a human isn't eating it's cause they are in a survival situation. And it would be pretty detrimental to feel muscle cramps if you're lost in a forest or something like that. But then once you get food your brain is like ,"" Now that we aren't in immediate threat of dying you should really know that you're legs are all messed up. Please continue to eat!""   That's based on zero research though. Just my own thoughts. Like now that my body knows we aren't actively dying it lets me know about all the other stuff going on!",False,False
