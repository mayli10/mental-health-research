My ""current weight"" I listed then is my goal weight now.  Clearly my problem is quite different, but I guess your post should serve as a warning for me. Getting to that goal weight won't stop this mindset.",False,False

After the euphoric high of having a lower number on the scale wears off, we feel the same as we did when we were heavier. That’s why some anorexics keep lowering their goal weight once they reach it.  The best way to be happy is to learn to love your body at any weight first. THEN lose the weight to whatever aesthetic you like.  That’s why I love the plus size movement. I would never want to be as big as them but I love how they make any body size beautiful and wanted.",False,False
