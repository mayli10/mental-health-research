I used to light right fitting clothes but now my body shape is just not fit for that. I'm like 3 different sizes between chest, waist and hips. I just can't find anything that fits good and the trend is for oversized stuff. Warm sweaters üòç  I buy everything from Primark and Aliexpress haha",False,True

Much more than the other things I ordered -except the scale obviously!   I've always been obsessive with the things I do and like so this is not new. I just hope it won't be destructive...
