I know it’s hard.  As an isolated thing, it’s not going to be medically harmful. The challenge for people suffering from eating disorders is preventing it from becoming a (fairly ineffective) purging habit or an enabling mechanism for larger/more frequent binges, either of which would turn it into a self-destructive behavior.   As far as the weight goes, eating a couple extra thousand calories for a day isn’t going to move the needle much, especially if you’re restricting or close to maintenance otherwise. You may weigh in slightly lower than your “true weight” because the way most laxatives work is to suck water away from the rest of your body and into your digestive system, making it easier to process/eliminate your food but leaving you dehydrated. That dehydration is the big reason why using laxatives habitually is bad for your health. As long as you’re supplementing electrolytes so you can actually absorb the liquid you’re drinking, you should be okay.  Hope that makes sense!",False,False

I know they won't get rid of calories, I literally use them because I need to relieve my constipation because my non regular eating patterns messed my bm so much. At first I was pretty skeptical about them, I used stool softeners and laxs not more than a couple of times, I make sure I do not abuse of them because I know that your body can get used to them and not make go to the toilet naturally on your own. Imo you didn't do anything bad, just don't over do it. Stay safe! ♥",False,False
