I make 8-10 servings for like $11 and 500-600 cals (whole pot wtf)! I can only eat about 5 servings before Iâ€™m super stuffed!   It warms me up and is good because I have trouble getting myself to eat :) also lots of healthy veggies for brain fuel.   I hope you feel better soon &lt;3 stay strong!,False,False
