My family was so confused by me restricting + watching hours upon hours of Food Network. I existed in total isolation during my early ED years so I didn’t even know it was a thing until I saw this BBC Documentary “I’m a Boy Anorexic” and there was a kid doing the *exact same behavior* (I mean, I’m female but it was about relating to the mental experience.)",False,False

A while back I used to low restrict &amp; literally ALL I thought about was food. Really don’t want to go back there, some part of me felt like I got lucky and skipped out on that part this time lmao... hope this is enough to scare me back into upping my calories, thank you",False,True

Eventually you develop mental hunger which sucks ass lmao. You just think about food 24/7 which is almost worse imo, i can ignore physical hunger",False,False
