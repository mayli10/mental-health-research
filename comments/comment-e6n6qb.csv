I actually did abandon everyone in my life and disappeared to Mexico about 2 years ago. I have been planning to kill myself after Christmas since September.  Currently fasting for the entire month of December in preparation. I'm rock bottom but I'm okay with it now that I know it's not going to be like this forever. I already hurt everyone so dying is nothing.   Just reread that and yeah. Is what it is now.   I hope you tell your therapist and stop the ball from rolling as far as I have.,False,False
