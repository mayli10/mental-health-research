I get especially paranoid about smelling like food. I hate thinking that someone can smell whatever I ate recently on me.,False,False

I have no reason to think it actually smells bad but I get worried about that dead mouth smell (idk how else to describe it) when you've not eaten for an extended length of time. I definitely think I notice smells more than other people though, especially when I'm fasting or low restricting",False,False

I read something about anorexics releasing a smell because of body decomposition but apparently anorexics also have a heightened sense of smell so maybe we don’t actually smell bad, we just think we do? Either way, lucky us :)",False,False

But probably because I’ve stopped sweating in the last 6 months.   If it helps, I usually don’t care about how others smell. If someone has an odor I just ignore it without any judgement. I’m sure others are similar.   And if they DO judge you- why are they wasting the energy? Life’s too short to get huffy over a little scent!",False,False
