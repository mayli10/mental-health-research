It’s a 12-step self-help program based on the Alcoholics Anonymous program which is a spiritual—not religious—addiction-recovery program. I’ve had success and seen many others have success too. The program treats the underlying triggers for compulsive overeating through fellowship (social support, including a sponsor) and personal emotional and cognitive change through practice of the 12 Steps in daily life.  You want a healthy meeting, though (if you happen upon a meeting where there’s no evidence of emotional and physical recovery, try a different one). There are online meetings also, some of which offer recorded meetings. I recommend meetings focused closely on the 12 Steps rather than discussion meetings.   Please no hate mail to me about 12 Step groups. If you don’t like them, please direct your observations to the OP.   I lost 60-70 pounds in OA over a period of two years and have kept it off for 14 years. I’ve had two relapses during that time (several months of binge eating), because I stopped attending meetings, dropped my sponsor and stopped sponsoring. The program works when I work it. It stops working when I stop doing what I know works :(",False,False
