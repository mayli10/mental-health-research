I can’t tell you the details of my weight since they’re really triggering for me. But here’s before and after photos of me. First one in SF and after is my current look. I don’t know if you notice, but my stomach has gotten so big that I need to wear a leggings that covers it. I know it’s hard to tell the differences but I’m just so angry right now and I really have nobody to share these crazy thoughts with. I feel like I’m losing my mind. Nevertheless, you’re right about changing to an environment that disrupts my disordered behavior, I know that not being able to do those things is good for me but I’m just afraid that I might run to foods now to alternate those unhealthy things I did back then.      https://imgur.com/a/WMStJO3/",False,True

I don’t know what your weight is at the moment, but your body is probably thanking you for finally nourishing it. I wish I got free healthy snacks at work! Your boyfriend will be so happy to see you after a long time. It’s good that you haven’t been able to do drugs or b/p, although it must be frustrating. I think you know that too. Jumping into a completely different environment that disrupts your disordered behaviour, that must be difficult. I think you need to find a therapist again, in the country you are in right now. That’ll give you some peace of mind. It’s only been two months, so things will fall into place soon!",False,False
