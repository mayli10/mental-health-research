If you are engaging in these behaviors, chances are you‚Äôll see the consequences of them via nutrient deficiency through more visible things like excess tiredness and potentially brittle nails/thinner hair or less immediately viable things like weaker bones and health muscle deterioration. if you‚Äôre saying you know these things, but you feel like engaging in these behaviors regardless, then i can‚Äôt really help as i‚Äôm in the same boat üôÉ",False,False
