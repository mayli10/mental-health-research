Binging does NOT equal failure. Just take one meal at a time. If you fuck up on dinner or over do a snack you haven’t failed. You just tripped. Get up and try again. We are all here for you. You can make decisions you are happy with. It just takes practice. I know this is just a Reddit post but the support is real.
