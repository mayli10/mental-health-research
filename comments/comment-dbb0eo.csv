It really messed up my gut health. I have permanent damage from it, and a really lazy and painful bowel. It is not fun. Try to stop using laxatives because most of them are steroids, and so it is poisoning your body. I’m in so much day to day pain from it. I did too much. I recommend stop using them because it will be much more difficult for you down the line when going the bathroom feels like someone is stabbing you in the side.",False,False

What works for me is 1-2 liters lukewarm herbal tea. Maybe a teaspoon of flaxseed.   (2) only when I reach a certain number. Don't know if I get less active at that point, or of it's lack of insulation.",False,False
