You metabolism slows down in theory to conserve energy.  Your rectum and lower colon do not absorb all things equally as that's not its primary job. You absorb things because that area has a very rich blood supply.,False,False

I've been under the assumption it was just news hype and wasn't really a thing. Kinda like the tampons.  Damn I feel old.,False,False
