Fast metabolism in the way that people imagine it just isn't real and it's so annoying that people can believe that I don't know, models are just super skinny because they just happen to have a fast metabolism, instead of aknowledging the obvious problem that we as a society glorify unhealthily thin people and having a body that few people can achieve without very low calorie diet or very much exercise.   Also I'm sorry that people suck and I hope that you can get that ED out of your life, you deserve better.",False,False

Little Asian bones make you look so thin!”  Do they just...not realize that the small Asian bone structure has *nothing* to do with being skinny ??? Big bones may preclude you from being stick thin/petite, *but* you’ll look extremely boney at a bmi in which I’d look small but still round.  My bones are just too damn tiny to stick out at bmi 18.5 like a white girl’s bones might; I have to get down to 16 for that to happen. And no, it’s not a body dysmorphic thing; I’ve had doctors commend my physique and say I looked “healthy” without knowing my bmi was 16. Fuckin annoying.  Anyway, yeah, I have nothing useful to contribute, just thought I might further fuel OP’s annoyance @ stupid people lol.",False,False

Stereotypes are awful.  I’m Polish and people there assume I’m thin because of genetics, too.
