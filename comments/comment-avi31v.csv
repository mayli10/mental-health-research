This is so wrong. People are capable of being comfortable in their bodies.,False,False

They are probably overweight because they can eat without caring and those extra pounds are where the limits of fun and freedom stretch between ""us and them."" Now if you're talking about switching to BED in recovery from restrictive ED, that's different and obviously not healthy but I'd still never use that as reverse thinspo because they're just relapsing like I am just in a different way. I think *maybe* the only people who are okay to reverse thinspo is like obese people who are morbidly obese and don't try to change because of laziness rather than an ed mindset. Like some but not most people on 600lblife but again a lot of those people have similar emotions and coping like us just the other end. It's hard for me to feel motivated by fear of being like those people without acknowledging that they are broken too usually",False,False

There are people on this sub trying to recover and may be backsliding and coming here for support. And this is something you should keep to yourself cuz it's rude AF. What if one of those people saw this post? And you're partially responsible for throwing their recovery game off?   Where TF are the mods? I mean I get this doesn't technically break any rules but this place is harm reduction/support focused and this thread feels like it doesn't belong. ,False,False

My highest BMI two years ago was nearly obese at 29. A future where I'd just intuitively eat anything while being below BMI 20 simply doesn't exist.   Seeing people who got overweight as a result of recovery also make me wonder how bad their mental struggle with an ED must have been. Because if they chose full recovery even at the cost of being overweight, the cons of continuing in their old ways of manually controlling food intake must have been really bad. The mildness of my ED means I can't really relate to the mental hell that many recovery stories describe. I basically just loosely count calories in my head, if I was a normal BMI I wouldn't have an eating disorder.",False,False

There’s a person at work who was lauded for their weight loss. I mean, everyone just fawned over it. This person was even recognized at the annual meeting for it. Meanwhile, I’m leading in numbers for the third straight year and other places would snatch me up in an instant if I even hinted that I was unhappy, provided they could pay me what I’m making now.   The person who dropped all the weight has since packed it back on. I know I’m awful, but I sit back and say “I’m glad I’m not him, now” but fack, it would be nice to be seen....not that it would change anything for me on the inside on account of BDD....but a little something for the effort, ya know?
