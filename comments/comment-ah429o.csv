Like if you eat fruit and protein @ the same time, the body will start to digest the protein first cause it takes longer, and if it takes long enough the fruit will rot in your stomach. Idk if that's true, but it's definitely something to think about.",False,False

Honestly I just shrug it off and laugh with people when they hear it.
