For example, instead of going out to a restaurant - I ask if maybe we could hangout at someone’s place and have a potluck and I could bring something I can eat. Sometimes I ask if we could instead do other non-food activities like maybe go see a show or attend a new workshop/class. ",False,False

I totally empathize with this, but eventually they might start thinking you're not interested in being friends and stop inviting you out. Since EDs are already so isolating, I really make an effort (even when I don't want to) to at least get coffee with my friends on a regular basis.",False,False
