When I first started getting treatment and finally got to my healthy weight for everyone else it was just like yup sheâ€™s recovered now all is well. I was physically healthier but mentally still screwed up. That was a long process. The turning point for me was feeling real unconditional love when I met my partner. Knowing that he chose to love me and that I was worth loving just kind of put things in perspective. I still have hard days but I feel that I have recovered now as much as anyone can with ana.,False,False
