All I wanted to do was meal plan and workout and obsess over every calorie  and pound. I was so fixated on controlling my body and food that I didn’t couldn’t even make time for my friends and family, let alone school.   Id hear some people say ""oh I do homework to distract me."" I fucking wish. I was so envious of people with EDs who could do that. Nothing could distract my mind.",False,False

My doctor just fucks with my ADHD doses now because she's worried about me losing weight. Except I spent a whole year trying to gain weight and lost it all because my ED fucked with my body and now I'm sick. It's not like I'm in control of my weight or that I could be even if I wanted to be. I think you just have to find a middle ground where you feel like your eating habits aren't too distressing but where you can also function well enough to at least pass your courses. I know how hard it is, but you will at least feel a bit better if you get your education back on track. If you do reach out to a doctor you may be able to get your current semester refunded for disability reasons.",False,False
