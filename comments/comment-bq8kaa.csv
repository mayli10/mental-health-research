I'm more often bored at work too, and when I'm bored I get hungry or snacky.  At home, I'm constantly busy and moving and easily go hours without eating.   I also have lots of exercise equipment at home, so if I start to feel hungry, I jump on the elliptical or treadmill.  AND I drink way more water at home since the bathroom is only a few steps away.  Water keeps my stomach from remembering it's hungry.    I wish I could work from home every day!",False,False

I hate weekends at home and try to schedule stuff to do with the kiddos all day. And I get these dumb ideas, like yesterday I decided to bake bread, filled the house with fresh bread smell. Fuck me. Had to chug diet soda to keep cravings at bay.",False,False

I left my previous school to deal with my ED partly but some other mental issues too and was homeschooled for the last year, and I was TERRIFIED of being home at all because of how much I know I can lose control. Now I'm back at school and though I hate it cause it's school and I'm a bitchy teenager, I'm grateful as fuck because I don't have the opportunity to binge as often.",False,False

Also I'm more tempted to binge at work because there are always donuts/cupcakes/cookies around due to someone's birthday or something. I don't buy that type of stuff when I shop for grocerys, so if I end up bingeing at home it's like...300 calories worth of rice cakes rather than 3,000 calories of cake and cookies. So I definitely prefer being at home. It's safer in that regard.",False,False

Weekends are so hard because weekdays I'm so busy I barely have time to eat but oh boy when it's Saturday... I try to stay in bed for as long as I can and just isolate myself in my room to not go to the kitchen and give in to my cravings. Weekends are usually the ""binge days"" for me now that I still live with my family but I'm trying to snap out of it...",False,False
