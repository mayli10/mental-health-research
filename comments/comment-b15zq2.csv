I don't know how reliable the results are at the moment, but hopefully it's true. This is my 4th time losing this weight, but I swear it will be the last. ",False,False

I feel like the first time took everything out of me. it left me sick and out of money and at a total disadvantage in both my academic/personal life. and weight-wise I’m right back where I started — but worse cuz the rebound weight distributed all to my abdomen and face. and now if I tried to eat at a “healthy” deficit, I gain. it feels like a cruel joke sometimes... I just don’t know where to go from here. ",False,True

When they come back they are harder to lose. Plus they usually bring their friends. Last time I regained I put on 50lbs. I'm currently down 18.5lbs and still have around 33 to go to get back to my lowest. It sucks that weight is so hard to lose, but so easy to put on. ",False,False

I was never UW and went from a 21 BMI to 19.5 and back to 21.   since the start of February I have kept my cals btwn 600 - 800 and stayed low carb (I have PCOS). I was worried my metabolism adapted after restricting for 3 months, so I tried reverse dieting the last 2 weeks and now eat more btwn 700 and 950 a day. my weight is still the same since the start of February. I watched the weight flux throughout my menstrual cycle/higher sodium/more active days, and my weight always settles around the same number. I still can’t fit into my pre-January clothes.",False,True
