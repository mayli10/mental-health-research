I start with a fun memory from the day (bc I forget those precious little moments so easily and they’re v important to me) and then I go into my thoughts for the day and how I’m feeling. Sometimes you just start typing and feelings you didn’t even know you were repressing come out. It allows me to realize more stuff about myself and be completely honest with everything.  -get into weight training! That community is super supportive and really helped me out of a bad place. Every lb of lean muscle gained, it takes 50 more calories to exist. 5 lbs of lean muscle adds an extra 250 calories to your day. Really helps w metabolism recovery, boosting energy, and you get stronger! (Also 1000000% recommended following @fearstofit and getting involved in that community. She really helps w mindset transformation) - it helps me to know the logical nutrition and training facts instead of just baseline counting calories.",False,False

If you’re afraid of drinking Gatorade or the like, try electrolyte water - SmartWater is one brand in the US, but it’s pretty popular now/there are a variety of options -	If you are generally restricting, consider consuming protein when possible to protect your organs. Your body requires a range of amino acids only found in dietary proteins (it cannot synthesize them itself). You may want to take a multi for the same reason (nutrients your body cannot make). -	You can chew Tums or other calcium carbonate-based antacids before purging - this has saved my esophagus from acid burns a number of times. Give them a few minutes to work. Fair warning: generally, acids neutralized by bases produce gas as a byproduct. If you are exceptionally full or gassy I would not try this trick.  **Dental Health:**  -	Don’t brush teeth immediately after purging, but try to spit out as much acid as you can. -	DO use fluoridated products as these encourage remineralization of your tooth enamel. Don’t rinse after brushing unless it’s with a fluoridated mouthwash. Sounds weird but if you read the instructions it doesn’t recommend rinsing, and that’s not a mistake. -	Don’t use harsh whitening toothpastes/anything that has silica high on the list as it is abrasive. -	Chew sugar free gum regularly/consider rinses for dry mouth if you’re suffering, as dry mouth encourages tooth decay.
