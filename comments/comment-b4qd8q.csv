ALTS are key.      I have a few, including my ED account (this one) and a ""public"" account.  The public one has a username based on my real name, talks openly about where I live, and so on.  In short, it's a decoy.  This one's for the ED, and to a lesser extent all the other fucked up parts, like the anxiety that leads to all this.    Use alts for reddit and google (youtube).  I like to leave some history just because I like the recommendations, but you can also clear and/or turn off youtube history, or use incognito/private.    Different browsers are good for sus bookmarks, or I have a secret online notepad.  It's a freaking saved draft for a post to a kids' game forum from the aughts, so no one would ever look there and it's accessible from any device.  ",False,False
