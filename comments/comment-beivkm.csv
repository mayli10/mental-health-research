I also get anxious having someone come to my place because what little food I do have would definitely give away that I have an ED... so if someone has to come over I feel pressured to buy ""normal"" food too (snacks, bread, chips, etc.) but it sucks because i know I'll just binge it all when they leave ughhh",False,False

Also might be worth explaining that buying fresh fruits and veggies is hard when you don‚Äôt have a big family because they‚Äôre so expensive and they go bad before you finish them  She probably doesn‚Äôt mean anything by it. when I was younger my mom only gave me really healthy food so when I‚Äôd go over to other people‚Äôs house and we had junk food I thought that‚Äôs all they ever ate. I didn‚Äôt understand that other people have junk food as treats sometimes  But I would also feel hurt by it‚ù§Ô∏è try not to let it get to you too much and happy birthday!!",False,False

For some reason, it is so damn intimate. A mini reflection of us somehow. I totally understand why you‚Äôd feel shamed by her comments about the contents of your fridge.  Things will probably change when she‚Äôs the one who is buying the food and stocking her own refrigerator. It‚Äôs really easy to judge when the food just magically appears in mom‚Äôs fridge. It‚Äôs like a food machine at that point! A lot of the time, growing up and moving out helps us realize how much work goes into maintaining a home.  Honestly, she‚Äôs still a kid. I hope you have a great time and are able to set her judgements aside!",False,False

You said it yourself, shes in that indecisive, uncertain teen period. Most teens act critically of others, even family, as a reflex. So it's kind of a given, I mean I bet shed find something to joke about no matter what you guys got for her to eat.   Props to you for being a good sibling and taking the care to put your complicated relationship with food aside a bit to be with her, though. She doesnt understand how important that act is, but all you can really do is try not to take the criticism personally.",False,False
