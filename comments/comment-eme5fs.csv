It is fun and okay when I do it after a good week, when I feel good and skinny and empty and I ""deserve"" a binge. I just recently did it on a bad week and it has pushed me deeper into my dark hole.  It is different for everyone, but I can say the experience was not good for my ED.",False,False

I smoke almost every day. Weed helps me get engrossed in things besides food, I have fewer food-related intrusive thoughts when I'm high, and whatever I eat is more satisfying than it'd normally be. That said, most of my Really Bad Binges have been when I was stoned.  YMMV. I'd say if you want to smoke, try it and be mindful of how it goes for you, your thoughts, how your body feels, etc.",False,False

You can beat them, being high doesn't need to be a reason to binge.  It helps me to remember that munchies aren't hunger. (This might be easier if you have eaten before smoking.) I try to have a variety of low calorie drinks available for different flavors and textures. If I want to eat, I plan it out ahead.  Focus on your goals before smoking and try to stay occupied in some way (even if it's just listening to music). Boredom makes the munchies worse!  I use weed to help with my anxiety.",False,False
