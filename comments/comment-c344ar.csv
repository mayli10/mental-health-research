I don’t doubt how shitty that could/did feel reading the label but in my experience with my mom, it hurts her so much to see me suffering that she’ll try anything to make me feel better, like buying a pair of leggings she thinks I might enjoy. It’s possible your mom is feeling that way too &amp; is trying to help in whatever way she can! (even if it ends up actually feeling unhelpful)  I wish you the best of luck in your recovery &amp; I hope that you can enjoy your new leggings (even if it takes some warming up to the idea of wearing them)! ❤️✨",False,False
