People pass out from heat, dehydration, all sorts of silly things.   Look at it this way: you didn't shit your pants in front of everyone and I would count that as a big win",False,False

ED’s are something hard to hide, especially at your age. Maybe don’t push against what happened. Let it be an opportunity to look at the how and the why. Let what happened pass.    Believe me my ED has changed my body in other ways than restricting.   I have passed out in a bathroom stall, collapsed at a house party broke two fingers on my left hand and my personal favorite. I passed out a few yards away from my front door. Fell direct to the ground, broke my nose in three places and split my head open leaving me with two black eyes.     Putting my fall into context. I had a work presentation for a large contract two days later. In front of a room of twenty people. I presented a multimedia presentation for three hours with a half an hour break in the middle.  Look what I am trying to say is “things happen.” Things can be overwhelming, but things are things. People have their own things and usually forget about your things very quickly. Dust your self off. Pick yourself up and get back in the pool. Life is fluid and you just need to keep swimming.   When I was growing up things stayed around for a month then disappeared into urban myth status.  Your generation (not a critique) it lasts a day. By now there talking about something else. If that wasn’t the case people won’t post or tweet to the volume they do.    Head up always forward never back.",False,False
