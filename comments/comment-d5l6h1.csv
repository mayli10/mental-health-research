I am about 180 now. This is still too fat and now he is not attracted to me the way he was when we first met.   Wait, so he was attracted to you when you first met, right? At which time you weighed 280 lbs? But now that you weigh 100 lbs less, he's not attracted to you anymore bc you're ""fat""? That doesn't add up, and he's making excuses imo. I mean, it's that, or you guys are not communicating well.   Like, just double checking, he did SAY these things, right? About you being fat/unreliable and him not being attracted anymore? This isn't just your speculation? Because that's a very different situation, and my priority in that case would be private counseling for your self-esteem/insecurity issues, whereas my priority in the case of your husband being insensitive about your appearance would be couples' counseling - *provided he is not truly abusive*. (Abusers are not capable of using couples' therapy appropriately, and may even attempt to manipulate the therapist.)  I see therapy resources are few where you are, in which case I would strongly recommend looking into online therapy. I really don't think this situation will get better without some outside help, no matter what its root cause is.   I'm sorry you're in anguish, and wish you weren't going through this.",False,False

He has never struggled with his body or body image like this. For him it is black and white, actions and consequences. I am not sure what else I can say to explain it to him without it becoming a crutch.   I hope some day we all can confidently hear our S.O.'s say they love us and believe them. Sometimes we are our own self fulfilling prophesies to that end.   I am considering the therapy angle but such services are scarce where we are.",False,True

I am not perfect and have been telling him for ages I am working on losing weight but it doesn't stick in my own head I guess?   I am actively working on self care, long showers with nice smelling stuff, picking up my vaping again which while bad I enjoy immensely. It's all a quagmire of a multitude of things that we both need to work on. I am mature enough to admit I am also at fault in this. Yes what he said is cruel but after a calm talk I understand now that it isn't about my weight as much as it is my lack of follow through.",False,True

He *should* think you will leave him for being a fucking asshole.   He told you that he is unattracted to you, because during a disagreement/argument you asked him to stop talking over you? So, he threw that in to fucking hurt you and derail the conversation. What a garbage, childish thing to do. This is unhealthy communication coming from him and totally unacceptable from someone who is supposed to be your partner. I'm completely livid for you.   Please take some time to do something nice for yourself. I am seriously concerned about your overall wellbeing mentally, having a partner as you described. This doesn't sound like the best thing for you long-term. You are a good person. You are worthwhile and deserving of love. I hope you can find a way to see that despite his best efforts at being a dirt bag of a husband.",False,False

ESPECIALLY if he knows literally anything about your mental health struggles. i'm going through something similar (finally got up the courage to ask S.O if they find me physically attractive, and then feeling like they're lying to spare my feelings) so i think i can relate a little bit &lt;3 would he be open to couple's counseling? whatever the outcome i hope things look up for you ðŸ’–",False,False
