They just help coach you and stuff like that.  Lol also I have nutritionist family members... help me üò∂",False,False

Having no choice is awful and not right. I am sending you so much love and thank you!! I hope everything turns out all right for you as well.,False,True

Unfortunately I am 14 so I have no say in anything. I‚Äôm constantly being weighed and discussed but I can‚Äôt know any of it. If they want me to do residential or a nutritionist or even a feeding tube I have no choice :) it‚Äôs a jolly good time being a minor with an ED.  I hope everything isn‚Äôt too overwhelming for you if you end up seeing a nutritionist.,False,False

They definitely told the medical professionals everything about my ED and if I even go to this nutritionist and they weigh me they will know as well. I'm hoping they end up forgetting or finding something else to focus on but I know that will not happen due to the state I'm in.,False,True

This whole situation is freaking me out and is so stressful. Also thank you for mentioning how you feel pulled apart because I feel the exact same way you worded it perfectly.,False,True
f7jfhf5,t3_dwg5o1,t1_f7j6erf,mariah-xo,1,2019-11-14 18:08:30,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/dwg5o1/family_wants_me_to_go_see_a_nutritionist/f7jfhf5/,Thank you!! I'm so glad someone feels the same. My family told me they have been wanting to do something more drastic such as hospitalization/going away but cannot force me since I'm nineteen (thank god). I would absolutely not agree to any form of going away or hospitalization! I only settled for a nutritionist because I can stop going if I want to but I really don't even wanna do that but they will not leave me alone no matter what I say or do.,False,True

The whole shindig gets kinda scary and overwhelming. I feel pulled apart between ‚Äúoh god please help me‚Äù and ‚Äúgo away - let me implode in peace‚Äù.,False,False

Also they might weigh you at the office.  And if you‚Äôre really that sick just go to a doctor. If you‚Äôre 18 (or of legal age) you don‚Äôt have to let your parents go with you.,False,False

My psychiatrist is threatening to hospitalize me if I don‚Äôt see one but like... nothing‚Äôs scarier than a nutritionist soooo :/,False,False
