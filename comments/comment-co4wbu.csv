I was talking about people in my twitter circles badly misreading studies to suggest that it is almost literally impossible to lose weight under any circumstance. I find haes perfectly valid in its academic/ medical applications. But it is frequently used inappropriately in my social circles which depresses me bc I know people trying to lose weight for medically appropriate reasons, and telling me “it’s pointless and they are betraying their bodies” really angers me lol",False,False

I'm getting a Master of Public Health with a nutrition concentration, and my research is with a HAES-focused professor who wrote one of the articles that I listed below.  The [American Journal of Public Health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3935663/) discussed how the HAES model can be used in a public health context to help with chronic disease prevention.  &gt;The public appears to be increasingly supportive for less weight-centric approaches to public health. HAES advocates healthy diets and health-sustaining physical activity, but is weight neutral. Its proponents do not view weight as an adequate indicator of health or weight loss as an appropriate end goal. HAES promotes consuming healthful foods, honoring internal cues of hunger and satiety, engaging in enjoyable physical activity, and advocating against fat stigma and in support of social justice, rectifying health disparities, and for ethical treatment of people of all sizes.  The [American Journal of Public Health](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdfplus/10.2105/AJPH.2015.302552) also discussed what empirical evidence currently supports HAES including strengths and limitations. Its interesting to see the gaps in literature, but public health professionals seem to be willing to try this as a new approach to changing health behaviors (which is absolutely one of the biggest challenges in the realm of public health).  The [Workplace Health &amp; Safety Journal](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/216507990705500402) examined whether there is an ""obesity epidemic"" when literature does not support several of the claims that are commonly made regarding weight and disease outlook. In addition, ""current"" (2007 was the year this was published) endeavors to help weight management might do more harm than good. This is more of a call to action to take the attention off of weight from both a public health and personal care approach and find alternative solutions to chronic disease prevention.  The [Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1499404615000111) found that a HAES college course reduced dieting behaviors and improved self-esteem, intuitive eating, and anti-fat attitudes. (I know this links to an abstract, but the full text is behind a pay wall. I have the full article to link if anyone is interested in reading it).  This [Clinical Nutrition](https://corpus.ulaval.ca/jspui/bitstream/20.500.11794/13492/1/Carbonneau%20et%20al.%20Clinical%20Nutrition%202016.pdf) intervention also found that HAES increased intuitive eating scores short and long-term which helps validate that the model is an effective health promotion strategy. They also found that those with higher intuitive eating scores tended to have better diet quality.  The [International Journal of Social Work and Human Services](http://www.hrpub.org/download/20141201/IJRH11-19290148.pdf) discussed how the weight-neutral HAES approach is more effective than traditional weight-focused approaches at promoting physical health and mental health. It even says that weight-focused approaches have proven to be so ineffective that they are unethical to consider.  The [Journal of Community Medicine &amp; Health Education](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0476/d0082356a7c283d18dd351352b5a4d990e9a.pdf) discussed whether HAES is useful for discussing obesity.  &gt;Given the body of evidence to support the efficacy of the HAES approach for improving health, the authors believe that this approach should be adopted as a mainstream “best practices” paradigm to promote health across individuals. This positive approach of helping individuals develop a healthier relationship with food, exercise and themselves will lead to greater self-acceptance, less size-related discrimination and decreased harmful behaviors (e.g., weight cycling, binge eating). Furthermore, this approach shows promise for helping children and adolescents, who are at risk for eating disorders and bullying to build self-esteem and healthy lifestyles. Although terms like obesity epidemic and obesity prevention are widely recognizable, health educators should avoid falling into the trap of narrowly focusing on disease prevention rather than using holistic positive health strategies to promote health and overall well-being.  The Center for Disease Control and Prevention's [Preventing Chronic Disease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5420445/) journal discusses how HAES can improve patient outcomes and recommends that the approach is incorporated into all levels of medical education. HAES could help current barriers in health promotion related to social and economic determinants of health. If the approach is utilized, more productive conversations regarding physical activity can be conducted between health professionals and clients. This supports evidence that physical activity is a better mortality predictor than weight. (Side note - this is a point that I've heard reiterated by cardiac physiologists and clinical dietitians who would rather set physical activity goals for clients than weight goals).  This systematic review in the [Obesity Reviews](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/obr.12749) journal found that HAES interventions benefit cardiovascular outcomes, physical activity levels, and psychological health. More evidence is needed, but it could be promising for ""obesity management"" considering traditional interventions are ineffective. (I can send you the full article, its behind another pay wall)  Its important to note that in the US, doctors receive extremely limited nutrition and physical active education, but they are required by most insurance agencies to make a Nutrition/Fitness/Lifestyle recommendation with each patient. This is one reason why a perfectly healthy individual who is 5 pounds overweight might be given a recommendation to lose weight by their clinician.  I think that people who advocate against HAES are making quick assumptions without knowing the extensive literature that supports that a) obesity and weight are not effective at predicting disease risk and b) traditional approaches to health behavior change are ineffective because they are weight-centered. I also think people associate the movement as an excuse to be unhealthy when in reality, the movement advocates for everyone to make healthier choices *regardless* of their weight.",False,False

I don't follow any of those people or come into contact with them, but it does sound annoying. On the flip side, let me respond to some of these points, from my perspective as someone who is trying to recover and is a newbie to the HAES mentality  \&gt; ""Food isn't healthy or unhealthy,"" they claim (even though their cupboards don't have a stash of Hostess goodies in them).   \*Food\* isn't, but an eating lifestyle is. Cake can be nourishing and part of a healthy lifestyle, just as spinach and kale can be part of an unhealthy diet. The distinction is whether you're being mindful while eating without judgement  \&gt; ""Diets don't work,"" they announce (even though they're slender and fit).   Diet as in ""I'm never going to eat these foods and/or I'm never going to eat more than x calories a day and/or I'm only going to eat at these times of the day"". I think that if you're mindful and move consciously toward different choices but without harsh judgement then you'll naturally get to that slender and fit body, but the body is a byproduct and not a goal. It also probably helps that when you feel in control of your body and have an attitude of self love then you naturally want to make it move and celebrate what it can do (aka physical activity/exercise)   \&gt; ""Eat what your body wants to eat,"" they say (making a vegan salad for lunch instead of a Big Mac). Again, I think that if you're conscious about your choices and work on not binging or restricting then you'll get to a point where you're able to have a better sense of how you feel when you eat certain foods. I hear stories of people in intuitive eating organically craving salads after a while. I think the idea is also that even people who have been ""eating clean"" will have the occasional craving for a burger and fries every once in a while and it's ok to indulge that. Maybe you hadn't been eating enough calories, or you were low on iron. Maybe that's just what your body needed to feel safe and secure.  \&gt; ""Your body has a natural set point,"" they exclaim (ignoring that activity levels and dietary choices control this). I think your understanding of ""set point"" might be off here. Some people always carry around a certain amount of weight and the idea is you shouldn't push yourself to be skinnier just because it looks good. If you're eating healthily, exercising, etc and you're not losing weight, that should be ok. If you're built like a weightlifter it might be unrealistic to try to comp like a long distance runner, and vice versa.",False,False
