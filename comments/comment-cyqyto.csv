She is kind of obsessed with comparing bodies. One of the first things she did last time I visited was ask to see my stomach, like that‚Äôs a completely normal request. I was unsurprised, unfortunately. And she‚Äôs much more likely to push food on others, to feel better about her food.  It‚Äôs also upsetting, but at least she‚Äôs consistent and I‚Äôve developed strategies to shut her down. She knows so little about nutrition (despite my attempts to teach her healthy options) that I can generally convince her that I know what I‚Äôm doing.  My dad is just always so certain that he knows what‚Äôs best, and swings so widely and unexpectedly, I just can‚Äôt keep up (he also has unmedicated bipolar).  I‚Äôm pretty sure my parents aren‚Äôt going to get any better, but I‚Äôm glad yours are!! And thank you!",False,True

My mom‚Äôs ‚Äúgood‚Äù at her ED and very small so anything she says about food is triggering. My dad and I both struggle and go up and down in weight so it‚Äôs a little less so, just for the fact that there‚Äôs empathy. Hopefully yours get better at respecting your boundaries like mine have",False,False

It is so bittersweet to have this community that understands stuff like this.  I‚Äôm frequently asked for weight management advice and I‚Äôm hyper-aware of which strategies are disordered and which aren‚Äôt. I would never ever want to encourage someone to use disordered strategies. His lack of awareness and willingness to encourage disordered behavior just baffles me. I think he really does believe his advice is useful and wanted. But knowing that it‚Äôs probably his own mental health issues contributing, really doesn‚Äôt make it much easier. I wish it did though.",False,True

Both my parents have food and boundary issues. I‚Äôm much better at shutting my mom down because she‚Äôs more consistent in her triggering bs. Last time I saw my dad he was into this all-you-can-eat buffet so I got caught very off guard today.  I‚Äôm getting much better about setting boundaries but it‚Äôs a process.,False,True

He's overweight and sedentary, so of course he's going to needle the person who actually exercises, bc he probably resents that you make fitness choices that allow you to eat like he wishes he could.   Still, understanding why people say things doesn't always lessen the pain. My own dad goes through disordered/orthorexic/overexercising phases, and makes inadvertently weird and enraging comments sometimes. I have to really work to not let them become triggers. So I know how much mental work that can be, and this stranger is proud of you for not letting his comment ruin your day.",False,False

Cause they go around projecting their own guilt and bs in the most triggering way. Both of my parents do it and I‚Äôve had to set boundaries about food talk in general. I don‚Äôt want to hear their comments about their food or their comments on mine. I shut that shit down so fucking fast,False,False
