She's always been much heavier the entire time she's been famous, and that became part of her identity and how we know it was her. She looks like a completely different person now.   And besides, no one dared comment about a heavy woman because that would be fat shaming, and her music was mature and not typical pop music, so she was immune to expectations that other pop singers suffer from.",False,False

Your face is the first to show any weight loss. My co-worker went from a huge belly (she wasn't pregnant, just ate too much) to a flat belly from eating much less and now her face looks sunken in.",False,False

Not sure why the media wants to suddenly be concerned about her weight. When she was overweight the media wasn’t concerned for her health (at least not that I can recall) now that she’s shed it all away people suddenly want to skinny shame her and be all super concerned.,False,False

I think she's probably at a perfectly normal -- if even slightly chubby -- weight, and it's the significant loss that has the HAES/FA types being all ""she's unwell!""",False,False

It was a pie chart titled something like ‘the internet’s opinions on women’, and was roughly evenly divided between “too fat” and “too thin”, and then a tiny sliver labeled “Jennifer Lawrence”.

I’m with OP. I don’t think she looks well but also recognize that it’s just a photo and that we don’t know anything about her. I hope she’s okay. I hate that the media is picking on her though!

Still in a healthy range. In that photo  she took with a fan, her body is in just a weird position and making here collar bones looks really prominent.  There is just something odd about her face (not in a mean way or anything). Like looking at her features they are still the same but she looks completely different.",False,False
