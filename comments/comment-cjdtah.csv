It was around 8 weeks ago and when he diagnosed me with AN he basically said to gain some weight and he wanted to see me again in 8 weeks (which is coming up.) I wonder what he will say when I might have lost weight since then and my stats are still the same. Maybe he will want to check those things then?,False,True

I went to the ER because I passed out at work, but I didn't disclose my ED at the time, and the doctors were extremely concerned.  They wanted me to wear some kind of special heart monitor for 48 hours because, in the doctor's (overheard) words, ""If this is her heart rate when she's awake, what's it doing when she's asleep?""  I am a dumb, so I never ended up doing the heart monitor experiment, but yeah, that's probably something to be concerned about.",False,False
