As someone who has been recovered for about 2 years now, I found myself restricting 700 calories from what I usually eat to be full in a day and for the first time in a long time I remember that hunger that I lived with for all my ED years and I decided I cannot do this to myself. I don't want to start back on self-destruction again. So today, I had breakfast and didn't stop until I was  full. Yes I counted and tracked the calories, it was hard seeing the numbers go up but I'm proud of myself for not wanting to hurt myself this way anymore. Years could pass of restriction getting worse and worse like they had before and I just don't want that for myself. I have a whole life ahead of me and I want to be alive and healthy to live it.",False,False

But wow I overdid it binging. I almost involuntarily shit and vomited on my way back home. Had to stop in a store 2 minutes from home because I was so full my body needed it to come out either end. Was so uncomfortable all night from my big belly. God that was awful. I wish I were able to purge just to relief myself but I just suffered.  Now 22hrs into a 48hr fast that I have planned food for to end it with after I weigh in on Saturday. My laxatives kicked in just a few hours ago and I'm making sure to hydrate. I suck at fasting so I'm already starting to get hungry but all I'm allowing myself is tic tacs, gum, and tea. I have planned to eat a whole pb jar on Sunday as my cals for the whole day. Then back to my last real week of restriction before I start treatment.   God I can't wait to eat normal. I want to be able to enjoy food like last night without binging. It was all so good but I ate 2 or 3 servings of everything because I have such all or nothing thinking right now. I literally shoved in one last bite of food despite being full to bursting because my fast was one minute from the start time ugh",False,False

But they got me some Dove chocolate (whyyy I can‚Äôt resist) with the quotes on the wrapper. I had one this morning even though I should be fasting til 1pm. It said ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt stop until you‚Äôre proud.‚Äù I wanted to spit it out right there in front of my coworkers. I can‚Äôt believe chocolate was making fun of me for breaking my fast!!

You better fucking hope you can purge, you fat bitch. You better pray to your atheistic god that you have enough of a gag reflex tonight so you can expel all this shit you don't need out of you. If you don't, you're going to have a grave time ahead of you, whether it's in the form of fasting, or, most likely, more bingeing. Bingeing sounds like a reward when you're starving but I bet it sounds like a punishment now, doesn't it? Of course it does, piggie. It always is. You sure do want it really badly considering how much you hate it when you're in the act.  You better. Fucking. Hope. You can purge this.  Time is ticking.
