I don’t see how you can be recovered if you never gain. She films herself eating lots of high calorie challenges so it doesn’t make sense to me. I have my suspicions.,False,False

I can’t bring myself to watch her videos. I only watch Helena Rose. She’s such a sweetheart &amp; her videos are so motivating to keep going.,False,False

She is the only channel I watch and for good reason. She really tries hard and keeps it 100% honest. Never posts photos of her at LW, never mentions numbers, etc. Just shows you how she struggles with something simple like drinking coffee at work, or eating a sandwich without checking calories, or eating a cheese sandwich. She doesnt edit out parts where she's crying because of how it makes her feel- but she is so inspiring. Highly recommend even if you arent in recovery, it can help you gain a new perspective on foods. I started cooking with oil (small amounts but still!) Because of her videos",False,False

It has a pretty long (in Internet terms) history of discussing messy drama in the ED community - there have been 20+ threads on there where people anonymously talk about drama, particularly weird shit, etc etc. It does have its better sides (and it’s not totally without compassion even though at first glance it looks awful), but they can get really obsessed with one individual and cross over into being too mean, imo.",False,False

She has mentioned that she isn't fully recovered so when her family isn't around maybe she has setbacks or brief relapses- I don't think she intends to mislead anyone,False,False

I just want her to get better, as she's obviously very sweet. I think she needs to take a social media break, imo.  Also, what's lolcow?",False,False

She gets discussed on lolcow a lot but I don’t really agree with a lot of it, because while the content of the criticism is broadly true, people are SO harsh towards her... I think she is being deceitful and it is harmful to behave like that, but also she’s just not ‘there’ enough mentally to really be held responsible.",False,False

I know it's hard, but she is lying to her followers and potentially triggering them.  (Also, I really don't get the attempt of trying to be funny in her vlogs. It comes across as awkward? Idk.)",False,False

I know they must struggle at least sometimes! Granted I guess they have no obligation to show us the dirty side of recovery but that’s what I’m looking for when I follow recovery accounts.,False,False
