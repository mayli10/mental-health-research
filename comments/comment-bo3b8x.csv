I hope you keep pushing through it. Something to keep in mind is that even if you are maintaining a healthy weight, if you do so by restricting what types of food you eat (as in, ""I will never ever eat a banana"", not moderation) it is still disordered. And while physical health is important, mental health is too.   Anyways, my second novel to you today is almost over. Like I said, I hope you keep pushing through it, but even so, I'm proud of how far you've come so far! And I hope that your wedding day is smooth sailing and that your marriage is happy and healthy, and that it helps you become happy and healthy as well, because you deserve it!!",False,False

Professionals are trained to compartmentalize these kinds of things; in the off chance your therapist specifically struggles with body/food issues such that helping you is harmful to them in a way they can't mitigate, it's their job to let you know they might not be a good fit for you and help you find someone else.",False,False

I think I‚Äôm like deliberately complaining about therapy because that part of me just still does. not. want. to recover. I‚Äôm terrified of gaining any weight, even though I‚Äôve already gained weight in recovery and stabilized, and I‚Äôm just anxious as fuck about getting married. But you‚Äôre spot-on that a good therapist will not conflate my personal feelings with how I feel about everybody.

Again, a good therapist will know that you do not feel that way about all fat people. If she suggests that you do, first make it clear that its specific to you. If she still insists that you feel that way about every fat person, you should look into a different therapist who will not hinder your recovery.  Also, if your idea of fat for YOURSELF is gaining even a few pounds, obviously that is still disordered. It is okay (and preferred) to not want to be clinically overweight because that comes with it's own health problems.   I'm a little all over the place but I hope that helps a bit",False,False
