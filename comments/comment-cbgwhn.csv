That's a good one.   I don't have much else to add, but i definitely agree, i feel like it's easy for people to forget how important independence is in life, especially during the tougher times, and in this case, for those of us who use our bad eating habits/disordered eating, etc as a means to have control,  it (fm trying to step in and decide what's right for you, etc)  can end up making things worse, since it can cause you to feel like you have even less control over your actions now that they're trying to pick and choose what you should do.",False,True

It also helps when they're careful to avoid suggesting that I'm weird and sick. Normalcy can be really, really nice, especially when things are deeply abnormal.  I like being able to always choose my food, even when it isn't healthy too.  &gt; I'm asking because i asked myself this, and basically my answer is for them to just leave me be or to just basically enable me.  So like...same, I guess, to a degree. But if they start to affirm disordered shit I say, or act like I've never said it, then I start feeling a bit silly/helpless/sad.",False,False
