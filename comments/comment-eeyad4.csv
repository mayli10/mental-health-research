I used to purge constantly for awhile even in public restrooms and train stations but since I don't purge maybe I am fine and should not bother anybody and I feel guilty if I make people worried or feel bad for me.  &amp;#x200B;  I really hope things get better for you &lt;3 I just feel too normal for help and I keep backing out.,False,True
