Never. No seconds!  If I am still feeling ""hungry"" after I have eaten what I have tracked and carefully portioned out for myself, I have tea. If that doesn't fill my empty hole, I start cleaning. Clean my whole house.. Do laundry or whatever. Keeps me busy. I also like to color.  Tracking lets me see exactly what calories I am putting in my body. I count the calories before I put them on my plate. That is another thing. Use plates. A promise to yourself to not eat out of the  bag, cartons, the pan...whatever. Using a plate helps with portion control. I also put the leftovers away before I eat my plate so that I won't nibble on more after dinner as I am putting it away. Eating at set times helps me by not over snacking between meals or binging while my boyfriend is asleep.  Sometimes I get pretty hungry waiting for a meal time, but the feeling passes after a glass of water then pretty soon before I know it.. It's meal time! I have not purged in a few years and I still struggle with binge. I had gotten so used to just eating untill I was marvelously full of rich and heavy foods, and then ""getting rid of it."" In recovery I can't get full like that because there is no purge after. I am stuck with those calories, no purge.. they are in me!  It's rough I get what you are talking about.  ",False,False

Dinner was at 4:30 and i ate constantly from then until 11:30. Usually I only eat dinner ~6 so I didn't do anything differently than my usual. ,False,True

Did you eat ""normal"" meals/snacks or did you restrict in preparation for dinner?   Sometimes, but not all the time, eating somewhat normal before special holiday dinners makes me less likely to binge. I'm reminded that I've already had x amount of food and don't feel like I can/need to make up for missed calories. ",False,False
