Well, I still am a prissy uppity bitch who doesn’t like to be grossed out, so I’m still exempting myself from actual bulimia. 8k calories is an impressive amount, that’s what, 2 handfuls of almonds?",False,False

I counted how many calories I binge on before, it came out to more than the people on my 600 lb life eat in a day (8,000+). I do this several times a week and I'm 130 lbs.

It turns out most of the calories are absorbed fairly quickly, so purging is mostly just a pointless nasty pain in the ass. No offense to the purgers in the audience, but I’m glad I just restrict.
