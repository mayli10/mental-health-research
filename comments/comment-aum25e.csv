My growth plates are pretty fused already unfortunately. And I haven't even been restricting lately. I've been eating around maintenance and yet at every opportunity to eat or binge I take it. ,False,True

I've personally taken it after waking up in the middle of the night (because of restricting during the day I'm guessing?) but it does require you to literally lie in bed waiting for it to kick in and in the meantime you have to resist that urge to go to the kitchen. Which sucks. But ü§∑,False,False

You'll get sleepy mid ""dinner"" and you'll just go to bed earlier. It at least reduces the damage",False,False

That helps me a lot - especially when I eat a larger breakfast than I'm used to (I am not a natural breakfast eater at all) it tends to prevent me from eating less later in the day. I think this could help w/my next point too which is that tbh, at your age I would try and avoid restricting too much so that it might affect opportunities to grow in height. You might be feeling more hungry than usual and gaining weight in preparation for growing taller?",False,False

People think that self-control is something that happens in the moment but I prefer to think of it as something we need to practice minute-to-minute throughout our lives. For example, instead of looking at the food in front of you and making the decision on whether to eat it or not, perhaps you could make the decision earlier when you‚Äôre in the grocery store not to purchase it or bring it into your home in the first place? I did this for a while a few years back and found it really helpful.   Another trick I have (and ymmv on this one because I think it‚Äôs more my OCD than my ED) is that I have food strictly designated into certain categories. Like some foods are weekend foods only, and my disorder categorically will not let me eat those foods during the week. It would be completely unimaginable, it‚Äôs not a thing I ever have to worry or think about. I also am one of those stereotypical Anas that has a ‚Äústash‚Äù of food that‚Äôs strictly for hoarding and not for eating. I have boxes and boxes of candy filling the shelves of my storage room that I wouldn‚Äôt even dream of touching because they‚Äôre not for eating, they‚Äôre for keeping. Maybe you could try designating your binge or trigger foods as foods that are for someone else, or something like that? ",False,False

I think it's just because I like food and have no self control anymore. I used to restrict so much and ever since hitting 88 lbs it's like I gave myself permission to eat again and I just keep gaining and gaining. I'm walking/ running 10 miles a day and I'm eating enough that I'm still gaining a couple pounds a week. It's just become a habit. Go to bed at 9. Wake up at 11 and binge. Go back to sleep. Wake up at 3am and binge again. ,False,True

Have you been able to identify *why* you‚Äôre binging at night?   Is it because you‚Äôve been restricting all day and are hungry so when you start eating you just can‚Äôt stop? In which case you could consider eating smaller portions earlier in/throughout the day to combat this.   Is it because the food is there after a long day of being away from home and you can‚Äôt control the impulse? In which case you could try prepping and portioning your meals in the morning/on the weekends so it‚Äôs already ready to go when you‚Äôre ready to eat and you don‚Äôt have to work out calories or anything, you can just eat it and then put the eating part of the day behind you.   Is it emotional binging? In which case you could try identifying other self-soothing techniques (reading a book, going for a walk, calling a friend, playing a video game, etc) to try instead of going for the food first.
