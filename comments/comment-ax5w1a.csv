As exhausting as it is to restrict, I’ve yet to find a better mood stabilizer. So I look back on my life when I was dangerously thin, and also able to juggle three part time jobs, honor courses/tracks, research etc., and it’s hard for me not to long for that.   A big part of recovery that I think many professionals over look is finding other things that bring you that same stability and enjoyment, but healthier (ideally). For me? That’s one aspect of recovery never addressed; everything else feels like beating a dead horse. ",False,False

My restriction led me to binge eating, and since I’m at a healthy weight with no major medical problems from my ED, people aren’t concerned. So I’m stuck feeling like a failure because I can’t eat normally, I can’t restrict like I used to, and it’s putting me deeper and deeper into this spiral of depression and self loathing.   It’s hard to look back on those periods, esp., when you idealize them. ",False,False
