Iâ€™m 22 and started developing my ED when I was 12, and it has led to a really difficult place to get out of. It used to be that I liked eating but would feel guilty and force myself to restrict, but now itâ€™s at a point where I hate everything about eating and food, so much so that itâ€™s a chore, and I canâ€™t stop losing weight (Iâ€™m at a healthy BMI but I look really, really, really small). It scares me that there are younger people engaging in these behaviors because it takes you without you noticing. Every time I see someone doing something I do or used to do I say something about it &amp; express my concern.",False,False

It was so mundane, but I remember it clearly. For a while I had been noticing all of the little signs posted in dining areas around my college campus saying ""an average person needs 2,000 to 2,400 calories per day"" and I had been thinking about how difficult it is to stay within that range with the options given to us. When an average meal is 1,400 calories you either eat once a day and fall under or eat twice and go over. The exact moment my anorexia started was when I had been thinking about how little money I had left on my meal plan and I told myself that if I just ate less I could save money and lose some weight. I remember exactly how stressed Iwas in that moment because I was failing most of my classes that semester due to my mental health and it felt like I wasn't in control of anything in my life. My weight was the one thing I could control.   Next thing I knew I was to trying not to cry over half of a left over bagel because I didn't want to eat it even though I was starving but I was trying to force myself to and if I started crying while my roommate was in the kitchen he would know something was up. (*He did realize something was up anyways.*) I couldn't get myself to eat anything more than a pack of instant ramen a day or maybe a box of mac and cheese if I was too hungry to not eat something. A pack of noodles is around 300 calories and mac and cheese is like 800 calories a box so it's not like either of those were even close to enough for me. I tried to take control of something in my life yet ended up spiraling out of control with that as well.  Anyway, I'm probably going to cry now ðŸ™ƒ",False,False

It makes me so sad because I feel like kids today keep getting better and better - they are smarter and funnier and way more tolerant and understanding than any other generation and I think that's awesome.  But they are also more anxious. And more depressed.  Oh, and they have to deal with a humongous fucking internet now.  I don't even know how I found certain pro-ED websites back then (especially when I didn't have my own computer or smart phone) but I'm pretty sure most kids my age weren't triggering themselves with pro-ana boards and chatgroups, but now that shit is on every single social media platform.  They are constantly bombarded with pictures on instagram of girls they think are more beautiful, skinnier, sexier, when in reality it's 90% photoshop and other bullshit.  I hope they all know that it's fake and most of the people they envy don't actually have waists that tiny or legs that long IRL. Unfortunately, even if you know it's edited, it still affects you.  You still want to look like that.  You still have stress that you need a way to cope with. One picture or one tumblr post can be the starting trigger to a cascade in a young psyche.  It makes me think about my BFF trio growing up. My two closest friends from elementary to high school were so fucking smart and chill and funny and just awesome young ladies.  But we all had EDs.  We talked about food and exercise and ways to not eat it or eat better obsessively but I don't think we ever, ever said the A word or the B word even though all three of us engaged in those behaviors.    I remember all three of us doing no carb, OMAD, eating a highly restrictive diet and only for 1 hour a day, skipping breakfast and ""eating"" not-lunch together, and throwing up and constantly struggling with stupid fucking food and our perfectly fine and healthy and athletic bodies (hi, I want that body back please. I promise I won't hurt you again).  I remember one of them pouring her heart out to me about her eating issues when we were about 15 and me just realizing oh shit, this is not normal, and I have the same thoughts. But I'm not as ""bad"" as her because I would never readily admit all of this, so it's okay.  And then watching her weight go up and down 20lbs every few months and experiencing the changes in her mood that precipitated or occurred simultaneously with the loss/gain. Or watching her mom have the same issues and only now realizing the damage she accidentally did to her daughter. Or us having a sleepover and not fucking eating and congratulating ourselves. Or two of us shamefully eating popcorn together, feeling somehow both superior and inferior to the one doing sit-ups for thirty minutes instead of joining us. And how do I tell my friend who used to be muscular and athletic that I'm concerned that she lost 40lbs in six months and looks frail and that she needs to get help when I am trying to do the same thing to myself? And I am only 16 and I don't know how to deal with my own issues, much less hers.  I just told her she looks great.   And the dumbest part is that they were both so intelligent (we met in a gifted program and one of them is literally a rocket scientist now and the other is like a savant multi-instrumental musician and I'm just here posting on reddit and watching tv all day haHAaaA) and we all came from families that cared about us and seemed nice on the outside, but this shit still pervaded.  And since we weren't technically in obvious or imminent danger and had relatively put together home lives, we didn't think we needed help nor were we offered it.  I see all of the teens posting here and every single one of them is sooo smart and perceptive and it breaks my heart that they are afflicted by this stuff.  It's not surprising to see that though because [several studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3016382/) have found that people with AN or kids at high risk for developing AN have slightly higher IQs and better working memory (gotta remember every single calorie xd). You guys that post here are so intelligent and recognize your failures of logic but that doesn't mean jackshit when it comes to getting better.  It's so easy to almost accidentally fall into this shit when you're 12, 15, 17.  I feel like I had no real control then and no self awareness and it just happened by default.  Now, I feel like I should have the capacity and tools to be done with it, but I guess not! These behaviors and thought patterns are ingrained.  I think it's pretty rare for an ED to randomly manifest after your mid 20s with no prior related behaviors, so if we could make it so that it just never happened to kids, so many adults wouldn't have to be dealing with this shit.  How the fuck do we fix this cycle?  &amp;#x200B;  SORRY THIS IS SO DANG LONG and jumbled i'm tired af",False,False

It breaks my heart because I can put myself in their shoes.  Not just that but any depression, self-harm, worry, isolation, loneliness they feel with it, too.  Maybe I am just projecting because that was me not too long ago.  I felt so worthless and I didnâ€™t deserve to be happy.  I want to tell them they are beautiful, special, they have so much to live for but it just feels like it might invalidate their feelings.  I just listen.

I know of people in their 30s and 40s who are struggling, and many beyond that. When I see my teen friends struggling with ED behaviours too it makes me so, so sad. This is such an awful pit to fall in to.   (And tbh, that's a primary motivation for recovery for me. As someone who has spent the past 7 years dealing with this bs, I don't want to be doing these awful things when I hit my next decade. I want to live normally!)",False,False
