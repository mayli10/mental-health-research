I guarantee if you've been binge/purge/restricting for almost 30 years, trying to maintain a 1200 calorie diet isn't going to be sustainable, and you're going to spiral back into bad habits.   I like the idea of starting with a healthy diet. This is basically what I did. Don't track or count calories at first. Eat as much as you want of healthy food. If you overeat, don't purge to make up for it. Don't try to compensate for it the next day. Just keep eating normally so your hormones and satiety signals start to normalize. Once that happens (which is going to take longer than you think - don't start too early), then MAYBE consider trying to restrict. But for now, just eat healthy food to satiety. For the first couple of months that I was trying to recover, I cut out most junk food, but let myself eat as much as I wanted of non-triggering healthy food (largely paleo, but including dairy and grains; didn't eat nuts or nut butter b/c that was a trigger food for me). If I overate, I would just continue normally as though that didn't happen.   I'm currently tracking calories and macros again, after a couple months, but I don't have a calorie goal - just tracking to make sure I'm fueling myself properly to make weight for a weight class. I haven't really spiraled, aside from one binge relapse, for which I didn't purge or restrict afterwards, and it's much easier to maintain mentally than constantly trying to binge/restrict.",False,False
