All it really does is make me shaky and talk a lot",False,False

Now I wonder if perhaps when I feel that way and decide to drink more caffeine if it is actually making it worse. I can only say that it never seems to be effective. I can't be certain of that however because I have no way of knowing if I would feel worse without caffeine. Maybe I should test that out. I wouldn't want to pass out and ruin my sleep schedule though.,False,False

I love coffee but I have to limit myself to 90mg of caffeine or I'm fucked. I also don't understand ppl who fast for days and still drink coffee like ??? I'd be a shaky sweaty disaster.,False,False

Can't have more than one shot of espresso or it gets pretty bad",False,False
