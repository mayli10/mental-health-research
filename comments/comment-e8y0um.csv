I wish I had something more useful to say, but unfortunately, no words can help a hurt like this. I hope the pain lessens with time, and you find yourself in a happier and more stable place.",False,True

I relapsed this year after 14 years of recovery when my little sister died. I’m fully aware that this is a poor coping strategy because life has been shit recently.    PM me if you ever want to talk.,False,False

This break down seems different and while I'm not immediately suicidal I just don't want to live anymore.  I don't think I want to get better either.  Ur screen name makes me assume you live in Denver too!  At least we know we aren't alone!,False,False

I really hope that you are right and that this is just another one of those episodes, but it's been a month and 10 pounds since this started, and it's only getting worse. I know I should talk to some one and seek out some kind of mental help, but as I said in the post, I don't want to fight it this time. Thank you for listening, and taking the time to respond.",False,True
