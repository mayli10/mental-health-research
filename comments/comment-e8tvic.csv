I do keep my macros balanced and eat nutrient dense food within my calorie allowances. I was just surprised to notice such a stark difference on the days I don’t take supplements/ vitamins!,False,True

Apparently most animals don't produce B12 on their own the way we produce vitamins like D3 or how plants produce vitamins like beta carotene. It seems that most B12 comes from soil so grazing animals would get it from grass that they eat and people of the past might have gotten more of it from not cleaning their vegetables too well. She didn't explain where B12 originally comes from, so I can't be certain she is well-informed on the subject, but she said that most foods with B12 are fortified to have it rather than having it naturally. I had assumed it was just produced naturally by animals which was why it is so abundant in meat and seems to be completely absent from plants, I guess farm animals on industrial farms are just fed fortified grains or whatever it is that corporate farmers feed them. I get most of my B12 through supplements anyway since I don't eat a lot of meat or dairy. I typically only have it if I'm not cooking for myself. I prefer nut drinks at home personally and I would much rather have tofu than meat since I don't have to worry about cooking it properly. (*It's also easier on my stomach since it's so soft and I prefer the taste I guess, but that's mostly since tofu absorbs flavours so well.*) Most of the dairy I consume is in the meal replacement shakes I drink since they have a significantly different vitamin content than the multivitamin I take. If I have any meat it's typically either cheap fatty meat from places like Taco Bell and McDonald's or it's chicken because I think chicken tastes better than beef or pork and it's not usually cooked in ways that make it so rough.",False,False

Your body needs vitamins and minerals for proper function just as it needs carbs, lipids, and proteins. The average person's diet certainly isn't ideal, but it's typically better than a restrictive diet. A big nutrient you are probably missing out on is potassium. Only 5% of people get the recommended amount and since it is an electrolyte you are probably both not getting enough and expelling excess as you exercise. I constantly recommend to people that they track what they eat to ensure that they are maintaining a healthy diet. Doctors typically only test for nutritional deficiencies if they have a really good reason to. For people with eating disorders nutritional deficiencies are a major threat to our health. I know that around my current weight last year when I wasn't focused so much on nutrition and just on intake that I had major problems with symptoms like numbness in my extremities, lightheadedness, migraines, and plenty of others. Since I realized that I was getting really sick and tried to fix that I have been focusing on taking steps where I can to improve my health. This came after I tried recovery and realized that it didn't fix the biggest problems I was experiencing. I started using Cronometer initially to make meal plans, but I found sticking to them in my condition very difficult, so recently I started using it to record what I eat instead. Around the same time I had considered what I do typically eat in a day and it became evident that adding a multivitamin and some calcium on top of supplements I was already taking would be important. Nutrition didn't cure any of my major problems, but I feel much better than I did two months ago and it's far easier to manage my illness these days. Plus, I believe that I might be back down to my lowest weight or possibly even lower at this point (*only saw a loss of 1lb between my last two doctor's visits, but I was super bloated at both of them, moreso at the second*) and yet I'm still not struggling with numbness in hands or feet and I'm not doing as bad with the other symptoms I had last year from being underweight. I can cross my legs without losing feeling in my feet and stand up without having to worry about standing too quickly. I can generally also manage my migraines just with caffeine and food now as well. I believe it has been over a month since I had to take acetaminophen or ibuprofen. If you focus on getting all of your vitamins and minerals alongside maintaining adequate ratios between your three macronutrients you might feel even better than you do now already with the vitamins you currently take.",False,False
