I got food poisoning when I was about 8 and lost around 6-7kgs too, I didnâ€™t eat anything for a week, just kept throwing up. And my mum loved it and praised me for the weight loss. Told me that I looked great and and that I should keep it up, she just wanted me to keep starving. Looking back as an adult, how insane?? I canâ€™t believe that she actually called it a diet and said that weâ€™ll continue with it. My whole family bullied me for being fat, my dad did the same thing with comparing me to other girls at the nursery, he shamed for being fat at 5 years old, somehow I was the one responsible for it! Iâ€™m sorry you had to go through all of this too xxx",False,False
