They will keep doing this to other people if someone doesn't take a stand. If someone i knew did that to me and my friends (who are all very experienced with psychedelics) we'd probably be out with torches and pitch forks hunting their ass down.,False,False

A lot of people just cannot and should not handle psychedelics and forcing them on people this way is somewhat akin to a mind rape.,False,False
