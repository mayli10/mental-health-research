I really don't understand why people feel entitled to comment of what people eat. Even my grandma took me to a restaurant once and I got an appetizer and entree, and her reaction was ""You sure you can eat all that?"" Well, one 24 hour fast later...I was afraid to even eat half an avocado.",False,False

I had already been fasting for a few days on top of being sick. Well I was getting pretty light headed so I went to a gas station and got a few beef jerky sticks. When I went to pay the clerk just said ""WOW look at all this junk food"" it was litteraly 3 sticks of beef jerky. Needless to say I payed for it and eneded up just peeling off the plastic and throwing them out the car window for the animals to have â˜¹. Atleast something living got to enioy the food haha.",False,False

The gas station attendant said to me the other night ""Got a lot a junk, huh?"" Because yeah Im a binge eating monster and had at least 5000 calories worth of food in my arms. Why do they gotta comment on it?",False,False
