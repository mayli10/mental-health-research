I can't imagine they'd make it mandatory right off the bat (especially if you tell them you can't/won't do it) but it may be more of a future goal.",False,False

I particularly have issues with eating in front of people that make me feel insecure and people that I want to get to like me.  Did you have the option to decline to have the meal, or was it essentially mandatory?",False,True

For me, it was one on one with a dietician and mostly just a casual dinner, with a few more questions, her making sure I didn't order just like a side salad or something, and was definitely a bit weird.  I felt especially odd because I don't particularly struggle with eating in front of people or restaurants, but would either just get the lowest cal thing/eat very little (I hate binging in front of others), so I felt like I wasn't bad enough to be doing it.  Sometimes she would say 'oh maybe some more rice' or whatever, and go over that I still have to eat more that day even though I just had pasta.  &amp;#x200B;  I do know that at the start they told me there were some group meals (which I couldn't make b/c of the time) and that I would have to show that I wouldn't refuse to eat or something so that I didn't trigger others.    &amp;#x200B;  So overall, yes, it's weird.  Just knowing that someone's watching you (but tbh I always feel like someone's watching me, even if it was a friend).  But it was more like a regular session with food if that makes sense",False,False
