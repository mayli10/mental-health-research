Underweight with a huge appetite. I ate 3200 today. I even hit 2k Cals in a day on the regular. Your struggle is valid and some of us out here relate and appreciate you sharing with us. ,False,False

I am around a 16.9 but cant restrict for shit. I will go about two days at 900ish cals this binge as if I fasted for a week. I feel fake, I get all the regret and self hate but none of the discipline, or rather fear? Stay safe ",False,False

Like I don’t eat but I want to eat every second of the day lol.  But Ed’s come in all shapes and sizes, yours is as valid as anyone else’s. ",False,False

My BMI is fifteen but I binge and purge literally every day, and thanksgiving will be no exemption. i feel like i'm way too relaxed about food in general to have an ED. yeah, i purge, and I fast or restrict when I don't, but like, i pig the fuck out on a regular basis.

But I’m still technically overweight. I feel like I’m never allowed to comment on having an ED because only thin people have eating disorders...so I get not feeling validated.    It’s sadly like that with a lot of disorders. If you don’t have the “classic” signs and symptoms then you’re faking it according to most society. ,False,False

That’s something I struggle with too, I’m underweight but I’m a mix between ortho and ana. I still eat enough to stay healthy, but i could eat a lot more and I know it. I feel like many people with restrictive EDs could eat an insane amount because our bodies are probably starving. An ED isn’t hating food, an ED is an unhealthy relationship with it, never feel that yours is invalid ❤️",False,False
