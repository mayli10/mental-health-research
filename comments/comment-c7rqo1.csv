Also speaking of Bean, when she finally realized that she'd been neglecting her and saw the mange in her fur and the pee stains on the floor...that broke my heart.",False,False

I loved it, but it definitely wasn't good for me either and I'm so much worse for having read it. I totally get what you mean. I didn't watch any of her movies after reading, though I was tempted to, but I've crolled through her Instagram probably a thousand times.",False,False
