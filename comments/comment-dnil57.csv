I also used to take vitamin C since it's good for collagen production, but it doesn't do much for me personally since I have a genetic collagen mutation.  I just wouldn't take vitamin D without getting your blood work done first, since (unlike the other ones) it's fat soluble and can lead to vitamin D poisoning",False,False

I've been dealing with really bad thin, brittle hair and bald spots for 6 years and always assumed it was either from my ED (and/or from other things like the malabsorption I get from gastroparesis), or that I damaged most of my follicles when I had really bad trichotillomania. Turned out that it was almost entirely from hypothyroidism! I'm not even on the exact dosage yet, and my hair and skin have already improved tremendously!  Biotin and B12 helps a lot too!",False,False

It could be your thyroid or pcos. Do you still get periods? Make sure you’re getting enough iron and vitamins too. Try supplementing with an omega 3, multivitamin, or vitamin b if no issues come up with your bloodwork.   Mention to your doc about your eating disorder too. They’ll take the checkup more seriously and maybe try to check you up more often. At the eating disorder clinic, the nurses and docs told me that a lot of their patients had hormonal issues due to eating disorders.",False,False

To be honest a friend of mine once told me she had bald spots (she had problems with pulling her hair) and I honestly never noticed but she could see it. So maybe your stylist only noticed because you were so close to one another?,False,False
