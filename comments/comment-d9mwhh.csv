I lost weight and gained muscle eating around 1500 calories/day and heavy lifting.",False,False

So no, you don’t want to eat only 600-800 a day. I’d suggest trying the Macros Inc calculator and following that to a tee. I’d estimate you’d likely need at *least* 1200-1300 which is around what I got, and I have a very low TDEE (1600-1800 depending on the day).",False,False

Like, I've done it. But I started with very, very little muscle. As Vice [explains](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wj9vdz/how-to-lose-weight-and-build-muscle-at-the-same-time), the more muscular you are, the more impossible it gets to gain while on a deficit. Since you're a beginner, it's potentially doable, although I seriously doubt 600-800 calories a day will be enough. The deficit can exist, but it generally can't be extreme.",False,False

Lifting = damaging muscle fibers, those muscle fibers are then repaired to be stronger. If you are in a caloric deficit or at maintenance, they can't be adequately repaired to be any stronger or larger because that requires more energy (more calories) than maintenance. It's literally rebuilding muscle tissue, it takes a lot of energy. It's possible to lose fat on a deficit, which can make muscles more visible, but it is, by definition, impossible to increase muscle mass on a caloric deficit.",False,False

I have like a male pattern weight distribution, so if like to add more mass to my lower half and maybe to the shoulders to give a more hourglass appearance.   I think I'm okay with the scale number being higher if I look leaner, but it's the idea of adding a lot of fat with the muscle that's scaring me.

What about your body do you want to change?   Are you willing to gain any weight? You’re likely to LOOK smaller but BE heavier - or is the scale number too important to you?
