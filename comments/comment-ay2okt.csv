Actual quote from the book:  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Imagine I blow up a balloon and tie it off, and I put it on the table in front of you. If I drape a thin sheet over the balloon, you will see every contour. If I toss a thick horse blanket over it, you might see that something‚Äôs there, but it would be less evident. For the first time in a while, you currently have digesting food, stool, and gas at various stages through your digestive system. These are the metaphorical ‚Äúair‚Äù blowing up the ‚Äúballoon‚Äù of your GI tract. Because you have insufficient fat and muscle, your abdominal wall is lying like a thin sheet over that balloon. Your muscles literally aren‚Äôt strong enough anymore to hold in the contents of your abdomen. Therefore, you can see every meal. By contrast, I have a nice horse blanket: plenty of fat and muscle. As a result, pretty much no matter what I eat, my belly looks the same. I encourage you to reframe and understand that only people who are malnourished and underweight can ‚Äúsee their meal.‚Äù As you get stronger and more weight restored, this will resolve. For now, understand that this protuberant stomach is a sign of malnutrition, the opposite of what you are fearing.  &amp;#x200B;  Gaudiani, Jennifer L..
