My recovery isn’t perfect and I’m not trying to convince anyone of that, but if im able to do something that others aren’t quite in a position to do themselves, I’m up for helping!  I get that, intuitive eating is difficult, and sometimes we can’t really trust our bodies at first, but with time you can. If that’s something you’re interested in. I don’t believe that intuitive eating is the only way you can be recovered though. I generally still make myself meal plans every day (very loose just what I’m going to eat) because that’s how I like it. 🤷🏻‍♀️",False,False
