It comes in bags, and sits in this funny-smelling vat of hot water until it's ready to be served. They just dump it out of the bag and into the bowl.  Their whole ""clean food"" ad campaign is complete bullshit and it irks me so much. Just because they serve salads doesn't mean they can claim to have nothing unnatural in their food. Everything that's not a fresh vegetable is packed with preservatives and sodium.  Idk about the lemonade, man... it's just lemonade, no hidden demons or anything (aside from the calories lol)",False,False
