French is hard and passing an exam on it is amazing! There will always be people criticizing unfortunately. Not to make this about me but when I got bad grades, people including me thought I was really dumb. Now I turned that around but turns out that I've become a ""nerd"". And in our language the word for nerd means *cow* so I just get triggered and think that it's about my weight lol  You gotta be your own biggest supporter in life and surround yourself with those who appreciate you. Wishing the best of luck 💙",False,False

They’re hard as hell to learn!! I should know, I tried a bunch! Fuck those people who tried taking away your achievement.   I’m sure you’re good at a ton of other things too, OP. I don’t know you, but I’m sure you’re a decent person with talents that you can’t see. The people in your life have reasons for loving and caring about you!   There’s also more to a person than what they’re “good at”. You’re enriching the world just by being in it. I know it’s frustrating to feel like you’ve got no skills, but you’re doing your best! And that is truly enough.",False,False
