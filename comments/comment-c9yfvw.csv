I have seen it on dieting advice aimed at the non-ED population. For non-ED people, I believe it. For ED people, I am skeptical. One exception could be people who go from long term anorexia and develop BED or bulimia, but I classify that as still having eating problems (because duh) that are affecting weight. If all that makes sense...",False,False

But I've maintained steady and never above 150 lbs (never going back above 150 even if I die). I'm restricting again and trying to lose weight this summer and CICO is all I'm doing and it's working. I only gained weight when I stopped counting and just gave up on caring about my intake and exercise.

It's hard to maintain a weight that's lower than the weight that your typical habits keep you at so once you get tired of putting 100% into weight loss/maintanence (like many many people do) you'll naturally regain some weight. Hence why life style changes are preferable to short term diets.  I think to spin it as ""don't diet because you'll gain MORE THAN WHEN YOU STARTED!!!"" is insidious and purposely antagonizing, though.  There's nothing wrong with fluctuating in weight.  Sure I'd love to be a low weight all year long, but this girl likes to hibernate during the winter and is only active when it's warm out y'know? Life isn't static, change your weight how you want when you have the time and energy to.",False,False

Rationally though, I know it's not the case. I don't give a shit what people say, CICO works and it is completely possible to recover and get back to the same, or around the same, weight you were.
