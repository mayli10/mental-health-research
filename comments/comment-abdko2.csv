Ask her to come over (even if you're panicking and making excuses) and ask her to help you out by not accepting those excuses and have you go out anyways. It may be super shitty but you can feel less guilty about cancelling, and you could always suggest you guys go on a walk or go to a park and get some exercise. That way you can alleviate your anxiety about the step goal. I also got a Fitbit for christmas so I know exactly how that feels. Best of luck to you",False,False
