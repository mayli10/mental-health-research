My parents cared about me for once, they allowed me to eat junk food, they didn't tell me that people wouldn't like me for my weight but only told me they didn't like me but I don't expect that to change any time soon. I don't want this to be an attention grab on this subreddit lol I've just had a bad day and want a whine. But guys attention will give you nothing if you feel shit and malnourished anyway, it will only annoy you at that point. Please stay as nourished as you can :) the best attention you can give yourself is self love and care.",False,False
