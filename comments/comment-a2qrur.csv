I can’t give more advice without more info about your country/insurance/ect. but I would recommend checking out the /r/ADHD sub if you haven’t already and searching around, there’s a ton of great info. Oftentimes your doctor is actually the least informed about insurance things, as opposed to the pharmacist or your actual insurance company. There’s a lot of great info on the adhd sub about certain program to qualify for greatly reduced Vyvanse (like $30 if I remember correctly). Also, while Vyvanse is great due to its slow-release feature, it’s essentially very similar to taking a fast-release amphetamine salt at more intervals. If you can’t afford Vyvanse at all and none of the avenues to reduce the fee work for you, try talking to your doctor about an alternate prescription of a fast acting drug you can take 2-3 times a day instead. Good luck! ",False,False

Vyvanse is most effective for me but it is really fucks up my sleep and that can negate any good effects (nothing like horrible fatigue to trigger overeating).   Vyvanse just happened to have the studies behind it to be approved for binge eating but you could find the same results with adderall. They're all speed.   Why do you think they are terrible? I kind of agree even though I still take them on occasion. But curious about your thoughts. ,False,False

I've tried them all. This is NOT worth spending that much money over.  You can get generic extended release amphetamine salts for like $10 a month. Seriously, they all work on the same receptors.
