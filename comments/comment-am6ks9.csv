The love of my live, who is a cisgendered male, was afflicted by bulimia for two years. I am pained every single time I think about it. Thank god he is recovered now, but if he wasn't, I'd give him all the support in the world to try to overcome bulimia. Never did I once think ""he didn't have bulimia"" because he was male, nor did I think his bulimia didn't matter. I would be fighting every single day for him if he still was afflicted by it now, and I am very glad he doesn't anymore.  I'm literally just referring to using the incorrect pronoun on an online, anonymous platform to strangers.  &gt; But don't expect some to like you much, when they care about this and you prioritize expressing your private dislike of them over that. That's all.  1)I don't care about random people disliking me. 2)I never expressed disliking a single person. I do not dislike you. Expressing disagreement in an opinion is not equivalent to hating on the person themselves. If you went to my house and needed help, I would be very welcoming to you and get you that help you needed to the best of my ability, without crossing my own boundaries.   &gt; Going by the votes on this post  You should go by the votes of this specific conversation",False,False

I've never once told people here to have different ""feelings"", only asked to be more considerate towards others' in how they handle them.  &gt; This post was kinda supposed to be generalized, tbh. I've seen everyone from trans men to cis women be uncomfortable about the assumptions that people online with EDs are all (teenaged, white, American) women, so it felt worth a reminder.  Also:  &gt; isn't the time/place to be offended by gender neutrality; **take that argument somewhere else.**  Original question:  &gt; Can people please not assume everyone in here is a ""girl"" or ""lady"" by default?  If people want to privately think fat people are disgusting, sure. If people want to privately think every man with an eating disorder doesn't matter and ""ladies"" is one-size-fits-all, sure. But there are some things you keep to yourself instead of sharing in eating disorder support spaces.  And even then, hey, they can say those things if they're the kind of person who just doesn't give a shit.  &gt; Nobody's forcing you to not be a dick about this if you really want to  But don't expect some to like you when they care about this and you prioritize grammar over them..
