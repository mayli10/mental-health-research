It does seem kind of douche-y to comment on someone’s eating habits like that, but I’m sure she didn’t mean anything by it :)",False,False
effanyo,t3_alhc6v,t3_alhc6v,shamo42,1,2019-01-31 01:43:31,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/alhc6v/you_really_like_your_chocolate_dont_you/effanyo/,From my experience unnecessary comments about food like these just happen from time to time at workplaces. You can look like Brad Pit in his 20s and still get a stupid remark about your food choices. Simply because they are different from person to person. I don't think it means anybody thinks you're fat. It's just people being people.  &amp;#x200B;  I looked up Nakd bars because it sounds delicious. But the ones I checked have all around 44% sugar which is more than the chocolate I can 't stop eating sometimes. Is there maybe a special low carb version?,False,False

I’m sorry that happened. I’m sure she wasn’t trying to imply anything about your appearance, maybe she was just trying to make small talk? ",False,False
