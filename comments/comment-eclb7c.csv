I think realizing why I was doing it was very helpful to me. Iâ€™m going to residential in a week and hoping to finally recover now that I have help. I know itâ€™s going to suck but I believe I can do it.,False,False

Thereâ€™s just something about that pain from hunger that feeds me. Gives me validation. Makes me feel alive and worthy of existence. But I know (for me at least) itâ€™s also about control. I get worse when I feel things are spiraling out of control. That high from not eating feels even better then. Hunger is oddly comforting.,False,False

Also trying to push past that 400 every day. What you said about being able now to control what goes inside your body...something just clicked in my head. I feel like I understand my disorder so much better now. Thanks for sharing your struggle! 790 is a win btw, every bite is a win",False,False

I was talking to my therapist today about how this is all about control and how the less I have control of other parts of life the more I restrict.  And I also love the feeling of being hungry.  And Iâ€™m also an adult (30!!) and have a freaking kid.  Even though I KNOW BETTER I still canâ€™t get out of the restrict/binge cycle.  Even though I know better I still have an eating disorder and a pile of other mental illness.  It fucking sucks.  But itâ€™s nice to know that we arenâ€™t alone. ðŸ–¤ðŸ–¤ðŸ–¤ try to be nice to yourself.,False,False

I definitely see my need for control around food/eating as very linked (at least in huge part) to past abuse, including sexual abuse. I empathise on how hard it is to make yourself eat when the practice of self-restraint &amp; control related to restricting food can feel thrilling, especially when you've been stripped of power &amp; control before. &lt;3",False,False
