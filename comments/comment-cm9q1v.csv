They just give you terrible periods.   Every birth control I’ve tried gives me migraines too so it’s just sticking it out.,False,True

Personally I dont want kids so I have no motivation to keep my period, but I totally understand that not everyone is like that! Good luck!",False,False

I have fibroids and bleed so heavily at the peak I’ll soak through 2 nighttime pads and an ultra tampon in half a night and still bleed through to my sheets (queue memories of my mom shaming me for this and all those feels). I’ve actually considered going to the hospital it’s gotten so bad. I would love to be done with it. But I also want another baby eventually and that would be counterproductive.,False,True

I've got extremely bad periods... like the kind of cramps where some days my body will not let me move from one position, blood clots the size of golf balls, once as big as a baseball, cysts, migraines, so much blood that I have to flush twice to get it all down the toilet... basically the period from hell. So the fact that my period has been getting super spotty and light lately just makes me happy. My therapist is all ""it's not good that you're starting to lose your period"" and honestly... for me, it is good. Not for my bone health but for my mental health yeah cause my depression gets so so much worse during my periods. Sorry to derail your post.  Was gonna say, I usually go to the store and just buy 2 chocolate bars (usually theres a 2/$4 sale) and tell myself those are for the next 7-9 days (usually how long my period is) while I'm craving chocolate like crazy. It seems to help to show my body it can have what it wants, I end up feeling less crazy cravey after a few chocolate squares. If that helps for you, let me know!",False,False
