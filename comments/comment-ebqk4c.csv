Same as going to the gym, calorie counting, going on certain diets etc. I’m not saying it is not triggering, but one thought that helped me was “if you are mad at someone else’s weight loss pictures you are projecting your own insecurities onto somebody else.”",False,False

I have moved on and am healing but it's hard because I know she is still spreading lies about me. All I can do is be the best version of myself I can be and that will speak for itself.

She said how when people say certain things or show certain behaviors, instead of taking it personally (“what did *I* do to make them say/do that?”), you should reflect on what’s going on with *them* to make them say/do that. For example, if someone commented on what food you’re eating or how much of it, something that can be very triggering, deflect that from yourself by trying to understand that the person who said that might be working through their own food issues, and it is not an actual assessment of *you*, if that makes sense. I am someone who takes everything personally lmao, and redirecting those anxiety thoughts really helps. My professor liked to talk about her metaphorical armor; if she had her armor on, nothing could hurt her and things could only roll off of her.",False,False

I did no such thing, and she knows I also have issues with eating. I could not say anything food related around her. At all. I couldn't even say I put something in the fridge or went out to eat. Or I got yelled at. And I tried not to say anything that triggered her but, sometimes I forgot and I wasn't sure when she was having a bad or good day. Meanwhile she could talk about her weight, calorie counting, bingeing etc constantly and I just had to listen to it. I wasn't allowed to be upset or triggered. The double standards were terrible. She used me for validation, insulting her body in front of me all the time and I was expected to say, no you're beautiful but she'd just say no I'm fat and disgusting, there was nothing I could do but I was basically a tool for her. She could use me as validation or as a reason to go purge. She was also ridiculously jealous of my body. All of this took a toll on my mental health along with the rest of her abuse. It wasn't all about her ED, of course, she just used it as another way to control me.  She did this with all of her other mental health issues as well, it wasn't her responsibility to heal but everyone else's to coddle her, explaining away bad coping mechanisms and behaviors with ""it's my mental illness"" without any intention or effort to change it.  Anyway, thanks for this post. I worry a lot that maybe I am a bad person, maybe I did intentionally trigger her, but, I didn't. I know I didn't. Because my issues are my issues. Don't let your ED make you treat people like she treated me.",False,False

It is tough but it is only tough when we still are in the mode of wanting to participate. Our frustration isn't that they have said something - its that for so long we allowed ourselves to be motivated by it and now (if we are trying to recover) we no longer can be.  Its essentially like someone taking away something that was okay for so long and all of a sudden deciding no that's dangerous. You'd be lost.  Don't give up. You can do it.,False,True
