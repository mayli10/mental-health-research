Being busy is probably a good diet plan.  Numbers on the scale are just numbers; if you lose 5# of fat and gain 5# of muscle, you will weigh the same but be noticeably thinner.",False,False

Now I won‚Äôt let anyone who has seen me at my LW see me if I‚Äôm even just one pound over because I feel so ashamed and like my lack of discipline is written all over my body. I‚Äôll even go out of my way to new stores if I‚Äôm running errands because if I don‚Äôt feel thin enough, I can‚Äôt stand being seen at the shops I frequent for fear that the store employees are judging my body.  I‚Äôm friendless atm, but every female friend I‚Äôve had has been competitive about weight and looks and has made unsolicited comments about my body, and as lonely as I am, I might just isolate myself forever.",False,False
