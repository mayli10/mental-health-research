But eds are mental illnesses and it's always best to try to recover before the physical consequences of it become more pronounced. They could also be there and you're not able to see them. Your heart, your digestive system, etc... Also looking skinny and sick is very aesthetic probably, but you could die bc of an ed while being morbidly obese or even on a healthy bmi. If you have the chance and the will to recover you should take it, don't compare yourself to others because that's also very toxic behavior that will only drive you further into this. ",False,False
