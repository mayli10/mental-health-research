Restriction and biological starvation triggers depression, psychological and chemically. And well you eat after, then feel the need to restrict. So, maybe trying a more sustainable diet when you feel well will prevent the lows or make them less intense. A good diet and exercise do have a chemical impact on our brain therefore mood. It is not the only factor and not the only solution at all, therapy or meds might be needed. But trying to stop the cycle is a start :) try to increase the intake with amounts you feel comfortable, maybe 100 or 200 cal per day/week?",False,False
