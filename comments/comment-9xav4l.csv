Iâ€™m going to have to use this account only here. I had a bigger account, but I was getting too frivolous and posting on Ed subs with it.  Need to stay in hiding. ",False,False

Sad, but true :( those people check comment history and report shit. ",False,False

Itâ€™s sad we canâ€™t speak without a filter but Iâ€™m afraid of losing this new space. I guess we will have to leave it up to the mods to decide what lines we can cross.,False,False

There are points where we have emotional triggers because of how having eating disorders make us think. If we start picking and choosing what people are allowed to vent about, then how can it still feel like aa safe space? ",False,False

We need to be quiet and I do think we need to take down posts about starving ourselves to get revenge on people. I understand that itâ€™s just the ED brain talking but that one post about the girl trying to make her ex boyfriend feel bad felt icky and cringeworthy to me. Iâ€™ve been where that girl was but I donâ€™t think it should be posted. The language was so sad and heartbreaking and may have drawn attention to us in a negative way.,False,False

If we want to be left to our own devices we need to leave everyone else alone and be as self-contained as we can. It's fine to browse other subs but it's a bad idea to come back with screenshots and things.,False,False

When I was in recovery (and actually was recovered!) Iâ€™ve posted something on one diet sub (the big one) and someone commented that this seemed disordered and soo many people got into it and actually discussed if I had an ED and that this wasnâ€™t healthy etc. I didnâ€™t have any other posts on any sub like that, it was based purely on one post.  And I swear it wasnâ€™t bad, like I know what bad is and I do have an Ed but I was recovered for years then and only found out about all the ED subs that day.   I thought it was rude and uncool to analyze others. I got over it and I love love love our community but I can imagine that this was triggering many upset people without EDs to report us without looking at the sub description twice.",False,False
