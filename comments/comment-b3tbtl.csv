Brace yourself, friend, because I‚Äôm about to write a really embarrassing book here.  For a frozen option, I like the Beef, Chicken or Pork varieties or Real Good Food Co enchiladas‚Äîor if I want something that actually does feel more convincingly like real food (lol): Healthy Choice Simply Steamers, Grilled Chicken &amp; Broccoli Alfredo. All are 190 cals w/ 20+ grams of protein, and they‚Äôre pretty enjoyable imho!  When I‚Äôm not as concerned about protein/macros in general for whatever reason, another frozen option is just kinda slapping some sort of low cal sauce on the Green Giant Veggie Spirals, Zucchini. It‚Äôs a big bag, ~4 servings per container‚Äîwhich I‚Äôve found to not be precisely accurate‚Äîbut this is one case where I truly don‚Äôt mind as much, haha, cuz each serving is 15 cals. Cuz it‚Äôs literally just spiralized zucchini. But it‚Äôs warm and filling and damn near effortless and *will* give you a nice little bit of potassium, I guess (plus some fiber and calcium, wahoo?).  When I truly don‚Äôt give a fuck but am still (barely) in Restrictive Mode and haven‚Äôt fully morphed into a ravenous fucking binge beast, I‚Äôll go for a small chili from Wendy‚Äôs. Or I used to anyway?? Tried this the other day and ended up desperately purging at the last possible minute because it Just Feels too much like a binge now apparently. :( But it‚Äôs fairly low cal actually! Looks like the current Wendy‚Äôs nutrition calculator lists it at 170, but that doesn‚Äôt quite make sense lmao. I log it as 270. üò¨  Also, if there‚Äôs a Jimmy John‚Äôs around you, they offer ‚Äúunwich‚Äù lettuce wraps as an option instead of bread on just about anything‚Äîand if you avoid the mayo (You Must Avoid The Mayo), most of the basic offerings are pretty low cal!! And huge! And surprisingly delicious.   Expensive as fuck tho. Which is funny cuz you can easily make the same thing at home (for the most part)‚Äîbut sometimes life gets in the way, and sometimes you just want the satisfaction of Getting Something Out, ya kno? They also have giant ass pickles if you‚Äôre into that, and the site has customizable nutrition info that generally seems more reliable.  I...I may or may not *also* know that an 8 count of Grilled Nuggets from Chik Fil A is 140 calories with 25g protein (not including any sauce though, and you‚Äôve got to pay attention to how much they put in the box b/c they‚Äôll often give you more!!). So you can get a decent feeling and looking meal there for ~215 cals by getting that with a small fruit cup as the side (45) and one Zesty Buffalo sauce for dipping (which is actually pretty tasty at 30 cals, haha, if you‚Äôre into some mild heat). Perhaps it‚Äôs also worth noting that an 8 count of regular nuggets there is 260 cals (definitely not the healthiest option but delicious as fuck).  Also, I swear the Egg White &amp; Red Pepper Sois Vide Egg Bites at Starbucks are 170 calories of decadent, cheesy tasting comfort. Higher in carbs and not as much protein as you would expect because there‚Äôs added rice starch or something to make it taste *that* unnaturally good, but still! They have repeatedly saved me from gorging myself on croissants.  I‚Äôve...only allowed myself to try this a couple times, but it has not been disappointing: A $1 shredded mini chicken quesadilla from Taco Bell is 200 cals of disgusting, amazing, hyper-palatable garbage. (Whyyy does it so disturbingly goood? Aaaah. So wrong, and yet so right...and the ‚Äúmini‚Äù here is highly questionable! Seems regular sized to me, if not big.)  FURTHERMORE, sofritas (tofu) and steak at Chipotle are both listed as 150 cal. Their cheese is 110, and so is their sour cream. So if you‚Äôre willing to accept that their measurements might be a little off (or to bring your food scale for relentlessly weighing out each component lol ha ha ha, Totally Sane Behavior ha ha :/), you can theoretically get a bowl with one of those as the main protein option, plus cheese or sour cream if ya want, no rice or beans (no queso or guac obviously), and just add lettuce (~5), fajita veggies (20), and tomatillo green chile (15) for a total of 300 cals! Or 200 cals without your choice of dairy, though it tends to look even less Normal that way (unless you‚Äôre vegan and doin the tofu thing, yeet!). Anyway. I always add an additional ~5  because I shamelessly smother that shit in hot sauce, haha. It‚Äôs awesome.  ALSO. If there‚Äôs one near ya, Blaze offers amazing ‚Äúbuild your own‚Äù salads that can easily be kept pretty low cal if you skip the dressing and stuff (with customizable nutrition info available on the website).  Grilled chicken drumsticks from KFC are 80 cals each.  A cheeseburger Happy Meal from McD‚Äôs with apple slices and water or Diet Coke is 380.   I‚Äôll see myself out.",False,False
