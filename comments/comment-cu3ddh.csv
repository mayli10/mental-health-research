A lot of my initial self-treatment for bingeing was from Geneen Roth's books that treated feelings as the underlying cause. I spent a lot of time identifying the feelings that led to bingeing (e.g., being tired is a big trigger for me, as is feeling anxious). I got good at identifying feelings but merely identifying the feeling wasn't enough to help me to stop bingeing. Even ""ok, this is how you're feeling so what is it you really need to feel better"" did not, for me, link to actual action to fixing how I was feeling. I think the key things for me from Brain Over Binge were (1) that it described bingeing as a HABIT that I could break and (2) that although we may feel a very strong compulsion to eat [whatever], it's not as if that food has some magnetic pull - we are in control. For me, bingeing had started to feel like this inevitable thing and it was actually kind of shocking (in a good way) to read that it's NOT. Somehow all of that put together - the feeling stuff from the Geneen Roth books and the ""food is not magnetic and neither are you"" and ""break the habit"" ideas from BoB has helped me get to a place where if I feel binge-ish I identify what I am feeling, remind myself food is not going to help (and is probably going to make me feel worse), know that the urge will go away if I distract myself somehow, think about what I need to do to feel better (usually involves sleep...) and how I can make that happen. (The other night it was ""just lay in bed with a book, you'll fall asleep in a few minutes"" - which I did). So last night was 2 weeks binge-free! I think I'm still feeling a little fragile, only half-believe bingeing is not inevitable - like in some ways I am definitely worried I'll binge again, but my brain keeps reminding me that I'm the one in control, it's not inevitable, just gotta keep using the coping strategies. That was long... hope it helps.",False,False
