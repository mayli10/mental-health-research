Super low calorie, you can chew on something, and if I'm not mistaken they have more potassium than a banana. I second the Pedialyte as well but I've been trying to eat more low cal foods instead of just supplements recently. Makes me feel a little more human.",False,False

Obv getting it from healthy foods is always better like other vitamins but it‚Äôs still WAY better than nothing if you‚Äôre struggling to get enough. Just don‚Äôt have too much all at once or bathroom trips won‚Äôt be fun. But you‚Äôd have to have like a full teaspoon at once to have that. More for if you go the ‚Äúketoaide‚Äù route and have it in a drink (lots of ppl on keto make a Powerade-like drink with NoSalt, mio, etc. to get all their electrolytes",False,False
