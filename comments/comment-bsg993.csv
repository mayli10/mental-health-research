A binge, in accordance with symptom descriptions for eating disorders involving binging, is an excessive amount (volume) of food, in a short period of time, accompanied by feelings of compulsion, obsession, dissociation or a sense of lack of control. ""Excessive"" typically should be measured against a non-disordered person's habits.  What was the volume/physical amount of what you ate? How did you feel when you ate it?  It sounds to me more like you habitually restrict your food intake and are uncomfortable with fullness or eating adequate meals. A 500 calorie meal with ordinary portions is something many people eat naturally three times per day. A 500 calorie eating session of you feeling like you can't stop putting olives/strawberries/shredded lettuce/low-fat yogurt into your mouth despite a strong desire of not wanting to is not.",False,False

But if while eating you felt out of control, like ""I dont even want to eat this but I cant stop"" that's still the mindset of a binge. I call them mini-binges because the calorie amount isnt enough to e destructive like a traditional binge, but the out of control-ness causes me A LOT of mental distress",False,False

No you shouldn't eat less today, you'll be fine.  I eat 800-1100 calories a day with one meal a day, so every day I feel like I binged because I'm full as hell after my meal but actually I didn't because I respected my calorie limit and moreover after eating I don't feel like actually binging.  You're doing great, don't panic. ❤️",False,False
