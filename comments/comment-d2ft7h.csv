I forgot to mention this too, but the author used to struggle with an eating disorder and talks a lot about her journey of learning to accept her body. It's a good read!",False,False

Whole Foods is a very weird place, a place full of people who eat salad and quinoa all week and then do coke on the weekends, a place where one goes to Be Seen as much as one goes for the privilege of paying $8 for pasta, a place that often amounts to one long parade of insecurity and self-conscious cultural signaling.  Bottom line, you're not alone when you're in that store. Don't look at those girls as your betters, look at them as fellow travelers in this weird world. Some of them have cried at WF, too. Hell, I've cried at WF.   You're always good enough, and I'm sure you're more beautiful than your brain wants you to believe. You sound hella interesting, too, just from what you've written here!",False,False

I really connect with the first quote you mentioned, about self-care. It can be so difficult sometimes to perform acts of self-love, exactly because they make me feel selfish and self-absorbed. Taking time just for yourself seems like it would be a natural, easy thing to do, but especially for people with disorders, it feels so much harder than it looks on the surface.",False,True

It's called The Self-Love Experiment by Shannon Kaiser, and I got a lot of great advice out of it, mainly the first 50 pages or so.  Some bits I found interesting and wrote down:  ""The word self-love feels funny for the majority of people. Self-love feels selfish. We are trained not to love ourselves. But we owe it to ourselves to take care of ourselves. I discovered that the word self-love felt uncomfortable, so I focused on self-care.""  ""Self care has nothing to do with what you do but with why you do it.""   ""I spent years blaming my childhood bullies for making me insecure. I used to shrug and say ""oh well, this is my story,"" but I was the biggest bully of all. My internal rage was keeping me from everything I wanted.""   ""Ask yourself what each trouble has to teach you- don't cop out on the hard things in life. Lean into it, let it be hard. What you are going through right now is not forever.""",False,False
