Get off the road you've been lost on, use an exit, turn around and restart your journey in a better direction.   You CAN do this.   The worst thing you can do is feel guilty about the past. I know it's hard to forget, but your brain will thank you if you pretend this relapse never happened.   We all know extremes are bad. Particularly, around the holidays. So, don't be too drastic or you may head in the wrong direction again. ♥️",False,False

I was a size &gt;!2!&lt; for so long. When I moved in with my ex-financé and started cooking all the time, I rapidly put on weigh. I’d been a “small person” my whole life and told myself I’d never let myself wear a size &gt;!4!&lt;. Shortly those became too tight and I was “overweight” for the first time in my life. I refused to buy a bigger pants size.",False,False
