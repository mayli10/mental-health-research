Full disclosure, I didn’t make this up, but I did modify it. I’ll give the link for the original when I find it! I mostly modified the technique because mine was overdone the first time, and she used too much sugar and not enough salt. I also didn’t use all the water but the weather messes with stuff like that.  Anyway:   1) Okay so I start by mixing in 1 cup of the water, yeast, and sugar in a bowl first. Your water needs to be 100-110 F, mine is usually 105, and filtered water seems to work better. Let that sit until it foams up. If it doesn’t foam within 10 minutes start over bc the yeast isn’t active.    2) So once it’s foamed add your salt, flour and rest of the water but really slowly! You’ll use all the water but probably not all the flour. Stop mixing and turn it out on a floured surface when the dough starts to pull away from the sides.  3) Knead it until it forms a soft dough, don’t let it get tough! It’ll look really small but that’s normal. Form it into a ball, and flour both sides.  4) Flour a bowl and let it prove in a warm area until it’s doubled. While it’s proving, preheat the oven to 460 F.   5) OKAY THIS IS IMPORTANT, do not punch the dough down when because this is a French bread so it’s supposed to be light and airy. You need the air bubbles!    6) Put the dough gently into a dutch oven (or just on a cookie sheet lol) and bake for like 30 minutes.   **For dutch oven:** Keep it covered and then bake for an additional 10-15 minutes with the lid off. Use your own judgment here, mine was done without the 10.  **For baking sheet:** Same but use parchment paper to cover, and you’ll probably not cook it as long.   7) You’re done enjoy! ",False,False
