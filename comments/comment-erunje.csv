I want children so badly, but I honestly don't know if I'll ever be able to handle the mental toll of pregnancy. Seeing my body get bigger just seems so scary and unbearable, and them I'm also terrified of my future child developing their own ED because of me.",False,False

I imagine it must be double hard if you do want them tho :(",False,False

I think I could MAYBE handle pregnancy weight but I don't think I could raise a child without imparting skewed views about food and health. That makes me so sad because I want kids with my partner but I don't think I'd be a good mom,False,False

I’m fucking terrified to have kids, like I can’t even take care of myself, I wouldn’t want to risk that for a baby. I already hate when I bloat so I can’t imagine what being pregnant would do. I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll adopt if the time comes but I just don’t think I’ll be able to be in the right headspace and see myself gain weight in that way :(",False,False

I am also terrified of losing control of my body and I think I’m just better off having pets.,False,False

A baby will make your belly grow bigger. And if you calorie restrict while pregnant it will be very bad for the baby. There is hope that you can recover and be in a healthy place to have a child. You have plenty of time.,False,False

There can be so many complications and miscarriages are very common for underweight women. Maybe that will be motivation to recover! Your body has to be healthy if it's going to provide for two. It's the harsh truth.",False,False
