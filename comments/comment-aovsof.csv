Right now I have been eating a normal amount of healthy food every day for about a week or two now and it started with a moment like this. Just getting a few days like this in a row makes my body feel good (cause it actually has energy lol), they're normally the easiest but for some reason I am maintaining it past the first few days.  Who knows when I'll just binge and restrict again but a moment like this is actually a good starting point for the possibility of at least a small period of good eating habits!!",False,False

I hit close to my highest last April after a terrible year of binging, have been losing since then but occasionally falling into binge/fast cycles causing me to regain. If I had considered a regular diet with 500 cal deficit I would've thought hell no, it's gonna take wayyyy too long that way, can get there faster by eating less. But truth is it's now almost a year, I'd be at goal by now and I'm not. ",False,False

I’m in such a restrict/ binge cycle where I’ll restrict for a week or so and then binge not even too bad but enough to ruin most of my progress and I’m constantly frustrated that this dumb ass Ed isn’t even worth it cause I could just eat at a proper deficit and not hate myself all the time and actually start seeing progress again ??? but nope that’s obviously not an option  and I’ll just keep plateauing or very slowly losing tryna get rid of this last 10 pounds that I don’t even actually need to lose! ,False,False
