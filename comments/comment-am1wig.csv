I literally avoid the gym in January, which is something I don't like to do all other 11 months.  And I agree! The only issue is to lose 8 pounds, we need a 1000 Calorie deficit everyday, and idk if I can do that. :/",False,False

Mostly because I hate to be a resolution-er in January since it feels so disingenuous. Something about this short little month with its four perfect little weeks makes me believe I can do what needs to be done and get things in order!   I'm right there with you on the 8 pounds plan. I want to be solidly in the 120s so badly, &amp; have for so long, but my sturdy little teapot of a body wants to be exactly 133 every day of my life. :(   Let's make this the month we meet those goals! We can do anything for four perfect little short weeks, right? ðŸ’œ",False,False

Hopefully February will be kinder to me and I can drop like 8 pounds :-) but it's a short month so :-))),False,False
