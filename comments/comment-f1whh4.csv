I am always just in a kind of half recovery though so I don’t care much if I lose weight, the only dark hole for me is if I start purging again.   Living with constant stomach problems makes it so embarrassing to go anywhere.",False,True

It's actually what caused the initial weight loss that triggered the eventual conscious starvation. My anxiety is very physical and stomach problems are a main part of that. After some stressful life events, I was experiencing almost constant nausea and extra stomach upset whenever I tried to eat. I threw away a lot of food at that point in time.  What helped was lots of Tums and eating bland, easy to digest foods. Non-dairy smoothies, soup (I ate so much soup!), non-dairy protein shakes everyday (I liked the chocolate muscle milk). Tea (and less coffee). You may have to take some time to find what is easy on your stomach, but don't give up! Helpful advice from my therapist: don't stress about not being able to finish something. Eat what you can, wait a bit and try again. You'll eventually get enough down to provide adequate nutrition.   Minimizing dairy, sugar, and carbonation and always drinking lots of water helped too. If I did have dairy or sugar, eating something more digestable at the same time helped, like having crackers at the same time as yogurt. Also, it doesn't personally work for me, but try peppermint anything or dramamine, both of which can help with nausea.  I hope some of this might help!",False,False

It was really bad about a year an a half ago which caused me to get very underweight and I just started dealing with it again this past few weeks. It makes it nearly impossible for me to try to stay in recovery and stay at a healthy weight. Even when I force myself to eat I get diarrhea:/ I honestly don’t know what to do for it. I wish I had some guidance for you.,False,False
