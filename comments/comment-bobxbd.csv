If you haven't had anything in your digestive system for a while then it can really jump up after a big meal, but it's literally just the weight of the once-was-food and it will soon pass. :)",False,False

No one would EVER see that probably not even with no clothes on.   Tbh Mexican food from restaurants also usually is salty so the fact that you only gained 3 lbs of water weight means that it’s very little legit weight and you probably are overestimating your intake. (If you don’t eat a lot you’ll get nauseous on smaller amounts often) I’m so glad that I helped ❤️ and know it’ll get better.,False,False

It took me up 8lb overnight. It was completely gone for me in 3 full days average eating and lots of hydration to convince my body to let go of the water.,False,False

I'm breathing a little easier now, I think. My stomach was sooooo sore and full. I really, really hated myself last night (and when I saw the scale today). I'm hoping so much that tomorrow will be better. All day today I walked around thinking that everyone was talking about how fat I was and how much I'd gained. I hate what this does to my mind...",False,True

It helps your brain and bodily function to have a higher calorie day (and often ppl with EDs wayyyyy overestimate their intake and it’s normal or even low to other people) and it’s actually good for you and helps you have energy not binge etc. I know it’s so hard but there’s no way it’ll impact your weight at ALL long term ❤️,False,False

That’s like twice as much as Amberlynn Reid eats on binge days so I highly doubt it. I promise you it’ll go down very soon and may even trigger a loss of water weight ❤️,False,False
