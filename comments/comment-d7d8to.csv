They have nights where they have like 10 random comics do short sets. (Though since it‚Äôs a famous club sometimes you will see famous people trying out new stuff which is cool.)  its actually really fun because even if someone is bombing, you know the next act will be up quickly.   However it is THE WORST when someone is bombing and tries to get laughs by calling out people‚Äôs physical appearance. Hey look at that guy! He‚Äôs fat!‚Äù followed by fat jokes. Or ‚ÄúThat woman‚Äôs really tall!‚Äù followed by tall jokes. Or ‚ÄúThat guy is ginger‚Äù etc. It‚Äôs just so uncomfortable when someone is making unfunny jokes about everyone.",False,False

The reason she got annoyed was because he got a little aggressive with the jokes. I apologise since my title definitely makes it seem like she overreacted!  This particular comedian was an opening act and wasn‚Äôt getting much of a reaction from the audience.   So the gist of the initial joke is: he came over to our table and went ‚Äòoh there‚Äôs someone there! I was looking at her sideways and it looked like a floating burger‚Äô or something. Which actually made the audience (me included) laugh a little, but because it was one of the only successful jokes, he pretty much stayed by our table his entire set to make jokes like, ‚Äòhey waiter, more burgers for this table! God knows she needs it‚Äô, ‚Äòlook she‚Äôs picking up the fries but I can‚Äôt tell where the fries end and her arms start‚Äô, ‚Äòc‚Äômon dad, give her back her carrot, is that what happens at home?‚Äô etc etc.   It was just a little uncomfortable because he was singling me out and no one was really laughing at that point. I wasn‚Äôt too angry but my family was definitely a little uncomfortable &amp; my sister is more outspoken about things like this.    It was more a charity show than a proper stand up show!
