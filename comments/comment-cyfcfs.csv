Remember, you can have an eating disorder at any size, and at any point in your life. You can't ""fail"" at anxiety.   I still get weirded out when I say ""I have anorexia"" because I am not the typical AN person, but it is true, and knowing it is true was one of my first steps in accepting I needed help.   Hugs to you.",False,False

You have issues with food/image, that's okay. Don't worry about the words, you have what you have. Not being able to say the words with conviction in your heart doesn't make it any less true, and it certainly does you no favours worrying about it, accepting it, or fixing it.",False,False
