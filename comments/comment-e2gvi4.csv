Unfortunately, it's neither snowy nor sunny where i live, just cloudy and rainy. I don't have a hat, but i have a pair of wrist warmers (basically leg warmers but for your forearms) that I'll have to get into the habit of using. I'll have to look into carrying a hot drink with me, which is a good idea for days where i have long breaks between classes. Neither food nor drinks are allowed in class, so I'll have to make do with other means of warmth during those trying times :).  Thanks for the tips, and have a lovely day!",False,True

Do you have a good hat or beanie? I would die without something covering my head... Also, carry a hot thermos of tea or coffee or broth at all times. I hope any of that is helpful. Sending you the warmth of the sun today.",False,False
