Maybe speak with your doctor, mention you're losing weight healthily but you've been feeling some old ED thoughts sneaking back up. It could help hold you accountable to stay healthy if someone irl knows. And remember that getting to an unhealthy weight cannot be done healthily- so if you get underweight by ""healthy"" restriction you have most likely unknowingly relapsed. Hope that helps, I'm proud of you. Instead of falling back into restriction, try to think of it as ""I'll show them that I have been losing weight, and that I am still losing it- and i' keep it off because I'm doing it the right way!"" Again, I'm proud of you.",False,False
