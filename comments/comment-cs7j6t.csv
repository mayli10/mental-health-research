I used to be a teaching assistant in a history class and when the students complained about being “so busy” that they had to do work during lunch (because they didn’t do their fucking homework the night before), one girl told the teacher she was “encouraging anorexia.”",False,False

Once it’s quite visibly a serious problem, people are scared to comment- not because they don’t care but because they are scared of triggering you and because they realise that the problem is bigger than they can fix with well-meant comments.",False,False

I'd say 99% of comments made about appearance have the potential to be super hurtful to someone. I'm sorry if you've ever had to deal with such a thing.   My brain just loves to use comments like that to make me believe I'm somehow not sick enough.",False,True

If a friend is a full-blown, out of control meth addict, you may just come to a point where it becomes so serious you can't even bring yourself to mention it or discuss it and instead leave them alone. At a certain point you cross the line between ""too skinny"" and ""so skinny that there's no way no one is even going to be comfortable enough to talk to you about this"". It stops becoming something you can comfortably mention.",False,False
