I fantasize about chocolate.  I am ASHAMED to admit that the thought of giving it up makes me want to cry endlessly.  I keep thinking, why should I have to give up something I love and everyone else can keep having it?!  Did you ever go through a phase like that?  I think it's clear I'm addicted to it but I don't want to stop eating it... But I can't control myself, I always binge it :(",False,False

I substitute it with 0% Greek yogurt, vegetables, a carrot or two, and mostly tea.  That sugar cookie tea or chai tea is the best.
