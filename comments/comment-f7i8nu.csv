You two sound like such a sweet and adorable couple. I'm really glad you have him. That's so awesome that you feel like you could be more of yourself around him. You deserve to have that with someone and yeah the fact that it's both of your first relationships, the making out and everything is most likely just due to being excited and discovering new things with someone.   I really like how he has asked about your eating and speculated but has never forced any of the information out of you. That's such a gentlemen thing to do and you will tell him in your own time when you're ready so don't worry about that part much. For now I would just try to care of yourself and enjoy your relationship. I wish you and him a happy future together! :)",False,False

He knows my strange non-ED food habits like eating sauce with a spoon and putting ketchup on anything and nibbling on raw bread dough. He cringes but loves me nevertheless.  I think it’s worth mentioning that it’s our first time in a relationship for the both of us and we’re also both autistic, so i’m thinking it’s sort of that manic “everything is amazing” phase at the beginning of a relationship (Only been together for a couple months, but started to know each  other better for maybe 5-6 months. It’s a long, isolated story) that I unfortunately can’t feel due to some unrelated past experiences. I don’t think he’s bad or exploitive, I think we just have to learn over time, so I could try to talk to him a little about it, but not right now just because I don’t feel ready yet.   Good news is I know for sure we won’t go any further than making out without making sure I’m okay with it, dude puts his hand on my upper leg and asks twice if i’m okay with it. Chance is he probably is just a shit kisser and ruined it for me and I don’t have the gut to tell him that.  But nevertheless thank you for the kind words. At least they’re dieting healthily and not starving.",False,True

That sounds as though it feels isolating like you have to put up a wall between the truth of yourself and what they captivate to be what's going on with you. This situation doesn't sound good for your mind and from your words I perceive it to be negatively impacting you. It's rough going through what you are and having to try to maintain balance with everyone in your life especially when you feel limitations towards being able to share what you're experiencing.  I'm glad your boyfriend has been supporting you in the way he knows how to. I've been in a relationship during my eating disorder and I get that feeling you had that ""you can't speak your feelings to him without making out first."" In relationships sometimes you feel this pressure to offer something as their partner and have their needs be met before you can ask for something in return even something as minor as them listening to you. We shouldn't have this perspective of dating as being such a one way street - in the way that I'll give you this and then I deserve to be heard or adequate too. You and him should be a team, there is a time for each of your needs and you don't always have to do what he desires first. Your feelings are just as important and if he truly cares he would agree with this. I agree about the cut-and- paste reassurance, whenever you let things out it should be considered an important discussion and not time to focus on making out or anything beyond yourself.   If you're boyfriend is the right person for you, then I genuinely believe it is ok to be upfront and honest about everything and vent. I don't know how much you have shared with him but just know if he makes you feel any less for what you are dealing with or he isn't loyal to you after you open up then he doesn't deserve you. Being real like that with someone can bring out their true colors and character that maybe you couldn't see before. Plus if he is just with you for sex appeal (not making this accusation) then any guy like that can take a hike because you are worth more than someone liking you just for your body and physical intimacy. From the sounds of it, I take your boyfriend as being very respectful towards you by not overstepping your boundaries and him being supportive. So I am hoping my intuition about him is right and he ends up being an absolute sweetheart and major supporter of yours. Not always but sometimes a lover can influence past behaviors with eating and I get the concern you are having with that. I recommend that you try to stay aware of yourself and if you do have a binge episode either from confessing things or getting support from him or just a binge in general, maybe write down what you were feeling or what may have been a factor or cause for that taking place. It might give you a deeper understanding of why you go through it and ways to possibly do better next time you are faced with that situation.   Professional help is always an option too like therapy or support groups even so the help isn't as direct if you feel uneasy about reaching out to a professional. These are just things to possibly consider and maybe you have tried these options. Now about your family, I can relate very much! I know that struggle where they just don't at all understand your mental health no matter what you say or do and they totally twist your reality and misunderstand what is happening and how eating disorders are. You can be any weight and have an eating disorder despite them not believing so. Maybe you need to get them to hear an outside perspective, this ties back in again with a mental health professional. If you could get an eating disorder specialist to talk to your parents and educate them on both your issue and eating disorders entirely then maybe just MAYBE they might not be as set in their ways. You could mention privately with the professional about them seeing you as a weight influencer which creates a toxic environment for you and they could also try to also explain to your parents why this is bad for you when they do this and help you to persuade them not to act like this. Some parents are just old school and don't believe what is outside of their own views despite anything you do. I unfortunately have these kind of parents only when it comes to my mental health though. It truly sucks cause you need this support especially from those who are closest to you and you feel like you have no one to confide in on your worst days.   I'm terribly sorry that your parents were screaming at you in the past and calling you ""selfish"" and saying you're ""faking for attention."" Just please know NONE of that is true! My parents have said the same towards me and later admitted it all came from anger and intense feelings even if your parents never admit that to you I'm sure that's the case. Both of our parents obviously don't understand or else they wouldn't say those things. It doesn't make their actions justifiable but your struggle is not something you choose and it doesn't define you as a person or mean that you're selfish. I urge you to not lose any weight to meet your parents ""definition"" of an eating disorder. That will also be a journey that only takes you downhill with both them and yourself. I know from experience, they finally see that you are unwell and their comments/behaviors just escalate! It makes your quality of life terrible getting constant mistreatment when you are in an apparently troubling situation to begin with. Losing weight doesn't make anything better both health wise and parent wise, it makes it so much worse than you could have ever even anticipated. Please try to focus on your health and don't let your eating disorder or other peoples misunderstandings of your situation win. I know this was long but I feel your hardship and I hope that I helped you in any way. You are definitely not alone and I hope things get better for you! Stay strong :)",False,False
