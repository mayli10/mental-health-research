Companies do a bait and switch constantly on products to tack onto whatever fad diet trend is going on. 100 cal packs came during the height of weight watchers.  This is all examples, not actual numbers, but it goes like this.  Normal Oreo cookie weights .3 ounces, but contains 120 calories per cookie. Oreo cookie snack pack cookie weights .1 ounce, but contains 50 calories. Because they decided to dust the top with more sugar.  So now you have the real original product actually being healthier for you, then the low cal option.  Now the reason these products semi work, is portion control. Weight loss is nothing more then calories in calories out. Everything else (skin, mental health, fatigue, hair, etc) is related to WHAT you eat. You can eat 5000 calories of fruit a day and you WILL gain weight just like how only eating 500 calories of cookies a day and nothing else, will cause you to lose weight.",False,False

They already do that - with marketing. So why not do both?  That's why I hate how companies have jumped on the ""LETS BE TRANSPARENT AND SUPPORT WELLNESS"" bandwagon, mostly by putting calories on the front of the package, so they are easy to find. They take advantage of people who don't think to check the serving sizes on packages, and trust the FDA/etc., to have our best interests in mind when it comes to advertising and regulation of this shit.  So misinformed people can grab a bag, assume that 2000 calorie bag of skittles is just 300 calories (because one serving is 1/4th of the tiny ass bag), eat the whole thing, then wonder why they are still hungry for more (because ya' know, candy isn't filling or anything but people can still treat themselves). Then later? Wonder why they just added a small snack into their day, only to find themselves gaining a lot of weight.   Like Pam? is 0 calories for 1/4th a second of a spray. Lets see how many people know that, or are able to accurately measure one fourth a spray of pam. &gt;.&lt;",False,False
