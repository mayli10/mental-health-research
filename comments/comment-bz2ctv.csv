For me, fasting is purely water and occasionally salts. I won’t even allow carbonated water.  But I’m very strict. I know many in the fasting community supports having coffee and tea.",False,False

So I end up drinking a lot of green tea and diet coke, and chewing lots of gum usually, but since I still wake up a lot lighter the next morning i dont really see a need to change my ways.",False,False

Some people will do juice fasts, I'm personally fine with cream in my coffee for fasts, but no sugar.

If you're drinking coffee/tea black, the theoretical caloric content is so incredibly negligible that it's legally considered ""0 calorie"" in the U.S. That's not ""breaking a fast"" by any realistic standard.

If fasting is considered not eating solid foods and staying in a state of ketosis, tea and coffee won't do shit.  I guess it depends how you feel about it. For me, it's still fasting till you actually swallow and keep down everything eaten (lol that's what I tell myself so that when I purge I'm still fasted.
