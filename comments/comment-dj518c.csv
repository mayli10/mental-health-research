I think the descriptions are more how i view myself than how i operate. Because all of these symptoms don't affect my day-to-day functioning/I don't let it-- compared to someone with OCD, they literally can't help their compulsions-- they exist, etc. Most importantly, I'm not a shut-in-- and growing up as a teenager, I've learned things like not to reject people in fear of them potentially rejecting me first, the importance of socialization and being around people for my well-being, etc., and i actively try/make an effort not to be 100% avoidant as I could be (basically i just try to be pleasant and approachable rather than completely cold/withdrawn and unwelcoming, I've never really initiated interactions). Also I don't really have social anxiety. I just suck at socializing. Most people probably just see me as extremely quiet and don't think much of me except wonder what my deal is. I hold conversations whenever another person initiates it, which I think a lot of people find surprising (to see me talk normally). My brother and I are very similar and a lot of people think he's autistic because he's so quiet and avoids eye contact (I'm pretty good with eye contact because i recognize it's importance and it's something I've always actively kept up). We both are very slow to react to things too (e.g. if someone smiles at me in passing, 75% of the time I'm too unprepared to reciprocate, and the other 25% is a white person smile). I'd say i have an advantage over my brother as a female because expressing emotions is more expected from women, so i have a better time/more opportunity to express myself, and because i don't have to worry about the stigma associated with my withdrawn personality (autism) because it's not as prevalent in women. People still mostly leave me alone though so idk what people think of me",False,False

The personality disorder criteria sound very relatable to a lot of people but please consider talking to a medical doctor or psychiatrist, etc about it because a lot of people self diagnose with PDs and I‚Äôm not going to be that person who‚Äôs like ‚Äúit makes it harder for people who ACTUALLY have diagnoses‚Äù but I am going to say that it might cause you to struggle down the line.  Maybe this is because I was a young teenager, but I made an identity out of it and it really limited me from personal growth and recovery (and leaving my abuser).",False,False
