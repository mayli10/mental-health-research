That shit scared the hell out of me and as much as fear may not always be the best motivation, it worked for me. And I knew that the worst came to worse, I'd never have children but I was committed to try and reverse the process, I knew I could do it. Apart from infertility, which may not bother some, there's the issue of osteoporosis, which you get when you're not menstruating and your hormones are out of whack. You are strong as fuck. Set your mind on recovery but because that's a relatively vague goal - pick something more tangible. For me it was getting my period back. I'm sure you'll find something for yourself. And remember that you are fucking stronger than that disease and you deserve better, queen!",False,False
