I've always gone for whichever is fewest calories for price but I'm sure there are other factors I'm missing out on,False,True

(this is something that 100% happens with other issues in kpop, as conspiracy theory-y as it sounds. i know people who have been messaged by big accounts and asked to delete stuff, and some things have been pretty effectively wiped from the internet by fans after i initially saw it. it's wild.) but sounds SO unrealistic so i don't entertain the thought too much.",False,False
