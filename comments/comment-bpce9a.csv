Food and exercise shouldn‚Äôt be causing you so much anxiety. I think of disordered eating as a spectrum, just because you might not fit symptoms of a categorised disorder doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre not struggling with something. It took me ages to accept I had a problem. Hopefully accepting that will be the first step to getting better, good luck talking to your therapist. I‚Äôve found that discussing my issues around my weight and with food has helped me work out where all the problems stem from, which has helped me when I‚Äôm trying to rationalise thoughts about eating etc. Xx",False,False

As for your question, yes, you should see someone about this. I would recommend a specialist eating disorder therapist over a psychiatrist though, as they‚Äôre much more aware and realize that EDs occur at any weight/size. If your thoughts about food are taking over your life and affecting your day-to-day, you have a problem with food and ED specialists recognize that.",False,False

Well , I'm sorta recovered except not really, it's difficult to explain. What you have expressed here is likely an ED (an ED is more than just not eating or purging). please take my word for it: you should do something before the ED becomes the only purpose of your life. Hoping you're not at that point yet but you do sound like you're getting there. Take care and I wish you the best. Ask for the help you need and deserve.",False,False
