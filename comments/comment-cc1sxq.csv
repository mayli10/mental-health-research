His decisions are not your fault. He did this, not you. IT'S NOT YOU.   I was in love 4 times, 4 different men. They all cheated and lied about it. I thought it was me, that I was inherently unloveable, destined to always be less than. It was not me. It was those lying cheating motherfuckers I was dating. I thought all men were cheaters, and I stopped dating and only did casual hookups.  Then I went home with a guy from work for what was supposed to be meaningless sex. We're married now. Over 8 years we've been together and I can confidently say he's never even tried to cheat. I know because he doesn't hide anything from me.   &amp;#x200B;  They aren't all cheating bastards.  You do deserve better, and I'm sure you'll find it. Be kind to yourself tonight, please, for this random stranger on the Internet that cares.",False,False

Please please do not punish yourself for somebody else's shitty actions. It's times like these where you need to care for and support yourself the most! Don't let *his* lack of consideration, empathy and integrity reflect on you. There is nothing wrong with you. You did nothing wrong, you don't deserve self harm!! This says a lot about him and NOTHING about you no matter how hard it is for you to believe that. You're the one walking away from this pure of heart and with your integrity in tact. He is not deserving of you.  You deserve more than somebody who has the audacity to not only cheat on you but to tell you directly that they essentially value your emotional well being less than they value ""porn"". Ugh.   I know you're hurting so badly right now but please look after yourself :( xx",False,False
