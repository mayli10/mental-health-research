Time may vary based on your microwave wattage, but it usually takes 1 minute and 45 seconds in mine.   It's not great plain, but it's decent when topped with stuff. I like to spritz it with I Can't Believe It's Not Butter spray and sprinkle it with cinnamon/erythritol to make it",False,False

It's amazing. I make microwave mug bread out of it.   If not, psyllium husk is excellent too. You can find that in capsule form in pretty much all big grocery stores by the fiber/laxatives, though it is a little pricier (but worth it!).  Drink plenty of water, and maybe eat a bag of fresh spinach.",False,False

When I'm really constipated and I want to avoid jumping into laxatives (I have a history of abusing them), my go to is high fibre fruits and vegetables to get my system moving. Oranges and kale are always what work bedt for me, but different high fibre fruits and vegetables may work better for you. If that doesn't work, I'll drink some metamucil. And if THAT doesn't work, then I'll either drink senna tea or take a senna tablet.  But it's also important to be patient and wait at least a couple if hours before deciding that something isn't working. The last thing you want to do is decide that something isn't working after only a few minutes and then say fuck it and just take everything at once. IT WILL NOT BE PRETTY. Trust me. I've done it and I was in toilet hell for hours with nobody to blame but myself.",False,False
