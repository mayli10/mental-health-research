Be kind to yourself; there’s nothing shameful or greedy about wanting to allow yourself love and kindness, and all the weight loss in the world doesn’t feel as good as being able to achieve peace with your body as it is- a pretty cool machine which works damn hard to keep the beautiful you working as well as possible!",False,False

Just remember that when you eat more one day it isn’t wrong and it’s the right thing to do. I constantly need to be reminded of this because when I allow myself to eat what I want to and be over maintenance calories I feel like I’m out of control and being greedy. I’m just so worried when I get to a healthy weight I won’t be able to maintain and I’ll end up overweight. I just want to be healthy, happy and confident in my own skin. Good luck and stay well, recovery is so hard&lt;3",False,True

I've gotten to a point in recovery where i can easily eat 1800 a day and gain a bit without guilt but i still want to be skinny. I don't want to be fat. My dietician wants to get me to at least 50kgs but i'm terrified of hitting that. I hate what my ED has done and i hated living with it but something in me wants it back. I can't give in though since it doesn't want the best for me and i want to be healthy again. We're in this together, one step at a time.",False,False
