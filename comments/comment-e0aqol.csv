Now I'm in dental school so I go to major lengths to keep my hands and nails looking as tidy and pristine as possible - it's part of good hygiene and professionalism.    If it is very severe you can see a psych who can treat behavioural disorders (basically Cognitive Behavioural Therapy) because this kind of deeply ingrained behaviour/mental association is often difficult to resolve on your own.,False,False
