Somewhere along the line wires got crossed and things are seen as something far different from what they are. I don't know if this helps, but I've felt a lot like I'm crazy and the only person who does these weird things. You're not crazy, and you're not alone. None of this makes sense, but taking it moment by moment and day by day is the only way to go.   This is getting long-winded, and I don't know you, but I hope you get better. This distorted view is truly hell and I don't want anyone to experience these things. I wish you the best and hope that along the line you can escape this into a peaceful recovery.",False,False
