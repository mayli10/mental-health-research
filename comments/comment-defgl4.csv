Everything was seemed fine with me joint-wise until I woke up recently completely unable to walk with no prior issues. The joints in my foot had completely flared up and swelled I thought it was broken until I got X-rays and my doctor diagnosed me. In two weeks I can now feel it in my shoulders and hands too. It came out of nowhere and was a huge wake up call. It can happen at any time and is usually genetic (but also with ED’s we put our bodies through a lot of stress). It could be a build up of uric acid in your joints from high sodium diets as well (diet soda, meat replacements etc). It never hurts to get it looked at- personally I’d rather know than not know. Sending you the best of luck ❤️❤️",False,True

I started getting knee and elbow pain &amp; swelling about two years ago and it's slowly been getting worse. Idk if it's arthritis or not as I haven't been able to ask a doc. My parents don't believe it is since it didn't pop up until I was 15 and most everything about juvenile arthritis points towards kids wayyyy younger.,False,False

It’s a very out of control feeling when your body just... doesn’t. And then when it does, it bitches about it the whole time.   You’ve got a perfect attitude about it!!! Hell ya, it won’t bring you down because it can’t bring you down!!!  Until it makes your knees give out and then you’re goin down a lil bit literally.",False,False

I feel like shit all the time and hardly ever have an appetite. All I do is pop my painkillers and sleep these days.

I’ve got it partnered with MS, we should start a club of shit body folk where instead of snacks at meetings we serve pain killers and muscle relaxers   ❤️ remember you’re not alone and we’re more than dumb bodies.
