Caffeine pills are the best substitute. Energy drinks are okay but have generally less caffeine than a cup of coffee. However, that zero-cal Monster has definitely saved me in a pinch.   If you’re going to be anywhere near a coffee shop, espresso shots by themselves work amazingly.   I usually have a combination of 3-4 cups of black coffee plus additional tea, Diet Coke, and the odd energy drink to get me through a day/night.",False,False
