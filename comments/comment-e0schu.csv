They're really easy to drink and have ~40 cal/bottle. They're low in sodium but have a pretty good amount of potassium. Magnesium and calcium are the other two you may need to look out for, maybe consider adding multivitamin? They're usually pretty high in both of those. I hope this helped!",False,False
