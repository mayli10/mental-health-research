Honestly i would be proud if i survived 50 degree heat with no air con. Thats a one hell of an achievement.,False,False

The worst part is that locals get some sort if sick pleasure from being able to say they survived a heatwave without air con. At home it's sitting around 40°C. Not cool, but at least it's not 50. It's supposed to drop to the early 30's next week, but no rain.",False,False

I would only expect those temperatures to be coming from the outback. I only guessed barossa valley because it is known for being in satans oven.   It's suppose to rain on tuesday where i am so hopefully it'll cool down a bit (if you haven't picked it up already im also in australia). Stay cool and remember to wear sunscreen. Don't get burnt so that you're red as a strawberry.,False,False

It was getting towards 50°C (122°F) and had no air con. Rug up, drink hot drinks/eat hot food, stay inside when possible and if you know anyone with heat, visit them often. Stay safe.",False,False
