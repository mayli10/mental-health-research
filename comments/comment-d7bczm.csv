I did keto for about 4 1/2 months and while I did lose 45lbs in those 4 months, it caused my ED to go into overdrive. I started fasting 4 days out of the week. (2 in the beginning, 2 at the end, not 4 in a row)   I allow myself anywhere between 50-70 net carbs a day. I have a healthy breakfast of either oatmeal topped with a bit of yogurt, fruit, chia seeds, and a small amount of nuts (almonds or pecans). Or yogurt topped with fruit, chia seeds, granola, (I make my own with 10g whole grain quick oats and 10g almonds. Toast in a dry pan then stir in 1/2tsp sugar free maple syrup) and a little extra drizzle (another 1/2tsp) of sf maple on top.   Dinner is usually a protein and a large portion of stir fried veggies.   I have lost 7lbs doing low carb for about a month.   You don't have to justify yourself to anyone. It doesn't make you a failure for deciding one diet isn't for you.",False,False
