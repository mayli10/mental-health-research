This looks like morbid obesity. Their BMI is just extreme as someone who is severely underweight. Yet if we had a group of people whose BMIs is 15 or under we would all freak out and call them anorexics, harass them to eat etc. Versus here, people would call them ""chubby and beautiful"" or ""thicc"" which downplays a severe condition. I just hate how people treat these situations. So many double standards and people trying to accept other peoples bodies to the extent of   trivializing a horrible medical condition  that reduces lifespan and causes a ton of other problems.
