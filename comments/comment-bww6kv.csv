You framed it really well, and it's really helping me to see that EDs are so complex (even more so than I thought).

It's more like they oversimplified it in the first place. Now that they have had the time to get  to know you better, instead of a generalized diagnosis, they figured out you are much more complex than they first realized. You are not an imposter, you have an illness and sometimes it takes time to get the right diagnosis, like any other disease out there. You are not the eating disorder, you have an eating disorder.  I'm sending internet mom hugs.",False,False

The first time I went to treatment, they told me I was bulimic. I was so embarrassed and ashamed. My second time around, I was diagnosed with anorexia, but â€˜atypicalâ€™.   Iâ€™ve only gained weight since then and Iâ€™m fucking depressed about it.   TL;DR: I feel this on a spiritual level. Keep your chin up.",False,False
