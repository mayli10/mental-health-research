And they only want it until they've lost those 20lbs. haha",False,False

It’s like.. in one way I want to recover because this shit is fucking terrible. But in another way I’m like “I like being anorexic teehee” even tho my mental health is shiiit when I’ve relapsed. It’s just so odd and so sick that I want to relapse. Was it fun eating 600 cals a day and almost fainting each time you stood up or walked? Fuck no. But I’m in a binge phase rn so..... fuck it.,False,False

Ha. Who would want that? Ha....    I miss when my Disorder was bad.. I hated the anxiety and meltdowns... but I was skinny. That’s all I cared about. I could resist food and restrict so well. Heck forcing myself to eat 300cal was difficult most of the time.. but college is back. Routine is back and the social anxiety is strong. Slowly, I’m falling back into only having one small meal a day.",False,False
