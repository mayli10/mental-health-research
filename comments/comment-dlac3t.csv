I had 13 therapists and 3 ip hospitalizations in a year. The thing that I think helped me the most was getting a kitten during outpatient. I had too much social anxiety to get a hobby or connect with other people at that point. The kitten was my first real connection and step towards recovery. Then I volunteered and got a job. I started to get to know people through work and they knew me through my role at work, not because of the ED.",False,False

Give yourself an identity and something to hold on to that *isn’t* your disorder. Which sounds hard. Because it is. Because everything is hard but that isn’t a *bad* thing.   So yeah, start with a hobby. It sounds stupid, but hobbies do become a part of your personality. So draw, or write, or crochet, or kickbox or literally *anything*. Doesn’t have to be with people. Don’t worry if you’re not good at it because no-one is at first. It’s basically a reflection of your own growth. As you improve your skill, you yourself improve.   Then maybe get another hobby. Maybe one more social. Join a book club or a conservation club or anything you have interest in. Or research things that interest you. Current events, fashion, birds. Whatever. Expand your knowledge past what school teaches you. Find what actually lights your brain up.   It’s exhausting. It takes time. More time than you feel you have. But you end up getting to a point where you start getting an idea of who you are and how to socialize again. How to be more solid. Get an actual foundation under your feet. It’s an effort and a half. And you determine if you’re worth the work. Given you reaching out and posting this, I’m guessing you’d like to be worth it.",False,False
