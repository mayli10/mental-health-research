Unfortunately for me it is paralysis of my stomach and I also have paralysis of my esophagus. It is because I had numerous botched surgeries on my G.I. tract. Again, I’m very happy that they figured out what was wrong with you, they figured out what was wrong with me but it’s very unfortunate there’s nothing they can do to fix it. But, on the bright side it’s intermittent and it’s not 24 seven so sometimes I can’t eat and sometimes I can drink and I just. I feel very lucky for that, I was just feeling very upset when I posted this. In some ways I should consider myself fortunate. And when I’m not feeling completely despondent I do consider myself fortunate I just made this post when I was not feeling so fortunate.",False,True

It was really bad and I got teased a lot. At first I was sent to therapy because my pediatrician thought it was anxiety (which it was but also wasn’t, anxiety makes it worse for me but wasn’t the cause). Then I ended up seeing a Gastroenterologist and she did a bunch of tests to see if what was happening was physiological. When it wasn’t, the screened me for allergies (by seeing what my stomach was/wasn’t digesting). It turned out that I had an allergy to a common food and my stomach wasn’t able to digest it. Once I stopped eating things with that food in it the symptoms largely stopped.  I’m sure you’re seeing doctor people too. It took a while for them to figure things out in my case, like it took about a year, year and a half, but they figured it out!",False,False

I had my second molar pulled from my body today because I vomit 40-70 times a day. I hate it so much. They didn’t want to classify it as an eating disorder because it didn’t originate as that but now when I have stress if I vomit it makes me feel better so the paralysis of my stomach has become an eating disorder. It’s horrible.Typically they only classify it as an eating disorder if it originated as a consequence of bulimia, but I didn’t have bulimia. But now, because it happens so much I come to associate a purging of stress with my involuntary vomiting. It’s so horrible. I am literally losing my teeth because I can’t stop vomiting and there’s nothing I can do.",False,True
