If you‚Äôre a gym bunny you might be gaining muscle mass which weighs more than fat, so it‚Äôs possible you can gain weight while not gaining size, if that makes sense?",False,False

When I was first diagnosed with AN (10 years ago) I didn‚Äôt do nearly this much exercise because I was so tired all the time. Over the past 4 years I‚Äôve gotten really into running and while it helps me mentally, I‚Äôve become more and more obsessed with it to the point that I consider rest days any day that I go for a walk instead of a run, but I still get the same amount of steps.   I know I need to take rest days but it‚Äôs hard when running does so much to improve my mood. But I will try, so I can hopefully see a change on the scale and avoid injury! ",False,True

I‚Äôm a few pounds heavier than you, eat 200-700 cal a day and I can‚Äôt even trust myself to go on a brisk walk without fainting.   As a recovering exercise addict I can basically guarantee you it‚Äôs water weight. When you exercise a ton, your muscles get tiny micro tears in them, which causes inflammation, leading to water retention. Drink some coconut water and take a couple days off and the water should go away. Dandelion tea helps too.  ",False,False

I‚Äôve noticed before it takes my body a few days to feel less bloated and drop any water weight from my period. But it‚Äôs still frustrating AF. ,False,False

I was in the 130's for such a long time and had been restricting and working out a bit. I had finally reached 129 and was thrilled! The next day my period came and I was back to 132. I blamed my period but continued to restrict. When I stepped on the scale again I was 136. Is that even possible!? I figured the weight would disappear when my period was over. Nope. Two weeks later and I'm finally back at 129 just this morning. üò≠ I hate my body. ,False,False
