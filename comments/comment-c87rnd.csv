Since I know how easily I can become addicted to things, I don’t want to try it. If you think you’ll abuse it, I’d stay away from it. Addiction is no joke. I’ve been addicted to prescription medication before and I never want to go through it again.   I think it can work for some people, but even in the BED subreddit, it doesn’t appear to help most.   Then again, I’ve never tried it, so take everything I just said with a grain of salt :)",False,False
