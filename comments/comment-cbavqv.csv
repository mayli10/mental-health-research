Or maybe don’t keep any sweets at home if you can do that? If I have any junk food those empty calories leave me hungry since I didn’t eat enough real food and I think it leaves me open to a potential binge.,False,False

Add mini merengues to pretty much any of these for a low-calorie sugar hit that feels more indulgent!) so you can allow yourself a dessert without going over your calorie budget and thus feeling tempted to binge?   If you don’t like any of those foods or prefer a specific dessert that is a little higher in calories, you could try saving a few calories on your “dinner” budget to create a bigger “dessert” budget? For example, maybe try substituting cauliflower rice for normal rice, or replacing a potato side with a vegetable one to save calories there to spend on a more indulgent dessert?",False,False

Don’t take your wallet so you’re not tempted to go to the nearest store and purchase something.   Do some self care things like take a shower, apply a face mask (can’t eat with those things on!), paint your nails. A clay mask is my go to since it hardens and I can hardly talk let alone eat.   Drink something to curb your appetite such as iced tea or energy drinks. Starbucks has iced passion tea and get it without sweetener or lemonade so it’s pretty low cal. Ask for it blended for a slushie feel!",False,False
