Only you have control over your thoughts and actions- including ones related to your ED.   It’s a case of choosing your ED or your friendship. If you continue to hold onto your ED this strongly, you will (and already are, from what it sounds) build resentment towards her. Which, again going off what you provided, she does not deserve.   You mentioned she’s careful of how she speaks of food and weight and shows she’s thoughtful about your own personal struggles. She clearly does think and care about you. Extend her the same care and focus. Anytime your ED builds jealousy, think of a good aspect about her that makes you happy. Not to create guilt, but actual positive connections to her. Remember that you enjoy her- you’re friends for a reason.   Don’t let your ED take over to the point you lose a friendship. And only you can know when your ED butts in and how to push it away. You have control over yourself. And your ED is not a literal separate entity. It’s still you. And you’re stronger and better than letting yourself be weak to it.",False,False
