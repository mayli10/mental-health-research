Sometimes you don't expect what someone is going to tell you and stupid things just come out. Not defending that person, but I'm guilty of saying dumb things when caught off guard.",False,False

They really suck for sure. It’s like once or twice a year the only thing that will fix my asthma flare and I always gain 5-10 lbs from it. Trying hard not to weigh for the next week or so until I’m done.",False,True

That's such bad behavior for medical staff...  Also I feel you, prednisone **sucks**. All steroids suck. I hate giving them because they have such bad side effects and low-key give me secondhand dysmorphia from when I gained 10 pounds on them.   Wishing you the absolute best, love.",False,False

It was pretty appallingly bad. I went to the walk in clinic over my own doctor to try to avoid the uncomfortable conversation because they are terrible too. I think it’s just my area. I’m moving soon thankfully.",False,True

That's extremely inappropriate and non-therapeutic communication (RNs have to take a fucking CLASS on it). She obviously knew you had an ED. Honestly, you should report it if you feel comfortable doing so.",False,False
