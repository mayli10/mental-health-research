I don't know/think it's officially the case for BED, but I know clinicians still heavily imply and look for it; it's just not technically in the DSM. I'm not sure what the case is for EDNOS/OSFED; I didn't look into that one, unfortunately.  It's unofficial common knowledge that almost all ED's require the symptom of BDD, but I can't say that's the official rule under all circumstances when I know it isn't. But yes, for AN and BN, that is the official rule, at least currently, under all circumstances for those two diagnoses.  But akin to how AN overrides bulimia if you are underweight, ED's override BDD. Some clinicians will still diagnose you with BDD as well if there is a strong case for it (i.e. you can't leave your house because of your nose, and you're obsessed with it as much as you are your ED), but it's rare and the way that most people on this sub talk about their BDD, most clinicians will not diagnose them due to their ED overriding that diagnosis. It's considered more of a symptom of the ED at that point, but I mean, it's all just official technicalities.",False,False

Not in a funhouse mirror way, it’s super subtle like you said, just kinda shifts from looking like it normally does to skinnier and then back again.   Last summer I went on vacation for three weeks and while I mostly had an amazing time, it intensified my disorder for the duration of the trip. All I ate the entire time was protein bars and by the time we got home I had lost around four pounds. I was already VERY underweight so this was very noticeable. I hadn’t really been paying attention to my body while we’d been away and the “break” I’d taken sort of shocked the dysmorphia out of my brain for a few weeks. I could finally see myself as I actually was, but the dysmorphia slowly came back and over time I watched in the mirror as day by day I started expanding again, even though I was still losing weight. It was a very weird and grounding experience.",False,False
