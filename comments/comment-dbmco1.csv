Hell- as a matter of fact I am 20 years your senior and I totally understand. I have to tell you though the co-dependent relationship your currently in is VERY DANGEROUS! I actually used to be bulimic with my girlfriend and her friends. Until one of our friends died throwing up. She had a re-occurring Mallory Weiss tear in her esophagus; it ruptured and she died on the cold bathroom floor alone. We were all downstairs scarfing and barfing, thinking shit was great.   The experience solidly ruined me and most certainly solidified my Anorexia. At my ripe old age of 49 I still struggle with almost daily.
