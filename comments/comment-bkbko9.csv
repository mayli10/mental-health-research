She did override your autonomy. That makes people sneaky, not healthy.  At the same time, your wife is confused, powerless, and trying to avert having to watch you slowly decline.  I'd do the same in your shoes or just buy a new scale, but I can't blame a spouse who reacts irrationally in the face of this.  My wife and I have a pact: I'll never lie to her, and she'll never try to control my choices. Maybe coming clean to your wife about already having ferreted contraband out could be a good peace offering, if you wanted to try to implement that too.  Things aren't perfect on my end, but they're a whole lot better than they were back when I was hiding this from her.",False,False

The weight fluctuations won't be as panic inducing",False,False
