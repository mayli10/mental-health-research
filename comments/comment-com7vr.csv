It won't make somebody sick. This is especially true because OP is underweight and the recommended nutrient values are based on somebody who consumes around 2000 calories to maintain their weight.  Avocado, seeds, and nuts are all very good for lipids, but you have to make sure they're good for the right kind. Salmon is very high in omega-3 so OP doesn't need any more of that. Omega-6 is very low though. Walnuts are a great source of omega-3 but not as great for omega-6 so they would not be a good idea. Almonds on the other hand have no omega-3 at all and are loaded with omega-6. For seeds sunflower seeds are definitely a good idea. They're a lot like almonds, but they do have a tiny bit of omega-3. Neither are a good source of vitamin K though. For K I would recommend spinach. Only an eighth of a cup would be necessary to get enough vitamin K.",False,False

Doesn't really matter since sources of vitamin k are also sources of iron 99% of the time.  The low lipid levels are why I recommended stuff like avocado and seeds.",False,False

You get 89% of your recommended daily nutrients, but you would be severely lacking in omega-6 and vitamin K. One good thing about it is that you do get 79% of the daily recommended amount of potassium. Only 5% of people in the US get enough potassium in their diet.

But you are getting the relevent micros elsewhere. I personally might replace it with a serving of avocado, pistachios, sunflower seeds, or even dark chocolate. Those have fats that are good for you, though it might be scary to intentionally eat a high fat food. They would do more for you than an apple.",False,False
