Thankfully I never really weighed anything more than high on the normal side of BMI, but that was only because my mom didn't keep sweet things in the house because she knew my father and I would eat it the same day she bought it. So I'm also really worried I'll just end up going back to that and gain a ton of weight again...",False,False

(Even though my mom figured my issue was that I drunk a lot of sweet tea, sat around, snacked on sweets, pop tarts for breakfast, eat a snack before dinner, have a big dinner, etc.) I couldn’t bring myself to do stuff like I did back then now but I’ve probably always struggled with portion control and my family I live with’s normal involves a whole lot less fruits and vegetables (way more processed foods and Hamburger helper, and spaghetti, and cooked beef, cooked meats aaa) and I just want some cottage cheese, apples, tuna, and frozen brussel sprouts to be happy.   Although if I hold out long enough stuff can potentially turn around and I can live with my mom who’s more understanding of my food scale mess and need to see numbers  and more of a cleaner water and she said she’s willing to work with me on things and we can do communication way better than the ones I’m staying with now   Recovery is definitely important and I think trying to would be helpful to both of us considering there’s still muscle and bone growth going on. I started calorie cutting knowing that I was doing the bare minimum for grown women at about 13-14 and figured I would be fine since I wasn’t predicted to get any taller but didn’t consider other things.  Stuff had happened and I’ve lost weight but haven’t had a period in 285 days. Some things have definitely made me cross more into the disordered line but I dunno if I would classify as EDNOS or not. I don’t want to be disordered/ really have that kind of label but at the same time supportive communities like this are a bit of a home for me and understand it. At the same time I’m pretty sure anyone would be hurt if someone gets mad at them and get called disordered.  Definitely in the same boat of feeling fat and hating to gain, I hate feeling my stomach and if I eat more at a meal or just have a bulky meal I can feel my stomach  and I don’t like it. I’ve been checking in the mirror in the morning all week since I’ve been looser at my dinners and guesstimating (felt forced into eating a huge slice of ice cream cake too) and hoping for the scale to be kind (it has but I got a party to go to tomorrow and other things this month rip)  Had 4 apples at lunch and some frozen orange slices and nearly died in my computer chair at school. I doubt anyone in reality becomes a whale off of fruit but it felt like I did.  Gonna just ask to remove my stomach at this point so I don’t feel it against the rest of my body  You got this though! I believe in you and that you’ll be fine!",False,False

I was just over uw when my family started noticing and now I'm trying recovery but I haaaate gaining and I feel so fat, but recovery is important to me and I want to be normal about food again.

I’ve been dealing with amenorrhea for close to about a year now and I can’t really lose any more and still claim to be “healthy”. My family has been more on me about things too and I don’t want them to worry or get mad so it’s to help myself and stuff with them. Just can be pretty overwhelming and isolating when the ones I live with don’t help the best or express concern in a good way that doesn’t wind up in upsetting me  But if I wind up healthier in the future as a result of trying to recover now then it will be worth it,False,False

I’ve been trying to ease back into exercise but there are a lot of factors contributing to me being inconsistent with it (depression chief among them).
