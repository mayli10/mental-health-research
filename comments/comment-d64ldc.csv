But you do have to work for it a little as well- which makes sense, because you can't maintain a friendship unless both people are interested.  Group projects and classes are a great way for you to talk to people. Go to college events, get involved in a club, go to a community service event, offer to help someone pick up things they dropped, end up stuck at the same table as someone in the library because there are no empty workspaces left. Scenarios you can't predict now will be the catalyst for friendships later.",False,False

I ate lunch alone all throughout college. I was only bothered a few times in community college (some random weird girl who wanted to be friends, and some people trying to ask me out). And at a 4-year, I was never bothered. My school had a kind of cafeteria (different food stalls owned independently, coffee stands, etc) and I would usually eat in there. I would also eat outside. My library allowed food and drinks, so I would also eat in there. Never bothered. I was always on my phone or watching a video, so as long as you don't look blatantly sad, I think you'll be fine lol (and even then people don't care)",False,False

High school cafeterias were the ""make or break"" of social standings, the gossip center, and where you sat and who you sat with mattered.  In college? Nah. No one ever really noticed or cared if someone was eating alone. In fact, a lot of people I saw would eat alone in the dining hall or common spaces while reading books, working on laptops, scrolling on their phones, etc. There was also a lot of eating in class, while walking to class, while studying in the library (food was allowed in most of our libraries and there were even cafés inside, so maybe go to yours to study sometime and see if you notice anyone eating or signs that tell you what is/isn't allowed!!) and just sort of wherever they could manage except on the bus, where open food/drink strictly wasn't allowed. And remember that many people don't have an ED, so they're not even going to care about what or where or how people eat, and anyone who DOES have an ED is going to be super hyperfocused on their OWN eating and not yours.  Don't sweat it, take care of yourself!!",False,False
