Our doors are and shitty and I didn't slam the lock on the bathroom hard enough and she walked in on me mid purge. I felt like such a piece of shit. She's a beautiful, clever, creative little girl and I feel like I'm infecting her with my bullshit and she would be better off without me. i think you're really brave for admitting this I know how hard it is. When my disorder first started I said I'd never do this around my kids if I have any. My husband and friends tell me I'm influencing and hurting her and it's so scary being a mom with this. I don't think you're a bad mom, though. The fact that you feel guilty about this says you care a lot for your kid I know that doesnt feel like enough. If it's any consolation, youre not alone.

It goes without saying that you don’t choose to be disordered around your kid but you can’t stop. It does not get easier as they get older. Mine are adolescents now and it’s hard to be UW without them noticing even though I don’t b/p and we eat together. Comments on my weight from them was the catalyst for my big effort to weight restore. I want to be a better role model. It’s not easy though and if you’re struggling it doesn’t say anything about your parenting or commitment to parenthood. Remember you are sick, people don’t choose to be sick! Consider therapy if you feel you can’t deal with this alone. Good luck.",False,False

I dont purge, but a couple of times I've ran up and down the stairs hundreds of times in front of him with him pleading me to stop because its scary. But I cant stop, so I just have to put on Peppa Pig and hope I don't fuck him up TOO badly :(  He also catches me binging and cries when I wont let him join in. I'll give him one of my Oreos or something but he just assumes I'm being mean.   You're certainly not alone.",False,False

On paper it should be easy to seek treatment and recover for them. But that isn’t the nature of this disorder. It’s selfish, unthinking, unfeeling, and unreasonable. I make a huge effort to hide disordered behavior from them as much as possible. I eat with them, stress the importance of healthy food, and let them know that it’s something to be enjoyed but just as importantly what they put in fuels them to play and be healthy and strong. I work a lot so it’s easier for me. But on the same coin if had them beating on the door asking if I’m okay while I purge. Mommy’s just nauseous. I’ve had off days with them where my oldest asks me why I won’t eat with them. Oh it’s too early, mommy’s not hungry yet. Had a big breakfast and I’m still full. And I’m fucking terrified. Two girls, impressionable, malleable, and watching mommy’s every move to learn how to be a person. To learn how to be a woman. To learn how to regard themselves, their bodies and souls. Yes I live with this disorder, and yes, the monster sometimes slips through the cracks. But you and I, we’re trying our hardest to navigate around something we can’t control and didn’t ask for. While also doing the already hard job of being a good mom. And as long as we continue to fight for what matters most, we will be good mothers. It’s better to fight and lose some days, than to never fight at all.",False,False
