Like yeah rewatching it recently I def noticed how TINY Monica and Rachel were but I never thought of Phoebe as being bigger than them. In my mind they were all super thin. And I guess she was also underweight at times, due to the pressure, but it's wild that she felt like she was so massive compared to them when in my mind's eye they all had pretty comparable bodies. I feel so badly for her, the scrutiny must have been god awful.",False,False

I always felt terrible for not being as skinny as Jennifer/Courtney. But there Lisa was: beautiful, confident, twirly, and normal-sized (or at least more normal than the other two).
