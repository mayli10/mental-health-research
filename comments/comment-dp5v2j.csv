Also sudden weight loss could be the whole whoosh effect. You most likely had been losing weight but your body was still retaining water. Today it finally just let it all go and now you're like wtf? Same thing has happened to me before and I remember I was shook and couldnt believe it.   If you need to double check then I know at my local grocery store and drug store chains that they have public scales.,False,False
