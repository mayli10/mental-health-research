Anecdotally, I got a small tattoo at my LW (quite underweight) and was fine having had a granola bar right before I went in. You can also stay and sit or lie back for a little bit afterwards if you're worried about fainting (if you're prone to that), but if you've gone in prepared I doubt it will be an issue.  This might not be necessary for just a little tattoo (maybe it's not necessary at all and I'm just extra this way, I'm not an expert), but in general I also try to be a little kinder to my body for a bit after getting tattooed. A fresh tattoo is effectively an open wound, so I tend to feel like I should help my cells out in healing it up as much as I can.",False,False

Turned out I liked it a lot so I kept drawing it back on after showers and eventually got it tattooed.,False,False

I have two tattoos on each side my ribs. I got one when I was underweight and one when I was 30 pounds heavier and I can honestly say that they hurt the same. The extra fat on my ribs did nothing to make it hurt less, just make sure you stay hydrated and consume a lot of electrolytes before your tattoo session!",False,False

[Here's the best pic I could find that shows it off.](https://imgur.com/aaAeWXc) Where the triangle on the right is is also where the flesh is thinnest, but I don't remember any part being too painful. Going over the tendon on the other side of my wrist was the hardest spot and I would give that 1.5/10 max in terms of pain. It was just uncomfortable. It was less uncomfortable than getting your teeth cleaned by a dentist. If you go to an experienced tattoo artist they'll know what size needle to use for different areas and they'll know how to minimize any pain you might feel.",False,False

The actual tattooing process didn't hurt that much, and after I left the shop, I thought I was fine, but maybe 30 or so minutes later I got extremely lightheaded/dizzy/fatigued. Prepare to eat or drink something a little sugary to help with that and you ought to be okay!",False,False

I fainted during a tattoo last year I hadn‚Äôt eaten enough I guess. Felt fine one minute then the next I felt really spacey and weird and suddenly I was lying on my back with the tattooist looking over me asking if I was ok üò¨ really embarrassing lol. He gave me a can of Coke and took a short break then went back to it and it was fine. Posted about it on fb and all my friends with lots of tattoos pretty much laughed at me for being such a noob üòè apparently everyone knows to take Lucozade or Gatorade to the tattoo studio!,False,False

Especially if your blood sugar is low and you‚Äôre getting it in a spot where the skin is especially thin or sensitive. So just watch out for that. It‚Äôs a good idea to try and have a popsicle or lollipop or something with sugar if you can beforehand for the pain. I got a tattoo without eating before and it hurt so much until my artist gave me a lollipop and it made me feel better because my blood sugar was just really low. That or I‚Äôm just a literal fucking baby,False,False
