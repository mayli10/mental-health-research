I used to purge horribly before doctor's appointments to try to get the weight lower, and usually ended up really, really sick. I explained this to her, and she immediately backed off and said that OK, as long as she could check my self-monitoring at-home records when she was concerned, that was good enough. My PCP is the same way -- she doesn't weigh me in the office, but our agreement is that she can ask for my phone, and I'll give it to her.",False,False

My therapist has me weigh myself at every session and tell her the number, and even though it is supposed to help get rid of the fear of weighing it does the opposite because of the exact reasons you stated. Like I’ve told her so many times that my ED stems from my need to prove how disciplined I am. It’s already bad enough that I have to prove it to myself through seeing my own weigh loss, but now I also have to prove it to my therapist by making sure the number on the scale goes down more every session! It’s honestly some pro-Ana motivational shit at this point. It’s not a coincidence that my biggest drop in weight so far has been in the week between when she announced the weigh-in and the next week when we did the first official one. If you don’t mind, I might show her this post because it expresses exactly what I’ve been trying to say.",False,False
