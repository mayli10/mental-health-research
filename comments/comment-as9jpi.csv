We deserve it!  But they all make jokes about how I don't order anything.  ""No wonder you're so tiny,"" ""I'd be skinny like you, too!""...it actually hurts trying to joke it off.  I didn't ask to be this way; in fact, I have several issues which are causing my disordered eating this time around.  They have no clue, I just slough it off as a lack of appetite or that I ""ate breakfast with the kids.""  Truth is, the thought of eating makes me feel ill, to the point of nausea.  And in that, I have returned to my bff -- my eating disorder.  It's almost like it has a mind of it's own and has said ""Hey, you hit 100 lbs!  Doing great, right?  Come back to me, instead!""  And now I'm fucking dying.  Hair falling out.  Skin looks like shit.  My only calories are alcohol.  1/4 of a bagel here and there, a bite of dinner as to not alarm my family.  I am out of control of this as I'm not trying to avoid the calories or the food.  But I literally cannot even think about food without wanting to vomit.  My stomach churns as the idea of eating.  If my co-workers knew how sick I was, they wouldn't say anything.  They'd just think to themselves ""Ok, I guess she's not hungry,"" but instead they tell me I eat like a bird or make a comment about how ""it's not your money, get whatever you want!""  It hurts.  My honest advice is rude: make a comment about her, too, ""I can't believe you didn't eat MORE!  Can I finish it for you?"" and wink, like a cunt.  Or be the bigger person and tell her that you're ""intermittent fasting,"" works every time.",False,False

Obviously she's not eating that fucking much if she's been a normal weight all of her life, and JUST MIND YOUR BUSINESS OMG. Imagine if she had an ed, how awfully triggering that would be.
