You will make her think twice before she opens her mouth and upsets someone like that ever again. The poor woman who got bullied is probably feeling very upset and embarrassed but I‚Äôm sure is grateful, even if they don‚Äôt wind up communicating that to you.

We dont hang out often outside of work since both of us dont drive and live in the middle of nowhere. I've hung out with her twice, and that's because we were both actually kinda friends with our shitty coworker.   I want to hover and make sure she eats enough at work and generally just be a work mom, despite only being 6 years older then her. I worry so much about other people not eating enough or developing EDs because of being triggered by me and my ... uh... ""extreme weight loss journey""   I know I shouldn't be like this, but I feel a ridiculous amount of personal responsibility for this whole situation tbh. I definitely talk about dieting too much at work (I'm kinda obsessed with nutrition and I really have a hard time shutting the fuck up about it. It's annoying) and this totally feels like it's all my fault and I dont deserve all of this praise.  Wow, sorry about rambling to you. Your response evoked emotions for some reason",False,True

Despite us being friends before all this, her behavior at work has always been wildly unprofessional. I've actually reported her already for an entirely different problem and nothing came of it. I'm also afraid that she might hurt me if she got in serious trouble because of me. I think I'm the only one at work who is bothered by her behavior most of the time so she would know it was me.

That was horrible of her to say, she hears a co-worker wants to lose weight and starts to treat her like shit for eating? What the actual fuck?  This isn't benign at all. You just helped undo some of the damage she did to that poor girl by standing up for her. Comments about people's weight and outright insults are not jokes, and she really strikes me as a manipulative and abusive person. You dodged a bullet, I wouldn't want to be friends with someone so horrible.  If it's possible, report her behaviour to a manager (even if anonymously). She doesn't deserve to get away with that.
