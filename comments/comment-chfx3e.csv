I was under likeminded and positive people. I would definitely recommend pushing through until September. Just think of that as your only job for now - get through august.   I get the sense that you want to fight all the feelings and have all kinds of expectations for yourself. Whereas in the current situation, just getting out of bed warrants a high five. You don’t have to be strong all the time. You are allowed to have the depressed feelings. They tend to come in waves. Just ride the wave, know that it gets better, and breathe.   Also, it sounds like you’re not getting much out of the relationship with your boyfriend anymore. If you constantly feel bad when/after hanging out with him, it’s definitely worth considering if the relationship still has the merits of when it started, or whether your paths in life may have drifted apart. It’s nobody’s fault, and it doesn’t discredit the great time you have had in the past if you decide to end it now. Just be honest with yourself if the relationship offers you much happiness anymore.",False,False
