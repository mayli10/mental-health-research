Obviously posting hateful thoughts about those with overweight BMIs in a group saturated with vulnerable people with overweight BMIs is less than ideal. But the whole premise of this community is to give us a safe space to share our disordered thoughts. I think the posts that just talk about discomfort with others' bodies are unreasonable, but when they're recognized as disordered thoughts we should be supporting each other through that. I don't think those threads should be interpreted as ""DAE hate fat people"" and more as ""has anyone else's ED made them have shallow hateful thoughts about others?"" I know I don't LIKE feeling like a hateful person when I have thoughts like that.   Also, it's probably worth mentioning, there's no backlash over hateful rhetoric about thin bodies (""she looks like a child,"" ""my bones/veins/chipmunk cheeks disgust me,"" etc.) ",False,False

My own body dysmorphia does inevitably change the way I see the bodies of other people, but I realize how sick those thoughts are and never ever verbalize them in real life, here or anywhere else. There is literally no need to post ""DAE secretly hate fat people"" here, knowing well that the ""secretly hated"" people in question who also read this subreddit are going to see that post and feel worse about themselves. I know that I'd feel a lot worse about myself if I knew that other people secretly hated and pitied me.  I'm a mentally ill person and I keep my mouth shut about body image because my opinion of what is desirable or not doesn't matter. My messed up ideas don't have to affect those in this community or anybody else. The only body I ever verbalize negative thoughts about in any form is my own. ",False,False

It's an unpopular opinion on this sub and I've been downvoted for it before but I don't think that *any* kind of thoughts can go unchecked on an ED sub.   Having the thoughts doesn't make anyone a bad person, but the atmosphere on this sub of ""I'm glad y'all think fat people are gross too! It's completely fine to think this because we have EDs"" without any reflection on it is just... Counterproductive.  It also seems really hypocritical tosay that everyone at any weight is welcome on this sub but then it's completely accepted to shit on fat people. A large part of ED sufferers are overweight and for a community that loves to preach how accepting and supportive they are, this is a negative environment for anyone who is overweight.",False,False

Here's the thing. When you have those thoughts and you know they're hateful, you should actually try to combat them (and obviously not post them). But if you allow your ED to color how you see other people without even trying to stop/ignore/combat that projection, you are a bad person.   And regardless of any of that, if you know you're doing it and you decide not to look at why you have this irrational hatred that you're projecting onto to other people, you are being, at the very least, an extremely immature (and hateful) person.   Also for context this is a post in response to multiple threads from people on here gleefully discussing how much they love r/fatlogic and r/fatpeoplestories and so on, as well as posts about people's coworkers or family members and how disgusting their bodies are. Which was also a huge problem at proED that I frequently argued against there too. It's fucked up that our sub exists in such a harmful way while people are claiming it's ""sUpPoRtIvE,"" which is a flat out lie. I'm sick of the immature and counterproductive discussions on here. We used to have proEDadults for that exact reason (because so many of us were sick of this shit), but that got removed as well. And I especially hate when people complain that proED got removed, while allowing hatred to fester in it. We deserved to be shut down, plain and simple. I don't want this sub to go the same direction, which is why I posted this and will continue to make posts like this. I want the majority of the members here to feel worthy of posting in this rinky dink sub, instead of feeling unwanted in a community that should support them.   But I agree, my phrasing was off (although it's Valentine's Day so I'm chugging wine as we speak, maybe that explains it lmao) ",False,True
