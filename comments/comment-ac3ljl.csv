But I could actually see a couple glasses of wine getting me relaxed enough without compromising my self control.,False,True

I started using it to escape. I‚Äôd take enough pills to be out of it for a couple days. (Bearing in mind that a benadryl trip isn‚Äôt that pleasant...seriously impaired speech and motor function at the very least). I went through that cycle for a few years. Then I attempted suicide with a really massive OD. Ended up seizing and on a vent in the ICU.  Now, the tolerance in my body is so high that I can‚Äôt use them to help get normal, restful sleep. Also, choking down so many pills was apparently traumatic and I pretty much gag just at the sight of a Unisom softgel.  Sooo...that was one way to end the cycle...",False,False

I started using benadryl to sleep on occasion and it gradually got real out of hand. It‚Äôs technically ‚Äúnon habit forming‚Äù but it‚Äôs not intended for regular long-term use and your body does build up a tolerance.,False,False

Those stops in breathing at night often cause you to wake up for a very short time, so short you don't even notice, but it does effectively prevent your body from entering its deep sleep phase, you know, the part where you actually get rest.  Do take this with a grain of salt, that study still needs further investigating.",False,False
