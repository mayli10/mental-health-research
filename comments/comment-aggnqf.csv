Is it emotional or due to restriction? Whenever I get into a cycle, it’s because I keep punishing myself or trying to make up for the binge, which only triggers another one.  I would suggest you try to move past your day as if it never happened, because the more you dwell on it or punish yourself for it, the likelier it’ll happen again.   If it’s from restriction, it’ll keep going on until your body is being nourished. I can’t tell you how or what to eat, but for me, it helps to stick to a schedule. 3 meals a day and snacks whenever I am hungry.   The idea that I HAVE to lose weight also triggers it, since I’ll restrict even more and obsess over what I eat, but I’m still struggling with managing that mindset.   As for the discomfort, light cardio, lots of water, sleep, and time usually helps me bounce back.",False,False
