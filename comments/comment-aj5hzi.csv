As soon as they wrote on my order form (do they even use those anymore lol), I would dash back to my house, grab the boxes from my stash and be back at their door within five minutes.    &amp;#x200B;  Idk if there are any scouts in my neighborhood anymore but thank the lawd I'm not at home to answer the door if that occurs.",False,True

People think about the holidays being rough in relation to food, but then they’re followed by cookie season. It is a truly challenging quarter of the year from Thanksgiving until the end of Girl Scout season. Best of luck, my friend.  A friend of mine has a friend who delivers Girl Scout cookies TO HIS HOUSE. At least we don’t have that easy access. ",False,False

Can't do it, hate mint. I know other readers here will be like ""wtf is wrong with you"", but I will stand by it that I hate Thin Mints. Maybe in like ten years and my palette is a little more developed, I'll try them but for now, nope.    &amp;#x200B;  I haven't had a Peanut Butter Patty in a minute and I kind of forgot what they taste like. I'm a slut for some good peanut butter so I guess now I gotta try one again.    &amp;#x200B;  GREAT NOW I GOTTA GO EAT THEM ALL.",False,True

Lemonades are pretty big and 150 for 2. Peanut butter patties are 140 for 2, but also small (all vegan, by the way).
