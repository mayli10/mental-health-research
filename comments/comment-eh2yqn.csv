I'm not an anorexic, a bulimic, or binge eater. I have food rules, I count and control calories, I exercise a lot, and sometimes I've cried and had meltdowns over food and exercise, but nowhere near the level of a real eating disorder. But that's F I N E! I'm not very underweight, not very extreme, but that doesn't mean I shouldn't work towards a healthier mind and body.  I'm kind of a mild orthorexic (a lot of rules/restriction with what I can best describe as the virtue of food and eating behavior) and have been so for about 5 years, 6 this February. I counted calories and followed rules for all of it, with 3 weight restoration periods after each time I got underweight and got worried. But here's the thing, my restriction was never low (basically a healthy dieting level of calorie control) or anything extreme. My eating patterns are rigid in the sense that I get stressed when scheduling and events make it so I need to alter my usual routine, ESPECIALLY when eating out, which can ruin my whole day and cause anxiety during the week or weeks leading up. But it's not like oh, restaurant meals have calories or whatever. I eat 1900, no problem. But a restaurant meal in the middle? Problem. I'm doing my best (most relaxed) when I control what,when and how much I eat, and I'll plan and eat normal ish amounts. Mechanically and functionally, that is, I do best when I don't attach joy or pleasure to most of what I eat because then i feel likes it's not hedonic or indulgent and then I have less shame/guilt. This obviously breaks down if I have anything that's considered a treat,so what I used to do is allow myself to eat treats only 10-12 times a year, which I saved for special events. But when I started biking and having a TDEE of like 2200-2500+, I started eating a bit of cereal here, granola there,ECT and actually started enjoying food and flavor, which scared me, but also I felt so much happier. I felt really content for 6-9months, biking 150-200 miles a week, weight restoring, having bits of cereal, making a hot dinner every night (as opposed to a afternoon snack of carrots with hummus since I would eat after 5-6). But then when I regained 15 pounds I made the mistake of jokingly calling it my freshman 15 and started cutting down again. But the problem became that I had started to enjoy eating and wanting to have some pleasure from food. And that's kind of where I've been at, except now I'm post a few episodes of weight loss and one failed restoration. Part of me wants to go whole food plant based and then pick up intermittent fasting again (once I'm at a healthy BMI, which is what I said last time I weight restored but I never got there). But another part of me says, don't you want to make the most of life? What's the point of cutting out things that are enjoyable except for very few occasions? Who cares? If eating chocolate once a week doesn't hurt you, and you exercise and have an otherwise healthy diet - i.e , are 'allowed', why not? (I don't have chocolate once a week as it is, but I do have unsweetened chocolate powder and 100% baking chocolate, which I try not to think too much about to avoid guilt).  I want to make the most of every moment in 2020. I still plan to eat healthy, but I also don't want to cry or freak out about food, be inflexible, obsess, lose time I could be bettering myself by obsessing, and fail to enjoy even when I partake because of anxiety. Physically, I want to become faster, stronger, less yellow-skinned, and get my period back.  ""What a long post"" buckle in yall I've been kind of lost about ""fear foods."" It's been long enough and I well enough (calorically/macro wise) that I won't really desire or think about having most of my fears (pasta, pizza, any pastry, chocolate, restaurant meals (including fast food and ready meals), candy ECT). So part of me says, well, doesn't matter then, don't have them, just eat what you like and are comfortable with. But the thing is I get so stressed when I am 'forced' to have them (parents pushing me to eat out, ECT) that I zone out and basically just shove food in my mouth. Maybe thinking I don't enjoy then reduces guilt since then I'm not taking pleasure in it and ""indulging"" myself. I don't know. But I'm thinking I should confront them a few times and push myself to have some when presented just for the exercise of it, so I don't have a breakdown when, say, we go out and I get a slice of bread and potatoes on the same plate and have a meltdown because it's two starchy non veggie carbs? Like, not have a meltdown and maybe even actually enjoy the 'now and then' stuff? So... Yeah that's my plan. Eat some fear foods, weight restore, get strong. ^im documenting it ok insta, pop_chip_boi, send me suggestions if you'd like",False,False
