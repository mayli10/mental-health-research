When something as natural and necessary as food ruins your day because you feel like you've gone over your self imposed limit. Or even if you don't go over, it's unbearable not knowing exactly how much you've eaten, triggering despair and panic. That's the mental side, but even if you're a bit more relaxed, the physical caloric deficit can still be too much if you undereat on a consistent enough basis to deplete most of your nutritional reserves (just because you think you're fat doesn't mean you're exempt, and just because 1200 is the recommended ""healthy"" intake doesn't mean it's good for everyone, or for too long). If you find yourself struggling to do basic tasks and still can't bear to eat more, there's a problem. I think that it's possible for calorie estimating to be non-disordered, to where you get a sense of how much you've eaten while also relying on physical cues without feeling any emotional attachment to your intake, but for those who are prone to eating disorders and tend to use food or lack thereof as a way to cope with and distract from negative emotions, it's a very slippery slope",False,False

I can say yeah those eggs were about 150 calories. And here is some 50 calorie coffee. Its not 145.25 and 52.3 calories. People who think they can calculate this small accurately seem extremely disordered to me.  Another red flag I think is putting calorie count above nutrition. If you have diet soda and rice biscuits all day, at only 300 calories. Thats way worse than actually eating meat, fruits, and vegetables, and yogurt at 900 calories per day. Our bodies desperately need protein, folate, vitamins, etc to not get sick. Disordered can even refer to a lack of priorities. People who put being thin over being healthy.  Maybe Im disordered. Or /maybe/ Im just 5'1"" , extremely inactive, and actually aware of the impact food has on my figure. Some days I cant decide.",False,False

When you plan your day around calories? I hear people debate what is too low. Somewhere between 1200-1500 a day is considered normal restriction I guess and lower than 1200 is too much. (Tell that to my disordered ass who tries to eat less than 800 a day) Yes calorie counting can be non disordered. Normal people don't freak out if they go a little over their calorie limit.,False,False
