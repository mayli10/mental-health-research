So I don't really know what real maintenance is for me so that I would actually not gain on it :/  I feel like if I truly eat intuitively and allow everything, including chocolates and so on, I usually end up around 900-1600 which should be a normal range for me - but I can never do IE freely as I still want to lose weight and start calculating in my head :(",False,True

I'm gonna be real with you. it was this mindset that made me hit a new HW... twice. You HAVE to forgive yourself. you HAVE to treat your body well. otherwise it will just fight you. your body is freaking out because it never knows if/when you're going to feed it. if you try to normalize your eating for a while, it will calm down. binging sucks. overeating is better than binging. eating at maintenance is better than overeating. this mindset is what helps me transition out of binge phases and back into restriction.",False,False

And, I still cycle, its just now my restriction cycles are getting longer, and my binges are just once every couple of weeks.   &amp;#x200B;  Unfortunately, I had to greatly increase my calorie goal for a long time (like 3 months of eating at maitenance, and staying fat, it sucked). Now I am starting to decrease my calorie goal so that I can lose. It sucks, but I spent an entire year trying to get my low restriction and fasting mojo back and that was just an exercise in futility.",False,False

I have NOTHING to wear lol and can't go outside.  I thought about doing a 5 day fast after my binge today althought I hate fasting, but I'll tell myself that if I finish it I can either go on fasting (and often if I'm in 'the tune' of it I might just keep going) or do intuitive eating after it but either way, I won't have to think about calories and plans and all that anymore :D How are you trying to get out of it?",False,True

At first, the king of restriction, then binged almost daily and gained 26 lbs in a little over a month. It felt like something in me was broken.  I don't really have specific advise for getting out of it. I remember seeing my bank statement and realized I spent a few hundred on fast food and baked goods in a single month. As a poor college student, that kinda hit me. Other than that, as far as what worked for me, ECA stacking helped. But what really did it, was getting a new job and being out of college. A big change in life like that, and suddenly you don't notice the little changes like diet.",False,False

After a couple months the crazy overeating calmed down and I was eating somewhat more like a normal human being. Although I can't exactly recommend this ""solution"" because I gained 25 pounds and now I hate myself again *finger guns* You know now that I think about it, I'm questioning if I even ended the cycle, or if I just lengthened it ðŸ¤”",False,False
