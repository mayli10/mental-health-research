Yeah, it’ll be awkward for a bit, but especially if you try to gloss over it and brush it off as a drunk mistake.  I’d address it in a straightforward way next time you work together - just “hey, I’m sorry if I made you uncomfortable the other day, thanks for being upfront with me and understanding, I hope we can still be friendly at work.”  The person who did this to me took that approach, and we’re still friendly - we even grab a drink from time to time, purely as friends.  I know it’s hard and it sucks, but try not to beat yourself up over this - it’s just part of being human and doing vulnerable, human things. It sounds like you already know this logically and are well attuned to the way your ED is skewing the way you’re dealing with this, but maybe the opinion of an Internet stranger will provide some reinforcement 😉",False,False
