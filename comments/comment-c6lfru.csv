I will heavily restrict when she comes home &amp; just make up lies like “yeah I already ate, I’m sooooo full” &amp; then she makes her own dinner for herself. But it does make me feel horrible when she says that she’s sick of cooking for just herself &amp; wishes I’d join her. If I do eat what she cooks, then I take it into my room so she isn’t watching me eat it.",False,False
