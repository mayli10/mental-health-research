A lot of porn breaks my fucking heart.  There are some scenes that have so obviously left the area of consent, and others it's ambiguous at best. I think I used to be addicted to it in high school/college and one day just completely stopped watching because I realized how inherently evil it is as an industry. I truly feel like most of the women and some men are trafficked into it in a way, and you can just see that a lot of them are uncomfortable, scared, high, etc while filming.    I've started watching it occasionally again and feel best about watching ""ethical"" porn.  I feel like films that were produced/directed by a female porn actress are a lot more consensual and respectful. I think one of my favorite porno flicks is Girl-Boy which was directed by Dana Vespoli.  She got into porn when she was a lot older just for the love of it and makes it actual art.  &gt;&gt;Porn is mostly geared to men- if it was the other way around, and women enjoyed strange men‚Äôs bodies regularly, men would be furious and work to stop the production of it.  That is such a good point. Honestly just look at the categories on any gay male porn sites and imagine how poorly hetero men would react to that being the norm.  I should just say that I was feeling particularly bad at that moment, but today I'm pretty neutral about the whole thing.  He is respectful and makes me (and my body, as undeserving as I think it is) loved.  Preferences are a weird thing and I don't think most are static.",False,True

I know because I‚Äôve been there.
