I think it’s both an issue of how society defines “feminine” and “masculine” as well as a physical issue. For instance, certain parts of transgendered people’s brains more closely resemble the sex they identify with than their own. And it’s their bodies that they feel wrong with more than the roles assigned to them. However, I wish we would abolish gender roles and expectations entirely. If a guy wants to shave his legs, wear a dress, whatever, who cares? If a girl doesn’t want to do that, who cares? These things are ultimately arbitrary and meaningless anyway as they’re purely societally based, and different societies have different expectations.  I personally have not discussed these issues with a therapist because I have more pressing matters to deal with in my sessions, and I don’t want help for the ED at this point. Some might consider it denial but I’ve successfully managed to drop and then maintain for a year or two with way less focus on calories, etc. It became more habitual that I knew about what I needed to maintain (12-1600 depending on activity level) and all my nutrition was good. So right now, it’s awful, and it may be a bit before I get to my ugw, but I’m not changing anything until I do.",False,False

And yeah I don't feel attached to the idea of 'being a woman', but I'm sure lots of people don't feel particularly attached to their 'assigned gender' yet don't feel the need to reject it. And I waffle on whether I reject it or not.   I reject the assigned body and traditional gender roles, certainly. But sometimes I think, wouldn't it help more to deconstruct gender roles if I were to continue identifying female yet not conform? Why shouldn't what I am/act like/look like currently be classified as 'female'? And why should it be NB/male/anything else instead? Man I don't know. WOW sorry this is kind of a rant and maybe off-topic now but your comment resonated with me.   This is a personal question so feel free not to answer, but do you see a therapist/counselor about any of this? I want to start therapy but feel like this is a really niche topic - the intersection of gender identity and eating disorders. I've heard it's difficult to find a therapist for either of those issues alone, so I'm dreading finding one who can maybe understand both. Ugh.",False,False
