Bread is one of my major fear foods because I know that once I get started on it I won't have the self control to stop.  We all have bad days. Even though it's extremely hard to see past what your ed tells you,  one bad day won't make any difference in the long run. Try not to sweat it ðŸ’•",False,False

Bread is a huge trigger food for me and I never buy except for planned binges (cheat days or whatever you want to call them). I know how crazy you feel, and I feel for you. I've felt the pain of picking up a pack of cheese and some bread in the store, only to put it down later because I literally cannot trust myself.    I know it's really hard, I truly wish that some day, perhaps some beautiful day, both you and I can enjoy a slice or two of bread, without going completely over the top.  I hope you can regain some balance here and get rid of this ""what is wrong with me"" feeling, because I know it sucks. Best of wishes!",False,False
