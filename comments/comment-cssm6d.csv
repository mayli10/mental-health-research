Because it's your ED brain that notices those comments and attaches to them. Whereas your boyfriend and family don't have that obsessive voice that will take notice of those comments. It sucks that people don't understand how triggering their words can be but just remember that it's only you who is thinking that way. Your boyfriend will probably not have even noticed that comment or just have forgotten about it immediately.,False,False

That's the messed up thing, a lot of people with ED are healthy looking or even a bit on the chubbier side so it's not taken as seriously as someone who looks like theyre dying. It's not fair that your dad and bro (the men in your life, seemingly) are so unsupportive. My family is the same. I don't talk to my dad anymore because I'm terrified of how he sees me.",False,False

My dad thinks that it’s all an attention thing- so my siblings kind follow whatever my parents feel. It’s tough.",False,True

I'm sorry. How could your brother be so insensitive when he knows you've had an eating disorder? That just seems cruel AF. I would try and move out asap, tbh.",False,False
