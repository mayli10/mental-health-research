Just spent the weekend with my very thin friend after I had lost some weight and immediately felt like welp nvm that’s what actually skinny is I’m just a blob still,False,False

I know that it won't ever be enough, but I'm also definitely not ready for recovery yet. At my lowest I was only 108 lbs, and with my height that put me square in normal weight territory. Maybe one day I will see how sick I really am. However, considering that I also don't feel sick enough (because I do eat, and my weight is still normal, so how sick can I really be) to go to a psychiatrist, it probably won't be soon.",False,True

At my lowest weight I still didn't feel good enough. I don't own a scale so when my ED started my goals were all about measurements. I wanted to get down to a 23"" waist and I did. Then I got weighed at a doctor and I wanted to get down to a certain lower weight and I did. Then I immediately wanted to drop another 15 lbs. From my lowest weight that would have left me at 90 lbs. I knew in that exact moment I would never be satisfied and that I had to force myself to get better. It was a long and very stressful process, but I'm here now. It just took me realizing that this really is an illness and that no matter how small I got I would never be small enough. I mean, I met two different types of goals and the second one was supposed to be my ultimate goal weight where I wouldn't want to lose any more. I wasn't as sick at the time as I am now (*developed some kind of GI issue while I was working on getting comfortable with eating maintenance calories for my low weight*) so I knew that I could manage the symptoms I was already experiencing and drop the weight if I really wanted to. That was a terrifying thought though. I mean, I knew what it meant when I first checked my measurements and did the math to estimate my weight and saw that I was in fact officially underweight in that moment. I cried because I knew what an awful thing it was. I guess I just wasn't ready to get better yet and then when the desire to lose even more kicked in that finally gave me he push I needed to start slowly working up the amount I was eating until I was eating enough to maintain a healthy weight. I think part of what I struggle with is that I'm more sick now than I was at my lowest weight, but I also know that I was more sick a few months ago than I am today which helps me manage. Losing weight again would make me more sick and I don't want to be more sick.",False,False

I'm an hourglass, so I have naturally bigger hips and chest and I absolutely hate it. I feel like thanks to my height every pound is extremely visible on me. Even at my lowest I still felt terrible and I was barely approaching underweight at that point. I have no idea when will I be satisfied with myself. But at the same time I just don't feel ready to recover. I just don't want to. However, it's really good that you have some really good reasons not to starve that help you! Although logic doesn't always help with things like ED, sometimes it does make a difference - knowing that there's something rational to hold on to, to keep going for. I'm wishing you the best in your journey!",False,True
ettjxcs,t3_cdekcc,t1_ettj9yv,livipup,1,2019-07-15 04:47:11,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/cdekcc/my_mom_called_my_friend_so_underweight_in_front/ettjxcs/,"I think I know how you feel. I was pretty lucky in that a lot of the weight I gained went to my chest so my waist measure is still the same and I haven't gone up a pants size. (*My legs have gotten bigger, but I was kind of a loose fit in size 0 skinny jeans before so no big deal*) I just see the number on the scale or my BMI and it makes me feel so awful. The worst part is probably that I genuinely think I look better at a healthy weight than I did when underweight and yet I still just want to lose it all. I have no reason to want to lose weight except that I feel like being smaller than everybody else. I think it's a mix between height dysphoria and anorexia. Once I started losing weight I realized that even if I'm slightly taller than average I could at least weigh less than other girls and that was probably when my ED got really bad.   There are really only two things that keep me from starving myself. The first is that I get really tired when I don't eat and I want to get back on track with my education so I can start doing all the things I want to with my career. I can't fix my health if I'm too tired to care for myself and I can't be productive if I don't even have enough energy to think straight. The other thing is that I'm trans and my chest is still really small. I already stunted breast growth for a couple years by being underweight and I don't want that to happen to again. Not only that, but if I don't end up getting the kind of growth I expect I'm considering fat grafting which of course requires you have fat to move around. If I do end up doing that in the future I could be at a healthy weight and maybe even be thinner than I was at my lowest weight. I can't get that done if I'm underweight though and I don't want to have to go through gaining weight all over again.",False,False

I would gladly have all of that instead of fat (even though it makes me kinda messed up haha). life is weird, isn't it. however, I am glad to hear that you seem to be on your way to recovery! please, don't let this jealousy get the better of you.",False,True

Turns out I was wrong because she's actually 1.5 BMI below the recommended minimum. She's not super under weight, but well I know that I was already getting sick when I was at the same BMI as her so it could be a problem for some people. Lowkey kind of jealous too though and I don't even know your friend, Weird that I would be jealous when I chose to gain weight.",False,False
