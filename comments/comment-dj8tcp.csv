Have had/ still have eating disorder tendencies whether it be anorexia/ binge eating disorders since I was very young. Have always been food obsessed too. Love playing the host and cooking for large groups of people. Once I find somewhere I do like to eat I'll obsessively visit these places for my safe foods, and wont order anything new from a menu EVER.  When having to eat outside of my safe spots, I'll either find an excuse not to eat out OR if I have absolutely no choice I'll obsessively study the menu/reviews/pictures until I find that one thing I'll order and I'll never order anything new if I ever return to that place.  AAAAANNNDDD that's just the tip of the iceberg really...  Damnit I'm such a feckin Taurus üôÑü§ò woop woop!",False,False

It is one of the few days of the year where it is suggested you eat whatever you want and enjoy food because you tend to be too hard on yourself, and may become unhealthy if you don‚Äôt indulge from time to time.‚Äù   Ahah, so long ago.
