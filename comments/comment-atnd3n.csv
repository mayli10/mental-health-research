Tbh, I also like that my hair can cover some of my fat in my upper back, neck, chest, etc. Hair can't get fat.  And if anything, long hair is beautiful; it may help with the dysmorphia to have something you can enjoy on you.  On top of that, hair weighs almost nothing..you won't notice much, if any, loss on the scale if you cut it.  I just know a bunch of girls who regret cutting their hair and don't want to do things ""until it grows back"", so I just don't want you to have to go through the same thing.",False,False
