I'm really sorry this is happening, I can really relate to your situation. My last ex cheated, and it hit me like a ton of bricks out of nowhere... we'd been together two years, and had just recently planned to get engaged and move in together. Then he left his facebook open, and I found out about his 'extracurricular activities'.   I don't have a lot of advice, but you're not alone. This isn't your fault. Just try to take each moment as it comes, and focus on getting through that moment however you can. It's ok to mourn the relationship you thought you had, and the person you thought he was... it hurts to lose those things. He's not who you thought he was though, so try not to regret letting him go.   I know this is kind of a silly thing to say here of all places, but try to be kind to yourself if you can. &lt;3",False,False

I've been there, it turns out I was a ploy to make his ex jealous. Real soul crusher right there. But guess what? That guy was a boring douchebag and I'm glad he cheated on me or else I never would've realized he's a boring douchebag. I hated all his friends, and I kind of hated him. I saw him as a ""fixer-upper"", but he was really just a bad boyfriend. Now I have a great guy, so it gets better. Just cry a lot and try and move on.",False,False

I've been in a position where I've literally been so unhappy in a relationship, on molly at a festival with some other attractive guy coming onto me and I still decided not to cheat. There is no valid excuse for cheating. That is a decision he made. Do you really want to marry this man? Just because you want it as an excuse to self harm via starvation because you have an ed right now doesn't mean you should stay. It will make it so much more difficult to recover from this disease and your life will be miserable. I don't know anything about your relationship other than he cheated, but I've been in these crap relation ships before and I would not wish that shit on my worst enemy.",False,False

You'll find someone better, I promise. And dont feel bad about being lowkey motivated because I feel the same way when I've been single or cheated on or anything like that. It's pretty empowering in a weird way lol.",False,False

You should never cry over spilled milk if it was rotten to begin with.  The grass is always greener where you water it. Donâ€™t put your emotionally energy on mourning your ex bc, put it towards something that will improve your mental health or something that makes you happy.",False,False

Iâ€™m really trying to first get over the shock and then hopefully move on. We were supposed to be engaged soon, and itâ€™s hard to realize that fantasy is over. I guess just take it day by day. What hurts me the most is I thought he, out of all people, would not me this way.",False,True

I'm so sorry.    The only thing that's ever helped me is shouting into the internet void (forums), talking to friends over and over, getting out to try new things, and letting myself feel hurt without self-judgement or redirecting that hurt into something else. I hope you find your path and don't be afraid to ask other people IRL or online for help. There's always someone to talk to somewhere.",False,False
