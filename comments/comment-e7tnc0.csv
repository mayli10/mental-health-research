A pump of chai is 30 calories and its half water half milk so its less milk. And i recommend a pump of the chestnut praline syrup. Also the peppermint mocha you can get with skinny mocha syrup but id check when you go in if theh have it cause some starbucks dont. And just get less pumps of the syrups theyre way too sweet for me to begin with.,False,False

I used to be a barista, I can help you!  If you like peppermint drinks get a peppermint tea latte with skim or almond milk. That alone is approximately 90-100 cals and then ask for a pump of sugar free chocolate syrup approx 75 cals. You can even get a large and it will taste just the same! For a bit more depth also ask for a pump of Sf vanilla in it too!",False,False
