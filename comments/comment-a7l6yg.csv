I'm not sure if you've considered the pros vs cons of this relationship but maybe you should? You don't trust/believe/validate a disorder that they feel like they have, and they in turn appear to be reacting unkindly to your distress and disorder    IDK, they sound pretty distant... I was always bummed out when my parter didn't react with the type of sympathy I hoped when I struggled with throwing up due to anxiety, and they also didn't really act sympathetically when I would drink to the point of being sick. He was suffering with anxiety himself and also witnessed a lot of alcoholism so there were understandable reasons he didn't provide support, but it still hurt me. ",False,False

I had confided in them earlier that day I had purged and was scared I was going to go back to doing it all the time. They said my ed is due to a lack of self-control Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯ ",False,True

I get that eating disorders can be a bit difficult for some to understand, but how on earth would someone think that's an appropriate thing to say? This gives me such fear of telling any romantic partner of my ED, just imagining opening up and then hearing unhelpful comments that might add to the feeling of shame or not being understood... I know it might have taken you a lot of strength to open up to them, that's definitely something that deserves respect OP. I hope that you have some other form of support for the ED whether that's maybe a therapist, a good friend, or this forum.",False,False

If you only started purging the other day after years of not doing it, anyone could get the impression of things being okay and in the past, especially if you didn't tell them that you purged again recently.  Your partners probably just thought that you were feeling sick from food poisonining and the food was starting to come up on its own, at least that's what I got from the description of what you told your partner. Advicing someone to throw up in that situation isn't a sick or ignorant thing to do: if the body is automatically rejecting something you put into it because the food was infected or you have a stomach bug, it's a wise thing to let it come out. It just saves you from discomfort and suffering that would result from trying to keep the food in.  Purposefully purging for weight management is absolutely not the same thing, but there's a good chance your partner mistook the urge to purposefully purge for food poisoning or a stomach bug.

You deserve someone who cares and wants to help. The fact that they didnâ€™t even look at you and TOLD YOU TO PURGE infuriates me. ðŸ¤¬,False,False
