And it was made worse because I was supposed to take it with food, but I just couldn't make myself eat. The thought of eating was repulsive. I couldn't even be in the kitchen. The lack of appetite persisted even after the nausea subsided. I dropped 15lb in a month.  And then, like a light switch, suddenly it came back. I wouldn't say I was hungry; I really think my body is so messed up from a decade of ED that I don't feel physiological hunger anymore, but I wanted food. I wanted all food. And that was normal. And that juxtaposition really drove home to me how fucked up my relationship with food is, even when I nominally am making myself eat normal amounts. I had *never* experienced a genuine lack of appetite before. When I was a kid and I had the flu, the actual influenza flu, or when I had mono in high school, two rough illnesses firmyl associated with a lack of appetite, all I thought about was ""oh boy now my mom is gonna let me eat as much ramen as I want, I'm gonna eat all the ramen."" I always want food. And i always have always wanted food. And that's... fucked up.",False,False

(but even though I'm complaining now, my weight was so chill and stable the whole time no matter how disordered I was/wasn't being it, and did take like 6-7 years to develop a noticeable tolerance to that side effect. so don't worry about losing the freedom from appetite anytime soon!)",False,False

Like I could eat, or I could not. I feel nothing either way. And I truly mean that: I feel NOTHING lol. My hunger cues are completely gone, god bless. However, my ‚Äúfull‚Äù cues are now as well.

This past week I ‚Äúbinged‚Äù for a week straight basically (I have it in quotations because it wasn‚Äôt like crazy, I didn‚Äôt have 2000 or 3000 calories or anything, but I definitely had 1000-1500 every single day for 5 or so days in a row and my ‚Äúhigh‚Äù limit is 700...so every day for a week I had over twice as much as I would eat on a high day, and every other day I eat low at 350, so it was a BIG leap from that routine, and I‚Äôd call that a binge for me 100%), and it wasn‚Äôt because I was still hungry after eating, or even because I wasn‚Äôt full, it was because I wasn‚Äôt...anything. Like if I don‚Äôt mentally stop myself, I can eat and eat and eat. But on the other hand, if I am not in the mood to eat, but I don‚Äôt make myself, I can starve and starve and starve for days lol.
