Not cute little cookies. Big ones. Those used to be my favorite cookie. I came home one night late from practice and she had already gone to bed and I ate almost all of them in less than 30 minutes. Animalistic cramming as many in my mouth as possible. I ate so many I accidentally made myself sick and then afterwards went back to eat the other half of the cookies. I don't know what was wrong with me, I'd never binged that bad before. Long story short I had to clean up macadamia vomit twice, and buy the ingredients and rebake all of the cookies for my mom early the next morning. I can't even smell macadamia anymore without gagging. Eugh.",False,False
