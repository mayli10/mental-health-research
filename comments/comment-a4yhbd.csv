ebj6nbi,t3_a4yhbd,t3_a4yhbd,cumhacumha,1,2018-12-10 18:54:16,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/a4yhbd/why_do_so_many_of_us_love_bakingbaking_and/ebj6nbi/,I associate food with comfort and escape from my problems. When I was a binge eating little kid I was obsessed with reading restaurant reviews in magazines and reading cookbooks and looking at the pictures. I'm strange now in that I love looking at food videos and pictures and reading about food but I never cook. I'm scared to make cooking a hobby because I'm afraid I'll end up binging on all the food. So when I'm consuming media about food instead of making it myself it's like a less dangerous way of indulging my food obsession/addiction.,False,False

I love creating, and cooking/baking is a situation where I don't have to put like, intense fancy thought into it in the same way that some other creative things I like doing (poetry and songwriting). And watching baking/cooking shows also gives me a way to positively connect with food without having a goddamn panic attack over it- I love food or at least the idea of food, I'm just terrified of the calories associated with it making their way into my body. And when I make food things, I can give them to others and make them feel good with it in a way that doesn't really happen with me (other than the ""I'm super low restricting and this stale bread I just took a bite of is literally the best thing I have ever tasted"" type happyish excitement thing).",False,False
