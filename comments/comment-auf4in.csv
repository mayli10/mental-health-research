I didnt notice myself, but could del it in my clothes and othersâ€™ comments etc. I buy lots of hyperpalatable food such as ice cream, chocolate and healthy fats such as nuts and cashew butter in an attempt to keep my weight up. I also feel really guilty when eating what I have deemed â€˜too muchâ€™, but if I didnt I believe I would be headed for full blown relapse. Dont really know what to do about the guilt but just wanted to tell you that I relate and it is a weird position to be in, feeling in control and doing whatâ€™s best for your body, whilst knowing how easily you could restrict",False,False

I had a broken rib right on my heart and that area is always painful in some ways. But when I don't eat, it seems that I'm weirdly conscious about this rib and I have more troubles sitting/standing in a way that doesn't inflict more pain.   Eating enough for your body to function normally should be your goal. You are right to allow yourself more food when you feel that you need it. It's intuitive eating and usually doesn't result in binges.   Stay safe ðŸ˜™",False,False
