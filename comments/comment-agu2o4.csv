She's fully recovered from 10 years of anorexia from a BMI of 13 to wherever her setpoint is. She did it by herself, no hospitalization or inpatient treatment and she always talks about how she's really grateful she did it that way, since she doesn't trust most ""professionals"" to help with true, life long remission. Tons of posts about that, and followers' shared treatment horror stories. Maybe you could relate to any of them? Anyway she's very, very encouraging and level-headed, and idk I just really trust her like I've never been able to trust a doctor or a therapist.  Another resource I found was the youreatopia website, which I think now redirects to edinstitute.org or something like that. I'll find the link for you in a hot minute! Lots of posts about the science, biology, physics, physiology, etc behind restriction/purging/bingeing/all other behaviors. Helped me realize I'm not crazy, it's genetics and biology.   I also like Life with Lydia on Youtube, she's recovered from bulimia and helps coach people to recovery now, but she posts a lot of free stuff too that's soothing.   On reddit, there are /fuckeatingdisorders (where I originally found most of these pages, it's a sub directed towards recovery and everyone there is very kind and helpful), and /exproed (which is unfortunately not very active, but still has some good old posts).   I hope this helps at all. ðŸ’—",False,False

I'd be very grateful for the resources. I'm already terrified that every relapse is going to worsen my ED. I don't want to live like this but I can't get out. ,False,True

Somehow, they didn't give you the help you needed to sustain a lifelong remission. That's not your fault, please don't blame yourself.   Would you like to see some resources that have helped me? I'm not recovered, not even close, but I'm doing a little better. Let me know what you think, and I'm always available to talk if you need.",False,False
