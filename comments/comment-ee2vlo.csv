I suggest this because we did this in inpatient therapy and it was shocking how our perceptions of ourselves (not numbers) changed.,False,False

It was really hard to tell what my body looked like since I thought my shoulders and torso were as broad as a 6'0 tall man.  But now it seems that I've gotten past that.",False,False

Because like my BMI is overweight but my clothing size/ measurements are pretty average (like way bigger than I wanna be but like if someone else told me that's what they wore that would be my perception) so I think I objectively have a pretty average/ kinda thin body type? My hips/ thighs/butt is bigger and pretty muscular which I think is where the extra weight is and I think I don't actually look as big as I am to other people. And sometimes I look in the mirror and I think that I don't look that big but then ed lizard brain gets in there and is like ""actually everyone thinks you look huge, look at you walking around thinking you might look okay and kind of thin"".  So even though objectively I'm pretty sure I'm not actually fat to most people I can't be sure and obviously I don't trust anyone I know irl to be honest with me   Oops sorry for the novel but ur comment really spoke to me lol",False,True

In my experience playing these games with people doesn't foster a healthy mindset, at least not for me.  I have the same issue as OP re: having no concept of my actual size. I asked my mom to guess what she thinks I weigh. She's been in nursing her entire adult life, so I figured she might be better than the average person at estimating weights. Thought it might provide helpful insight. Lol nope.  She guessed 105 when I'm bouncing between 115 and 120. So on one hand, her opinion is now invalidated to me because she was so far off, but on the other hand UGHHHH to actually be that small??? What a dream.",False,False
