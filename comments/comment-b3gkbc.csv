My lunches and dinners usually consist of a bowl of all those veggies cooked down in water, garlic, and a tiny bit of oil, a chicken leg without skin, and 3 nuts to replace the fat I would have gotten from the chicken skin (trading saturated fat for unsaturated fat). There's sometimes variation with the protein, like replacing it with fish or the occasional red meat, but the veggies are very, consistent. When I'm out of those though, I'll have raw veggies like broccoli slaw, cabbage, or cucumber, which is suppperrrr low Cal. I don't even feel like I'm restricting because of all the veggies I eat at lunch and dinner.",False,False

Tomatoes are that bitch for sure. I used to not like onions or mushrooms as a kid and now they are faves. I'm coming around to cauliflower and broccoli and green beans and corn. Not a huge carrot, squash, radish, zucchini, eggplant, brussel sprouts or pea fan. Used to love bell peppers but now kinda eh about them mainly for the prep work aspect. Cucumbers are decent. Do potatoes count lol cause I do love small red potatoes roasted oh fuck yeah. I don't really fuck with leafy greens tbh because they're only good with dressings to me and dressings are not usually worth the calories. Would rather just have salad without the lettuce. Oh and who could forget the all star avocado?",False,False
