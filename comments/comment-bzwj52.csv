I have never been so good at starving until then. He’d comment on my legs and cheeks (two parts I gain from) and how sweet they are, all puffy.... ugh.

There were lots of red flags about him, but I never realized how awful they were until we broke up. I was 16, coming from a not-so-great mental state in life, and he was older. We were distance for most of our relationship, and after we separated, I found out he was seeing other people for one of the two years we were together. Turns out the only reason he kept me around was because he liked my body—I would always change myself to be what he wanted, and eventually developed an unhealthy relationship with food and myself.   It’s been five years since we broke up, but I hate how parts of that relationship are still with me. I currently have the sweetest, most supportive, and loving and boyfriend, but he hates to see me be so hard on myself. I keep telling myself I have a healthy relationship with food &amp; my body now, but deep down I know that’s far from the truth. I keep having this fear that if I ever grow out of a double zero, I’ll be worthless and unloveable. After all, it was the only reason my ex stayed with me.",False,False

Him dating me was a favor in his mind- and he never let me forget it. He had a friend who was a stripper and he would always wave her in my face, ""the only reason she makes good money is because she's underweight. Look how much money she made last night. They put girls like you on the day shift, or just try not to hire you at all."" He used to cheat on me with skinny girls and tell me it was because he couldn't control himself, after being with someone like me. I just couldn't satisfy him, at my weight!  So yeah that had me fucked up for years. I'm really trying not to think this way, but his voice is always in the back of my head- reminding me that the only reason my current partner doesn't say that shit is because he's too polite.",False,False

It’s always made me feel heavily offended and afraid that they wouldn’t like me if I gained weight, which hurts me deeply and keeps me in this cycle of falling back to restriction.
