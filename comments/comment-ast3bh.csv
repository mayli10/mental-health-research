Upon seeing a very slim singer on TV, I remarked that that was my dream body, and he was absolutely baffled. He genuinely seems to love my jiggly bits and the more ""generous"" parts of my body, not in a ""aw well I love your body because I love you"" way, but as in is actively aroused by it. Which is good and flattering and all, but I can't help but be suspicious! How!? ",False,False

I’m at 147 now and he likes my body even more now, but I don’t really believe him when he calls me skinny because I still look big and he thought I was sexy even when I was over 200 pounds  :( doesn’t help that I saw my ex recently and he told me I looked fat.
