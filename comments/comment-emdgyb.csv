None of your families problems is your fault. You are a minor. Any responsibility for anything going wrong lies squarely on your parents shoulders. You eating in a healthy manner is their responsibility as far as the law is concerned as well. I truly believe Your family is trying to do what they feel is best for you. Which is keep you at a healthy weight. Maybe to feel less full they could switch out say 100 calorie salad with a tablespoon of pb? Wont make you feel as full.,False,False
