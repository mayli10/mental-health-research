I got my ED from my mom (poor woman) and I have three sisters so we all had something wrong with our food habits. Now as an adult (in my 30s) I notice people's food habits even when I try not to. I am so beyond judging anyone for them (I have done/been worse) but I'm like oh I'm restricting I should hang out with my drunkorexic friends or so-and-so won't mind me essentially binging in front her. Idk having disordered eating habits I think happens to a lot of aging women so I think it's more accepted to be on weird diets/not eat/etc. Plus people are just way less likely to say anything about your eating habits the older you get. Unless you work in an office with fat old women and then it seems to be anything goes!,False,False

I have a close friend in college now who also suffers orthorexia. We would always skip meals in school together and talk about our low carb diet as well as our cheat days and stuff. I asked her if she somehow have an eating disorder and she admitted being afraid and stressed to eat some carbs isnt normal. ,False,False
