ecwnqps,t3_aayw6x,t3_aayw6x,TacoinaToaster,1,2018-12-30 17:31:28,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/aayw6x/i_want_my_scales_back_also_my_weigh_ins_at_the_ed/ecwnqps/,"A lot of healthcare providers in the UK are private companies that the NHS outsources to. The NHS gives them targets, and meeting them can decide whether their contract is renewed etc. Also, getting a lot of patients through the process quickly means they make more money, as they'd be paid a mix of per-appointment and per-patient. Probably weighted more towards per-patient in your case, given this weird weighing procedure.  Our dentist was another example of this.  Took five (5) ! appointments to get my brother measured and fitted with braces, which probably means they were mainly compensated per appointment. ",False,False

Because those are exactly the tricks that anorexics use to weigh more on the scale when they want to allow about their weight and get out faster or be underweight without being noticed.  ,False,False

I mean, the fluctuations are going to be massive. They weighed me late in the day once. I was on medication they gave that caused water retention, they'd just asked me to chug as much water in their waiting room as possible and after giving me the 'yay! 500g gain!' well done speech they called me later to say 'yeah no that was a false reading' lmao.",False,True

Where I go they weigh you in hospital gowns before breakfast, and if you use the bathroom within an hour of being weighed you have to get re-weighed.",False,False
