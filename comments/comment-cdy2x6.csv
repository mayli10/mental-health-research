exirj83,t3_cdy2x6,t1_ex7nx37,kashmirkiikali,1,2019-08-20 15:49:05,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/cdy2x6/anyone_else_w_gastroparesis/exirj83/,"To my knowledge I was not born with an abnormal stomach but I did have horrific stomach spasms for most of my life. It wasn’t diagnosed until recently unfortunately so I had no help.  The issues with my stomach really started from a botched vertical sleeve gastrectomy. It was supposed to be a duodenal switch but apparently they couldn’t cut through my scar tissue from previous surgeries and crushed my lungs twice somehow. From then I was vomiting 40 to 70 times a day every day for two years, no matter what I ate or drank.   They diagnosed that 70% of my esophagus became paralyzed from that and obviously my stomach wasn’t working properly so they went in and did a gastric bypass to try to counteract it (uncontrollable and excessive reflux that led to the subsequent paralysis).Now only 5% of my stomach is functional and most days it’s not.   Technically my diagnosis of having an eating disorder is uncertain. I developed rumination syndrome but it was not a result of prior bulimic activity (it falls within both motility disorders and eating disorders). So what happens to me is that when I’m stressed especially I vomit uncontrollably. There’s no nausea associated with it. But I’ve psychologically also started to associate that involuntary purging with a sense of stress relief so it is pretty much now an eating disorder. There’s nothing they can do for it except to try to teach special breathing techniques that are supposed to inflate your diaphragm enough to force the food to stay down. But half the time I don’t want to stay down anyway because it feels better not to have it inside.  so now they have to implant a J tube into my intestines because my stomach anatomy is to mangled to even handle a feeding tube through that (g tube,  I was actually being rolled back into surgery when they decided it was too risky to perform that procedure so it really sucked).  So basically, one bad surgeon ended up causing me to develop paralysis and an eating disorder. If you’re having issues you definitely should get checked out because there could be something progressive going on there and maybe if they had caught some of my issues sooner I wouldn’t be experiencing what I do now, and unfortunately it’s permanent.",False,False

I forget the rest of the tests but they’re esophageal etc.plus they physically removed all of the 5% of my stomach. How long have you been working with your G.I.? It took me two years to finally get to the point where they agreed that they want to put a feeding tube in me when I told them from the first day I knew it was going to happen. But by that point I was already vomiting 40to upwards of 70+ times a day and I’m still vomiting 30 times a day now.",False,False
