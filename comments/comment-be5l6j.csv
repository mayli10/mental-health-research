It's strange, and even now I'm not entirely sure what I look like, I feel like changes in every mirror or picture",False,False

I look back at old pictures of me when I thought I was fat 6 months ago and my face looked so terrible gaunt. Recovery is really really hard...

I wonder what it would be like now, would I appreciate it? I have no idea. I‚Äôm hoping I can keep my head above water. I know I‚Äôll have to delete the pictures eventually in order to do that.

Oh gosh...I lied about how cold I was, how little energy I had, it was miserable. And then I still looked at my body as a ‚Äúwork in progress,‚Äù there was no end in sight.   Weight restoration...some days I‚Äôm like, okay, not bad, I don‚Äôt look too terrible. And then I realize that the top of my thighs touch, my back is less bruised, and my face doesn‚Äôt have that gaunt, dollish quality, and it‚Äôs like ‚Äúwelp, guess I‚Äôm a fat fuck after all.‚Äù  Remember how much stuff doesn‚Äôt such.   Repeat after me:  Feeling my toes is nice  Being cold sucks  Feeling my legs is nice   Having my legs go numb from sitting too long because my ass is bony and constipation because of a crap diet is not a good combo. (The amount of times my legs went numb when I was just trying to poop...)  Being mentally present has some perks   Feel free to add any other perks :p",False,True

I remember looking back on my old pictures and just thinking ""what the fuck"".
