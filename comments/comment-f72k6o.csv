She also carries her food into the bedroom one piece at a time to eat it alone. And she's a kelpie/collie mix who is obsessed with fetch to the point of compulsion - much more play-motivated than food-motivated, will exercise herself into the ground if given the chance. It's like looking in a mirror tbh",False,False

She probably picked it up from me too. She will ignore her full bowl of food all day and legit be hangry. Then when I eat my meal at night, she wolfs all her food down at once and passes out. She must be copying my restricting/bingeing cycles and itâ€™s so weird.",False,False

I donâ€™t know anyone who likes birds irl so itâ€™s so hard to explain to them how much I rely on my bird to keep me alive basically. Just thinking about how confused heâ€™d be if I never came home to him and I know he wouldnâ€™t have anyone to take care of him if I was gone :(   Birds are really special and Iâ€™m so happy you have a lil buddy keeping you going! Conures are such sweethearts ðŸ¥°,False,False

I relate; I always tell myself my bird wonâ€™t understand if something happened and I never came home.  Weird how a bird is the one thing that gets me to take care of myself haha,False,False
