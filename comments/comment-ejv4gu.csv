That sounds like you’re holding onto disordered behavior. If you want to recover, you have to be ready to give up your disordered behavior.   That said, there are many non-disordered reasons to go vegan (animal welfare concerns, environmental concerns). I think you should avoid exploring veganism though until after you’ve been in recovery for some time. Good luck!",False,False
