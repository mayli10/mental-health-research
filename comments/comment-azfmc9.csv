I wasn’t even aware I had an ED (besides a stint of obvious bulimia in college) until I came to this sub. I was in denial. But I’m pretty functional. Look healthy, and close to graduating med school now. To everyone else I just appear to be someone who “watches their weight”. They can’t hear my disordered thoughts.",False,False

Part of my happiness comes from giving up the lie that I’ll ever have a normal relationship with food. I’m physically healthy and that’s enough for me. ,False,False

I’ve had months on end sometimes of being more-or-less okay, but I no longer believe there will ever be a time that I’m not disordered.  ",False,False

Well, I *am* slowly recovering from it..since November. But I'm only focused on recovering from bingeing..and though I don't really have a restrictive eating disorder, some restrictive coping mechanisms have arisen during the years to cope with the bingeing sometimes..and I'm intentionally neglecting treating that part of my BED...The result? I'm at my current LW. It's not that low, but my goal is to lose a couple more BMI points to become just underweight. I want to maintain ~99 pounds forever, and I don't know if I can maintain such a low TDEE without having *some* part of an ED.",False,False

I've tried recovery several times in several different ways, and it just never works. I've kind of accepted that I'll have to live with this until it kills me.",False,False

But it’s hard to get help if you’re at a normalBMI etc. I’m not sure that it will ever go away. I remember my firs weird food/eating behaviors starting around 2002. It’s 2019 and things are still not 100% normal. ,False,False

My ed is my security blanket and it makes me feel more in control of everything around me. I've tried recovery but can't help but fall into old habits. It used to be for me that I want people to notice that I'm skinny but now it's kind of a self rewarding thing if I maintain at this weight or size. Sure I get exhausted easily, but I think my body is functional enough, sans the constant thoughts about food and my body. How do I switch off those thoughts? I'm not sure how.",False,False
