First things first, one fuck up, no matter how big, is going to doom you. You’re feeling scared because we have some psychological bullshit that makes eating a monster and makes eating a lot the fucking devil. But nah, you just ate a lot. There’s a lot of meaning that goes with binging, but bottom line, the action was just eating a lot.  Tomorrow you can eat a normal amount. Whenever I binge, I make the mistake of flipping a shit and then trying to restrict like a mfer the next day. That usually doesn’t work because restricting heavily is hard, and I stress eat and binging stresses me out, so I inevitably fuck it up big time.  I’d say to lax it up if you feel constipated bc that shit sucks. If it makes you feel stable, I’d say go for it. But try to chill yourself out as much as possible. As with a lot of psych disorders, “catastrophizing” is the fucking enemy.  give yourself some you time tonight. paint your nails, shower, take a bath. go to sleep and wake up knowing that tomorrow is a new ass day. The binge from today doesn’t set tomorrow up for failure or success. It’s just another day. One foot in front of the other.  This makes no sense bc i just took hella melatonin but i wanted to reach out! i can sense that you’re really anxious and it suuucks to feel that way so all i really want to get across is that ITS OKAY, the world won’t explode, and i’m here for ya",False,False
