It's also in a sort-of stream of consciousness style? I'm not really sure if it was intentional or just everything bleeding through the pages. I think I've found something really special here.",False,False

I think that ""A Child Called It"" started it off.  Going through shitty life experiences should have at least have some kind of compensation (like top grades, for instance).  I've bookmarked the link and I'll buy a copy on Wednesday (when I get paid).  Good luck with your future writing as well.  Hope someone throws in a movie deal some day!",False,False

I prefer to read books inspired by the writer's real life experiences.  It's always obvious they have a clue what they're talking about.  Not so good your experience is with an ED, but sharing what you wrote about it really has to be cathartic as well as giving non ED people an insight into the glamorous world of BED.  Let us know when your first novel gets published and I'll be first in the queue for a signed copy  x",False,False
