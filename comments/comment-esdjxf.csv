I can do my homework without it but it takes me 2x longer it's so much easier on adderall. I'm SO careful about taking too much since I do take it everyday. I feel like I'm addicted but also I know i'm not abusing it? it's INSANE I hate not knowing if i'm going too far,False,True

I have really bad ADD and adderall really helps me, but I’m scared I’m on the path towards abuse/addiction.
