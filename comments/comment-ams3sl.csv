I think a big part of why I love my Daddy/boyfriend and am able to do this with him is that he accepts my body no matter what. Even when I had to gain weight because I quit purging, he still called and looked at me like I was perfect.  Now, we DO get a thrill out of me being smaller and him being larger, but even when I was at my heaviest and he was at his smallest (so there was only a 35 pound difference going on rather than the 85 pound difference we have rn), we didn't see each other as any less DD/lg. Being little is a lot more of a mindset than it is a physical thing.  However, I want to be small because of my own aesthetic goals :( and idk, I just love being swung around like a rag doll. So maybe that might be where I am at fault, but otherwise, I completely agree with you üíï",False,False

I've got a shit-ton of fetishes and I'm what someone might call on the high-end of ""sexual"" (whatever that means). I'm pretty into caregiver/little play and have been for most of my adult sexuality. If this information helps (and I think it does), I am also submissive from the standpoint of impact play and what some would call humiliation play. This stuff is complex and not simple to examine so I totally understand your comment. But I worry that it sounds like you might have too much wrapped up into your idea of what kind of little you need to be (or im just projecting, sorry LOL). People can have partners that indulge kinks but are also safe partners who look out for psychological well-being.  I am very proudly assertive of my right to engage in kink activities when consenting adults (especially kind and giving ones) choose to engage in them. I find my sexuality liberating and validating. I want others to feel like safe kink is ok, because thats how I want to be treated too.  This said....  I just want to caution you: please stay alert to the expectations you place on yourself and how you let others treat you.  Try not to tie your body type to the idea of how you must be a little.  My body type is tied up in my sexuality. I know I objectify each others and others bodies but I try to keep this to myself and work hard to phrase things safely and try not to make anyone feel like I like them exclusively because of a looks-reason... so I don't want you to feel like I am necessarily pointing to something where your SO (or you) is at fault.  I hope this perspective helps anyone who reads it  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;",False,False

I used food to stuff down my emotions, and as I look back, I recall it starting around the time I was first sexually molested.  I‚Äôm not sure at that time that I consciously began overeating to decrease male attention, but I think it‚Äôs possible.  I was molested again and again, by others, and I know then I was definitely trying to become invisible to men by gaining weight.  I thought I brought it on myself.  I looked older for my age and received attention from older men and was terrified by it.  Later my disordered eating turned to anorexia and orthorexia to try to keep my husband‚Äôs approval and attention as he was highly critical of women‚Äôs weight, I never felt good enough and I loved the feeling of being in control.  Once the marriage ended, I recall the exact moment, I even said it out loud to someone, that I wished I didn‚Äôt get so much male attention and getting harassed at work, and since I was trying to raise my children as a single mother and didn‚Äôt want men around my children.(probably bc of the abuse I suffered and wanting to keep them safe). So the BED just got worse every year, and it certainly did make male attention disappear.  I‚Äôm now invisible and I think it makes me feel more safe.  Thank u so much for this post as it‚Äôs helped me really look back at the time line of how my disordered eating morphed and changed.  Are there many others here that swing between types this way?    I still have no idea how to get this under control.  I swing every few days between high restriction 300cal to huge binges.  It‚Äôs exhausting and everyday I feel like a failure.  I still want to be invisible but I feel like I‚Äôm drowning in a fat suit suffering an invisible disorder that no one knows about, except my psychiatrist that doesn‚Äôt seem to care bc I look ‚Äúnormal ‚Äú.  As messed up as I know it is, if I‚Äôm honest, I want my anorexia and orthorexia back, but I think my fear of male attention keeps me trapped.  I‚Äôm sorry for the book, but your post has really helped me see this more clearly.  Thank u so much.",False,False
