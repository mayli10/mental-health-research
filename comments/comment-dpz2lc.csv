The pumpkin purée is like 40 calories and the yogurt varies but since I like the taste of “light” options I can get away with like 25 calories of it. It’s so filling I literally have to wait to eat next meal and I’m someone that can eat seemingly endless veggies or sweets.",False,False

It thickens it up a ton and makes it feel so, so much more filling.   If I wanna actually like, add stuff to it, I’ll do like a lazy egg drop soup. Do the corn starch broth stuff, toss some veggies in there, maybe some tofu, then scramble an egg (or just an egg white to save additional calories) and pour it in right when it’s finished cooking. Voila. Healthy, tasty, and filling as hell.  And if you add curry powder oo la la that’s good shit   The only downside is yes corn starch has calories. ): but for me, I’d rather have 100 calories and feel super full rather than have 50 and feel alright and end up eating another 100 later.",False,False
