The screwed up thing is there's a blood drive towards the end of this month, and ever since I donated last summer I've wanted to get so underweight that they wouldn't accept me. My friend is going on a trip and will be gone a whole week, and I'm sitting here wondering how much I can lose before I  see him again. I use any excuse to restrict more, but especially something I can mark my calendar for. I just met with a college representative for the next college I want to go to, and I want to be underweight before I attend their open house... ",False,False

Cousins wedding is in two months back in my hometown that I haven't visited for over a decade. So I'll be seeing old classmates that remember me as the dorkiest looking slightly chubby kid from middle school. Time to flip their expectations completely.
