I'd worry more about hypoglycemia. Please remember that it's not a checklist, just because you can die from hypoglycemia does not mean that you will have a seizure from it first. Google anorexia and hypoglycemia.  ""Hypoglycemia can cause headaches, slow thinking, mood changes, seizures, and poor balance (Falck, 2018). Severe hypoglycemia may even lead to death, as it “indicates liver failure and a depletion of substrate to maintain safe blood glucose levels” (Brown &amp; Mehler, 2017).""",False,False
