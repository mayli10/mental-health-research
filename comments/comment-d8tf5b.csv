Obviously i’m not a dietician or an expert, but I really try and do harm reduction stuff already. My main concern here is that i’m gonna have to pay a co pay to hear stuff I already know :(",False,True

There's definitely no safe or healthy eating disorder, but you can take steps to minimize the damage, and learn what things to watch out for (potassium, B12, etc). Good luck!",False,False

I know my dietitians in the past were more like therapists than “dietitians” lol they let me cry about my body image but actually provided good tools for feeling better about my body/the food",False,False
