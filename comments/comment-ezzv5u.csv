He knows about my issues with food and would never say something like that now, but I still use it to trigger myself.",False,False

I mean normal people are already entitled to be a little sensitive about their weight or shape. But you have an ED, that is something a partner should know in order to function as couple.  Anyway he doesn't seem insensitive at all, probably he sees you 100 times more beautiful than his tiny-ass coworker, since he's with you and not her.  In the beginning of my relationship I was very sensitive too, but eventually partner's compliment to your body will help you make peace with it.  Said by a big girl in love with a fluffy boy, who loves fluff... i hate when my boyfriend appreciates my softness, too. It makes me feel weak and lazy and powerless against that stupid fat and the food. But also It reminds me that I'm loved and attractive, and that shit is only in my brain.  So are you girl, loved and attractive to your man. All the rest is bullshit.",False,False
