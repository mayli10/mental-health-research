I don't encourage this if you're doing it to help starve yourself. With that said, what helps me with curbing binge urges it to drink like 2 litres of sparkling water as quickly as possible, it makes me feel extremely bloated and i get the same feeling as i do with a binge but I haven't actually eaten all the calories. Remember to try and balance your electrolytes if you try this.",False,False

Caffeine pills help so does chia seeds in your drink and I've also noticed antacids helping a bit. Hot tea, coffee. Foods that expand in stomach help.
