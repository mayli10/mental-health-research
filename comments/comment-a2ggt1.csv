I feel like this was a hot topic in the homeland too.   Everytime it happens I actually get really excited because it is an important personal topic for me. Because guess what- I have these thoughts! But inevitably a lot of users get upset because things get taken personally and out of context.   But seriously- what do you do when you have intrusive thoughts like this? I use to (and ironically it was more when I was obese and overweight) go to the fat people hate sub and then at voat. When I got down to normal BMI I really started having awful thoughts about other people who were overweight. I think the post in reference had some really good responses and it was a pretty resounding consensus that these thoughts are dehumanizing and not acceptable.   Respones from people who had been there and have been able to overcome or subdue those types of intrusive thoughts...well that sounds like harm reduction to me!,False,False
