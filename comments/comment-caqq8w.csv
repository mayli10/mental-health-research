In the past I used to wander around our neighborhood and collect vegetables. People let their gardens run wild in the summer  and stealing corn and tomatoes in the dead of night helped a little bit. Also buything things with change. Exclusively quarters and nickles and dimes. Reserving that for essentials like pgj and rice, flour.",False,False

Buying in bulk online...Like massive bags of rice, pasta &amp; dried beans. It often looks a heavy outgoing to bulk buy at first but when you realise how long it lasts compared to buying a regular packet of something &amp; using it up in a week, this could last a month or more!  Learn how to bake your own breads, tortillas etc. Once you have all your flours, yeasts &amp; whatever, your base ingredients can last a long time &amp; you then have a large variety of things you can make yourself with a ton of recipes online, which often taste better &amp; most things are freezable so you can store them &amp; nothing goes to waste.   Look for deals on Amazon.   Food banks are always an option if you really need one.   Look for reduced foods at the end of the day at supermarkets/bakeries etc. Ask the staff if they have anything they will be getting rid of or reducing &amp; often I find they will help you out, direct you to any reduced items.   Sometimes butchers have offcuts of less popular meats they will give away for a heavily reduced price or even free!  I'm in the UK &amp; there is a website (approvedfood.com or something) which sells food at or close to the best before date. Note, best before not use by. Often products last a lot longer than the best before date &amp; this can be a cheap way to fill your pantry with stuff you can actually use for a lot less than buying ""normally"" at the supermarket. Maybe Google around for a site like that where you are.  Good luck! Having to be frugal shouldn't mean starving &amp; I wish all the best for you &amp; your family.",False,False
