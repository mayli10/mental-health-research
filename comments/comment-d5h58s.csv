It's done, and I can't take back my actions, but I can plan for the future and maybe meal prep with more full things. It's also helpful to not keep foods that are easy to binge, since the temptation isn't as readily available. I've had problems binging on ice cream, so I've been trying to avoid buying as much.",False,False

I just force myself to understand that the weight I gained from it is all water retention and food weight, and in a couple days I‚Äôll be back to normal in a couple days. I also read that fasting the day after binge isn‚Äôt the best route to take - eat at your ‚Äúnormal‚Äù the day after a binge (so if you usually eat at 500, try to eat at 500 after you binge) so that it‚Äôs less stressful on your body. Then you can fast the next day, because it will be better for you overall and it won‚Äôt impact your overall weight. The restrict-binge-restrict cycle is super bad, so taking a day to recuperate can help!  If you binge because of cravings, try to allot an amount of calories out of your day to a certain craving. For example, if you‚Äôre craving peanut butter, make sure to pay attention to your calories throughout the day so you can end it with a couple tablespoons of PB2 on something.  Make sure to drink a lot of water today! You got this! You‚Äôre not a failure, and you deserve to eat!",False,False

Hot chocolate. The kind I have is only 80cals per two tablespoons, and if you make it with water or low-cal nondairy milk...  It's sweet, it's chocolatey, but most importantly it's a liquid, and you can really only chug so much of it before you don't want any more, and then there's no room for food in your stomach unless you want to to be overfull/nauseated.",False,False
