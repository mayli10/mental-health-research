I have had multiple urges to binge, and I have not yet acted on any of them. There’s even Reese’s eggs in my pantry. I have the urge, recognize it as intrusive, and dismiss it. I typically spend a lot of time and energy trying to distract myself, yell at myself, talk myself out of it, that I honestly now see that the rush of relief when I give in is just in response to the torture I put myself through trying to fight the urge. I’m not trying to fight it anymore. It’s dumb and it is a thought that doesn’t even belong to me. This is easily the calmest that I’ve been in literally years. Thanks for checking in, and I hope this can help you and anyone else who has been fighting this exhausting war, even if it just helps with one battle.",False,True

I actually was looking up intrusive thoughts this week cause I have them sometimes with wanting to hurt myself and I’ve also never made the connection that binging is also an intrusive thought. I mean when I would really binge thousands of calories at a time I would not be able to stop thinking about it til I did it.  I hate that our minds can be our own worst enemies.,False,False

I’m calmer today than I have been in months, maybe years, and even if it only lasts a short while, it’s been a welcomed break.",False,True

When I have urges to binge, I usually try to distract, punish, demean, and eventually experience the rush of relief when I give in. It’s different today. It doesn’t deserve the time or energy. I don’t have OCD but I’ve had anxiety with intrusive thoughts for a long time, and I know that many of us likely have the delightful combination of some other co-morbid mental health issues that keep our ED company. It’s exhausting, isn’t it?",False,True

If I’m driving a car, I have a flash thought of ramming full speed into a wall. It’s disturbing and scary and unsettling. I am able to get rid of it by telling myself that I would never do that, I’m in control of this vehicle, and I am safe. I’m now seeing urges to binge as the same type of destructive thought that has no bearing on reality, and I in no way have to follow through on it. In fact, it’s absurd and not even a thought that deserves another second of my time. So I “dismiss” it by reminding myself that I won’t do that, I’m in control of my choices, and I’m safe.   Now keep in mind that I’ve been applying this for all of 8 hours to my fucked up eating habits, but it’s comforting and it’s helping me. I’m very good at dismissing intrusive thoughts about other situations after years and years of practice, so I feel like this is a familiar tactic. I haven’t found myself obsessing on it more - it falls under the mental category of “ridiculous” and I’m able to move on. Let’s hope it sticks at least for a little while to help me change my habits!",False,True

It’s this weird dynamic of knowing my thoughts aren’t rational but not being able to shut up the stupid voice in my head that keeps whispering these irrational thoughts. But, with effort, I can choose not to act on them and the thoughts get better (less frequent, easier to ignore).  This basically sounds like ERP therapy used for OCD, experience the binge thought but prevent the binge response and, over time, you train your brain to respond differently. Thanks for sharing! I hope your realization helps you ❤️",False,False

I’ve heard from therapists before that I’m the one who is in control of this, it’s my decision, but for some reason, this notion that it can be dismissed like any other intrusive thought has me feeling stronger and more capable than I’ve felt in a good long while.",False,True
