I know my own mother's insecurity about her weight and her body image influenced the way I dressed for a long time, and when I started branching out from it she really reacted with what I recognise now as fear.  On top of that, it's possible that she was just trying to encourage you to get it because she knew you liked the print so much, so maybe she was like, ""If I talk shit on the other shirt, they'll feel better about getting this shirt, which they like better."" That's also a very well-intentioned but badly-executed mom thing to do, lmao.  Basically... Try not to feel badly about it. I know that's an impossible task lol but I'm sure it had nothing to do with how you actually looked and more to do with your mother's subconscious concerns.",False,False

I think it's partially because my mom was a young lady in the 80s, when dress shirts looked [like this](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/29/f3/44/29f34413d8e40de7e61f73ff7716f19b.jpg) (read: super oversized). Maybe your mom is the same way?",False,False

Even when I was taking in a shirt that used to be my father’s and was meant for a 6’5” huge man... lol. Moms tend to like oversized things (and like, so do I, but we have a different definition of oversized) and I know this, but it still hurts my feeling every time lol.  Honestly you prob looked great in it anyway.",False,False

I remember my mom saying something similar to me (suggesting I “size up”) when shopping. I was severely underweight too, it still fucked with my head. I think she might’ve just wanted to make me feel more comfortable, especially since she wanted me to gain, she didn’t want me to have clothes that would eventually be too small. Idk, maybe that’s what your mom was going for? Still seems rude to put it the way she did though",False,False
